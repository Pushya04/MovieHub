This is not a Review.  This is only an Illusion.,"""The Illusionist"" is a unique film that combines two often stale genres into something fresh: the lush romantic period piece and the ""AHA!"" mystery thriller (a genre M. Night Shamalyan has single-handedly run into the ground recently). Helmed by a first time director (Neil Burger), based on a short story, and featuring an eclectic cast, ""The Illusionist"" had the perfect set-up to be a monumental disaster. With a graceful slight-of-hand, it ends up being something very good.As with any run-of-the-mill period piece, there's a lavish attention to the set designs and costumes, here representing late nineteenth century Vienna. Director Burger puts a nice spin on the same-old, same-old with an acute attention to lighting (especially in the dreamily over-exposed flashbacks) and old fashioned camera techniques (witness the circular camera's eye closing to transition from scenes) to give the film the feel of being a fond memory of a classic movie from a bygone era.The central romance where Edward Norton's title character and Jessica Biel's Dutchess are star-crossed lovers kept apart because of class and society, had all the makings of a snore-inducing cheese-athon. Executed in an understated manner that services the greater plot, it ends up being anything but. Norton's performance, especially in the second half of the film when he turns into a man of very few words, had the potential to be one-note. As an actor, he speaks volumes with his eyes. Biel, a former teen idol and TV star, seemed a horrific choice for this role. She pulls of the nifty trick of being quite good. Even better are Rufus Sewell as the tyrannical crown-prince and Paul Giamatti as the chief inspector. Using a short story as the source material, characterizations had the potential to be paper-thin, but these seasoned veterans make the most of their lines and scenes adding terror, humor, and gravitas through their vocal and physical deliveries where lesser actors would've been wooden and cold. The entire cast also worked together very well utilizing their odd, vaguely European and aristorcatic accent. Everyone used it so consistently and earnestly, it didn't seem to matter after awhile that the accent was unnecessary.A more over-eager or pretentious director may have completely sabotaged the fantastic ending to ""The Illusionist"" and cheated the audience. Handled deftly by Burger, the grande finale where ""all is revealed"" is a wholly organic and satisfying conclusion that rewards the patient viewer and fulfills the lofty promises of the themes presented throughout the work.""The Illusionist"" boasts an excellent music score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass that easily rivals his great work done in ""Candyman"" and ""The Hours."" Norton and Giamatti treat us to some of the best ""staring"" since the days of silent films. The look on Giamatti's face and the positioning of his raised eyebrows as he watches Norton perform his illusions coupled with Norton's eyes as he pulls off his tricks are priceless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Norton is mesmerizing,"I am a long time fan of the old theatre magicians and have been fascinated by the wave of spiritualism that swept both continents around the turn of the last century. This movie plays off those real life happenings, with the added twist of court and political intrigue. The movie is lush - as a period piece should be - with terrific performances from a true ensemble cast. Edward Norton has the charismatic gaze that makes you believe in every thing he does. Jennifer Biel is tragic and compelling as a woman trapped by society and dubious duty. Paul Giamatti - who seems to be in every other movie these days - is wonderful as a conflicted man unsure of whom he serves. Rufus Sewell, as the Crown Prince Leopold, is that man, and he embodies the boo-hiss villain. Vain and driven, he is larger than life and not one to cross, as the illusionist comes to find out. The music of Philip Glass fits the scenes and add just the right amount of tension. Plus the horses are very old world with large hooves and a heck of a lot of presence. A compelling and beautiful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Worth the price of tickets,"The Illusionist is a very entertaining movie. The beginning of the movie sets an awesome foundation for the rest of the film to work with, without making the rest of the movie predictable and pointless. Although the basic story of boy gets girl, boy loses girl may not be original, the way the plot is presented with the excellent magical imagery keeps one interested in Edward Norton's character. My only complaint would be that the movie needs a little editing towards the end as the creators seem to show basically the same scene over and over in an attempt to drive home Norton's character's emotional distress. Unfortunately, this gets a little monotonous for viewers. Still, Norton, Sewell, Giamatti (and surprisingly Biel) provide excellent performances that, along with the beautiful cinematography, make a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion.""","And Edward Norton is absolutely right. Nothing in this movie is what it seems. I was floored by the end of this movie. This was a wonderful job by everyone, actors and director. I couldn't believe how it ended, I wanted to stand up and clap at the end because of how beautifully it was done. This movie really grows on you. In the beginning I wasn't really impressed, but by the end I was completely convinced that this was a real work of art. The acting was great. Norton, Biel, and Giamatti all did tremendous jobs in my opinion. This is the best fictional biography I have ever seen. This Eisenheim character seems like a real person and not someone based on a short story. Norton is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors, the guy has more range than I've seen from anyone in a while. He's always playing different characters and he always does a very good job. I think everyone should go and see this movie, it won't let you down.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Brilliant movie, exceptional all around","This movie was stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton was mesmerizing, a superb performance that allowed the story to unfold seemingly at his discretion. Jess Biel was very believable and stunningly beautiful. Paul Giamatti (sp) played an admirable role and took the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. The story was fresh and imaginative, very intriguing. Not as predictable as you would think. We saw this at a Sundance screening and the entire theater of 500+ seats was full and when the movie was over all you could hear was excited and happy chatter, lots of applause as well. Director came out for a Q&A after and was very amiable in answering questions. Highly recommended!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Must see mystery!,"I just saw this wonderful film at the San Francisco Film Festival as a surprise entry. Beautifully shot and realized, it keeps you guessing until the end as to the true outcome. It was throughly entertaining and innovative. This movie has it all: romance, suspense, star crossed lovers and supernatural illusions. Edward Norton is perfectly cast as Eisenheim The Illusionist. His accent flowed seamlessly and he simply disappeared into the role. The real revelation to me was none other than Paul Giamatti. Paul's richly accented role was not altogether unlike Tommy Lee Jones' role in The Fugitive. I found his scenes with Norton full of respect and begrudging admiration. It was an absolute joy to see these two pros at work. I will definitely be paying to see this one again when it's released theatrically.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Terribly uninvolved,"First of all, showing ""magic-tricks"" in a movie is somewhat dead and pointless idea to begin with. At least they should never be the main issue, AT LEAST so that no explanation is given to a (film)viewer despite their often supernatural elements, like especially in this case. (""The Prestige"", though also very flawed film, anyway showed us what was happening behind (and under) the sets too.) But these malfunctions aside, even outside the stage there's not much to say about the plot anyhow, only that it's shallow and predictable.But what really makes this film utterly a failure is terrible handling of its character-development and realization. Yes, there are moments people are obviously trying very hard to show emotions, but none of those moments ring true, none. In a film like this, where all kinds of illusions are the king, all the more important it'd be to have lively and genuine performances and characters. Jessica Biel looks pretty but as an actor she's totally transparent. There's nothing happening inside her. Sadly, same goes for Mr Norton here too. He's in his role of a great magician also outside his act so much that every time he tries to break out from his numbness it's too late and unbelievable. (As a matter of fact, Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of the 90's, has been frighteningly disappointing for the last 5 yrs or so.) Rufus Newell as a Crown Prince, unknown to me and by this performance, remains so. And finally Paul Giamatti. He should only concentrate on comedy, rolling those big eyes just don't do the ""trick"" anymore, especially here as a Chief of Police. He's no hero and is a little bit too weak and small and overweight even for Everyman.The movie was produced by the same guys who did Sideways and Crash, both enormously overrated films too. But character-wise, The Illusionist is actually very fitting continuation. Weak, weak, weak. And director is someone called ""Burger"". Well, for me that name is only half right...",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
One Of The Classiest Films You'll See All Year,"First of all, let me say this was a beautifully-filmed movie, just gorgeous from first to last frame. That gets big points with me. Just as impressive was the story, a fantasy-mystery- romance-drama combination set in Vienna, Austria, around the turn of the 20th century.It is a story that should keep most viewers intrigued all the way and perhaps surprised quite a bit at the end. Edward Norton does his normal job of making you fascinated with whatever character he's playing, this time a magician with almost supernatural powers: ""Herr Eisenheim."" The character he plays, and the tone of the movie in general, is pretty low-key with next to nothing in (on screen) violence or profanity.It's simply a classy film and a modern-day one that older folks would very much enjoy as well as younger adults. Paul Giamatti also is very interesting as the police inspector, torn between his allegiance to the villain crown prince and to the truth and what is the right thing to do. The movie, however, belongs to Norton.In a nutshell: good stuff, classy film. I haven't talked to anybody yet who watched this and didn't like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"A Wonderful, suspenseful, sensual escape from reality","I love movies of all type for different reasons. Action movies to become stimulated physically, comedies to laugh my troubles away, suspense to sit on the edge of my seat. But mostly, I attend movies to escape from a humdrum and dangerous world. ""The Illusionist"" is the ultimate in escape movies. It is gripping from he opening scene and the grip lasts until the final realization. The story is masterfully crafted and the screenplay intriguing. The special effects and illusions are entertainment enough. But all of this surrounded in the backdrop of the story, it's movement from one idea to another is an added treat. First there is the marvelous acting of all the major actors, surrounded by great support. The cinematography and music are awesome. This movie is filled with entertainment, suspense, romance, sensuality tastefully done, treachery and surprises. I have not been so entranced by a movie since the first Banderas Zorro movie. I didn't look at my watch once and the one hour and forty-five minutes flew by in delight. I want to see this movie over and over again. and I will still marvel at its perfection.

If this were a beer it'd be called Prestige Light.,"THE ILLUSIONIST 2006 (EDWARD NORTON, JESSICA BIEL, PAUL GIAMIATTI) DIRECTED BY: NEIL BURGER ~ THE RUNDOWN: A well acted, nicely polished piece of entertainment, but made with little passion and little drama. ~ It's hard to say exactly what this movie's missing; the performances are fun to watch, especially that freaky Rufus Sewell guy, and, as always, Edward Norton is amazing as well as Giamatti; it is entertaining in an old-fashioned, mystery type of way; and it's beautifully shot, but I think that's part of the problem - it's too beautiful...too old-fashioned...too much like a movie that tries too hard to impress us with its image and not engage us enough with its story. To compare it with 2006's The Prestige, a film about the same subject, the Prestige simply crushes the Illusionist when it comes to ""movie magic"", relying very little on CGI and reaching our hearts through an amazing script about humanity...the strive for success, the need to be loved and at the same time showing us how magic really exists in our modern world. The Illusionist, on the other hand, is simply more superficial in nature and would work better as like a thirty-minute TV show. The big twist at the end would be very satisfying for avid TV watchers just after a commercial break, but, seriously, when your making a movie around it you shouldn't just have the viewer sit and wait with little to no hints just to fill up time and then hit them with it and expect a big hooray. ~ Overall, this actually is worth watching because it is indeed entertaining, well acted and interesting, but don't feel bad either if you decide to skip it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Life and death. Space and time. Fate and chance. Theses are the forces of the universe.,"The Illusionist is directed by Neil Burger and Burger adapts the screenplay from ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" written by Steven Millhauser. It stars Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell. Music is by Philip Glass and cinematography by Dick Pope.How splendid, a period romantic mystery that's filled with the mysticism of magical conjurings and political volatility. Plot essentially has Norton as Eisenheim The Illusionist, who later in life runs into Sophie (Biel), his childhood sweetheart, and finds that she's on course to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell). Leopold has a bad reputation and it's not long before Eisenheim comes under Leopold's disdain, forcing Eisenheim to try and pull off the ultimate magic act to save Sophie and himself.Creator Neil Burger crafts a picture that has everything going for it. The story is rock solid with intrigue credentials, where appropriately for a story based around magic tricks nothing is ever as it seems. The period flavours are smartly assembled, the Czech Republic locations smartly standing in for turn of the century Vienna, the art production is on point with the era of setting, as is the costuming. Glass drifts a tender melancholic score over the piece, while Pope's cinematography is simply gorgeous, offering up colour lensing that's aura enhancing, the kind you could get lost in for days.The magic tricks are beguiling, as they should be and are in fact required since the narrative tantalisingly suggests Eisenheim may have supernatural powers? The story itself has no historical worth, but is fascinating none the less. It all builds towards its revelations, and much hinges on if the pay off is worth the admission fee? Most assuredly so it is, even if from a personal point of view this writer wouldn't have minded if pic had finished five minutes before the final revelation.Either way, and with smart acting (Giamatti as the police inspector standing out) without histrionics holding things at the top end, this is delicate film making that engages the emotions fully for entertainment rewards. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A compelling mix of magic and mystery.,"Edward Norton's characterization of the title character provides a great deal of the credibility for this highly romantic mystery film. The illusionist, Eisenheim, is a confident, arrogant man who reserves and guards his emotions for the things he really loves. His self-assuredness does not derive from insecurity or some other psychological weakness, but from his achievement of perfecting his skills to an extremely high level of mastery. He creates magic that baffles the mind and only he fully understands the science behind his illusions.Overall ""The Illusionist"" is very enjoyable. It is also unsatisfying. That is caused by cliques in the plot and in the behavior of the characters. It is sometimes all too clear what will happen, and the characters sometimes do things that contradict their otherwise insightful personalities.""The Illusionist"" is a good looking film, with good performances and smooth direction. The magic is especially enjoyable, and the mystery, though not imponderable, is enticing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Simply a wonderful film!  Absolutely stunning Cinemaptography!,"I loved this movie. It's just that simple. I've seen it several times and the charm never wears off. Yes, it ultimately is a 'feel good movie', but is that so wrong? It keeps you mesmerized until the very last scene. This film is destined to be a classic.As I read some of the other comments about this movie on IMDb, I realize that cynicism can easily get in the way of just enjoying a movie for what it is. This is a magnificent film! Edward Norton and Paul Giametti are terrific and so is the rest of the cast. The cinematography was stunning. The script was superb. The direction was outstanding. I really can't say anything bad about this film. I thoroughly recommend this movie! I could give it no less than a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Captivating story with a touch of magic,"This is a film about love and magic. The thing is the magic that is performed in this movie makes it seem like it's real magic and doesn't really give the benefit of the doubt for the audiences in the movie that watches the magician at work. Although most people don't believe in magic in real life and in this film, so they try their best in this story to doubt it as much as possible. When I first saw pictures of this film in a magazine hyping this film up, it worked for me I really liked the premise of it all which involves a magician. And especially because it has Edward Norton in it, who is one of my favorite actors. And for the most part it meet my expectations. This film is magnificent and mesmerizing at times, with a good amount of mystery behind it while it's played off very well. 2006 was really a good year for movies about magic, cause another magnificent film ""The Prestige"" which was a real thrill ride. Ed Norton is magical and mysterious in a good way and Paul Giamatti put on a excellent performance playing the Chief Inspector. This film sort of feels like it moved along a bit slowly but it's still a captivating film with lovely story with a touch of magic.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Like the Moody Blues song asks--""real or just an illusion?""","Kind of a strange movie but very original and entertaining! It was a Gothic-romance period-piece drama-mystery, and quirky characters and a bizarre--or at least unusual--plot held my interest.Edward Norton's character plays an inscrutable but romantic master illusionist. But is he just a master illusionist or has he developed powers to effect the creepy conjuring of those who have passed on? (Regardless, the guy is so easy on the eyes.)Jessica Biel is beautiful and good in her role but I couldn't help thinking, ""Hey, Jessica, Scarlett Johanssen called. She wants her lips back.""Paul Giamatti bothered me just a tad at first because he spoke in a near-whisper and had a scruffy beard so you couldn't read his lips. He got louder and his character developed pretty darned well, thank goodness. Actually, he was fantastic (so what else is new?).The makers of this movie did the same thing the makers of Little Miss Sunshine did--made me want to see the film twice, but for different reasons: LMS because the first time I saw it, I laughed so hard I cried, and I really needed a laugh again (and got it); The Illusionist because I was like the audience for the title character's shows the first time I saw it--just kind of naive and awed and staring up at the action with my mouth hanging open. So I'll have to see it again and pay attention. Kind of like when my daughter told me to go see The Sixth Sense again and pay attention to what Bruce Willis's character was wearing. (Plot-wise, this is unrelated, folks--just a movie watcher's analogy.)At first, the old-fashioned circle wipes seemed a little distracting, but in retrospect, they were part of the excellent movie-making decisions that created the illusion of time and place in this film. A really good story with really good art direction and really good actors, costumes and settings. Definitely worth a go-see--or two!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

This movie is ridiculous,"Eisenheim is a consummate professional. He leaves nothing to chance in his tricks. They are well-thought out and cannot be figured out. That's why his plan to save Sophie is so ridiculous. What if the Crown Prince doesn't follow her out to the barn? What if the Crown Prince kills her in the main house? What if the drug that Sophie gives him works too soon and he collapses in front of the guard outside the barn? You mean to tell me that a drug is so precise that they know he will pass out as soon as he gets in the barn, assuming he even follows her? What if the Crown Prince doesn't kill himself in the end? In all instances, the illusion would come to a quick end. Does this sound like a plan that a genius like Eisenheim would come up with? A script that builds a plan based on several unlikely events happening is a bad script. Plain and simple. You people are suffering from The Halo Effect. Just because Norton is a great actor and the cinematography is good, doesn't mean that the underlying story is good. And from a structural standpoint, this script repeats itself every ten minutes in Act 2. I was bored during the movie, and when the great 'reveal' was made, I was just disgusted that the writer/director assumed that so many people would suspend their common sense. However, he was right.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
nice looking but hollow,"The Illusionist is a good looking film set in Vienna in the nineteenth century. There's plenty of romanticism, empiricism, and mysticism to ponder over as you try to keep awake with the plot about a magician, no an illusionist, who's trapped by his class, born the son of a carpenter, and can't have the woman he really loves, a duchess, who's equally trapped in her royal status. Not to sell the film short, the story includes a career police officer who's pushed and pulled by a cruel crown prince who promises to make him mayor of Vienna in exchange for his complicity. Their relationship is the film's most interestingly done facet, especially as the police officer noses around into a murder that brings him closer to Mr. Crown Prince. The film's best scene is when the Crown Prince is hunting on his estate and fires off his shotgun, bringing to an abrupt end the talk he was having with the police officer. In the end, it's a meticulous recreation of a time, which isn't nearly matched by a meticulous presentation of a story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Awesome and handsome  film set in early 1900's Vienna about a magician , his lover and a nasty prince","Imaginative and intriguing flick set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, where takes place a crash of wits between a famous magician , a price and and a Police Inspector . This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among an ambitious , easy-going magician named Eisenheim (Edward Norton who did many of his own magic tricks, with the coaching of James Freedman) who becomes a prestigious illusionist and get mutual envy , a Police chief (Paul Giamatti) and the heir prince (Rufus Sewel) ; being set in turn-of-the last century , Vienna (although the film is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic) . Their escalating cat and mouse feud is played out in palaces , theaters and Vienna streets . Eisenheim (his character is closely based on the magician and supposed clairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen, who was famous in Vienna in the early part of the 20th century and was murdered by Nazi soldiers in 1933) delivers the most spectacular version of a teleportation trick that calls for something like real magic . The stage illusionist falls in love with a woman well above his social standing . He will use his abilities to secure the love of a gorgeous girl (Jessica Biel replaced Liv Tyler, who dropped out of the film just as filming was about to begin) far above his social standing as the magician use his powers to combat his enemies . The Duchess Von Teschen is soon to be wed to the Crown Prince Leopold in what would be for him a marriage solely in pursuit of power : overthrowing his father, the Emperor Leopold , as well as overtaking the Hungarian side of the empire .This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres : the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era , mystery thriller and fantasy . The picture gets it all : suspense , mystery drama , star crossed lovers , plot twists , murders ,tragedy , exquisite costumes and supernatural illusions . It inhabits a world between reality and illusion as when Inspector's investigation develops , it's amazingly unclear whether the illusionist is the performer of unbelievably excellent tricks or genuine supernatural acts . Explicitly modelled on the pattern of a magic trick , it's also bound by the rules of the mystery thriller genre . And in devoting so much room to romantic subplot , the picture ends up breaking the magician's cardinal rules . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Edward Norton , Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti as well as eclectic secondaries , Rufus Sewel , Jake Wood and Eddie Marsan .Although the story is fictional, some of the details are based on the life of Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf, only son of Emperor Franz Josef. The painting of the emperor which Eisenheim creates is an actual portrait of Franz Josef ; the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, the Baroness Mary Vetsera, were found at his hunting lodge Mayerling on January 30, 1889 in what is now known as the ""Mayerling Incident"". This was initially covered up by the Imperial Family, creating controversy and mystery. Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Dick Pope ; too marvelously photographed in a red sepia palette flashed with colorful images . Intriguing as well as evocative musical score by Philip Glass . The motion picture was perfectly directed by innovator director Neal Burger , a filmmaker who has filmed notorious movies such as ¨The lucky ones¨ , ¨Interview with the assassin¨ and his most successful , ¨Limitless¨ . At the same time was made another film (2006) with similar theme about magicians titled ¨The prestige¨ (2006) by Christopher Nolan with Hugh Jackman , Christian Bale and Michael Caine . 'The illusionist' results to be a magnificent picture which achieved much success . Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting , and no as predictable as you would think . The film turns out to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Nothing is what it seems...imperfect but interesting...,"THE ILLUSIONIST is a satisfying magic show, but not quite up to the standards I expected. One factor that was especially disappointing: any discerning viewer could easily see what the final plot twist would be long before the secret is revealed. Still, it has a certain fascination for any fan of mystery, suspense, Gothic detective stories or any sort of story involving these ingredients.EDWARD NORTON is Eisenheim, the magician who fascinates audiences with his clever sleight of hand and amazing tricks that seem to indicate he can bring to life dead spirits.PAUL GIAMATTI is effective as Inspector Uhl who doggedly determines to find out just what's going on behind the illusions, as much to placate his own need to know as it is to satisfy Crown Prince Leopold (RUFUS SEWELL) who has an agenda of his own for wanting the illusionist thrown into prison. It seems that his fiancé (JESSICA BIEL) has been a childhood sweetheart of the magician.Rufus Sewell gives the film's strongest performance as Crown Prince Leopold, with Norton appearing a bit uneasy in the pivotal role of the man behind the illusions.The film's biggest flaw is the last portion of the story, which has the detective putting the pieces of the puzzle together as a last minute fix for the story's conclusion. It doesn't strike a truthful chord since the plot was much too complicated to be solved by a few bits and pieces of the inspector's memory.Summing up: Interesting, lots of atmosphere, beautifully photographed with an appropriate score by Paul Glass that captures the mood perfectly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Nothing to write home about,"While I found this film watchable, I also found it to be rather flat. It was pleasantly shot, but I think I would have been rather more excited at the conclusion of a Sigmund Freud biopic set in Vienna. The Illusionist was more than a touch maudlin and I couldn't help but feel that Philip Glass' score was a retread of many other scores he has put together in the past.Norton carried the film exactly as I expected: I wasn't surprised and I didn't end up feeling particularly connected. This movie was a predictable romantic period piece with a little bit of cgi thrown-in to spice the paste. Overall I left feeling that this will be one of those films mostly forgotten after a years time.For a movie with so much magical content, it didn't manage to leave any with me to take home or remember.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Like the movies themselves, all smoke and mirrors...","Movies are like buses. You wait for ages and then two come along at once. Take, for example, DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon (cobbled together these two would have made a decent movie, which separately, neither of them did), or ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES and Bergin's ROBIN HOOD. Strangely, or perhaps magically, it's the same with movies about late 19th century magicians. In September/October 2006, within ten days of each other, we had THE ILLUSIONIST and THE PRESTIGE, both tales of rivalry, revenge and the quest to discover the secrets behind the magic.Childhood sweethearts Eisenheim and Sophie, peasant's son and aristocrat respectively, are forbidden to meet because of the class difference between them. Eisenhiem travels the world and returns to Vienna a world renowned stage magician. Sophie by this time is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold is fascinated by Eisenheim's 'tricks' and orders a private performance so that he might demonstrate his cleverness to his peers by exposing Eisenheim. The magician however turns the tables during this 'demonstration', and, having been made a fool of in front of his colleagues, and especially Sophie, Leopold enlists Inspector Uhl to discover the secrets behind Eisenheim's magic and/or shut him down. Tragedy eventually and inevitably strikes and Eisenheim turns his skills toward the thwarting of Leopold's political plans and his complete downfall.The film is beautifully shot and the period is captured superbly. There were a few slow passages but the ensemble cast work well together, particularly Sewell and Giamatti. Norton does have moments of looking spaced out rather than enigmatic, but the ending was totally satisfying and, to me at any rate, completely unanticipated, which makes a pleasant change.A superior film in my view to THE PRESTIGE, which veered into Mary Shelley/science fiction territory, whereas the magic in THE ILLUSIONIST is simply that  illusion. Like the movies themselves, all smoke and mirrors.Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Sadly disappointed,"This film was extraordinarily beautiful in many ways but the story was disappointingly trite in the sense and style of a romantic film. The sound track, costumes, sets, husbandry, lighting and of course the classical style of cinematography and use of close-ups were extraordinary. However, it's a shame that such awesome locations and excellent actors are in a film where the hair department can't make a realistic mustache for the prince. Furthermore the ""magic"" was only an illusion for the fact that it was all computer generated. The orange tree illusion or a similar illusion should have been mystifying on its own merit as it should have respected the time period of this film and not depend entirely and wholly on a special effects department. The creative talent of this film came close but sadly missed the mark. Most certainly this is a one time only kind of film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Best Picture of 2006 to date (Sept),"In the year that brought us one over-sized dreadful picture after another -- trash like Peter Jackson's awful $150 million King Kong and Jerry Bruckheimer's Halloween Squid Mask pirate movie -- along comes this very special and wonderful movie playing without fanfare in just a few theaters.The basic story was engrossing, and was enhanced by Grade A acting by Edward Norton and others, outstanding cinematography, prolonged suspense. As a person not usually taken with magic, the 19th century tricks were astounding; but juxtaposed against a great story of one special and talented man's pursuit of his long ago pre-adolescent love. This movie grabs hold from the first moments and never lets go.Contrary to my opinion was that of the Washington Post, whose critic found the film slow-moving. One more reason that thinking persons of the 21st century prefer the Washington Times.We drove 40 miles to see this movie at Baltimore's Art Deco Senator Theatre, a real movie theater, rather than a once-again visit to the local multiplex.

Make Us Disappear,"Greetings again from the darkness. The trailer and two male leads for this one made it a must see. What we get is an incredibly stylish, cool work of art ... and a decent (not great) film. Director Neil Burger, whom I know nothing about, has obviously studied Hitchcock and some of the great period pieces in Hollywood history. His lighting and shot selection are beautiful.What is missing here is a captivating, suspenseful story line. Really only two half-developed sub-plots exist. The first one is, will the Police Inspector (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti) ""catch"" Eisenheim (a mesmerizing performance by Edward Norton) in the tricks of his illusions? The second, and much less interesting, is the odd love story between the long ago adolescent friends (Norton and Jessica Biel). This second story is borderline preposterous as we are supposed to believe some unbreakable bond occurred between these two at age 14 that even 15 years apart (and maturity and life lessons) could not break.Missing suspense aside, this is a very entertaining film thanks to the style of the film and the joy of watching two of our best working actors - Norton and Giamatti. We actually sense Norton's pain throughout and Giamatti again wreaks eternal resignation to his plight. Also adding to the fun is popcorn evil bad guy, The Crown Prince, played well enough by Jude Law lookalike Rufus Sewell. Luckily, Biel's contribution is limited to big hair, big lips, a big smile and very few lines of dialogue.The spiritualism of this era in Venice is touched upon, but actually very little historical significance is given to the Illusionists of the time, who were worshiped by the masses until they were exposed and then deposed.Definitely worth seeing, but disappointing due to its lack of story breadth and substance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
beautiful and generally good,"It's late 19th century Vienna. Chief Inspector Walter Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is arresting illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Uhl recounts Eisenheim's life story to the Prince. Young poor Eisenheim was in love with high born Duchess Sophie but they were separated by force. He wanders the world learning illusions and returns to find Sophie (Jessica Biel) engaged to arrogant Prince Leopold. The prince dislikes Eisenheim and is also scheming to overthrow his father, King Leopold of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.The film looks beautiful with great looking sets. The acting is generally good. Giamatti is playing a conflicted character. Biel is better than her usual self. Norton is a compelling lead. Sewell is suitably villainy. I like this film although I would like a bit more intensity. There is mostly a brooding tension. Also the final twist is not surprising but it is fitting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Anyway...i enjoyed the costumes, the sets, but generally thought it was not that great...anyone else see this? I also didn't like the way they refreshed us on all the ""tricks"" at the end.

"Enchanting movie, great entertainment","This was absolutely charming. It is rare to see a movie with a completely different plot. So many times you can almost write the content as it is a re-hash of an earlier plot and it all seems vaguely familiar. Not so with ""The Illusionist"" This is one you cannot predict. I went in a party of 5. All 5 of us were truly surprised at how really great the movie was. Pure entertainment. This is one of those rare movies I am willing to see again in the same week. Hollywood should make more movies like this. I was also impressed with the cinematography and the ability to take one back in time to the 19th century.

To compare with Nolan's The Prestige...,"Neil Burger's 'The Illusionist' would immediately fade and its magic would fritter away. The two turn-of-the-century magician tales beg a comparison and indeed they share many similarities like fractured chronology, narration, deceptive illusions, era and music score but they are ultimately two different stories focusing on two wholly different aspects of magic, rivalry between two magicians and a love triangle in the court of Vienna respectively. Although The Prestige also intertwines some romance in its story, the love side of the tapestry firmly belongs in The Illusionist where it fares best. Both films are nothing short of wonderful, The Prestige with a meticulously-composed, brutal pay-off and The Illusionist with a warm centre.In the latter, two young lovers are separated by rank but brought together again fifteen years later on stage as Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is performing magic and requests an audience member to volunteer, which rekindles their illicit romance in a moment of tense chemistry and nostalgic recognition. The problem is Crown Prince Leopold (resident baddie: Rufus Sewell) who plans to wed duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel) and has no desire to lose her to a struggling magician. Through lushly sepia-tinted flashbacks we are given the sweet story of young Sophie and Eisenheim, a ploy which affirms their positions in the protagonist slots and cues the viewers in to root for them. Through tricks and twists Eisenheim engages in an intense battle of wills for his lover, with chief inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) on his tail who scratches his head trying to figure out his next magic act.The Illusionist is a decidedly brighter story with likable characters and clear-cut antagonists, while The Prestige comprised of grey-zoned, selfish lead characters that only momentarily held our sympathy, only to dispel it with their pride, greed and obsessive dedication to the craft. Here the dedication is to love, to Sophie, and the theatrical magic takes a backseat to the love story. It follows then that the setting holds the same bright beauty. The dark 'Prestige' took us to the murky backstreets of London; The Illusionist sweeps across the grand gold-strewn halls of Vienna. The period and costumework are undeniably much better crafted in the latter with a screen that is awash with lyrical colours and luxury, but it may well be that Vienna is simply more of a thankful setting to lose yourself in. There is in this way a tremendous visual sense throughout 'The Illusionist', which Nolan never truly reaches in gloomy, damp The Prestige.For all of its optimistic turns and beautiful outlook, The illusionist does not hold a candle to the majestic Prestige, which towers over the former on a script-level. It is a webby meshwork of magic, an ever-shifting hall of mirrors that kept us guessing throughout, and topped it off with one of the most inventive plot twists in cinematic history. The Illusionist may boast of a clever plot-turn too, but one that is infinitely more conventional and perhaps even predictable to those that pay extra attention. The acting in both films is consistent in the way that the leads are uniformly strong and that Scarlett Johansson is consistently bad in The Prestige. I had never crowned Jessica Biel a particularly capable actress but she performs well in the role of Sophie with a fair European accent. Edward Norton is intense and brooding as the layered Eisenheim with a very European-sounding accent but ultimately he is quite the dullard in the story, which is possibly Giamatti's show as the observing, narrating detective. He may be the only ""grey-zoned"" character in the film, as I first labelled him an antagonist of sorts.Lastly, I have a few serious qualms with the stage 'magic' that took place in The Illusionist; certainly entertaining parlor tricks and astounding magic are performed  but these tricks are not explained in the film, only alluded to by Eisenheim's vague concession: ""Everything you have seen has been an illusion."" This is a cheap and lazy cop-out, because if you never bother to explain the magic acts, then you can basically whip out anything, CGI wonders and supernatural creations. So what? The 'mystery' genre is achieved through teasing the audience, not dishing out magical extravaganzas without hinting as to how they have been performed. Christopher Nolan realised this with the script of 'The Prestige' which he and his brother penned, and as a result the mise-en-scene of the film is its key component, letting the audience in on all the secrets... almost.In conclusion it appears as though The Illusionist and The Prestige are rather different films after all. The former is smaller-scaled, lower-budgeted, sweeter and more forgettable and in all fairness, it is only its fantastic, epic score by Philip Glass that reaffirms its home on the big screen. The Prestige, by contrast, is utterly unforgettable and I am still scratching my head in awe at its meticulously-composed mystery even though I was probably equally entertained while watching the two magician stories.7 out of 10 for The Illusionist. 9 out of 10 for The Prestige",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Masterpiece!,"The Illusionist is a work of art!It has everything, a strong, powerful and engaging storyline. A brilliant cast, amazing acting and more.The story follows Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and The Duchess Sophie Von Teschen (Jessica Biel) who are childhood friends and who fell in love with one another all those many years ago, but due to their differences in social standing they were ripped apart. Now many years later Eisenheim is back this time his a trained magician or Illusionist as he calls himself.The movie has you thinking it's about magic and magicians and illusions but it's not and it is... The movie is ultimately a love story but it's done so well and so perfectly that the two different genres meld together to form this perfect piece of art. In the end you will be left with a sense of awe as well as a happy feeling at the joyful ending for Eisenheim and Sophie...Spoilers Ahead!This is because the entire movie is the illusion. Eisenheim pulls off the ultimate illusion in order to be with the woman he loves. He gives up everything for her and she does the same for him. In order to ensure they won't be chased after, they fake Sophie's death at Crown Prince Leopold's hand and spirit Sophie away instead to a secret cottage. Eisenheim follows afterwards but not before he destroys the crown prince and all his plans for overthrowing the empire.I've started rambling a bit and I apologize, but long story short.

"Good Acting, Good Movie, Definite Watch","Read the Plot Outline and Synopsis first to better understand my review.Ed Norton as the Illusionist and Paul Giamatti playing the Chief Inspector who is torn between his duty to the Crown Prince and of a growing respect towards Ed Norton's character, Eisenheim. This movie contains fine acting by Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti; both show exceptional skill in portraying their roles, with a nod towards Giamatti. I think this is one of the best performances from Giamatti. Rufus Sewell plays his part of the Crown Prince exceptionally well and one cannot leave a theater or watch at home without finding a bit of contempt for his character. Jessica Biel has a good performance, but she does not seem altogether in character for her part.The movie itself has a fine screenplay; it is neither too long nor too short. There are no loose ends as some movies always have. The cinematography is good but not great and the period costumes and background are nice, not overwhelming but very believable.This film is worthy of your attention and will hold it until the end. This movie was released around the same time as the movie The Prestige.

It would have been nice to know what happen to Paul Giamati's character, a good man caught in politics, but maybe that was the point.

Aged well and is still a wonderful little film,"Watched this again back to back with The Prestige. They both came out in 2006 and I remembered liking them both back then. Now when I've seen them both again I must say that The Illusionist aged better. It's a classic made as a classic, while The Prestige breath a little more major studio and therefore has a little more sign of the times woven into it.

"Could be an illusion, but I might as well try ...","When the young magician Eisenheim attempts to run away with his true love, the princess Sophie, the imposing wall of class divisions rises between them, and the star-cross'd lovers are separated. Years later, Eisenheim (Edward Norton) has risen to be the most popular - and mysterious - illusionist in Vienna, and Sophie (Jessica Biel) is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a tyrant-in-training who has designs on his father's throne as Emperor.Leopold grows increasingly uneasy about Eisenheim, whose relationship to Sophie is unknown to the Crown Prince, believing that the magician is committing fraud or claiming to possess supernatural powers. What truly irks the prince, though, is that Eisenheim manages to upstage him at the Prince's own castle with a magical display that enchants his audience of the social elite. And so Leopold orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to investigate the illusionist closely to determine his secrets.Eisenheim performs some truly astounding tricks, including growing an orange tree before the unbelieving eyes of the audience and transporting a handkerchief from a closed box in the audience to the claws of small doves on the stage. But after a truly unfortunate turn of events, his show becomes quite minimalist in scope: The Illusionist merely sits on the stage and conjures - yes, conjures - speaking, reacting ghosts to wow and astound the audience, while Eisenheim mopes about distractedly. What has happened to put him in this state cannot be explained here, unfortunately. But when Eisenheim's performances go a little too far for the Crown Prince's liking, Leopold orders Uhl to arrest the magician.But this is no mere telling of unrequited love followed by the mysteries of a magician. The placid Eisenheim desperately misses his long-lost love, and when he sees her in the company of the overbearing boor Prince Leopold, he uses all of the magic at his disposal to free the beautiful Sophie from the Crown Prince. How this is ultimately accomplished constitutes the great twist in The Illusionist.Norton is simply - to use a pun shamefully - spellbinding as Eisenheim, a man who uses a paucity of words, every motion calculated well in advance, every emotion kept in check, doled out in spring-loaded moments of unbridled passion. Eisenstein, in the capable hands of Norton, is a romantic, a cipher, an unknowable hero. It's a shame the movie was released during a year in which many other wonderful performances evolved on the screen, because Norton - twice nominated for Academy awards - turns in a performance that rivals those of his more-lauded roles.Surprisingly, Biel is pretty good - and, of course, devastatingly sexy - as the aristocrat trapped in a loveless marriage who finally finds someone worth living for and with. Of course, there's not much to be surprised about, since I haven't seen her in much, just Ulee's Gold, when she was a kid, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Still, she's hot, and it's rare that a gorgeous actress can actually show emotional range. It's a real treat, too, to watch Giamatti, who's well cast as the intrepid inspector, a role with more than a passing acquaintance with Claude Rains' Captain Renault of Casablanca, a man not above petty bribery and graft but with his own system of morals.A lush, dark mystery, The Illusionist relies heavily on the splendid performances of its three youthful leads to weave wonderful threads of mystery, romance, and intrigue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A worthwhile surprise,"I did not expect anything particularly grand when I went to see this movie. Nor was I surprised by the relaxed setting to an albeit tense-enough story through the beginning of the film. What surprised me was how good the tale got along the way. I enjoyed particularly how the ""magic"" was not taken out of the magic tricks through explanation and revelation; I liked sitting before a magician who performed as though I was in the audience myself, so that I was shocked and entertained every step of the way. And at the end, which I will not reveal of course, I was particularly pleased with how brilliant the plot became. The wrap-up was marvelous and will, I suspect, only be lost on the ""slower"" movie-goers out there.

Forgettable,"Ed Norton plays Eisenhein,a magician famous for his spectacular shows and mind-blowing tricks. As a young kid he was friends with Sophie, a duchess but they were taken apart and never saw each other again.Eisenhein then traveled the world learning the art of magic. One day he sees Sophie, now engaged to a crown prince, in one of his shows.From that point on the film focus on Eisenhein attempt to free Sophie from the royal house of Vienna so that they can finally be together.The movie is OK, to be honest, it didn't blew me away and I found the story quite predictable, half way trough the movie I had already figured out what was going to happen,obviously I didn't know all the details but I figured out the big twist almost right away.

Charming and entertaining,"Anybody who has read the user comments on ""The Illusionist"", will probably notice that its a love-hate affair. To some it is thoroughly uninspired, boring and predictable - to the others its entertaining, smart and enjoyable.This entirely depends on your state of mind when you start watching ""The Illusionist"": if you willingly place yourself in the position of Eisenheim's audience, letting his hypnotic personality lead you (as well as Norton's exceptional acting), you are sure to enjoy the movie, to the full extent. However if you always look for mistakes, and approach every moment with the disbelief of a critic, ultimately you will spoil the major twists and end up feeling that the movie is nothing special.The Illusionist's best trait is that it isn't too ambitious for its own good. It attempts a love story, mixed with mystery and a sprinkle of the supernatural - and it succeeds in all of these things. Told with a fairy tale like quality, without any political, pseudo-philosophical or other today usual, movie ""baggage"", it aims to entertain in the purest sense of the word.""The Illusionist"" has very few characters, but they are all very well realized. Norton as usual steals the show, given his enormous talent, and effort he puts into each role. Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel surprised me with the quality of their acting, given that my opinion of them wasn't really high. However, they did their roles well, and I will look in on their films in the future.Other notable high points of the movie are: excellent cinematography, fantastic music and a decidedly ""old school"" approach to movie making that pours out of ""The Illusionist"", which would have been nothing special in Hollywood a few decades ago, but today is entirely refreshing (especially the lack of any ""usual baggage"").The verdict?

Lacks magic,"This is a passable period piece, a film set around the turn of the last century in Vienna. Its about the star crossed romance between a Duchess and a poor boy who makes good on the stage as a magician. Its nicely mounted,well directed by Neil Burger and mildly engaging.But it could have been a much better film, if it had undergone a serious rewrite, been better cast and had its feel good, montage ending reedited.The core of the story is the illusionist played blandly by Edward Norton. While glib on stage and good under pressure, he is nonetheless a nondescript magician without any engaging character traits. He is neither a tortured mystic struggling to cope with his powers, nor a skillful conman using his talents to make a killing duping audiences. He's simply a quiet success. Too quiet. He is not a larger than life character and that seriously hurts the entertainment value of the film, for he seems to be a man with no major motivations, no big goals he's trying to achieve. He doesn't even seem all that fascinated with his magic.Seeing him in blandness and raising him is Jessica Biel as the Duchess. She is beautiful, but about as uninvolved a princess in an ivory tower as you will see in a film. Her big scene in which she breaks up with the abusive Austrain prince she is engaged to is almost unbelievably dull.The lone exception to the blandness rule that controls this film is Paul Giamatti, who plays a Vienna police detective fascinated with Norton's magic tricks, but forced by politics to play ball with the demented prince.Giamatti goes in the other direction, mugging for the camera at every opportunity, and actually almost going into a parody mode at the end of the film as he ""figures it all out."" For a hint about how to play the important third party --especially if he is a detective -- see Edward G. Robinson's performance in ""Double Indemnity.""The film is not without merit, and the action moves the picture along with few dead spots. Nonetheless, you can't help feeling that this is a picture about magic that lacks magic, both literally and symbolically.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

The dialogs match the quality of the acting, and don't get me started on the script. The settings, the soundtrack, the lightning, all create the atmosphere of the time portrayed. If you like movies that make you think and not just watch the pretty special effects, if you like plot twists, you'll love this. If you missed it in theaters, get it on DVD, I know I will.

Almost a 9,Intensely frustrating because I loved everything about the film but the effects. A disastrous mistake to do most of the magic as CG effects and optical effects. Edward Norton does a tiny bit of close up magic but the rest are computer effects and they take you out of the movie ruining the scenes. Aspects are a bit close to The Prestige but I respect that The Prestige went with actual magic tricks and only used effects for the one gag. That film had a fantasy aspect to it where as this one is grounded in a 100% reality so it was odd The Prestige would use practical magic where as the film that was set in the real world uses effects that can't happen in the real world ruining the real world feel.

A cool magical twist on a story!,"I was really excited to see ""The Illusionist"" and it met up to my expectations! I am a huge fan of Edward Norton's, he's one of today's most under rated actors, I wish I would see him in more films, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see. My only concern was Jessia Beil, she doesn't seem like the old day's type of a movie actress. She was kind of a bummer to the film, she couldn't keep up with a British accent, but she didn't do too bad of a job. But it's the others who truly keep this amazing film going.The story is about a man, Eisenheir(spelling?), he is an illusionist/magician, and we aren't just talking pulling a rabbit out of a hat, he does the most amazing tricks that would make you think that he was made of magic. But it is the duchess played by Beil who steals his heart and they have a scandalous affair since she is engaged to the emperor's son. When she attempts to leave him, she is murdered by his hand, and the chief inspector tries to find out who the murderer is. When Eisenheir starts to do amazing beyond the dead images to the public including his love, he gets into big trouble, but plays all the men with his amazing acts into a great ending!I really hope The Illusionist does well at the awards ceremony, it deserves it. Believe me when I say that this is one of the best films I have seen in 2006, considering what we have had, I'm extremely happy that Hollywood brought us a great and unique story.

As Close to a Perfect Film as Can be Made - The Illusionist,"This movie is one of the two best films about magic every made (The other being King of Masks). The cast is superb. The direction is airtight. The production values are first-rate and the script is impeccable. Edward Norton is at the top of his game here; and that is like Nolan Ryan pitching in his prime. Giamatti deserved a supporting actor oscar, and Jennifer Beale is to die for. The film will grab you from the very first minute to the very last minute and has as many twists and turns as The Red Violin, one of my favorite twist films. It was obvious that Norton worked very hard on this character, as he shows his skills in several sequences. A few amateur reviewers found one or two holes in the story; how sad for them. ITS A MOVIE! You are supposed to suspend disbelief for one or two minor flaws in the story line. No story is perfect; not even stories from the Bible. But that does not stop people from appreciating the EFFECT of the stories in the Bible. This film is almost devoid of any weaknesses, and is highly recommended as one of my top 100 films of all time. That is a list that is not easy to get on; especially after 10000 films or so. Enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"A Well-Crafted, Well-Acted Atmospheric La Belle Epoque Viennese Mystery","Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject. Wisely using the repeated line 'Nothing is what it seems' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim (finely characterized by Edward Norton) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel).As children Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class: Sophie was royalty (a Duchess) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court. They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold, whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel.Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman, under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer (Eddie Marsan), delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks. His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown. Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl (a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is, well, 'Nothing is what it seems'.The cast is outstanding, the setting (in Prague) is incredibly atmospheric, and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit. Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for 'The Hours' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day. THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine, misty, dark evocation of life in La Belle Époque of Vienna, based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems.

"""Everything  I  do  is  a  trick,,  . . . . .it's meant only to entertain you""","The greatest magician of the 20th century was Eric Weiss, otherwise known as The Great Houdini. As was his practice, he often explained, what he did was not to trick people, only to entertain them. He was good at his craft, and despite his plea, he was still thought of as the greatest magician of all time. His famed career and that of this film, ""The Illusionist"" are to say the least, similar and remarkable. For Houdini, his only ambition was to enthrall audiences. In this film, we have a young man, The Great Eisenheim, (Edward Norton) who discovers his talent may be a way to win and hold the heart of a beautiful princess, named Sophie (Jessica Biel) whom he loves. Obtructions to their happiness include, Crown Prince Leopold, (Rufus Sewell) who plans to use Sophie to cement his claim to Hungry. There is also Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who will do his best so his employer, the prince gets his way. To say the audience will be entertained is to underscore Edward Norton's ability to conjure up more than is expected. Prepare to be mesmerized to the very end of the film.

It's magic,"I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. Although I think its down-tempo and simple story line are a little of a let down, the rest of the film is pure magic.The movie is based on a great illusionist who re-encounters his childhood-friend/girlfriend. After that you know what... he tries to run away with her even though she's engaged to the Crown Prince. So don't expect complex and mind blowing intrigues.What I believe to be the appealing part of the movie was the plot around the boy chases girl thing. The great magic tricks along with a solid structure are what the film is all about. After all, a credible scenario along with intelligent and creative ideas are enough reasons to make it a good movie.Having Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti amongst the cast is just a proof that the acting is top notch. You can't even complain about Jessica Biel as far as I'm concerned.The soundtrack sets the ambiance just right, so thumbs up for the whole environmental aspects of the movie.Basically a great film, although I recommend it when you're in a mood for a non-existent-action mystery/romance flick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Magical Elements and (poof!) Mediocre Movie!,"When I heard that there'd be two ""turn of the century magician"" movies coming out this year, I was expecting the classic ""Armageddon/Deep Impact"" Law of Hollywood; wherein some scribe came up with a cute idea and a rival studio's mole funneled it back, causing a race to pump out 2 cruddy movies in record time.My thoughts were waylaid, though, when I heard that this was based on an award winning short story (!)starring Edward Norton (!) Paul Giamatti (!) and featuring the supporting cast of Jessica Biel's lips(!!). Unfortunately, and perhaps unfairly since everyone is already gaging it against the trailer for ""The Prestige"", the result underwhelms. Not that it's not a completely capable film; Herr Direktor uses flickering film effects and irising reminiscent of silent films, Ed Norton is predictably solid, Giamatti chews scenery like succulent beef jerky, the googly-eyed mean guy from ""A Night's Tale"" is both googly and mean, and Biel's lips are... quite present.However the film itself is simplistic; the magic effects are mere CGI add-ins rather than slight of hand, and the plot is a bit to easy to unravel by the half-way point. In fact, the main plot is little more than a classic Holmesian mystery that could have been told quite cleanly in 30-45 minutes.Perhaps it is unfair to instantly judge a piece by the sum of its accomplished and well-paid parts, but as such, ""The Illusionist"" merely passes the grade of standard entertainment... Though the costume designer should be commended; the low slung cowl on Biel's on-stage cloak hangs to her nose, giving the audience every opportunity to enjoy her, um, y'know acting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"""A Masterful Blend of Magic and Mystery""","The Illusionist is a captivating cinematic experience that weaves a mesmerizing tale of love, deception, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. Directed by Neil Burger, the film stars Edward Norton as Eisenheim, a charismatic magician navigating a world of intrigue and danger.From the outset, the film immerses viewers in a visually stunning world of turn-of-the-century Vienna. The sepia-toned cinematography, reminiscent of early cinema, adds a layer of mystique and nostalgia. The intricate set designs and costumes further contribute to the film's enchanting atmosphere.At the heart of the story is a forbidden love affair between Eisenheim and Sophie (Jessica Biel), a woman from a higher social class. Their passionate connection serves as a driving force throughout the film, adding a romantic undercurrent to the suspenseful narrative.The plot unfolds as a complex interplay of illusions and realities, keeping the audience guessing until the very end. Edward Norton delivers a compelling performance as Eisenheim, a man capable of both extraordinary magic and profound deception. Paul Giamatti shines as Chief Inspector Uhl, a determined detective caught in a web of mystery.The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to blur the lines between magic and reality. The audience is constantly questioning whether Eisenheim's feats are mere tricks or something more supernatural. This ambiguity adds a layer of intrigue and keeps viewers engaged throughout.While the film's ending may leave some with unanswered questions, it ultimately provides a fitting conclusion to the story. The final act is filled with dramatic tension and a sense of poetic justice.If you have so many Suspence and Mystery movies like me, you have very good idea whta ending might be. But, still i liked the movie. It will force you to be engaged in every seconds from start to finish.I must say if want to enjoy this movie, you have to put your brain a side and just watch. Don't ask question your self how can be that possible and don't think about unanswered questions just watch.The Illusionist is a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating film that will leave a lasting impression. Its masterful storytelling, captivating performances, and atmospheric cinematography make it a must-watch for fans of mystery, drama, and magic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Saying hi but not staying for dinner,"Often paired with Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" this story follows a similar path of misdirection and curiosity within the world of magic and illusion, but is executed in a completely different way. The color tone is distractingly warm and the moments of misdirection are underutilized and somewhat given away through emotion, never fully selling the concept that drives this film to achieve the potential that it may have had. As a supporting cast member, Paul Giamatti leads this ensemble and acts as a guide to viewers to match his character's emotion as you transition throughout each sequence. The ambitious premise of magic and illusion only succeeds through the execution of its reveal, and though there are plenty of aspects to enjoy from this experience, there's an equal amount of buildup that never pays off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Thats the party line and here I'm willing to tow it since to do otherwise would involve lengthy explanations that would tell you too much before hand.Absolutely one of the best looking, best acted, best made movies of the year.

The Illusionist (2006),"In turn-of-the-century Vienna, the illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) impresses and upsets the royal court, including the woman (Jessica Biel) set to marry the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell).Philip Glass's spellbinding music and Dick Pope's shadowy, Oscar nominated cinematography enshroud this intriguing tale of love, power and magic. ""The Illusionist"" is a unique film that combines two of my favorite genres into something fresh: the lush romantic period piece and the mystery thriller.There is a lavish attention to the set designs and costumes, here representing late nineteenth century Vienna. Visually in terms of locations,this movie was stunning .The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story.Edward Norton in his role is excellent and and Jessica Biel is mesmerizing she is very believable and stunningly beautiful. Rufus Sewell as the tyrannical crown-prince and Paul Giamatti as the chief inspector are both splendid in there villainous roles .The music of Philip Glass fits the scenes and add just the right amount of tension.This film has a lot going for it ; romance, suspense, star crossed lovers and supernatural illusions.A compelling and beautiful film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Good movie but definitely a case of style over substance.,"No doubt that ""The Illusionist"" is one of the best looking movies of 2006. Great sets, costumes, cinematography and such but the story left me mostly cold and in fact was quite poorly told and developed at times. So definitely a case of style over substance this one but what a great style it is.What I especially loved about the movie was its authentic feeling. The movie was made in fairly much the same style as back in the early days of cinema. Of course all of the sets and costumes and such also add to the authentic feeling of the overall movie. Neil Burger obviously has a love for the movies from the early days of cinema.I however found to be the story quite simplistic, with a love-story also done in about the same way as in the earliest movies. It's admirable but not really good and interesting enough for an 21th century movie. The story also doesn't bother to explain everything, which leaves a lot to the viewers its own imagination and assumptions. Its a good way to make a movie but in this case it just leaves a bit too many questions in the end. The movie is also lacking too much in proper tension, mystery and real surprises. I for one already exactly knew how this movie was going to end halve way through the movie.The story and overall movie also don't always get properly developed. It's like the movie is stuck at times and Neil Burger still has got a lot of learning to do when it comes down to telling a story exciting, intriguing and suspenseful. The story now just couldn't grab me, though I guess that in its core it had potential. Perhaps the movie felt like it was stuck at times because of the reason that the movie is mostly set at constantly the same locations, for most part. The movie also uses its special effects too much as a tool to tell the story with. It's in huge contrast with the authentic feel of the movie. It takes away some of the 'magic' of the movie, since you just know its not real and not a real magic trick you're looking at. It also takes away some of the charm of the movie and its subject.The best action and intriguing aspect from this movie comes from Paul Giamatti as Inspector Uhl, though his character really doesn't get developed in the best way possible. His character constantly changes during the movie. At times you like him, at times he's more the villain and at times he just confuses you what his motivations are. Nevertheless, Paul Giamatti is absolutely fantastic in his role and he also shows how incredible versatile as an actor he is. I wouldn't had mind him seeing being nominated for an Oscar again for his role in this movie. But of course opposing is Edward Norton who also does more than a great job as the main character of the movie.But before I'm starting to sound too negative; ""The Illusionist"" is definitely a movie worth seeing, that however is too weak and simplistic to also consider it as one of the best movie in recent years, like the current rating here at the moment might suggest it is.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
One of my favourites - classic movie,"Great screenplay with perfect plot and character development - an excellent production - great direction and sound. The ensemble of supporting actors is also perfect - every one of them is great in their role. However the main actor role suited Edward Norton better than any other and brought out his best - he is the movie and he carries it perfectly. Just like the character Eisenheim in this movie, there is something very different and 'unknown' about Norton. While Fight Club.and Birdman are many people's Norton performance, this movie IMO is his best performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
My purpose is to entertain,"A strong sentence spoken by Norton in the movie. A magician efforts to achieve his objective. Full of illusion, what you see is not always true. A truly remarkable performance by Norton. Paul Giammati also performs very well in this movie as a character that was sort of in the middle of the fight between Norton and Rufus. Love, especially first love will stays with you and a promise made is a debt that will make you moves. Norton characters shows what a struggle he has gone through to repay the debt and come back to pay it. One of the best movie in 2006 that worth to be re-watched again. You won't guess what's going to happen next, a wonderful cinematography as well. You will enjoys it again & again. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Excellence as smooth as a conjurer's backhander,"The Illusionist (three and a half stars)Director: Neil Burger Writer: Neil Burger, based on a short story by Steven Millhauser Cast: Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell, Edward Marsan, Jake Wood, Tom Fisher, Aaron Johnson, Eleanor Tomlinson, Karl Johnson Runtime: 110 minutes Certificate: PG Year: 2006 Country: Czech Republic/USAnother stage-magicians story so soon after The Prestige needs something to distinguish itself with, and The Illusionist fares quite well.In keeping with the theme, The Illusionist is visually impressive from the opening credits, sweeping us into intricate scrolls and patterns that lead us through soft focus shots of rich landscapes, book-lined offices and the delicately distinguished architecture of Vienna's streets from a hundred years ago. Browns, sepias and ochres suffuse the screen, seducing us into a world of chimaeras and fairy-tale reality masterminded by quiet and unassuming Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton).This is a romantic mystery around a brilliant stage magician of yesteryear, determined to win back his childhood sweetheart from a corrupt and dangerous Prince. Through flashback, we see Sophie, a child of the gentry. Eisenheim, on the other hand, is a lowly son of a cabinet-maker. Where The Prestige toyed with magicians seeking ultimate magic through fringe science of the day, The Illusionist has an air of fantasy where amazing powers are never questioned. The main protagonists have a Hansel-and-Gretel innocence against a big bad tyrant.Says director Neil Burger, ""Most of the tricks are based on real illusions,"" but, even though based on tricks of the period, they are rather stunning on screen, due in no small part to the very powerful, almost hypnotic presence exerted by Edward Norton. But at one point early on, it seemed to be getting a bit too Harry Potter. Burger says, ""If you're going to exaggerate certain elements, to have it be dreamlike or surreal or uncanny, you have to make sure that the rest of it has a rock solid foundation in the period."" The film is so smoothly delivered that it seems pointless worrying about how exaggerated they were. ""My goal was to have the film completely inhabit that realm of dream and mystery,"" he says, and succeeds.Jessica Biel, as Sophie, also gives a strong melt-in-the-mouth performance. Paul Giamatti, as the doggedly persevering police chief, torn between conscience and following crooked orders, shows a strength in his performance that contrasts well with bumbling characters of earlier films (such as Sideways). Norton is tender and caring - again a revelation testifying to a breadth of very considerable acting skills.The film competed against The Prestige for Best Cinematography Oscar, and has a very distinctive look, based on an early colour photography process called 'autochrome'. Philip Glass, one of the most important contemporary composers and well respected for his film scores, seamlessly maintained the flow of the movie (even if it did sound disturbingly similar to his score for The Hours). But the consummate production values and perfectly combined talent going into The Illusionist is also its weakest point. Where The Prestige hit an unsettling nerve by keeping the audience unsure of the plot development, The Illusionist, appealing to a wider market, is engaging but controlled. The surprise ending is icing on the cake of a sumptuously professional piece of entertainment. Elegant and mesmerising, skilfully saturated with stylish energy, a tale of forbidden love that will delight as an intelligent date movie or as family entertainment. Production line it might be, but top of the range. Or so we are meant to believe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Enjoyable historical romance-drama.,"""The Illusionist"" is a period drama set in Vienna around the turn-of-the-20th-century.The ""illusionist"" of the title is Eisenheim, a celebrated stage magician, and the story tells of his love for the aristocratic Sophie von Teschen. Eisenheim (whose real name is Eduard Abramovich) and Sophie were teenage sweethearts, but because of the difference in social class (he is the son of a cabinetmaker) their love was a hopeless one and her family forbade her to see him. When they meet again, Sophie is the reluctant fiancée of Crown Prince Leopold, the son of the Emperor Franz Josef and a drunken debauchee with a history of violence against women. (He is rumoured to have murdered a former mistress). To make matters worse, Leopold is planning a coup d'état to usurp the Imperial Crown from his father. Eisenheim has to call on all his skills as a magician to thwart Leopold's plans and to save Sophie from the prospect of a marriage which is hateful to her.Leopold is, of course, a fictitious character. Franz Josef only had one son, Crown Prince Rudolf, who died in a suicide pact with his mistress in 1889. At the time the film is set the heir to the Habsburg throne was Rudolf's cousin, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Leopold, however, does bear some resemblance in character to the notoriously dissolute Rudolf (although not to the historical Franz Ferdinand, who was a devoted family man). Sophie is another fictitious character, although there was indeed a von Teschen family, a younger branch of the Habsburg dynasty, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Edward Norton can normally be relied upon to deliver a good performance, and does not disappoint here. His Eisenheim is, as befits a man whose trade is based upon mystery and illusion, suitably inscrutable and enigmatic, but behind his outwardly calm demeanour we can discern a powerful sense of right and wrong and a deep love for Sophie (Jessica Biel, looking as stunning as ever). Another important character is Paul Giamatti's Chief Inspector Uhl, the detective ordered by Leopold to spy on Sophie and Eisenheim. Uhl is a man of divided loyalties. On the one hand he is a patriot and a loyal servant of his emperor; on the other his own strong sense of morality leads him to despise Leopold and to sympathise with the young lovers.The film has an unusual look. Although it is officially a colour film, it is characterised by dull tones and a lack of bright colours. The aim seems to have been to produce something reminiscent of a sepia photograph, appropriate to the period during which it is set. Overall this is an intelligent, well-written, well-acted and enjoyable historical romance-drama. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"Almost great, but something essential is missing","This stylish story of deception and intrigue takes place in early 20th century Vienna. Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton) comes to town and stuns the crowds with his nearly--possibly supernatural magic tricks. Even the Crown Prince is intrigued. It so happens that the crown prince's fiancée Sophie (Jessica Biel) and Eisenheim were best of friends in childhood until her parents forbade her association with a commoner. When they become reacquainted, they spark an affair, which causes the prince to kill Sophie in a drunken rage. Eisenheim knows the prince did it and tries to subtly have him accused. The prince won't have any of this an orders his faithful, but just, chief Inspector (Paul Giamati) to shut down Eisenheim.The director maintains a mysterious and dark mood throughout the movie in this well-paced period piece. The actors do justice to their role and the story draws one in. The ending, which is meant to be surprising, can be guessed at by the savvy viewer who has developed her skills watching Buffy, Veronica Mars and Lost. I enjoyed the movie, and would possibly watch it again, but it wouldn't hold up to multiple viewings as well as some.This movie is like a blue peanut M&M with only a half a peanut inside. The crisp candy shell gives way to a less sweet chocolate (Mars Inc. took months to perfect the chocolate, making it less sweet, hence less satisfying, thus increasing consumption). When you realize the peanut is minuscule, you experience a slight disappointment, although an M&M with only half a peanut is better than a plain M&M which is better than celery any day. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"An OK movie, not that exciting","I watched this right after The Prestige, and maybe the former was so awesome that this movie just mildly interested me.

The explanation at the end of the movie seems not good and logical enough for my liking.The plot, I think, is supposed to have a twist, but I hardly found it surprising at all!

Breeding the Illusion of Puzzle,"I can't really remember the last time I was so amazed by the quality and development of a movie. Not just flabbergasted, but filled with awe as the story was constructed inside a most meticulously brilliant frame.I say first meticulous because the film excels in every aspect imaginable. All of the production values contribute discreetly to give the film that taste, like inhaling deep beauty all around. Scrupulous and beautiful art direction; from the dusty lamps; to the sculpted street scenarios, to the wonderful wardrobe election, fonded on careful creation. The photography is also remarkable, let's give it the honor, of imposing a dry, sepia like tone all over and mastering the precise quantity and quality of colors to amuse the spectator and drown him into the story, helped by a cohesive, narrow editing. Neil Burgess shows his study on films, as I was interested in seeing the now rare closing on iris, used in some scenes fading the image in a black, circled vortex. That was used in the pre-50 movies. ""Some of the tricks transcend the illusion and approach art"" claims Norton's character. Well, art is reached with this breathtaking production afore mentioned.Actings, on the other hand, are brutally calculated: like Giamatti's pondering ordinary charm, and Norton exuding elegance all the way on. Sewell's villain potency and Biel's charm, beauty, mesmerizing looks and so on. Oh, and I forgot! The music is sincerely spectacular, inviting the viewer to close eyes in order to truly hear it. Some ups and downs of a piano make an absolutely astonishing score that adds to the movie.If ""The Prestige"" (unevitable comparison) was a dark, gritty but fantastic approach at magic ""The Illusionist"" is delicious, exceptionally presented and a lot more sweet on edges, with a romantic story finely scripted. The spiritualism messages are beyond my interest, but adds to the movie's utter bright karma.I wasn't surprised like these since a long shot, since ""Spirited Away"". Maybe because I wasn't aware of the hype. But the movie will be presented as a puzzle, with many hints to solve a faltering mystery. Appearances may lie, may not lie. The true illusion lies in how deep does the viewer believe this story. Movies are an illusion, right?Fantastical, Incredible, Brutal, Mesmerizing. Can think of many more words. Please see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Surprising dull affair as it misfires on various levels,"As a child, Edward fell in love with a girl who was outside his social class. The girl is taken from him and he is warned of arrest for himself and his wider family. Years pass with Edward travelling the world  the details of this varying depending on which story you listen to. Either way, he eventually remerges under the moniker Eisenheim the Illusionist and is a big draw as his blend of magic and the supernatural leaves audiences gasping. When he comes to Vienna, he finds the girl he loved has become a woman and is now engaged to Crown Prince Leopold.I was curious to see this having seen The Prestige simply because thematically they seemed similar. However, beyond the idea of using the magic, the period and the uncertainity between real and illusion, the story is quite different as it is much more of a romance-driven tale. Someone on the message board for this film joked that you can tell which of the two films you will prefer if you simply refer to your genitalia and in a way they are quite correct because I do see The Illusionist being of more appeal to women. Maybe I should pull that comment back a bit though, because, regardless of what sex you are, I suspect that you might find this to be as dull as I did.In theory what we should have here is a smart mystery that is driven forward by a romantic history that we care about. This should lead to a ""reveal"" that brings everything together in the sort of way that those who have enjoyed The Usual Suspects will appreciate. However stage by stage it all fell down for me. Firstly we are handed a childish ""love"" that we are asked to care about  understandably I didn't at this point but I looked to it to be made real for me in the adult stage of the characters. Of course it seems that the writers told nobody about this because the relationship is never convincing and as such this emotional hook into the film doesn't catch  it probably didn't help that Norton and Biel go as well together as ice cream and syphilis.So this left me with the mystery inherent in the plot. Sadly this failed to interest me either. The magic aspect of it took it beyond my interest simply because, by being set in the world where ""anything is possible or can be made to appear possible"" I knew that the film could really do whatever it wanted to do. This was further reason why the narrative failed to draw me in and, not only that, but I actually found it quite dull as I found myself caring less how the couple made their getaway (I assumed) or what would happen. The final few minutes of the film is evidence of the failure to engage as we are given what was clearly intended to be an ending with the impact of The Usual Suspects  where the entire film is shifted in a ""reveal"" that only served to make a good film even better. However here nothing is really revealed and it left me wondering what the ""solution"" that so amuses Uhl actually was. Of course maybe I would have been more taken by the ending if I'd actually been made to care about the narrative (as I had with Suspects) but, as mentioned  I didn't.It is not that it is a bad film, just more that it was like a dud that never actually fired for me. Having said that though the one area where it did engage me was the cinematography. For a film dealing with what is real and what is not, I thought the decision to use bold colours was a good one as it made everything seem almost overly real and tangible in a way where real ""reality"" is much more grittier and less impressive than that which is presented as such. Visually the rather stiff cast fit in with this visual creation but otherwise they do mostly come off dull and stiff. Together they are poor but individually neither Norton or Biel offer much. The latter was no surprise to me but seeing Norton failing to emote was a surprise since I do rate him as an actor. He is overly stiff and as a character he offered me nothing to engage with. I almost want to assume that this was a conscious decision because the rest of the cast match this. Giamatti is flat but next to the flop that is Sewell he does appear to be giving the performance of his life.A dull film then that really failed to engage or interest me. As a romance it fails as the chemistry is totally absent from the lead two while, as a mystery, the magic element actually works against it, meaning the Usual Suspect ending did nothing for me and certainly did not have anything like the impact that it was suppose to do.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"very well made movie....details, score, picture, etc","i gave an 8 out of 10 because this movie is not a masterpiece but there was really some work on this motion picture...I saw it this morning in williamstown and everybody enjoyed it, big time!!!! At the end of the movie, Naomi, the editor was here to answer questions from the crowd, and explained the style of the movie, that they used some new technology to give a such look to the movie. I have to say that Edward is good as a main character but Paul G., second role, really steal the 'main character title' by his acting, job....something completely different from what he did before.

a love story disguised as a mystery,"The acting was great and the so called illusions used by the main character fitted in the story nicely! But the greatness of the illusionist doesn't come out as big as it is advertised! The magic is small and not spectacular! The thriller elements could have been better! But I think this movie is meant more as a romantic story than mystery! Although I personally would have enjoyed this movie more had this been more a mystery/thriller! It could have been darker adding more excitement! Also i wasn't really amazed with the special effects in the movie,because it was obvious CGI was used! If they had put more effort in the magic looking real and me doubting if it was real magic or CGI than this movie would have been great!

"In The Illusionist , whatever your interest, magic or romance, you won't be disappointed. Just don't forget that the whole scheme is in the details - look carefully","In yet another of these coincidences so frequent in Hollywood, 2006 gave rise to two films that, set in more or less the same period (late 19th and early 20th century), feature magicians whose tricks may or may not involve supernatural phenomena and who face problems with the Law. The difference is that, while The Great Trick had a complex and intelligent plot, The Illusionist sacrifices its ambitions in favor of a novel that converts the story into a predictable sugar water, but full of good moments.Written by Neil Burger (who also directs) from a great short story by Steven Millhauser, the film revolves around Edward (Edward Norton), a peasant's son, who falls in love with Sophie (Jessica Biel), a teenager belonging to an upper class family. The two then find themselves forced to separate due to noticeable differences. After a while, Edward, now known as Eisenheim, decides to return to Vienna. From a young age, the guy already had a talent for magic, which, over the years, only improved. And it's exactly like magic that comes back to the city. He manages to amaze the audiences of Vienna with his spectacles and, because of this, arouses the curiosity of the skeptical Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Duchess Sophie, at this moment, is already engaged to the prince and is closely watched by police inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), Leopold's trusted man. However, even committed, the young woman perceives in Eisenheim the figure of her youthful passion, and the two resume a clandestine romance.Contrary to what it may seem, ""The Illusionist"" is not just a sugar-water romance movie easily found out there. It brings persecutions, mysteries, unusual situations and, of course, illusions. Just by the trailer, the dimension of the feature is already noticeable, deducting the shows that it will provide us. Director and screenwriter Neil Burger may not be an expert in cinema, as, before this film, he was only involved in a film project called ""Interview with the Assassin"", however, even so, he is able to win the audience from the first moment., with well-crafted flashbacks.Neil Burger sacrifices most of the ideas present in the original short story (a story about one man's obsession with magic and professional perfection) in order to make the film more ""accessible"" to the average audience - which, in other words, it means creating a romantic plot that comes to dominate events. Thus, the filmmaker soon tries to include a sugary flashback that, through the anachronistic visual resource of the iris that opens to a past time, throws the viewer in the middle of scenes in sepia tone that portray the origin of the affair between Sophie and Eisenheim.Determined to further accentuate the couple's happiness, Burger loses his sense of the ridiculous, going so far as to surround his frames with a misty, ""dream"" frame. In addition, the director does not even fail to include an obvious slow motion in the instant that Jessica Biel appears on the scene - and it is clear that, when showing the couple's separation, he does not hesitate to include one of the most beaten shots of the genre: that which shows the two lovers' hands being forcibly separated. Not satisfied, the writer-director finally forces the talented Edward Norton to utter the phrase ""I saw many mysteries, but the only one I didn't solve was because my heart didn't forget it"", which ends up representing one of the most embarrassing moments of the series. Actor's career.And this is unfortunate, because Norton creates a character infinitely more interesting than the film in which he finds himself: elegant, intelligent and mysterious, Eisenheim is a man of strong personality who shows no fear of anything - and the narrative would benefit. Immensely if he concentrated on investigating the true nature of his spells. Instead, Burger chooses to sacrifice any verisimilitude by creating the protagonist's figures with the help of far-fetched visual effects, making them artificial and implausible (just compare them to those seen in The Trick). Meanwhile, Paul Giamatti offers, for the second time in the same year, a performance unworthy of his talent, as he limits himself to autopilot by embodying Uhl as a subject with a whispered speech and a muted personality. And if Rufus Sewell embodies the same obnoxious and dangerous type that he has lived many times in his career, Jessica Biel doesn't challenge our perception of her talent either, emerging as an attractive but not very expressive ornament.Like any screenwriter affected by the laziness of creating more dynamic solutions, Burger uses the voice-over whenever he needs to provide some kind of information to the public - and the plot created by him to replace that of the original story proves to be obvious, implausible and even offensive. By suggesting that the viewer might accept it as something intelligent (incredibly, the screenwriter doesn't even bother to explain how the main Eisenheim act was performed, which is unforgivable and ends up confirming our suspicions that Burger really isn't. Had no idea how to tie up the loose ends of the story). To try to deceive the audience, the film includes one of those endings that, through a quick montage, pretend to assemble the puzzle presented throughout the projection, culminating in a character's smile when he realizes the meaning of everything. Unfortunately, we only need to think about it for two seconds to conclude that nothing makes much sense and that the holes are numerous and unavoidable.Neil Burger gave his narrative an aura of mystery. With an impeccable period, reenactment, it is an elegant film. The photography, stunning, values the excellent production design. The whole aesthetic of the film reminds us of silent cinema, with dimly lit and ethereal scenes. Even the editing techniques pay homage to the ball-shaped fade so used at the time. Dick Pope's photography work is fantastic. It perfectly captures the impressive Gothic architecture of the city of Prague, which served as the backdrop to represent Vienna. The person responsible for transforming one city into another is cameraman Ondrej Nakvasil. The soundtrack by composer Philip Glass perfectly completes the narrative, alternating suspense and drama.Burger introduced us to a new world, which, fused with the old, since the time in which the plot takes place is old, has become completely irresistible and captivating. The effects used in Eisenheim's illusions aren't exquisite, but they're still beautiful. The part, for example, in which the magician manages to make an orange tree grow is not beautiful enough to leave the spectator open-mouthed, but it is capable of completely pleasing. To further enhance the project, dark tones were always used, thus giving a greater sobriety to the film, which involves the audience even more with the world of magic. The filmmaker also manages to provide the feature with an engaging rhythm and reasonably approaches the romance experienced by the protagonists. Without falling into the doldrums, Burger, after a while of projection, leaves the novel, which was apparently the main focus, for another approach.The Illusionist is very similar to The Great Trick, another recent film that focuses on the world of illusionists in the 19th century. Here, the focus is more on the romance between the two protagonists. The script involves and seduces the spectator in the same way that the protagonist's magic tricks do with his audience, always astonished, developing mysteries and romance in an elegant way. However, that dynamic is lost as it moves towards the end, especially when rehearsing a story with a supernatural background. The conclusion of The Illusionist, full of twists and revelations - which does not fail to surprise the hypnotized audience - is a bit run over, at odds with the rest of the film, which was developed with such care.However, we must take into account that The Illusionist is not a film that intends to surprise the viewer, but a film more interested in telling a love story, even if it hides behind the facade of ""thriller about magic"". Whatever your interest, magic or romance, you won't be disappointed. Just don't forget that the whole scheme is in the details - the scheme is to look carefully.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Complete Surprise,"I took my teenage sons to see this, and they are merciless critics. They both cam out raving about how much they loved the film, as did I. Just a few thoughts:1: If one looks at film as ""cohesive art"" this is perhaps the best film I have seen in a long time. It was a period piece, and used sound and lensing techniques more similar to 1950 than 2006. 2: The roles were cast to people who appeared human, not gods and goddesses. 3: I have read extensively about the reactions of crowds to spiritualists of the time. I believe the film caught this very well. 4: Whereas the makers of so many films seem to despise their audiences, this film was made with what I can only call respect and honor.Absolutely the best piece of movie-making I have seen in all of 2006.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist  - WONDERFUL MOVIE!,I really enjoyed the movie and the twists! Edward Norton Jr. is a wonderful actor. I enjoy any movie he has starred in. I plan to see this again! It was very mystical and romantic. He is good at memorizing you through the screen with his eyes. Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel complimented the movie to make a well rounded cast. The setting was set in an era when people believed in magic and illusions. It takes you back to your childhood and the magic that we possessed before we grew to adulthood. The Crown Prince brought a touch of tyrannical power that occurred during this day and time period. It proved that good and evil co-exist.,10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Could have been much better!,"Unfortunately i didn't like the movie as much i thought i would. I hate when this happens, a movie is built up by everyone, and in the end it's a big disappointment, for me at least. The story is nice, but i didn't like the storytelling, it lacked detail and it was dull. The characters weren't completely defined: for instance, i would have liked to know more about what they had done during the time Eisenheim was away. It would have given me a sense of what he has become.The casting was awful: Paul Giamatti is NOT cut out to be a badguy, even if in the end we found out that things were completely different. Rufus Sewell lacked the elegance of a prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, don't get me wrong i like him very much (in Tristan + Isolde, for example). Not even Edward Norton, a very very gifted actor, could not make his role work. The only pleasant surprise was from the part of Jessica Biel. I didn't realise how talented and beautiful she was up until this movie.The twist in the plot at the end wasn't predictable, i admit, but it lacked the eloquence it needed to pull it off. Goof: (in my opinion) the private show for the prince takes place before the two of them decide to run away. But in the end the writers are telling us that the gems from the sword, used to frame the prince, were taken that evening from the sword... COME ONAll this movie accomplished for me is the fact that i got to see Edward Norton one of my favorites, and rediscovered Jessica Biel for the bright, young, talented actress that she has become.Thank you for your time...Andrei.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Truth Behind The Illusion,"Neil Burger's 'The Illusionist' is an enchanting mystery. The atmosphere that Burger creates, using Philip Glass's haunting soundtrack, a yellowy green tint that looks as though the screen was washed in olive oil (adding to the charm), the costumes and sets and magic (or shall I say illusion) gives an overall enchanted and illuminating feel. The special effects look authentic. Burger's screenplay is solid. He has given great attention to detail and the way he unfolds the story and peels the layers of his characters is remarkable. Edward Norton can proudly add 'The Illusionist' to his illustrious filmography. Paul Giamatti is stupendous. Rufus Sewell does a fine job. Jessica Biel has finally made a wise career choice and surprisingly holds her own. The story interweaves the murder mystery, the love story and Edward's passion for magic quite well. Burger tells a convincing story overall. Though it is fiction it does make me wonder how illusionists were treated in those times (the film shows them to be admired by some and despised by others).",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A mystifying end,"Rating-7/10The Illusionist is a mystery drama movie set in Vienna at the end of the 19th century, with magic on show and a royal who doesn't like it much. The movie is an interesting one, the plot is very intriguing and really makes you think quite a bit about what will happen next. I think the movie also stays with you afterwards as you fully realise what has happened in the movie, a kind of nice after taste if you will.It has a smart plot and feels even smarter as the credits roll, there is no doubt this will please many many fans but I did feel this movie thinks it is much smarter than it is. Now it is not that the film has been done before necessarily, it is just that the plot when thought about is good but in truth you can see the producers really wanted people to leave and think ""Wow that was amazing"" and try to win you over on only one element of the story.The movie is well acted all round and the cast are picked well, Edward Norton is fine as our main character Eisenheim and he manages to confidentially play out a difficult role. Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector Uhl is good as well, the way in which his character has two faces in a way really makes this a defining role for Giamatti in cinema. Jessica Biel is fine as the Duchess and although she isn't great, her role is very important in the end, with Rufus Sewell's portrayal of the Crown Prince Leopold also a very fine and important role all together too.Neil Burger writes and directs the movie and he does both well mixing together elements which haven't been done before and bringing in the tried and tested to create an all round good film. Above all he directs well here and it is one of the best things about this, Burger manages to bring not only the most out of the characters but also true emotion and it can't be said that you don't feel for the characters if not a little by the end in anyway.Now don't get me wrong the movie can have it's dull moments although it isn't bad I don't mean, I am just saying that the scenes can around the middle to middle ending feel too dull and as if everything happening is completely predicted. The real pay off as I have said is of course the end and I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this, but let's just say that you have to wait until the end to really get the full force of this movie.The film is even well researched, it goes well with a true story in history about the Crown Prince and the duchess and takes a new if not absurd spin on the story, well for some maybe it is absurd. I liked the setting of the movie, Vienna provides a beautiful backdrop and one of the defining things about this is the architecture, it may make you want to go on holiday there after viewing I have no doubt.Overall it is a good piece of cinema and one that will be remembered, As I said it thinks it is smarter than it really is so some may watch this and really love it like a lot. It is though a smart plot in fairness and a smart movie all round, the cleverness of the team in directing and writing and also the acting makes this a fine movie and one that may have some calling for why certain actors didn't get award nominations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Much more enjoyable than ""The Prestige"" released almost two months later","(2006) The Illusionist
MYSTERY DRAMAReleased during the same year as ""The Prestige"" directed by Christopher Nolan between the two movies, I prefer ""The Illusionist"" over ""The Prestige"". In my opinion magic should not involve murder.Adapted from the short story ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" by Steven Millhauser co-written and directed by Neil Burger. Since magic had been around for an extremely long time, probably even before the Houdini years, this is a great vehicle that doesn't need to require an answer for it's conclusion about how did that happen BUT how can two characters the audience care about reunite back together during the time of the century.

For AMPAS,"It has the look of a foreign film. I thoroughly enjoyed sets, costumes and mostly, the acting by Norton and Giametti.

I predict that it will be a cult classic. Let's see more of Ed Norton.A standing ovation to the special effects department. It is exciting to see a production not geared to the demographics of those under 29. While I am not a prude, I often feel that filmmakers have no concept as to how to depict sensuality as they substitute nudity for same.

A good film makes you feel better,"When this film was released, I was wondering whether I should watch this film or ""21"" and after all I chosen this one and watch ""21"" at a theatre.

If you think about it, it sounds strange that an actor plays a role who plays a different role in a story. I can't say too much not to spoil the story...The story is about Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and Sophie (Jessica Biel) fell in love in childhood but their love, which they wish to have the everlasting love however, had to be ended due to the differences of realm. Since he saw an illusionist as a child, he was fascinated by the illusion and created various kind of tricks, and acquired as a position of the illusionist. One day, he invited a women from the audience to feel his illusion at his stage. The woman is the lady who he fell in love in childhood. She has a finance at the moment but their love between Sophie and Eisenheim is profound and decide to escape from her state. That night, her fiancé Loepold (Rufus Sewell) killed Sophie due to his anger of Sophie's betrayal when she left the castle. While Eisenheim with his suffer heartache, exhibits an illusion creating visional apparition at his stage...A tricky thing with its features creating an illusion, tricks or magic in a film is kinda cheating in a film, but I think it's not a live performance and everything is acceptable in a film. Any special effect or unrealistic magic could be made in a film. When I saw ""Prestige"" (2006) felt the same way; ""That's cheating! cos it's a film"". This time again makes me feel the same way.

cleverly disguised romance,"This movie is about magic. It is clearly about people believing what they choose to believe whether it is real or not. The magician's real trick is the ability to lead people down the path of their beliefs while messing with reality. When the trick is done, the desire to believe and the belief become the magic. That is what movies are, too. All the talent and effort of the people who make the movies go into playing off of your own ability to believe something and it is the viewers' ability to be distracted from the reality of movie-making that helps the story be successful. This film succeeds on several levels and I sat like a child being told a sophisticated bedtime story. I wanted to believe. I got pulled into the romance in a way that I don't normally because I dislike most romance movies. But this worked because the acting was so strong and the attraction felt real with an unpredictable aspect. The romance, although central to the story, became secondary to the psychology and story of the impact of illusion on everything from romance to politics to social behavior. As the magician was analogous to movie makers, the Chief Inspector Uhl becomes the audience. He needs to be critical to do his job as detective, but he, too, gets lost in his own desire to believe in mystery and the fantastic. The acting is very good, Edward Norton was particularly good I love how he expressed depth and meaning with his eyes while only revealing what he wants you to see just like the magician; Jessica Biel surprised me at being better than I expected; Rufus Sewel embodied that era and his character perfectly; and Paul Giamatti is always top notch. I also have to say that the costume design is superb. Ngila Dickson is so talented at bringing other realities and time periods to life. The story is well told. There is one weak spot at the end that almost ruins what I had thought was careful story telling, but I hate spoilers, so I will not say specifically. It has to do with a clunky montage and laughter. It seems tacked on to retell a story for dumb American audiences and the story doesn't need retelling. If people want to see it again to find the details they missed, let em. Good for the box office, you know. But other than that, this is an really entertaining well-made movie that is also beautiful to look at.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"THE ILLUSIONIST (Neil Burger, 2006) ***","Having recently been impressed by THE PRESTIGE (2006), I was looking forward to this similarly-themed film but, as often happens with rival productions, one always ends up towering over the other; in this case, it's THE PRESTIGE which emerges the superior film. Still, THE ILLUSIONIST provides plenty of visual interest (both films, interestingly enough, have been nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar)  not least in the muted color palette and the magic tricks themselves (which, however, were more sparse than I had anticipated and rather too far-fetched into the bargain). However, compared to the dramatic hold and thematic bravado which distinguishes THE PRESTIGE, the stately film feels somewhat conventional: in fact, while I was expecting something on the lines of Ingmar Bergman's THE FACE (1958)  with a government official exposing a magician as a fraud and the latter's deadly retribution  all it ultimately amounted to was another impossible/undying love type of story; the final twist, however, is worth waiting for. Edward Norton gave his usual thorough performance, Jessica Biel was radiant as the romantic interest and Rufus Sewell rather monotonous as the crossed Prince  but it's Paul Giamatti who steals the film as the conflicted Police Inspector.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Very good mystery fantasy in a historical setting,"""The Illusionist"" is a very good mystery and intriguing fantasy film. It's loosely based on a short story, ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steven Millhauser. The story is set in the late 19th century in Vienna, which then was the principal capital of Austria-Hungary. And, the fictional story intertwines some with history. It includes a fictional account of the Mayerling incident. That was the 1889 murder-suicide of the real Crown Prince Rudolf and baroness Mary Vetsera.The characters in the film are all fictional. That of Eisenheim, from the short story, was a mythical character of the period who was a magician and sorcerer of sorts. The film is dark but quite intriguing, and very well-acted by all of the cast. It's entertaining and is one of those that, to best appreciate the illusions, is best seen on the big screen as I first saw it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Watch again and look closely,"I was surprised at how this was, when I watched it. Strangely enough it didn't do well at the Box Office. Maybe people can only be bothered with one Magician movie at a time, the other being the Prestige, which there is no doubt about superior to this one. It still is a very good movie, with a powerhouse performance by (especially) Ed Norton and the other actors involved.The movie can be watched just as entertainment or you can actually read things into it. Both ways will be rewarding, so you don't have to get everything (intentionally put there or not) to enjoy it. If you do, good for you. I liked the way it was told and the fact it left room for you to interpret some things. There is rewarding second viewing in sight then ... If you care for it that is",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
I liked it,"Sometimes it's good to see movies that are not too pretentious, not too full of themselves. I don't know exactly how you spot them, and set them apart from the movies that just want too much. It's not necessarily the themes or the visual style, nor is it the script. But there is something there. The Illusionist tells a story in a straight-forward way while still letting you think for yourself. I like that.The first notable thing about this movie is the acting. Edward Norton is one of my favorites, not least because his best work is usually quite minimalist. In this movie that is definitely the case. Norton is toned-down and excellent. Jessica Biel on the other hand shows that she is not just a pretty face, she does well. But the real star i found to be Rufus Sewell as the crown prince. I have know before that he's a good actor, but he excels here. His subdued rage and mood-swings are beautiful.The second thing i noticed was the visual style. It has a very nice touch to it. It comes in pale, almost sepia-toned, colors with a very nice ""old film""-style to it. The environments in Vienna are beautiful and the sets are a wonderful recreation of the late 19th century. The quite understated score from Phillip Glass complements the visual style nicely.The third and last thing is the plot. I really liked the way that it's straight-forward and yet... not. Even after the movie stops rolling it's not so easy to say what you just saw. Was it real or was it illusions. Paul Giamattis character ends the movie with a laugh that's almost maniacal, and i know how he felt. Movies are about illusions and perceptions. The people making ""The Illusionist"" understands this. In a time when audiences are constantly underestimated, and points are driven in with a sledgehammer more often than not, a movie that leaves you thinking is worth a lot, even if the plot itself is not advanced nor exceptional.This is hardly set to become a classic, or most peoples favorite pick for movie of the year. It's not that kind of movie. However it is proof that you can raise the bar with very small means, and make a solid movie just be respecting the audience. Very recommended. I rate this 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Shallow and predictable,"Ouch! For all that this film promises, I got way more of a surprise seeing the rating it has on this site than anything I saw in the film itself.The respectable cast do what they can with their bland, boring characters, and the setting is beautiful, but that wasn't nearly enough to keep me interested. An hour or so into the film, I knew how it was going to turn out, and I didn't really care. By the end, I was downright annoyed. I didn't build up enough compassion for the 'hero' and 'heroine' and I didn't dislike the villain enough to justify where the film sees them end up. Don't get me wrong, the villain was evil enough, but the reasons we're given to hate him seemed to be thought up and thrown in with clichéd subtext and a few clichéd scenes at the last minute and some of the decisions he makes later in the film are inconsistent with earlier parts. Maybe I'm a sucker for the bad guy, but I just ended up feeling sorry for him and I guess it's because of that I didn't end up liking the good guys. There's no character development here. Biel's character is insipid, shallow and annoying and Norton does his job well but seems bored most of the way through. Giamatti is as good as ever but his character is at times annoyingly inconsistent too. Sewell didn't have much to work with. If you want to see him as a much better villain in a much better film, see A Knight's Tale.I was expecting this film to grab me a lot more than it did, but it turned out to be more of a disappointment than anything else.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"The true illusion is this movie works well, Norton and Giamatti are fantastic","One of the years best films, and I thought for sure it would be tiring since later this year you have another magic movie coming out. With Bale and Jackman, but so far this movie sweeps away any competition of opening week. The story follows a magician (Norton, Oscar Worthy trend) who falls for a beautiful woman (Biel) in a higher social standing than himself. But when she is to be wed he uses his unique ability of the ""dark arts"" to win her love back. ""The Illusionist"" is smart and probably will end up very underrated. And of course Oscar snubbed. By far the best movie I've seen all month long I enjoyed the magic, the sense of wonder and just everything about it. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
outstanding film,"I was captivated by The Illusionist from the very beginning. A truly beautiful film. Gorgeous cinematography, excellent cast, wonderfully complex storyline. The sepia tones of the opening credits grabbed my attention and I immediately became enthralled in the fictitious yet plausible history of the tale. I can easily see both Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton earning Best Actor nominations for their fine performances. Have either one of these gifted actors ever let us down? And Jessica Biel was very very good. I consider this a break-through role for her. She carried herself well. Her performance was understated~ which only made her character stronger. The musical score of Philip Glass is alluring. A wonderful accent to this rich film experience. Great films don't happen on their own. I'm sorry to say I am not familiar with director Neil Burger's history. But I can assure you that I will be digging in to his past and anticipating his future contributions to the art media of cinema. It has been a long time since I've been this engrossed in a film. I highly recommend The Illusionist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Using Magic for Good,"I don't think there has ever been a year in which two movies about magicians came out, let alone two good movies about magicians. Unfortunately for ""The Illusionist"" I happened to see ""The Prestige"" before it. I wholly enjoyed ""The Prestige"" so it was a hard act to follow. Fortunately though, for ""The Illusionist"", it was not the same story as ""The Prestige"". The story of this movie, and the tricks done in the movie were good. The name of the movie alone sets the audience up to be wowed by a grand illusion. The only question would be: ""What is the illusion we are so anxiously awaiting?"" Every good illusionist has the ability to create doubt about certain things we hold as truths. As prepared as I was for the grand finale of this movie, there was some doubt created. Overall the movie was good, but the ending was a bit too ""Usual Suspects"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Surprising, beautiful period piece, excellent acting","I don't know how much of this movie was historically accurate, but I loved it.I was most worried about Jessica Biel, because honestly, I can only see her as Mary from 7th Heaven trying to break out into movies and not doing very well (with Summer Catch and Stealth). But Jessica Biel surprised me...she was actually really good and I think she has a bright future in movies if she continues in this direction.Plus...Rufus Sewell? Edward Norton? Paul Giamatti? Excellent acting from everyone! Rufus Sewell is always amazing in the roles I've seen him in, and Edward Norton...wow, that man is awesome.I loved the music and the swirling intro at the beginning and everything about the set was so lavish and so beautiful.Great movie. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Edward Norton Proves He Is Very Good,"The Illusionist is not a brilliant film, but it is nice. If you think that it is about somebody like Houdini and his tricks, then you are mistaken. The main hero, played by excellent Edward Norton, named Eisenheim, is an extremely talented illusionist, whose shows attract great attention and have no explanation. But this simple plot is weighed much by the fact that the whole story takes place in visibly calm but internally tense Vienna, where His Royal Highness is plotting against his father, an Emperor of Austrian  Hungarian empire, to take his throne. Mr. Eisenheim is suddenly in the very midst of this political turmoil, which is only mad worse by his romantic affair with Prince's bride-to-be. The seemingly slow and peaceful film in fact gets in quicker with every minute and the whole whirlwind of events is flying high. Till the end of the film we have no idea who is dead or alive, who is going to win or lose, who is right or wrong. This is a great, up-tempo story, with political killings, love, tricks and mystery. Sometimes, the film seems to become openly mystical, sometimes, very realistic. This is what it makes it so very thrilling and catchy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist Mystifies,"This is, by far, one of my all time favorite movies now. It has everything you could ask for: mystery, romance, and magic. I was in a trance the entire time the movie was on, it was as if the illusionist had cast a spell on me as well, a little cheesy I know but you get the idea. I can't remember the last time I left a movie feeling I actually got my full monies worth. This is a movie that will keep you thinking as well as entertained as you are constantly trying to figure out if he is in fact an illusionist or has a gift us normal folk could never possess. This is definitely a movie to pirate... oh wait that's illegal, so instead just go see it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Unbelievably Good Film,"I saw this film twice, and both times was completely enthralled by it. All of the performances are magnificent, especially Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti. Norton has such an amazing stage prescence in this film as Eisenheim, he completely brings me to believe that he actually does have the supernatural powers some believe he does. It was most certainly an Oscar-worthy performance. Giamatti too gives a powerful and excellent performance as Inspector Uhl, bringing the entire story together. While it was somewhat shocking to see and hear him at first, he quickly merged with his character, giving another Oscar-worthy performance. The cinematography, costumes, writing, and directing were all superb. If this film does not win a number of Oscars, it will be robbed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Good Movie, Falling Short Of Being a Great Movie","""The Illusionist"" was released in the same year as ""The Prestige"". Both deal with magic and mystery. Definitely, it would be absurd to write a movie review comparing with another movie, but it's important to have some sort of benchmark for comparison, a benchmark nearly achieved by ""The Prestige"" and missed by ""The Illusionist"".""The Illusionist"" stars Edward Norton. This ever bankable actor has the ability to carry the entire movie on his shoulder and he nearly does the same here. Supported well by Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti, the film has a good casting, a feat achieved by 'The Prestige"" too.The strength of this movie includes its sets and screenplay. The movie has a haunting atmosphere that greatly adds to the tension maintained throughout the movie. The sets are very believable and the entire aura greatly corresponds the movie's mysterious theme. The running time is good and the movie pace is very engaging and audience will always crave for details. If you consider the set design, movie pace and screenplay; ""The Illusionist"" scores better than ""The Prestige"".The biggest drawback of ""The Illusionist"" is the lack of trick details and the climax. Having said that, I like the climax of ""The Illusionist"", but none of the tricks preformed by Ed Norton were ever explained and hence, even though liking the twist ending, one never gets to know the authenticity of the twist. On the other hands, every bit of tricks is revealed in ""The Prestige' and hence, the end twist completely augur well with the film plot and the tricks preformed.Overall, watch this movie. Everyone who has seen this movie has liked it. But if you have panache for details, then you might be disappointed. Or, you can take up the challenge and crack the Illusionist's tricks.My Verdict: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Popcorn Flick for Adults,"""The Illusionist"" is an enjoyable diversion. It is ultimately escapist fluff, but finally there is a fun film that is geared towards an adult audience rather than children and teenagers.The acting is first class. Edward Norton is good but somewhat stiff as the lead character. Paul Giamatti actually has the most screen time and it could be argued that he is really the protagonist of the story.The photography, music, and the script are all first rate. I thought the ending was predictable, but I would have been disappointed if it had ended any other way.After a Summer of children's film and a Fall full of disappointments, ""The Illusionist"" is a film that actually delivers the goods.

Edward Norton IS the Illusionist,"Wow! This movie is spectacularly amazing! Edward Norton's performance was so mesmerizing that I literally got hypnotized. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. When my mom and I saw it in the theaters, we both applauded at the end, as everyone else did. Some people even whistled loudly. Some people even sat through the entire credit reel.Edward Norton practically IS the Illusionst. He plays the role so well. I am astounded at everybody's performances. I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD.I never saw the ending coming. It was so shocking. My mom sort of knew, though.Here are the stars: Edward Norton (Red Dragon, Kingdom of Heaven), Paul Giamatti (Lady in the Water, Sideways), Jessica Beil (Stealth, Cellular), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan and Isdole, A Knight's Tale).Philip Glass's music is hypnotic. I love the way he uses violins and violas and cellos and basses in his music, it's so beautiful. He also made the music for Secret Window, The Hours, and Candyman.The Illusionist is everyone above the age of 10 should see this movie.

Magical Acting But Old Tricks,"There was a period (2006) when there were a lot of movies about magicians (okay two). 'The Illusionist' was one of them. At the time I figured, 'you've seen one...' and you know the rest. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it the other night. A great cast of interesting characters that draw you into a story that otherwise is the standard fare. The movies tries to deliver on two levels: as a romance and a 'bro'mance - which left me wanting a little more of both frankly. The plot carries enough intrigue that you'll want to know what happens at the end but it's less impressive then the movie deserves.

Illusions are what we wish them to be,"An excellent period piece, part fantasy, part mystery, all enjoyable. One almost expects Gandalf or Dumbledore to appear, .... Edward Norton brings the correct amount of brooding intensity to Eisenheim, while Paul Giamotti could be dogged without turning into Javert. History students and film buffs may recognize the allusions in the story to that of the real Crown Prince of Belle Epoque Austria, Rudolph Hapsburg (what do you think the hunting lodge is that is mentioned? It's Mayerling, also movie of the same name). The cinematography, with its fades and blurry edges of frame, add to the mysterious atmosphere of film. The score is haunting, who knew minimalist could be melodious?",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A kind of comparison...,"I knew I wanted to watch this film, but before doing so I had been asking myself a question: ""Will I able to write about 'The Illusionist' without comparing it to 'The Prestige'? Now I know the answer; which is yes. However, a friend of mine asked me to do a kind of comparison; that's why I'll highlight some information as I write about ""The Illusionist"" on its own.First of all, in my opinion ""The Prestige"" is better than ""The Illusionist"", but apart from the fact that both contain a person doing magic on a stage, they are very different films. Mainly, the first one is the story of a rivalry; this movie is the story of a romance. As I said, slight kind of comparisons so that they don't take over the review.Without revealing too much, ""The Illusionist"" the story of Edward, a peasant who later becomes a wizard (or however you may call it) and, as a young man, falls in love with a Dutchess (Jessica Biel). This we all learn from words spoken by Inspector Ull (a fantastic Paul Giamatti), who is telling the wizard's (now known as Eisenheim) life to the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) after an apparent arrest.Now, when the story is told, the camera darkens the corners of the main image, so we can be transported to the past. The picture looks beautiful with its predominant light brownish tone (accompanied by Philip Glass's haunting score), still kept when things seem to go back to the present; and with the black screen closing up as a little circle as in old films. But if I have to be objective, something basically doesn't fit: and it is that the story told by the Inspector (which constitutes the film) has facts of no interest or of previous knowledge to the listener, the Prince; which would make it sort of useless for him to listen to the 'whole' story.Maybe this comes from the fact that the screenplay, by the director Neil Burger, is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser that, as a film, runs long at 100 minutes. While undoubtedly a good film, it's betrayed by two bland performances of the young actors who fail to transmit the main romance the film deals with.This is mended by the performances of the older actors, though. Edward Norton is, once more, totally immersed in his character, obtaining (once more) a very peculiar accent and a good use of body language. There's a scene after the lovers meet again, where Eisenheim is invited to the Prince's house to perform and, in order to make the Dutchess recognize him, he says something. It's not only what he says, but also the way Norton looks at her as he says it and then again when she looks back; is a little detail of Norton's mastery.And the way Jessica Biel looks back, only in that exact moment, proves that she was a good choice for the role; even when a big number of actresses could have done it better.At last, the twistI'm not giving anything away here, but we live in a time where when a movie has a twist, it is not ruined or given away; but it is mentioned. It is not likely that someone who hasn't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"" rents the film without knowing there's a twist.Well, you may remember ""The Prestige"" has a twist; ""The Illusionist"" also has one. The way I see it, in ""The Prestige"" the twist generates a big impact: you're blown away and you can't believe it; while in ""The Illusionist"" the twist is too much to take in at the moment it is presented. Think about that when you watch the film; and also think if ""The Illusionist"" would have done better without the twist (because I do) and if you want to watch it again when it finishes (because I didn't), like with ""The Prestige"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Finely a well written and acted movie.,"My wife and I went to see The Illusionist not really knowing what to expect. Well finally a well written story to sit and enjoy for nearly two hours. The cast which included Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, were very good and Jessica Biel was adequate in her part as the love interest. This movie had a surprise ending which I will not tell you about, as it would ruin the movie for you. With all the trash that Hollywood is turning out these days it was a relief to see a well written story, and no slapstick acting by some teen age actor. I would recommend this film to anyone who is an adult and enjoys a great story and good acting. Please Hollywood let's have more of this quality film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The original Illusionists,"I agree with those who have said that ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think ""The Prestige"" must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that ""The Illusionist"" is a romantic caper film and ""The Prestige"" is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the ""magic lantern show"", which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Where is the Hoopla for this Top Movie?,"How do these great ones get lost in the hoopla of the losers. This movie runs so smooth that I blinked when it was over and said ""wow""! The ending came as a complete surprise tying up the story in a neat bow. A great story well told without Hollywood's usual harsh language, heavy sex and big bangs. A very pleasant change. There is one blurred, non-invasive sex scene that, I feel, is essential to the plot.The period piece is well costumed. Subdued set colors so as not to detract from the story being told. Every action is well thought out. Moves at an even pace throughout. All the actors mesh. Their characters very believable.""The Illusionist"" is a great movie to see alone or with a friend, male or female.

Entertaining and well crafted -  a little formulaic,"The acting and production was solid. Sewell, Giamatti, Norton and Biel were all excellent. The plot kept my attention - tossing up red herrings and false mysteries and milking them for all they were worth. I can't tell you to what film(s) this owes a heavy debt to without a big spoiler, but I am sure many of you will figure it out.Norton and Biel play childhood sweethearts whose romance has been cut apart by class divisions and a planned arranged marriage. Norton runs off on a quest to discover magic and, in his thirties, returns to Vienna where he almost immediately crosses path with Biel, her jealous and homicidal fiancé (Sewell) and the affable but cynical Inspector under Sewell's thumb (Giamatti). Norton's Magic is so astonishing that nobody can discern how he does it, and eventually, it becomes apparent that the real mystery is not the identity of the murderer, but the methods of the illusionist.The film is clever and manipulative, and does a pretty good job of distracting its audience from the the very question which actually drives the plot. That said, there are problems with believability which don't really detract from the entertainment experience. Recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Quite dull, don't bother.","If you saw The Prestige, prepare yourself for an inferior movie. Sure, The Illusionist sounds promising... the magician, the magic tricks, Edward Norton, the love story... you'd be forgiven for expecting a good night at the movies.Unfortunately it ends up a dull night at the movies if your movie tastes are at least average. For one thing, we're asked to suspend too much belief - with unremarkable film effects standing in for any realistic conveying of ""genuine"" magic. You'll find yourself thinking, ""oh, it's *that* sort of movie""...meaning cheesy impossible supernatural stuff -- things floating in mid air etc.. which is not clever or interesting.The Prestige is so much darker and complex. The characters have grit, passion, realism; the story and script more exciting, surprising and refined. Even though we're asked to believe in something quite impossible in The Prestige, it pulls it off somehow. The Illusionist doesn't pull anything off, and lacks most qualities your keen movie appreciation is tuned for.Cinematography was fine. The acting was mostly OK if a little dry... it was the story and screenplay / dialog that was shackled - never shifting into second gear. There are no satisfying narrative developments... you won't care for these characters much at all, and any plot twists that may happen, arrive with a clumsy thud and don't do anything to lift the film's spirits (pardon the pun).4 / 10",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Great film - highly recommended,"I didn't know what to expect going into this film mainly because I'd heard virtually nothing about it. I am an Edward Norton & Paul Giamatti fan so thought I'd give it a whirl. I was very pleased that I did. This film was very well done. I loved the cinematic scenery, the filming was done to make you feel as if you were there. The colors were subdued & bright when the audience was viewing the court scenes. Paul Giamatti was brilliant as the Chief Inspector. You could tell from his performance that he was torn between his duty & the truth. Edward Norton, as ever, was also brilliant. His performance was powerful & breathtakingly real. Watching his do his sorcery was almost frightening. I could feel why the audience was aghast. The imagery throughout the film kep your attention. The countryside was beautiful. Jennifer Beals did an adequate job as the Duchess. However I couldn't wait to see more of Edward Norton or Paul Giamatti.

Romantic intrigue in period piece,"I rushed to see the Illusionist for I am a fan of Paul Giamatti, Edward Norton and also Jessica Biel. Good actors, an incredibly interesting script, and a setting to take us away from our daily grind here in the 21st century all spelled great to me. I read many terrific review but there was little exposure at movie theaters. This is my greatest complaint .... these movie gems, romantic period pieces, lush acting and settings are not blockbusters like say Chicken Little or Will Farrell as a dumb NASCAR driver.

It's subtle and keeps the story from lurching into something too big for its britches,"Based on Steven Millhauser's short story, Eisenheim the Illusionist, this beautifully shot period piece is fairly hokey and completely predictable. That said, I still had a lot of fun watching it come together.It's a typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story with Edward Norton as Eisenheim, a sleight of hand artist, who falls for the wrong dame, Sophie (Jessica Beal sporting some big choppers and a nice plump heinie in the final shot). She's an aristocrat, way out of his poor boy league. The two are separated by the powers that be, only to be reunited years later when Eisenheim becomes the toast of Vienna and Sophie attends one of his gigs with her almost fiancé Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell doing the darndest Jude-Law-with-ridiculous-mustache impersonation I've ever seen). Also on the scene is Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector Uhl. He's doing his best to maintain law and order while also favoring the Crown Prince in hopes of political advancement.There's lots of intrigue with more than enough special effects to go around. Luckily, Eisenheim's illusions are all flash bang wowzer stuff. It's subtle and keeps the story from lurching into something too big for its britches. This is a little film and, rightly, the tricks are small as well. I enjoyed the old time look of the film (the center of the picture is very clear while the edges seem soft and there is a distinct flicker to some flashback scenes) and was able to overlook the odd ""we're in a foreign country so let's all have English accents"" staple.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Childhood friends, the illusionist (Norton) is separated from the love of his life, Sophie, a Duchess (Biel) while in their teens.

"A beautiful film, but the emotion seems to have vanished!","I could try to explain this movie about a Viennese magician who woos his childhood sweetheart, while mixing it up with Eurocops, royalty, and a greedy stage manager, but it wouldn't do much good. In fact, I am not sure I get the movie. Edward Norton keeps this film afloat, give a suble, yet raw performance as said magician, and Paul Giamatti is clearly enjoying himself as the Chief Eurocop. The writers of this film also deserve huzzahs, for creating the most head-scratching ending since ""The Usual Suspects"". And, as expected of a period film, it sure does look pretty.So what else is great about this film? Not much.Trust me, I am a fan of period epics, but this one moves along at a snail's pace, expecting you to give your attention while the filmakkers set up the plot for 90 minutes, because, after all, it'll all be worth it in the end....right? A great ending is no excuse for the fact that the rest of the film feels high on its self-importance, and steeped in its own ""majesty"".

The directing is perfectly invisible, minus some montagery (this is a good thing for this sort of film) and subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) highlights the emotions and tensions present in the film.There is some tricky writing going on, however, it's not too difficult to guess the plot if you're well read in films or mystery-dramas. And the combination of all these leads to enjoyable and entertaining fare. It's not much more than that, but I don't think it's trying to be.The only criticism I can really level against the film is that, as a mystery film, things are only partially explained in the end. In particular, the whole aspect of the film regarding illusion and magic isn't adequately explained and I can understand why the writer/director didn't want to fully explain it, because it does take away from the magic, but the genre that the film is in dictates that it must be at least explained adequately. If it's magic, tell me so. If it's trickery, show me so. But some of what happens in the movie continues to be unexplained, although to some degree, some explanations are hinted at.Nevertheless, that's the only real criticism I have of the film. It didn't particularly impress or connect with me, but that doesn't make it any less of a worthy effort. You wouldn't go wrong by watching this one. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A brilliant expression of cinematic synergy!!!,"Having always been passingly interested in magic and illusion, I was attracted to this movie from the very start. The list of actors involved served to further arouse my interest and the beautiful design displayed in the trailer was simply the icing on the already tempting cake. Then I saw the movie, and I have now seen all of my expectations proved utterly insufficient! The four main characters are portrayed with complete conviction by their respective players. Edward Norton plays a very cool and reserved Eisenheim. A temperament which seems a departure from some of the other roles I have seen him play. I will also jump on the bandwagon and say that I was happily surprised by the quality of performance by Jessica Biel. Her playing of Sophie was natural and involving. I hope to see more examples of this caliber from her in the future. And, of course and at the risk of being bland, the stunningly apt performances of Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell were treasures which would have been unexpected only by their absence.I have heard complaints regarding the nearly insane attention to detail given to the production design, complaints which my personal aesthetic holds to be totally unfounded. The costume design is not only true to period, but also perfectly suited to both the characters and temper of the situation. The sets are powerfully dramatic in their own right, but used with such skill as to utilize that drama for the enhancement of mood without upstaging the players upon them. Likewise the score by Phillip Glass served to help steer the course of emotions in this film while also serving as a moderator to pace throughout the film. The lighting, filters, and de-focusing of the edges of the frame served to complete the nearly nostalgic experience.As for the illusions themselves, while others picked at them and other details of the film its self, I was contented to simply be entertained and at times amazed by them. It is true that faults can be found in the construction of the film if one looks for them. But if you keep your eye on the film-makers hand, and let the film progress in its own way, then you may be tricked, but you will leave the theatre the more delighted for it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
disappearing Act...,"Jessica Biehl is one of the most beautiful actresses working today. She has a fine healthy physique, long gorgeous blonde hair, medium sized pouty lips and seductive eyes that pull you in dry the manhood out of you. I didn't know what to expect from her in a period piece, I didn't know what to expect of this film. I had heard it was good, but you can never really trust reviews. But I can now lay my fears to rest. Both are good. Jessica Biehl shows her versatility as an actress while portraying the object of two man's separate desires one for love, the other for possession. Her performance is immediate and plausible. The film itself is good, not great. It presents a layered storyline setup as an illusionists magic trick. As the film moves along we are introduced to plot twists, character revelations, none of which are too surprising. But still confident and skillfully executed. Biehl and Nortons chemistry is so-so. But solo they both do quite well in the film. The love story isn't as involving as the film makers would like it to be. But the suspense is. The film is well done, shot beautifully with wonderful costumes and good performances. The direction is confident without being smarmy but isn't very inventive either. The films pacing is a bit long but never dull. In the end the film is a solid good effort for all involved but despite Jessica Biehl's surprisingly confident turn the film is like one of it's characters magic tricks. Plausible when your watching but ultimately it's nothing more than a disappearing act. A little more involvement on the character level would have made it much more memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A disappointment compared to 'The Prestige',"What a shame that two magic-related films were released at approximately the same time, and that this one came first in the US, deterring cinephiles from checking out Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige,' a far superior film on all counts. Both films are mysteries dealing with a troubled magician and a dead woman in turn-of-the-century Europe, but the similarities stop there.Too bad that the talents of Philip Glass were wasted on this film. The music was excellent, but the only other thing this film has going for it is the scenery. The plot is lame and unoriginal. The love story and characters are hardly developed to render them believable. The script is terrible. The accents are ridiculous. What are these people, British or Austrian? Or, like the messenger kid at the end of the film, American?Not much could really be expected from Jessica Biel, but even Norton's acting was cringeworthy (notably during the scene where he pulls ""Sophie"" from the water). At least for his part, Giamatti made do with the lousy script, like he had to in 'Lady in the Water.'The kids might appreciate the fairly elementary plot and simple language of 'The Illusionist' like they would be amazed by sleight-of-hand and card tricks. However, adults, don't bother with this film - get 'The Prestige' for a real magic show: a skillfully crafted, spectacularly entertaining mystery/thriller.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
So good I watched it over again.,"Sometimes, when a movie (on DVD) is particularly interesting and thought provoking, I watch parts of it over with director's comments turned on. In the case of ""The Illusionist"" my wife and I watched the entire movie over to hear the director's comments.Clearly, as some critics complain, some of the illusions could not be done as shown in the movie (and certainly not in 1900) and the director admits he took some illusions that actually were done during the movie's time period and added to them to provide an enhanced movie effect. But, that is really picking nits in this case because the basic illusions themselves would have been adequate, in the real world, to provoke a similar response. In fact, many illusionists throughout history have done exactly that.Some reviewers compare this movie to ""The Prestige"" because they are both about illusions. That is like comparing ""Saving Private Ryan"" with ""Apocalypse Now"" because they are both about war. In ""The Illusionist"" illusions are the means to an end. In ""The Prestige"" the illusions are the end.The theme of this movie is that in the minds of most people, there is a fine line between illusion and reality  one need only hear discussions (such as they are) of renewable energy, nuclear power, or global warming to verify the truth in that  and writer/director Neil Burger uses a story of star-crossed lovers (a relationship which, interestingly enough, is not in the original story on which this movie is based) and Eisenheim's (Edward Norton) determination to be with his love, if only in death, as the framework for that theme. At one point in the movie (no spoiler here) the question of whether the visions Eisenheim has produced are illusion or reality is being discussed when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) states that it doesn't matter  the result is the same.Such, according to Burger, is the nature of the mind. It is often stated - and, incredibly, many people seem to be believe - that perception is reality.Edward Norton is the perfect actor for this role. Norton may have no peer when it comes to using nothing but facial expressions (or lack of same) to convey thoughts and feelings, and that is all-important in this film. It is politically, and legally, necessary that Eisenheim not make claims that could be used against him, so he conveys his thoughts with body (mostly facial) language that is so strong that one feels that words have been said that, in fact, were never spoken. Similarly, he can disclaim, with strong words, any special powers knowing that the people who hear those words will continue to believe the powers exist. I did not think Paul Giamatti was right for the role of the police chief, but he handles it adequately, which is all that is necessary. Similarly, the much-maligned Jessica Biel handles her undemanding role quite well. I was surprised to hear the director say in the commentary that there was some concern about using her in the film since neither Norton nor Giamatti ""suffer fools"" very well. He said it in praise, however, because he thought Norton and Giamatti accorded her the respect they would only give to a competent performer.But, this is Norton's movie. He is great in it and makes it a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Terrific, and that's no Illusion.","""The Illusionist"" is a terrific film. It is no illusion to the audience to appreciate a work of art such as this. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, the Houdini of his time. He is convincing in the role, and very adept in captivating his actor audience as well as those in the cinema. His eyes are piercing. His gesticulations are perfection. Paul Giamatti stars as the Chief Inspector Uhl, who unravels the mystery with an energetic stance. Jessica Biel plays, Sophie, the lovely heroine responsible for the tricky plot. I prefer to allow the film going public to absorb the story on their rather than spoil any of its finely tuned twists. One cannot become the least bit bored because the attention is constantly on the slight of hand of the magical hero. Don't miss this movie. It is a real winner. And that is no illusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Full of intrigue and very engaging, but lacks the focus needed to be a truly great film","It only seemed a matter of time before the genre of magic, specifically in an era outside of our own, was seized by Hollywood hands with ""The Illusionist"" and soon ""Batman Begins"" director Christopher Nolan's upcoming ""The Prestige."" With CGI to make magic seem even more eerily believable, what audience doesn't love magic? ""Illiusionist"" takes advantage of this fact, mesmerizing the audience and intriguing them with the thought that the illusions might actually be possible. The problem is that the film sometimes lets this get in the way with the real human element of the film, the love story, which is supposed to be the most important part.Edward Norton's character Eisenheim the Illusionist is merely a talented magician who after many years encounters his childhood sweetheart, Sophie (Jessica Biel), a girl of the upper class with which Eisenhiem is unfortunately not affiliated. The problem is that Sophie is nearly engaged to the Crown Prince of Vienna (Rufus Sewell). The Crown Prince's interest in magic reunites the two, who fall back in love. When Eisenheim sacrifices some of the prince's dignity for the sake of his magic, the prince requests that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) do what he must to bring Eisenheim down. The two lovers then find themselves in a situation bound to tear them apart.Love, therefore, becomes the motivation for nearly all Norton's actions, but we see the plot instead being driven by the film's other conflicts, namely Giamatti's character's internal conflict between his allegiance to the prince and the truth. He seems to take over the protagonists role at a point during the film. We also get to see very little of the romance that drives the film aside from a couple of scenes that this motivation gets blurred.While these other elements that distract are entertaining and meaningful, the story's ability to grab the viewer's heartstrings is muffled. It's all very interesting from the illusions themselves to the mystery at hand, but the extra step needed for the film to flourish is a true grasp of the love story. You'll be intrigued and entertained, which is sometimes all you need, but the film cheats itself out of the opportunity to be a real sleeper.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
GREAT movie,"Please understand, I usually like anything Edward Norton does, but this movie was really intriguing. Great twists, great acting by all of the cast, and a great story and plot. This movie got such little press I hadn't even heard of it when I went to see it, but it was very refreshing to see a movie I can't stop talking about (which is rare these days). Jessica Biel does an amazing job and Paul Giomatti's (sp?) acting only seems to get better and better lately. Ed Norton was amazing as well, but then again, when isn't he?

It had beautiful cinematography and excellent acting. It was engaging, and the ending was very satisfying. The Grand Illusion of the Illusionist is worth seeing.

Interesting story with good acting and costumes.,"My friend recommended this film to me saying it reminded him of Now You See Me, though I don't see much of a correlation except for the magical element. The story is not that focused on the magical element though that does play a big part in creating the illusion of the film.The acting is great, with the chemistry sizzling between Norton and Biel. Norton carries his character well and his charisma shines through the screen. Biel too does great in her role and with the costumes smoothly fits into that time era. What really shines as well is the acting by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Eleanor Tomlinson who play the young versions of Eisenheim and Sophie. The emotions they convey transcend the screen and feel pretty authentic.The setting of the film creates a nice atmosphere that complements the time period they are depicting. The colours have a very reminiscent feel to them with brownish and dark colours illustrating the past era. The costumes too are elegant and classy with long trench coats for the men and frilly dresses for the women- though the only female character in the film is pretty much Sophie. My goodness, I had a pretty big problem with that. Sophie was the only female character who was kind of like the other protagonist, but then she doesn't get much screen time. What. I was flipping out a little. Adding to that, I was a little peeved at the introduction of Asian characters who didn't speak and only served as muscle power.The story itself though is not entirely unpredictable, is still quite fascinating. However, I wished the film had shown more magical tricks, instead of focusing so much on the romance line. Also, the film cuts through the chronological order quite a bit which for the most part helped in creating the mystery of the story, but some bits were still a little confusing to match the events altogether.Overall though it was still a well made film with great acting and an interesting storyline.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Illusionist,"I thought that the movie must be good because it was made from the producers of ""The Crash"".The movie is a love-story about a young carpenter boy who is in love with a duchess, but is separated. He comes back as a reputed magician when the duchess is about to marry a prince - a 'to become' emperor. The director tries to bring in the romance, suspense, love, hate, jealousy, arrogance and ego in divulging the nuances of various characters. I think to a certain extend he succeeds  but to a major part of the film he does not. Most of the actors are over-board in their expressions; especially the main lead Edward Norton  who is as wooden face as one could be. The only interest arises in the film when Rufus Sewell with his negative performance as the prince is on the screen  even though he also is at times overboard in his acting. A little mention is required of Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector who builds up an interesting character; but again overacts.Does the magician manage to get his childhood girlfriend back is the question. The director builds up the suspense and in the last 5 minutes discloses it so rapidly that we as audience are left short of fulfillment. The set up of the movie is in the late 19th century  which is well captured. All the magic tricks shown are unusual and only appeals at the moment of seeing it on screen, but does not convince the audience. Knowing that it was not the mandate of the director to show the techniques behind some tricks, but when the suspense is hastily disclosed there are so many questions unanswered  on how did the hero manage to perform such a feat.Not much more to say.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Wonderful story, good magic","Understand that when I write this, I'm biased. I'm not only a professional magician, but my act is such that I perform as a Victorian-era magician. I've done tons of reading and research on the period, not to mention the type of magic that was performed, so that's really the direction that I'm coming from. That said, I'll start with the story. I felt that the story was interesting and compelling enough to keep my attention, though I did feel that it began to drag in the last hour. I liked the way that the director made you feel the transition with Eisenheim after the situation with Sophie. You could feel his mood change. I also felt that this was probably the best performance I've ever seen from Paul Giamatti. If he doesn't at least get a nomination for best supporting actor, I'll be sorely disappointed. His portrayal of the Chief Inspector that is torn between his admiration of Eisenheim and his loyalty to a corrupt monarch was simply brilliant! Now, I'll review it as a magician...it would have been nice to have seen the magic as it was actually performed in the Victorian era, but you can't win 'em all. The fact that they used Robert-Houdin's Orange Tree, then did it with ""movie magic"" instead of the way that Robert-Houdin did it in the 1850's was a bit disappointing...but didn't ruin the story for me. Great movie, highly recommended.Rick",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Wonderful Fable of Love and Illusion,"In the turn of the Twentieth Century, in Vienna, the teenager Eduard Abramovich is the son of a cabinetmaker that becomes fascinated with magic. While practicing some tricks on the streets, he meets the upper-class Sophie, they become friends and later they fall in love for each other. When they are separated by Sophie's family, the broken-hearted Eduard travels to the Far East and fifteen years later he returns to Vienna as a famous illusionist with a different name, Eisenheim (Edward Norton). While performing a show in the presence of the ambitious and ruthless Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the corrupt Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), Sophie (Jessica Biel) volunteers for a trick on the stage and they immediately recognize each other. The flame of their passion bursts, but Sophie is engaged of Leopold, as part of his political game to be crowned king with the support of Hungary in a coup d'état against his father. Sophie and Eisenheim plan to runaway together, but when the drunken Leopold discloses their intention, he apparently kills Sophie. The grieving Eisenheim brings his Chinese acquaintances and performs an amazing show, where nothing is what it seems.""The Illusionist"" is a wonderful fable of love and illusion, one of the best movies I have recently seen. The original and excellent story is disclosed in an intelligent screenplay, magnificent cinematography and beautiful music score. The direction is stunning and the performances are fantastic, highlighting Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti in an upper level, immediately followed by Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel, who shows a great chemistry with Edward Norton. The twist is spectacular, and after watching this great movie, I realized how dirty the political game in the Oscar is, where nothing is what it seems, selecting ""The Departed"" as Best Movie just because of the name of Martin ""obsessed for Oscar"" Scosese. Honestly, there is no comparison between the boring, unrealistic and overrated ""The Departed"" and this overwhelming and mesmerizing ""The Illusionist"".

When every second movie maker wants to open your eyes to the real meaning of your existence and every first one just tries to make money it's wonderful to meet a director who's just trying to grow an orange tree from a single seed, one who, if we forget ourselves, gracefully shows us the invisible line where his mastery ends and our stupidity begins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"A rare, but excellent movie-going treat","The popularity of the average magician is fading away into obscurity. No longer are they amongst the most popular celebrities out there like in the much older days centuries ago. A good magician film is even harder to find. With technology progressing the way it does nowadays, it is even harder to craft a good magician film without it being overblown or revealed with special effects. The Illusionist however, is a diamond in the rough, a rare exception in which when special effects is required, it delivers, but in such small doses that the magic comes off as almost believable. To add to the stunning visual effects is a magnificent score, an emotional love story, a murder mystery, suspense, drama, great writing, decent directing, and magnificent cinematography. Emerging almost out of nowhere back in 2006, it has become a surprise hit and with good reason too.The Illusionist follows the life of a controversial magician by the name of Eisenheim (Edward Norton) that has a very unique and special gift that allows for him to do things that other people only dream about being able to do. But, despite his talents, his position in the social circle of Europe prevents him from getting a certain amount of respect. What's worse is that his love (Jessica Biel) just happens to be higher up in the social ladder, and it would be almost impossible for them to be together. Using his talents, his wits, and persistence, he tries to win his dream girl Sophie and stay away from the troubles of a corrupt inspector (Paul Giamatti) and the crown prince (Rufus Sewell).What else is there to say about this film? Its woven together beautifully and presented magnificently. We'll start by praising the acting. Edward Norton, whose previous work has proved his ability as a superb actor (Especially Fight Club), shines yet again as the main character. You can almost feel his sorrow, his despair when he is at his emotional low points. Jessica Biel, despite her start at a mediocre family dramedy, does a swell job as Eisenheim's love interest. Mixing her natural beauty with vulnerability in her eyes Biel is impressive as a woman stuck in a world she obviously doesn't belong in. Surpassing them both is Paul Giamatti, whose work has quite a range (Big Fat Liar, Big Momma's House, Sideways), yet nails it home portraying the calm yet rather lost Inspector Uhl.Continuing on the praise express, the next stop is congratulating the writer for lacing a great screenplay out of a relatively unknown short story. Full of details, plot twists, mysteries, and tense moments, you as the audience are left mesmerized and unaware of what is about to happen next. Taking advantage of a fine script, the director (Neil Burger, who happens to be the writer as well) and cinematographer (Dick Pope) capture all the majesty and mastery of our main character and the unsolved questions of the conflicts by displaying beautiful scenery, a knack for tone, and the ability to drop off little clues and fine points as the movie charges along from one scene to the next. Also helping progress The Illusionist is the original score of Philip Glass, which stands as one of the best composers in Hollywood today.The third act is where everything falls into play and the true abilities of everyone involved is revealed. In the third act, we see the best in directing, music, acting, and writing, as the ending comes almost out of nowhere but comes off as so refreshing, you cannot help but have a smile on your face as the credits roll. Unlike most films, the final moments of the movie rewards the audience by revealing the tricks that not only the magician but also the director had pulled right in front of your eyes. The Illusionist serves as a piece of work that is a magic trick: there is the teaser, the scenario, and then before you know it, the magic.Bottom Line: A nice movie that exceeded expectations and stunned critics and audiences alike, The Illusionist serves as a unique movie going experience that is quite captivating and entertaining to watch. With a hint of mystery with romance, drama, suspense, and themes of love, fate, and life against death, this serves as one of 2006's biggest and most underrated surprises. Firing on all cylinders and hitting the mark quality-wise in all aspects of film-making, it's really hard to find something wrong with this picture. Morality issues may be sparking once the film is done, but in terms of technical issues and directing techniques, there's very, very little to complain about here. Highly recommend, hopefully we'll see more of Neil Burger in the near future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Little Hocus Pocus mit Your Strudel?,"""The Illusionist"" is a fun bit of mitteleuropa fluff. There's lots of pretty sets from the Czech Republic, both architecture and pastoral scenes.Paul Giamatti as a police officer gives us yet another masterful performance. He was convincing as a drunk in ""Sideways,"" as a boxing manager in ""Cinderella Man,"" and he's convincing here as a Viennese cop from a common background trying to reach the top of society by carrying out the will of the powerful but not destroying a magician for whom he feels some sympathy.Jessica Biel is really lovely as an aristocrat torn between family duty and true love. Unlike too many other actresses her age, Biel really convinces that she is of another era. There is nothing of the jarringly anachronistic twenty-first century mall rat, valley girl, or post-feminist about her performance. She fills out her lush costumes with both her body and her soul.Rufus Sewell is so good as the evil Crown Prince Leopold that I wish that there were a slew of Hapsburg movies in the pipe so we could boo and hiss him again and again. Let's make a movie version of ""Janosik"" or ""Good Soldier Svejk"" or remake ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" just to keep Rufus Sewell in that costume, toting that sword, screaming those lines.Ed Norton has his champions; I don't get it. I think he's fine, of course, but I'm not all gaga about him the way some are. He's good here as a magician / lover / trickster, but he didn't take my breath away.Philip Glass' score was fun, in places, in that it reflected mitteleuropean music, but there weren't enough over the top moments, and mitteleuropean music is all about going over the top, in terms of technical aspects like tempo and emotional aspects like schmaltz. Also, one wishes that Glass had made use of instruments other than violins and the occasional flute. A cimbolom, for example, a zither, or a Slovak fujara. The score for ""The Third Man"" has not been bested as the most memorable mitteleuropean-influenced film score.The story, of Eisenheim, a magician who bests the world around him through his wits, is reminiscent of Jewish folktales in which a very clever Jewish man outwits his better-armed, Gentile opponents. The movie doesn't make much of these cultural resonances.Also, I wonder about ""Eisenheim""'s similarity to ""Einstein."" In one of his onstage tricks, Eisenheim creates the illusion of an orange tree growing from seed to maturity in a few moments. He introduces this trick by talking about the relativity of time, which, of course, brings Einstein to mind. Again, the movie does not dwell on this.As much as I liked this movie, I wish it had been richer. The real mitteleuropean world it depicts is a busy, lively, crowded, warm, complex one; I wish some of that had made its way onto the screen. The movie is slow, and not the good kind of slow. Its slowness could have been livened up with more on screen -- why not give Giamatti a peasant lover in embroidered aprons who could provide some depth to scenes that consist, only, of Giamatti staring ahead, looking dumbfounded, as he tries to figure something out? Otherwise, though, ""The Illusionist"" is a fun and pleasant movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"A taut, romantic drama","Edward Norton as the illusionist ""Eisenheim"" gives us a delightful  hero. To our modern day eye, it is easy to slip and think of his  appearance as a cliché, but it is completely in keeping with the  fashions of the time period for both men of Europe and, in particular,  magicians. Full evening attire was the norm for a stage magician.  Two elements were particularly fun for this former professional  magician and history buff. First and foremost, the fine line that magic  walked during the 19th and early 20th century (and before, technically,  but trust me, it came to head with the scientific advances and  discoveries of the late 1800's). During that time period, magicians  were simply fooling audiences in much the same ways as they are today,  yet the general population was much closer to the old beliefs and  superstitions. Magic was an affront to science, though ironically, in  its actual workings, it was more a celebration of science. Secondly, an  element that is the focal point of the movie ""The Prestige,"" and that  is, the close guarding of secrets.  While not all of the illusions presented are as faithful to real life  as ""The Prestige,"" it's close enough that it works. I saw nothing  presented that could not be roughly duplicated (or actually was done)  at the time.  The ending is, well, truly satisfying. Sit down with your spouse, grab  the popcorn, get past the rather odd beginning (which sets the pace and  tone of the movie very well), and get ready for a GREAT movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist will leave you spellbound,"The illusionist is a wonderful film that once you begin watching you will not be able to take your eyes away from the screen. Starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamotti, the two played well off of each other. You will also be mesmerized at how well the set director captured the essence of this period piece. Neil Burger, the director, does an outstanding job of addressing every detail of attention to the set designs and costumes of this fantasy-mystery- romance-drama combination set in Vienna, Austria, around the turn of the 20th century. I love the way this movie takes it's time to build character drama and suspense; it's a slow burn but when it catches fire, it really sizzles. You will be dazzled by this story of an understated but brilliant illusionist, a vile and ruthless crowned prince, and the righteous compassionate police inspector who is caught in the middle of the two.

To date he has only directed one other feature film, Interview With An Assassin, a fictional account of the real shooter of the JFK assassination, which I had the chance of watching it on DVD some time back. Comparing production values, it's a great leap forward for Burger, having now directed a movie starring heavyweight character actors Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti.Adapted from a short story by writer Steven Millhauser called Eisenheim the Illusionist, this movie made its debut at last year's Sundance Film Festival, and was supposed to have premiered locally at around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. However, I suspect that distributors might have thought the pairing of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, excellent actors in their own right, would find it tough against competition in Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, who in today's context, are instantly recognizable and appealing because of their successful comic book movie roles in Batman and X-Men respectively.In reality, comparing The Illusionist to The Prestige is comparing apples to oranges. The only similarities they share are their occupation - practitioners of magic, and coupled with immense knowledge of science and technology. Although period movies, they share similar eras, but are based in separate locations - this one in Vienna, the other in London. At its core, The Prestige is one solid movie about obsession and revenge, but The Illusionist is surprisingly, for all its moodiness displayed in the trailer, it's all about love.Edward Norton is Eisenheim, top illusionist whom some say he dabbles in the dark arts and sold his soul to the devil. Watching what he could do, you'll probably be more inclined to agree. After having lost his love due to a difference in class, he meets up with Sophie (Jessica Biel) again, although this time she's about to get engaged to Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Hence the dilemma, and now, an opportunity to try and get his girl.It's a beautifully filmed movie, and I marvel at the cinematography and techniques to date this movie to the early silent movie era. The production values are top notch, with costumes, makeup and special effects which, though simple, deserve special mention as they just worked brilliantly to enhance the viewing experience. The magic here is ""magic"" in that sense of the word, and doesn't try to obsess itself with trying to explain the plausibility behind every trick. And yes, there are more magic here, if that's your cup of tea (though of course, aided by cinematic movie making tricks).But what I thought really did the trick (pardon the pun), was Paul Giamatti's character Chief Inspector Uhl, as the man caught in the middle of a moral dilemma. Through his eyes, we see the corruption of those in power, and when put in a position where you are reliant on that power, how it could serve to confuse, whether to betray your values for material wealth and status, or to do what is right. Edward Norton is not as muted here as his other movie also now showing in Singapore - The Painted Veil, and although his Eisenheim is strictly focused on his goals, his intense fixation somehow diluted the complexity of his character somewhat. Jessica Biel unfortunately is the weak link here, as is Rufus Sewell as he struggles through his yet-another-villain role which doesn't offer much range besides snarling and being nasty.Before you pass judgement during the movie's plot development as being too simplistic if compared to The Prestige's, I'd say to hold that thought, and to pay close attention. It's a mixture of drama, mystery and romance, and when all's revealed at the end, somehow it'll just bring a smile to your face, especially so if you're a romantic.I like The Illusionist!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"I Didn't See What Others Saw, But a Great Film Just the Same","A peasant boy grows up to become a great magician (Edward Norton). But his childhood love (Jessica Biel) is now betrothed to the crown prince (Rufus Sewell). Will the magician stand for this? Can any one man stand up against the royal family? Almost everyone I know loved this movie. Some were saying it was much better than ""The Prestige"", while others would point out the cinematography (which I must agree is very nice). I guess I didn't love it as much as many other people, but I freely accept it's a great film.Jessica Biel was wonderful. Let me stress I don't expect much of her. Prior to this film, her best role was probably ""Rules of Attraction"", even though she was mostly just there to be a drunk college girl. Here she is much more and her acting is quite nuanced and refined. Almost the best of the movie.The best, though, goes to Paul Giamatti, who seems to make everything he touches turn to gold. He couldn't save ""Lady in the Water"" (who could?) but he was no less awesome in it. And ""Sideways""? Wow! But here, he does a very low-key acting where he doesn't have a lot of range, but seems to make the small range even more dramatic than a character with large range. Compare Rufus Sewell (the crown prince) who is an overlooked actor and has good range here. Giamatti out-acts him, even though he does considerably less.Edward Norton, always great, seems less than his best here. It's no ""Fight Club"" or ""American History X"". My friend who says that this film is better than ""The Prestige"" cites Norton as being better than Christian Bale. Maybe on his best days, but Norton here is nothing compared to Bale. Further, why I preferred the ""Prestige"" is that it seemed more realistic and plausible to me, whereas this relies on very different magic (and is done with poor CGI). I prefer a film where I can feel I'm supposed to accept the premises.In all fairness, the two films are very different (aside from the magician thing) and shouldn't be compared. The Illusionist is a beautifully crafted film, with all the scenes framed perfectly, lit perfectly and given a texture that cannot easily be found elsewhere. If you don't watch it for a movie (even though you should) watch it for a piece of art. Really worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The best movie that ed norton has done since The 25th Hour,"Of being a Ed Norton fan I was very excited about seeing this movie even though I had to travel 45 minutes away to see it. I was expecting a great movie but I never though the whole theater was going to applaud at the end. This movie was that good. Paul Giamatti also did an excellent job as he too is one of my favorites. Jessica Beil even was great and before she was one of the reasons for me to not see the movie.The movie started off with credits that worked very well with dissolves that were beautifully done and gave the movie a great start. Than it showed Ed Norton in a chair, just chilling there. Then he gets arrested. But why does he get arrested? The directer doesn't tell you right off the bat.The movie also describes the illusionist's childhood with a great flashback of how he met his first love and why she was taken away from him. It also describes why he became a magician.The magic / illusions that was performed in this movie was very well done and I'm trying to figure out how the did them from the great camera work that was credited to the film. Understanding that Neil Buger hasn't had much of a resume in the past really surprised me and I know there will be a lot more work for him in the future.This film can be scene by mature children from a brief sex scene (no nudity). The best thing I can tell you about this movie is that there is a twist at the end, and it should make you smile. Perhaps not a Primal Fear twist but enough to keep you talking for the ride home.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist,The Illusionist is a film that came out at same year as far more known Prestige did and i think like many others that such thing did ruined bigger sucess of this film and it was left overshadowed by Nolan film.Dont get me wrong i still bealive that Prestige is better film but this one was also one very fun watch and it had cool romantic story and feel about it mixed with some good twist in end.Norton was here great and so were Giamatti and Taylor Johnson.Illusionist is a good film about magic and love,7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Some have torn it apart for being ""boring"". I wasn't bored for one moment in this movie. Ed Norton was *stunning*. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. He underplayed his character brilliantly. Jessica Biel was also delightful and for once it was excellent to see real chemistry between the two leads in a movie.While I had the movie figured out, I wasn't disappointed by that.

You'll enjoy slapping yourself,"""The Illusionist"" (2006): With good acting, stylish photography harking back to another era, a film score that's moody and effective (by Philip Glass doing what he DOES do well), and a plot that only gets more and more interesting as it goes along. This is one good piece of entertainment. Is it a ""morality"" tale? Barely. It's a romance and a crime mystery. It has political intrigue, good and bad guys, and plenty of tricks up its sleeves. You will NOT see the complexity as it builds, partly due to its not being available, but partly because it's slipped to you just a little at a time, and not in ways that calls attention to itself. Fortunately, the web of deceit is reviewed by a former foe at the end, and you'll enjoy slapping your forehead right along with him.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Beautiful pictures and music, predictable story","I loved the Czech scenery and architecture (both buildings and rooms). These backgrounds combined with Glass' music and Norton's mysterious character do an astounding job of setting the mood. Giamatti does a great job and really brings the inspector character alive. Jessica looks fantastic (her part doesn't need or get too much of an acting performance).However... the story was amazingly predictable -- at least to me. Based on audience conversations I overheard afterwards, some others were more successful at leaving their brains at the door than I was.With all that said, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it for all the things in the first paragraph.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
failed attempt at making a clever movie,"First of all this movie is very cheesy and clichéd; the music, the sappy love-story, the good guy, the bad guy etc. The basic story is a boring and predictable lady-and-the-tramp tale, forbidden love, Romeo and Juliet etc. It's been done to death by now.Secondly the characters are one-dimensional. There's Eisenheim who's torn apart from Sophie by the powers that be, an underdog but with a gift for illusions. By the way, the magic tricks seem totally impossible to perform, let alone in those days.. But who cares because he's the good guy, let's all cheer, yay! Then there's Leopold, he hunts animals for trophies, gets drunk and hits his fiancée. Let's all boo the bad guy, boo! It's like a cartoon, Eisenheim could be Popeye fighting Brutus (Leopold) because he kidnapped Olive Oyl (Sophie).And finally there's the surprise ending, which didn't fit with the rest of the movie at all. I won't give away the ending but when you really think about what the ""good-guy"" did to the ""bad-guy"".. It seems to me very immoral and evil, yet it's presented as if it's a great thing.In short, a boring movie with a strange tagged-on ending.

"Excellent movie--dramatic, captivating, and just plain awesome.","This is my first movie comment, so if I'm doing it wrong...my bad.Although the only reason I went to see this movie was because there was nothing else to see, I was VERY surprised to found out it was wonderful. I was drawn from the very beginning. The ending almost struck me as an interesting spin on Shakespeare, but it turned out to be much, much better than Shakespeare's stuff.I was really blown away by the ending. Some people watching the movie with me, however, were more interested in trying to found out how Eisenheim did his tricks than what was going to happen to him. Eisenheim turns out to be quite a daring man throughout the entire movie. I love his interactions with the Crown Prince, and I'm GOT to get a quote of what he says in the first show. That thing about time. Does anybody out there have it? Anyway. Great movie. GREAT. I'm glad I let my friends drag me to the movies for this one.

"Smoke and mirrors, unsexy romance; pretty scenes","The Illusionist, NYTimes film critic Stephen Holden says, ""rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous."" Maybe. Its grandly staged magic shows in nineteenth-century costume are very pretty. But this fairy tale for adults with its suspenseful but simplistic plot and its feeble finale has you just plain slumbering at times too. To call it ""the miraculous"" is glorifying what Eisenheim the Illusionist does -- just super-good magic tricks that con naïve nineteenth-century audiences in the age of Mesmer and Liszt. And Eisenheim's tricks are inevitably marred, cinematically, by the fact that he's mostly not doing them but having them done for him on film, processed in by the editors and special effects guys.Finally Holden also says this finds a good use for Edward Norton's ""disturbing inscrutability."" Is that what it is, though? Or is it a quality of being technically skilled but cold, mechanical, lacking in presence -- as well as limp in the area of sex appeal? (In fact the movie's sole purveyor of animal attraction is Jessica Biel as Sophie, the noblewoman both the Crown Prince and Eisenheim want. She and Eisenheim were secret teenage sweethearts even though she was an aristocrat and he was a carpenter's son (don't ask). She's sexy, but due to some shortcomings in the acting line she's a bit limp too -- you can't remember anything she says -- but if you look at her lips or her cleavage, that does the much-needed job of giving the screen a pulse.Actually, though Norton is the Illusionist, and his romance with Ms. Biel, revived when he returns from fifteen years of wandering in the Far East, highly dangerous now that she's semi-betrothed to the Crown Prince, is the movie's plot's main focus, still the movie wouldn't get off the ground if it weren't for the fact that Paul Giamatti has an equally important role as the head cop the Prince sends in to hound Eisenheim's footsteps. And that's not enough either: Rufus Sewall in his scene-chewing performance as the obnoxious Crown Prince gives Norton and Giamatti a very necessary run for their money. Put them all together, though, and despite the fact that this is a romance, you still haven't got a single male hearthrob -- not in these roles.Paul Giamatti is an impressively skillful mechanical ""character"" actor -- something that we don't necessarily associate with movie acting, but which movies nonetheless always need. He can deliver any tone or personality, within the limits of his schlubby looks -- which aren't really so confining, given that the world arguably contains more schlubs than Hugh Jackmans. His technical skill and adaptability would mean little if he didn't have that cuddly, slightly goofy but still smart and competent quality that makes his characters believable, sympathetic, and fun to watch. There's always an edge of a twinkle in Paul's face, when he's working well. There's the bustle of the buffoon in him. He's best as an amiable loser, as he is as Harvey Pekar in American Splendor and as Miles in Sideways, his best roles to date, not to say immortal ones. Since then he has gone on to bigger and better checks, but not better acting opportunities or as good movies, though his work is always admirable and he brings palpable enthusiasm to his work. He inhabits Herr Uhl, the Viennese chief inspector of police he has to play in The Illusionist, as convincingly as ever, but the man is such a dutiful and serious good-boy-in-school type, that when the laughs come they tend to seem unintentional.Rufus Sewall, another versatile character actor whose looks give him the embarrassing additional option of being a leading man, is trying so hard to be strange and unpleasant and scary as Crown Prince Leopold, with his big dark over-precise moustache and thin parenthetical made-up looking eyebrows, that his looks in modern terms are so effete as to make him seem ""gay."" Compare Pascal Greggory as Jean Hervey in Patrice Chéreau's Gabrielle, a similarly effete character who's so subtly done he becomes complex and tragic. Sewall's Leopold is obtrusive, joining into the magic show at Eisenheim's command performance at court to his own embarrassment; but Leopold's menace in Biel's stiff staging seems a bit theatrical and empty. The worst thing he does on screen (to anybody else, anyway) is smack a lady, despite his wearing a sword and brandishing a pistol. The way he meets his end isn't surprising. Before that he has long turned into a barking stick figure. If only Sewall had been encouraged to play the Prince straighter (in both senses) and more vulnerable, the character would have been more interesting and the story would have had more subtlety.Simplistic and greeting-card conventional as it is, The Illusionist is a good-looking movie in a traditional costume-pic sort of way, and you have the feeling it actually was probably shot either in Vienna or somewhere that for Americans can pass for Vienna. There are nice street scenes and crowd scenes and the look is glossy without being overbearing or calling attention to itself -- it doesn't surprise you either, though.After the heroine comes to grief, things get messy and a bit confusing, where before they had all been orderly and well-paced. It's not clear what's gone wrong, but bad editing certainly is a factor. The way everything is explained in a montage of flash-shot reviews of past moments doesn't make up for the anticlimax. The Illusionist has a few good scenes, but no high drama. It is not helped by the chilly little voice Norton adopts, perhaps imitating some Forties costume drama, which the director himself may have wished to evoke.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Best movie Ever,"Directed by the relatively unknown Neil Burger (Interview with the assassin), this will simple be the best movie of 2007. It is easily the best movie to have been produced since the turn of the century.

To tell you anything else would be the spoil the way the movie sets itself up, simple it best if you watch it.I will tell you it also start Jessica Biel (7th Heaven), Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Man) and Rufus Sewell (Tristan and Isolde), while you may not recognise their names at the moment you will recognise their faces and they all show that they are indeed quality actors in this piece.I'll not mix words, after seeing this movie it displaces Donnie Darko as my favourite movie ever.

"Fantastic Performances, Imaginative Storyline and Slick Filmaking","What a treat to go to a theater and experience magic. The Illusionist is not a remake, completely original. It's based on a short story that was written by a Pulitzer Prize winning author. The feeling of the movie isn't spooky, its not like a Shyamalan thriller where the music and images intend to shock, although it could have been. Instead the filmmakers let the performances, editing, and strong symbolic and poetic storyline take the audience through the movie. Highly entertaining and imaginative. The time period adds a lot to the picture, as far as the look and feel of the film and the government and belief systems of the people. Beautiful filming with well thought out shots. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti give great performances. They carry the film well. I also appreciate the performance of Rufus Sewell as the Crown Prince, not a recognizable name, but you'll recognize the face. Go see it, too bad my wife and I had to go to an art house theater. Hopefully it wins an award for best screenplay adaptation and that creates some buzz. I can honestly say, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

"Jon Monsarrat review: nice mystery, but lacking stage magic!","The Illusionist is a well-crafted, well-acted romantic drama, that may teach you a little about history. There are some great plot twists, and even though I saw the end coming it was still satisfying. After a stuttering start (too much narration, which is ""tell"", and they always say ""show, don't tell"", right?) the film is very engaging. As usual Edward Norton is fantastic. He is spooky and mysterious, but not too aloof for you to empathize with the Illusionist. He'll win an Oscar one day for sure.I would gladly have given the film an 8 out of 10, but I am settling for 6 for the following reason: there's no prestidigitation in the film. Almost every effect is done with computer graphics, which left me so disappointed. If only they'd started the movie saying something like ""all illusions in this film were recorded without the use of camera tricks or graphics of any kind,"" they would not have had to modify the script and it would have had such a higher impact.Instead, I have to confess that I found myself sitting there thinking, sarcastically, wow, computer graphics, like I've never seen that before. Some actual sleight of hand would have impressed me. I think the cruel fact though is that circa 1890 the true-to-life craftsmanship and technology of that era would simply not have supported illusions that would compete with our 21st century sensibilities. So perhaps they considered that route and discarded it.Finally, I have to confess that I don't understand the success of Paul Giamatti. I guess there must be a lot of people out there who like him, but I find that he's too much of a big huggy bear to play a tough guy like his supporting role in this film.Who should see this movie:-- Mystery film lovers, skip it unless you're big into romance. Guys, this is a safe film to let your girlfriend drag you to. It's not syrupy.-- Amateur magicians, you will be disappointed to find no sleight of hand in the film, although I've heard that Ricky Jay was somehow involved.-- Megalomaniac princes with false-looking mustaches I'll give The Illusionist a near-miss 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A huge disappointment,"This is the movie that is supposed to be the huge competitor of Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige""? This is the movie that received a rating of 7.7 here on IMDb? God, this movie is a joke! I can't believe how many things are wrong with it. This movie about a magician has fallen into every trap ""The Prestige"" avoided. Whereas in Nolan's film all magic tricks are possible at least according to the movie's logic, ""The Illusionist"" makes the magician look like a real wizard. Apparently director Neil Burger wanted to leave it to the viewer to decide whether Norton's character Eisenheim relies on tricks or really has magical powers. That is the first thing that is very lame about ""The Illusionist"".What's worse is the story. Slow, uninteresting, not believable and ultimately completely unsatisfying. In other words, the script is a complete failure.The most shocking thing, however, is the acting. I would never have thought that Edward Norton could be so bad. He stumbles through this movie like an amateur playing his first main role in a high school stage play. Nothing much could be expected from Jessica Biel and she's just about not horrible. Paul Giamatti tried his best to act convincingly but overacted in the end. His constant rolling eyes and his weird ""doubtful, yet intrigued, but always critical"" looks come very close to unintentional comedy. The best performance in this movie was given by Rufus Sewell, but even he couldn't save a character as one dimensional and shallow as Crown Prince Leopold.One positive thing about the movie is the set design. As a person who is living in Vienna I would have loved if they had shot this right here in my hometown, but hey, what the hell. A movie as promising as this one with a cast like this is exciting enough, even if it just pretends to be set in Vienna or so I thought. Well, after having seen ""The Illusionst"" I'm not very excited anymore. This was just a great opportunity wasted. I wouldn't watch it a second time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Hollywood at its best.,"The list of good things to come from the communist period of Russia and East Europe is quite short. At the top of the tiny list is the untouched great parts of cities that are still in a high state of 19th Century preservation.

Add to that a marvelously written script filled with the enchantment of surprise; all told, a delightful, artistic set of Chinese Boxes with a pearl at the center, a genuinely powerful yet socially impossible love. The surrounding outer boxes are the deeply etched characters of the story, the extraordinary photographic treatment and above all, the metaphysical music score of Philip Glass, a composer that has fascinated me from the earliest years of my adult life.This production engages at all levels of appreciation. The outer box is the performances of the two central leads, critically acclaimed actors Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti who beguile us with a masterful balance of nuance and verve.

A neat trick.,"""The Illusionist"" is a beautiful movie, artfully designed to seduce lovers of period pieces and high fantasy (such as myself). It's not particularly deep - nor is it necessarily all that brilliant. But, like any good conjurer's trick, this film is so delightful and entertaining that I think you're a spoilsport if you criticize it for being too insubstantial.The high points are the production design (which is gorgeous) and the acting. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti speak in weirdly soft tones for much of the film, but they manage to convey a wide ranges of emotions anyway, and both of them play very compelling characters. I had no problem with Jessica Biel, either, perhaps because I never saw her ""teen"" movies and I'm not saddled with the preconception that she's a lightweight. Let me put it this way; she's certainly beautiful enough that I understand Norton's obsession with her!Now, about that script. It's actually a bit simple, a bit fanciful. The plot twists are not too hard to predict, if you really want to predict them. But so what? I enjoyed the movie even though I suspected what the ending would probably be. And, unlike many commentators on this site, I didn't feel ""superior"" to the film simply because I figured out the mystery. Sometimes it's fun to watch even a predictable plot unfold.I'm actually glad that Norton made a film like this, because I usually associate him with darker, more downbeat fare. ""The Illusionist"" is a very pleasant movie by his standards - like a dreamy sort of fairy tale. I enjoyed seeing him in something that's so much fun.If you insist on over-thinking this film, I'm sure you'll figure out - and start to resent - all of its tricks. You'll see the wires, so to speak.

Quite a Chess Game or How Is It Done?,"I'm trying something different with this one: writing my impressions of this film whilst watching it on DVD for the first time. You know, I figured out the ""surprise"" of the Sixth Sense about 10 minutes into the film. With this one, the plot twist was a complete surprise right up until the end of the film. In the final summation, the magician is the director, and the audience being sold the illusion is the one in the movie theatre.The writing drips with meaning with every phrase and glance and gesture. But, is information, or disinformation? Edward Norton, like Russel Crowe, knows how to read a script and work with a director. Norton is a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for a good time at the movies, even though, in this one, his acting ain't that great, particularly the accent. But it doesn't matter.It is Paul Giamatti who actually anchors the film. He represents the audience, and is the most rounded character in this piece. Like so many of us today, he is a moral man, trapped in a corporatist institution that uses his talents and corrupts his soul. But is that soul beyond redemption? Are ours? This film deals with multiple themes: love, morals, objections to rash power, use and abuse of power. This film is a compelling portrayal of totalitarianism and a police state's attempts to control and silence the truth.I can quibble: Vienna depicted as way too clean for a turn-of-the-20th Century period piece, where the primary means of heating in bad weather was coal, but I imagine that this was deliberate to the production design and the mood that was trying to be created. The DP, production designer and director are able to use a very interesting use of colour, even if it is too clean! Lastly, the music is majestic and evocative of the European music of the past.A wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Norton and Giamatti work their magic,"Director Neil Burger triumphs, as The Illusionist proves itself to be much more than meets the eye. Edward Norton proves himself as versatile an actor as any out there. Its nice to see him play someone other than his usual angry outsider role. His character is calm, collected and captivating, and he plays the role of Eisenhiem the Illusionist with Oscar-worthy skill. Paul Giamatti plays every role like that, and this one is no exception. Jessica Biel is equally wonderful in her role as an Austrian duchess, betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold and seduced by Eisenhiem.The plot is complex and will leave you guessing until right up to the end. Everything flows naturally and the dialog is very eloquently written. This is one of those films that really needs a couple of viewings and undivided attention for one to walk out with the full experience.The Illusionist has proved to be a ray of light in an otherwise dull September at the movies. The next time you visit your local theater, The Illusionist deserves strong consideration.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
2006 Had Magic in the Air,"Romantic mystery based in Vienna at the turn of the century.No matter how much time has passed, I feel the same as I do today as I did in 2006. I can't help but compare this film to 'The Prestige' which also came out in 2006. Even though they're very much different films, they both deal with magic, love, loss, and take place around the same time. Because of that comparison, this film will always take a back seat. 'The Illusionist' is a good film, there's no doubt about it, but it will always be in the shadow of 'The Prestige' which is a masterful film. The ending of 'The Illusionist' you always sensed was coming, whereas the other you did not.The movie and music were beautiful. Norton was very good, along with his co-stars. It's very enjoyable. Just know where to turn if you really want to be blown away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
I Was Totally Involved,"This movie came out about the time ""The Prestige"" did. I really enjoyed that movie for its multiple plot levels. It also stayed a mystery to the end. I enjoyed both of them. I wish there were more films like these. This one sets you up by making it known that the purpose of the main character is to fool you. The film then sets about to do so, not with a bunch of gratuitous magic, but with a carefully plotted set of circumstances. You laugh, you cringe, you cry, you're outraged. The performance of Edward Norton is really admirable. He puts that neutral face on every event and yet you know he's teeming with emotion. His sense of love and craft are carefully integrated and we know the bad guy is going to pay in some way. One gets a little jaded sometime when films fail to deliver. Or the writer or director paint themselves into a corner. This doesn't happen here. There is something around every corner, but it doesn't jump out; it lies there unopened. You need to open it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

A brilliant movie,"Let me begin by saying that this is one of the best movies of 2006. Set in the late 19th century in Europe, The Illusionist follows the story of Eisenheim the Illusionist. The story is well done and paced superbly. The costumes and sets are absolutely convincing and the whole movie is shot in a sepia tone to give it that old world feel. Edward Norton acting in a role that is atypical for him puts in an Oscar-worthy performance. The supporting cast of Paul Giamatti as the police inspector and Jessica Biel as the Prince's soon-to-be wife are all excellent. I have no doubt that Norton, Giamatti and the movie itself will be nominated for Academy awards come March.

"Has holes, but a decent film nonetheless","Was it just a coincidence that two movies about magicians with a period setting were released within the space of a few months of each other? I don't know, but needless to say this film is always going to find itself being compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', and it's always going to find itself in second place because Nolan's film is a hell of a lot better than this one. The two films are similar in that they're both thrillers, both focus on retribution and, obviously, both are based on magicians. This one is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser and focuses on a man named Eisenheim. As a boy, Eisenheim falls in love with a girl a few social classes above himself, but their relationship is broken up for that very reason. Cut to years later and Eisenheim is a successful magician in Vienna. He meets his long lost love during a show and they quickly rekindle their relationship; but being together is a problem as she is engaged to the Crown Prince...After rising to fame with the likes of American History X and Fight Club in the late 1990's, it has to be said that Edward Norton has been a bit of a disappointment ever since. He really was due a good performance, and while his role here isn't as great as the ones that made him famous in the first place; he performs well and the film definitely represents his best work in years. Norton is given excellent support from the likes of Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel, and the acting is high quality on the whole. As mentioned, the film features a period setting and with the help of some glossy cinematography, it mostly looks very nice. The film is obviously intended to be a thriller, although there isn't a great deal of suspense featured. The plot does remain interesting for most of the duration, however, and there is usually just about enough going on to ensure that it doesn't become boring. The film builds up to a twist at the end. I didn't see it coming myself, though I'm sure many others will. However, in spite of this it is fairly well worked, although the audience is asked to suspend disbelief more than just a little. But even so, this is decent enough entertainment and I did at least enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Terrific,"Terrific plot development. Norton is excellent in playing an enigmatic character with a profound and quiet intensity. Norton does well with dark characters. But who is really surprising in his skill in a non-comedic role is Paul Giamatti (sp?) as the police chief. The theaters (I believe it is the same one used in Amadeus but am unsure) are beautiful. The time-period recreation is completely absorbing. The story takes several turns - it would be best to see this movie without talking to anyone about the plot and especially not reading any spoilers. Even well intentioned reviews might give away elements which while not profound twists, at least add to the enjoyment of the movie. Phillip Glass' score complements the film well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Bloody Brilliant,"I didn't think I could see a recent film that would be better than V For Vendetta. I was sorely mistaken. This film was incredible. The acting was absolutely outstanding, but of course it would be - Edward Norton, one of the most talented actors of our time starred. How could a film featuring both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti fail? Easily, it didn't. I originally thought that the casting for Sophie could have been better, but I underestimated the talent of Miss Biel. She gave a compelling performance as Sophie. The twist was fantastic as well. I am usually quite good at predicting movies, but the details of the ultimate outcome eluded me. The cinematography and costumes were as equally impressive as the acting. No matter which way you spin it, this movie was very impressive. A fantastic film that I am proud to keep in my movie cabinet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Spellbinding Cinematic Wizardry.,"One of the greatest movies I've seen in a while, one which definitely fits in that category of elite and favored films of mine that I simply watch it awe of. It's absolutely fantastic, and I'm disappointed by how poorly the Academy received it. I don't blame them, of course: As of yet I haven't seen a movie they chose that didn't deserve the nomination. Granted, also, I've been very lax, as of late, in my movie-going, and have only yet seen two of the best picture nominees (which I plan to rectify by the Big Night). At any rate, I would have loved to see this movie nominated for Best Picture. In my opinion this is a better movie than The Departed (and please don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved The Departed: this is only a testament to The Illusionist's qualities) and of the same notable parity as Little Miss Sunshine (only, clearly, in a much different fashion: serious drama and mystery, as opposed to dramady).The movie stars Edward Norton in a role but like and unlike anything we've ever seen him in. He revels in the same mystery which he typically partakes in Fight Club (1999) and The Score (2001), and yet he does so in an extraordinarily reserved fashion. His speech is far more reserved, his eyes and features far more telling, than anything he's done before: and this is by far the greatest role he's ever undertaken.I hate to use this terminology, but acting under him is Paul Giamatti, whose equally impressive performance provides a solid foundation to lay the movie on top of, acting in the same fashion as Edward Norton, although surely something he's had more experience with: reserved and carefully executed acting, although with a tad more pomp and flare than Norton This is likewise, in my opinion, his greatest role, although seeing what he's done in the past this is a matter of considerably more debate.Jessica Biel provides a powerful and striking performance in a role that could have, in fact, probably would have, lagged behind and weighted the movie in the hands of a less experienced and less capable actress. Rufus Sewell provides an equally potent performance, one that warrants-- nay-- demands, a mention.The directing is spectacular: absolutely magical, as it were. The special-effects are subtle and used to a pleasingly small degree, opting more for Norton's actual skills and sleights of hand for a more realistic show. Further, the magic was merely the setting, a catalyst for the story to take hold and grow, not a crutch in which to support a flimsy production.The movie, in a word, was spellbinding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
What's with the menorah?,"Toward the end of the film when the police inspector confronts the prince, as the latter holds a gun in his hands, one notices a large menorah in the background. I don't get it, that royal family was roman catholic??? Now, it's no big secret that most Hollywood film producers are Jewish and that may well explain this. Surprised that Sophie's name wasn't Rebecca! What was the illusionist's real name? As a young man he was Edward and later in the film a voice mentions that his real name was Adam Abramovitz ( coincidence...) All in all a pretty good movie, nice scenery and the actors were great, especially the inspector. Too bad Norton always gives the impression that he's constipated in his roles...",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Thinking Man's Pot-Boiler,"""The Illusionist"" is a nifty but rather strange film. It's a mystery whose central mystery, once revealed, isn't all that mysterious, yet the film manages to build an exciting amount of suspense anyway.It's success, I think, lies in the fact that it builds a great deal of character development and character-driven subplots into the film, so that not everything hinges on how tricky you find the ending to be. As Paul Giamatti's police inspector character begins to connect the pieces of the puzzle in the film's climactic moments, it's more fun to watch his face responding to the trick than it is to see how the trick was pulled off in the first place.Edward Norton, as usual, does a fine job as master magician Eisenheim, who meets his long-lost childhood love (Jessica Biel) ten years after they were parted and told they could never be together, due to class differences. From there, it's up to Eisenheim to pull off his most elaborate illusion yet, and make them ""disappear,"" as his young love asks him to do early in the film. But where does reality end and illusion begin? The film plays with that question in what is mostly pot-boiler fashion while giving it just enough intellectual trimmings (talk about the soul, etc.) to satisfy those who want a little meat with their thrillers.And Philip Glass provides a musical score that sounds for all the world like the one he composed for ""The Hours,"" though what worked so well for that movie feels less suited for the material here.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Magical gem,"It is not easy to bring magic into a movie. It takes more than imagination, more than atmosphere, more than excellent acting performances. Maybe it takes all of them combined, plus a little something that has to do with the plot. And the ""illusionist"" has all of the above. It is a film worthy of its title and reputation, with Norton giving -once more- a great performance, even though none of the other actors is any less. Romance, mystery, magic, all at the exact right proportion, providing a unique power. It is, after all, a matter of how much a director can leave you with this feeling of ""It was such a great journey"" that matters. That he has taken you somewhere you really found worthy being at. It is in any case important to comment on Norton' s contribution to this outstanding result. Playing a man with the ability of deception is not an easy task. It might be relatively easy to do it in front of a live audience, but when on screen, the audience needs quite more to follow an illusionist. And Norton manages to have this look of ""I can do anything"", which seems to come from a deep knowledge and acceptance of this fact. He does not give the sense of a performer, but of someone able to twist the natural world around. It is, no doubt, his physical characteristics, as well as his amazing ability to dive into each characters deeper self. I would assume the writer of the story was exceptionally lucky and blessed in this movie, and his story did not lose its strength, as so many stories have in movies unable to provide the atmosphere or character strength the writer had in mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
he lived in turn-of-the-century Vienna but never met Sigmund Freud,"In ""The Illusionist"", Edward Norton plays a magician who uses his tricks to upset the power structure. Whenever he performs his tricks, he reminds us how one can never be totally certain about what's real and what isn't. I guess that the correlation is that Austria-Hungary has a status quo - in that it's run by straight-laced aristocrats - and this magician is changing it; showing that the status quo doesn't have to be, if you will.But even without that aspect, it's still a pretty fascinating movie. Even though Eisenheim is a fictional character, one has to wonder what it must be like to be in his audience and witness his tricks. If anything lessens the movie at all, it's that the woman-loves-someone-outside-her-social-circle premise seems pretty routine (and why do the characters in these movies always have English accents?). But overall, I really liked it and I recommend it. Also starring Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell.I wonder why they didn't incorporate Sigmund Freud into the plot. I bet that he could have had some comments about illusions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Hypnotic!,"Story: The ""twist"" itself isn't really too much of a twist, especially for the current generation of audience who's been getting smarter and more alert. The overall story itself is rather generic  love triangle, a murder case, with a bit of political thrills thrown in. But there's something hypnotic and compelling about the plot  a mysterious mixture of magic and reality. If the main character is say an ordinary bank executive, instead of a magician/illusionist, the movie would lose much of its compels and appeals. The uncertainty about whether and when it crosses the realm of reality gives the movie an immense feel of suspense. It's story-telling at its finest  it relentlessly grabs hold of your attention till the very last scene.Acting: Ed Norton is good, Rufus Sewell is great, and Paul Giamatti is simply amazing. What more can be said?Production: The music and lighting are greatly effective, and the set and costumes are first-rate. Watching the movie is like seeing a wonderful magic show. While you are acutely aware that everything portrayed on the other side of the silver screen is hardly believable, you are keen to get carried away into this fantastic parallel universe and indulge yourself in all the tricks and magic it has to offer. By the time the end credits roll, you might feel reluctant to pull yourself back into the reality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Duchess and the Magician,"This film begins in Vienna with a young boy becoming fascinated by magic and practicing sleight-of-hand tricks quite frequently to sharpen his skills. During this time, a young girl happens to notice him and the two of them begin to have romantic feelings toward one another. The problem, however, is that the young girl is of noble birth, while the young boy is considered beneath her status and as a result, the more they insist on being together the more difficult it becomes for him. Eventually, he leaves Vienna and doesn't return until fifteen years later under the new name of ""Eisenheim"" (Edward Norton) and, having spent a great deal of the time in the Orient, has amassed a mastery of magic that few have ever attained. Because of this, audiences flock to the theater to see him perform and that includes the cruel and arrogant ""Crown Prince Leopold"" (Rufus Sewell) and his bride-to-be ""Duchess Sophie"" (Jessica Biel) who, as it turns out, is the same young girl that fell in love with him so many years ago. But what neither of them realize is that Crown Prince Leopold has already developed an extreme dislike for Eisenheim and is prepared to do whatever it takes to expose him as a fraud and ruin his reputation. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I found this movie to be quite entertaining with both Edward Norton and Jessica Biel performing their roles to near perfection. I also liked the way in which none of the magical illusions were explained until the very end as it added to the mystery and suspense.

Incredible Movie,"This Movie is my all time favorite which i have seen more then 10 times. The Illusionist is infectious mix of drama, mystery and romance. t's an exquisitely crafted period picture that keeps promising more and more as it goes along--smarter ideas, richer themes, spookier plot twists--and keeps delivering on every promise, right up until the rug- pulling and overly hasty final sequence. Eisenheim's storybook romance with Sophie (Jessica Biel), the childhood sweetheart now expected to become Leopold's princess, is the most compelling thing about a film. Sophie in childhood says when they were caught together ""Make us Disappear"" and when Eisenheim is back as a grownup he tells Sophie during one of his performance ""Perhaps i will make you disappear"" that rang a bell for Sophie, astonishing way to tell her that he is back. Overall a brilliant piece of work.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Sleight of Film,"The unique mileage Edward Norton and company get out of this period piece mystery does have it's merits. Sequences in which the enigmatic magician conjures his intriguing imagery inside many of the murky, though classy stage setups remain the overriding soul of this movie despite any romantic developments or late act revelations. The heavily accentuated ambiance prevalent in those scenes does wonders to elevate the interesting but somehow gimmicky character study that at least the first half of this movie purports to be, replacing Norton's questionable interpretation of the work with some authentic scenes that bristle with the kind of on-screen magic this illusionist was trying to represent to his audience. In this aspect writer and director Neil Burger has succeeded in giving viewers some of the most original entertainment of the year. Unfortunately, the majority of the remaining plot to divulge does not necessarily complement the highlights, and often pales in comparison to the original set of aesthetic values placed on the actual stage performance of The Illusionist. While Burger does weave a passionate love story around the magic, one can't help but think all the romance, action, and conflict surrounding this script feels sort of tacked on to the one trick pony that it really is. Acting is uniformly decent, with even the likes of Jessica Biel wearing her role somewhat convincingly, although it did seem like Norton was a bit lost with how to interpret this different character, too many times relying on a vacant blandness that has all but consumed the latter half of his acting career. Undervalued Rufus Sewell added that much needed edge, while the always good Paul Giamatti surely impresses with his refined technique, but needs to revert more to doing what he does best, playing the types of roles that got him big in the first place, ala Sideways, and not trying to be so well rounded in his movie choices- an admirable goal for any actor, but in his case a discredit to what he does best. Overall this is a worthy film to see, although more for conceptual originality then for any actual originality to be found in the script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Not necessarily a one trick pony but not far off.,"The Illusionist got me thinking; reminiscing, if you like about a filmmaker called Georges Méliés who was a trickster come entertainer at the turn of the twentieth century. He made hundreds of films between about 1890 to apparently 1913 that fell into a long since dead genre: 'trick'. There can be no doubt that Méliés had a massive impact and inspiration on the science fiction genre as well as other filmmakers as a whole all those decades ago with his bamboozling images and expansive imagination. There was one such short from Méliés that had me remembering during The Illusionist and that was the one in which a person stands in front of the camera; there is a 'cut' and they are then gone from the frame thus vanishing. I'm sure audiences in the day were completely perplexed and murmuring amongst one another in the same vein they do at Eisenheim's (Norton) tricks in this film but that's the hook: we now know that Méliés merely used a 'jumpcut' to vanish the person just as we know now that there is no such thing as magic or supernatural powers so any 'wow factor' The Illusionist as film has is actually pretty vacant.I think a lot of people 'love' this film because of its cinematography; its effects and because Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are in it and they share some sort of romance but I feel they're kidding themselves as its like watching Méliés' films nowadays and being aghast at what he achieves even if the knowledge now is common. The 'trick film' genre may be long since dead but demand for period drama romance films that have twist endings seemingly are not. The Illusionist is impressive in its basics and its fundamental areas but it felt like a big ball of gas ever expanding before going out with a 'pop' rather than an almighty 'bang'. Firstly, I was under no illusion (no pun intended) that what I was seeing was mere CGI to myself and a mere illusion to the audience within the film. It is humanely impossible to achieve the things that Eisenheim did in this film and no, I couldn't even let my mind relax and enjoy it for what it was: an escapists dream in a world where magic exists. What the film does is challenge you into thinking: 'what can filmmakers achieve these days vs. what can actually be achieved in real life.' No; orange trees can't grow into adults in ten seconds; people can't bring back images of the dead and when you look into a mirror, you'll see yourself looking back. With this in mind, any clever twist or devious trick the film has up its sleeve is consequently a letdown if you opt for the first option in the quandary: 'what can filmmakers achieve these days vs. what can actually be achieved in real life.'If anything, it's the editing that makes the film look more spectacular than it does but then again; editing can make anything look believable or spectacular: did people back in 1905 or whenever REALLY think Méliés made a person vanish on screen? Likewise, when audiences watched a train speed towards the camera in the late 1890s and some of them ducked out the way, some of them might have been a little 'aware' of the situation but watching The Illusionist in 2006, haven't we learnt anything about 'what we see vs. what we believe is really happening/is really possible.'? To the people who loved this film: obviously not. The Illusionist may have its actual premise as a flawed piece of historical context involving cinema, magic and genre but for what it is as a film, it works. The lead character of Eisenheim is a rounded and likable guy who falls for a girl he is clearly in no position to get; something a few people watching will be able to relate to. What follows is a tricky and devious narrative; something that resembles a snake crawling calmly along and then suffering a seizure towards the very end and wriggling all over the place. The antagonistic behaviour of Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell) who has bigger plans than that of his bride to be and secret love of Eisenheim Sophie (Biel); is an effective villain who demeans and threatens Eisenheim not solely because of his tricks that appeal to everyone but because he is at risk of becoming second-best public figure to a fraud: ""For anyone wanting to discuss a more serious topic, join me for a drink."" he announces on Eisenheim's stage right after a show.What I didn't like about The Illusionist isn't necessarily what I didn't enjoy. The story of a love triangle is dumped for that of a detective route about half way through with certain events although surprising, you can't help but feel will pop back up later on. I don't know if it was the brilliant acting of Norton portraying Eisenheim or the film overall but something felt arrogant; something felt as if it was just going to force you into thinking it was a good film rather than you making your own mind up and this is emphasised in the closing scene at the train station where a certain character works everything out just when he needs to. This scene plays out in a messy way and I am still unsure about how all those memories and flashbacks would come to him there and then at the station all at once and never before  it tries to be The Usual Suspects when Dave Kujan stands on the police station steps; cursing to himself but the build up and the payoff is just not of that quality. The Illusionist works as a piece of entertainment but lacks any real depth if you look deep enough; like a typical magicians trick: you see it and smirk to yourself but it doesn't stay with you in the long run.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
captivating movie,"This movie is truly captivating. Ed Norton as usual delivered an astonishing performance. I was hesitant at first since Jessica Biel has not always picked the best movie roles, but she too was captivating and this might be the role that gives her a little bit of credit. The era is perfectly portrayed and the movie was captivating the entire way through. Even after the movie was over I found my self asking questions of how the illusionist was able to do what he did! I would recommend this movie to anyone that believes in the unbelievable and who wants to sit in awe throughout the movie. I can say without fail that if you allow yourself to become engulfed in the movie you leave with a strange feeling of being truly moved and captured by a wonderful movie.

Amazing Movie! A Must See!!,"The Illusionist is one of my favorite movies of all time, because of the fact that it keeps you thinking and interested throughout the whole thing. Set in late nineteenth century Vienna, The Illusionist it one of those movies with AHA! moments and a mysteriousness that keeps you trying to figure out what's going to happen next. This quote from Herr Eisenheim's assistants summarizes the air of mystery: ""Life and death. Space and time. Fate and chance. These are the forces of the universe. Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a man who has unlocked these mysteries. From the furthest corners of the world where the dark arts still hold sway he returns to us to demonstrate laws may be bent. I give you Eisenheim."" This is a quote makes you look at what Eisenheim's doing, make you believe that he is really doing it, but makes you think of HOW he is doing it, makes you QUESTION the abilities of a person and their will. Herr Eisenheim, played by Edward Norton (The Italian Job, Kingdom of Heaven) plays a magician, or more as the title entails, an illusionist. An illusionist is, by definition, one who uses techniques such as foreshortening to produce the illusion of reality especially in visual art. Herr Eisenheim used his skills to attract the attention of a young Duchess named Sophie, played by Jessica Biel (7th Heaven, Stealth, Summer Catch) who is forbidden to see him. After years apart, they meet again, when Crown Prince Leopold, who is played by Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde, The Holiday, A Knight's Tale) comes with his fiancé, who just happens to be Sophie, to one of Eisenheim's shows, and when Eisenheim asks for a volunteer, the Crown Prince stands and volunteers her. Throughout the rest of the movie, it seems that Eisenheim and Sophie are having a fling, which they are and aren't at the same time. The Crown Prince has Chief Inspector Uhl, played by Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Cinderella Man, Fred Claus), follow them around, keeping an eye on them at all times. What looks as if a sure fire way to get caught, Eisenheim uses his wits, tricks, and thoughtfulness into getting around what everybody sees. What he is planning, from nearly the beginning, isn't what everyone believes it to be. ""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion,"" a quote by Eisenheim, understood to be said for his performance, is much more than that.This movie could have ruined by the ending alone, but the way that Neil Burger does it is so fluid that it makes it even better than expected. The way that Edward Norton played his part was mesmerizing, you couldn't help but think of what he was planning to do and how he was going to do it. He played his part perfectly, being that during his performances he used a monotonous voice, ultimately using whatever voice needed (sad, excited, or spontaneous). Jessica Biel played her part good as well. It surprised me, because the only shows I've ever seen her on are either adventures or comedies, but this was the first time I've seen here in a drama. She did extremely well, in my opinion, and from what I've read, so do other movie-goers who've seen this film. Giamatti played it well too, as I expected, as he played his role in Cinderella Man very well. Burger made the magic tricks convincing. They're very believable, and they're interesting and really cool. The first time I saw this, I was expecting yet another one of those ""predictable"" movies, but the way it is set up is exactly as the tagline says: ""Nothing is what it seems.""

seductive,"the atmosphere of imperial Vienna. a love story. an egocentric prince. and a fascinating story about truth, sacrifice and illusion. the great virtue of film is represented by brilliant acting, in the case of Jessica Biel almost surprising -. the other - wise manner to mix different stories in a coherent fresco of a fight between two different status characters . and, sure, the final. a film who impress for the admirable use of non verbal language. for the nuances of silence. for the flavor of a period who has new nuances for define it. a beautiful film. about the instruments to build the perfect victory. for Edward Norton who explores the mystery and the force and the tenacity of his character. for Rufus Sewell who does a strange but credible prince . for the soundtrack. and for the flavor of a lost time who obtains, in this film, new nuance of charm.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

enjoyed this movie thoroughly,"Cinematography is wonderful - acting is very good. Story - while it may not be completely original, is delightful none the less, and delivered with heaps of originality.There are some who claim this movie is predictable. I can usually figure out the ending to a movie half way thru it, and had no problem predicting the endings of Beautiful Mind and Vanilla Sky, but this movie surprised me, and it did it in wonderful way. Ignore the naysayers... go see this movie!! If I have any criticism.. and this is minor, its that Sewell plays the crown prince a bit over the top. Its a matter of interpretation on the part of the director, and some may be completely convinced by his performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Age gap,"I thought this film wasn't bad. I thought it looked excellent; cinematography, costumes etc and the music was fantastic and the actors did a good job with the material they had. On the downside I thought it lacked a little emotion to engage the audience. However, what really bugged me was the obvious age gap between Norton and Biel. When they are younger they look of similar age then when they reunite he looks mid-to-late thirties and she looks about ten years younger. So I checked the actors ages: Norton b. 1969 and Biel b. 1982! Last time it was that noticeable was Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang where there was a good 10 years between Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan. I mean I know these actors usually look a little younger than they are but there are limits to the suspension of disbelief!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
It should have been better,"The Illusionist could have been a much, much better movie. For starters, why are the producers passing off Prague as Vienna? The freshly painted signs in German gave them away. If you're going to make a movie in which Vienna is the central character, please use the real thing, none of this Toronto-passing-for-New-York business. Second, Edward Norton's decent performance is sullied by Paul Giamatti's hammy performance (left over from Cinderella Man, albeit with an Austrian accent.) The movie had potential but instead we got a half-hearted effort. Unless you are itching to see a movie and have no other choices, wait for video on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Love, honor, and magic","During interrogation by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) in ""The Illusionist"", the magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton) confesses to his supporting crowd, ""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion."" Perhaps, everything we have seen has been a wonderfully crafted illusion by Director and Writer Neil Burger. Based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, ""The Illusionist"" is a tale ultimately about love, honor, and magic. This is a stark contrast to the other magicians' movie, ""The Prestige"" which is about the cost of fame and all consuming obsession. Edward Norton's powerful performance as illusionist Eisenheim, who pursues love and honor, inspires and compels in ""The Illusionist"". From that point of view, I enjoyed ""The Illusionist"" more. ""The Illusionist"" is an impassioned and timeless love story set in the world of magic of the late nineteenth century.Before becoming Eisenheim the Illusionist, Edward became entranced with magic as a young boy. Edward's first love is Sophie. However, social privilege keeps them apart. Edward is from a poor family. Sophie is a young Duchess. Edward designs a keepsake of his love for Sophie, which she wears. Unfortunately, Edward is forced to leave to protect himself and his family.Edward returns to Vienna as Eisenheim 15 years later. He is an accomplished magician of great talent. He rediscovers the love of his life Sophie (beautiful Jessica Biel) is still in Vienna, and about to be engaged to Prince Leopold (noble and unsavory Rufus Sewell). This arranged family marriage is purely for political leverage. Eisenheim has always loved Sophie, and she has always loved him. The suspicious and paranoid Leopold tasks his Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) with uncovering Eisenheim's secretsmagic and personal. Uhl fancies himself as a magic amateur and fan. The magic performed in ""The Illusionist"" is spectacular. My bud Tom, who is an accomplished magician and student of the art, told me that these are classic magic tricks dating way back. So there is great authenticity and atmosphere to Burger's ""The Illusionist"". His final twist is more redemption, than merely shock.The performances are impeccable. Edward Norton has this sublime power on screen as Eisenheim. He is a commanding presence, who is never over done. He brilliantly balances both compassion and angst. He breathes refreshing nobility within his character. Paul Giamatti is awesome. In a sense ""The Illusionist"" works, because of his believable performance as Inspector Uhl. This is particularly true in the amazing scene toward the end. Giamatti, always so natural, embodies such humanity. Jessica Biel is a welcome surprise. She is stunningly beautiful, and possesses an underlying strength and vulnerability as Sophie. Neil Burger orchestrates ""The Illusionist"" with masterful strokes. The storytelling is impassioned, stylish, and inspiring. ""The Illusionist"" is a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Don't Blink,"This film seems to pile comments on both sides of the teeter-totter. Some are negative and some (like me) seem to like the total package of The Illusionist. Negative comments appear to focus on specifics - Why this or that for location. I hate one actor or another's performance. Yawn factor to wow factor. What are you to believe? My best guess it that some viewers don't like to be drawn in, fooled, and then left wanting more. This is an excellent film with the rare capacity to keep you guessing - if you're willing to suspend your ego and go with it. Instead of red objects to give you clues, they come in the (GASP!) dialogue. You, as the viewer, must interact with your intelligence to decide who is the more evil, the more twisted, the most powerful, the more deceptive or the more in love. Delicious. Part of the problem is that a movie with this caliber of viewer participation is rare. Yes, Ed is handsome and convincing. Rufus is intense and real in his madness. Jessica is beautiful. Paul is devilishly fun and Eddie *is* his character. But the story is the most seductive partner in this crime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Not like The Prestige,"Most reviews put this movie in the ""suspense"" category. However, that is far from the case. While the acting is decent, the plot is very thin. You sit through the first hour just waiting for something to happen. It's one of those ""this is boring but I can't turn it off 'cause it feels like something's going to happen any minute now"". Then you waste an hour and a half waiting for something to happen that never does.Also, the movie does not form a tight enough connection between its characters and the audience, so any dramatic turn of events lacks the shock value.This movie is slow, very much NOT in the suspense genre, and just ""blah"". Make sure you don't have high expectations before you watch this--prepare yourself. For a magician-focused movie that came out around the same time as The Prestige, this definitely takes 2nd place (or 5th if there were more to add to the list).",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The illusions were the best part.,"The illusions were top natch but going in i had expected they would be because it's 2006 and the Pepsi commercials have illusions in them. i admit i tapped into my inner child and aloud my self to ohhh... and aha... at the magic. I also caught my self snickering from time to time at Eisenheim's use of magic to be little his enemy and Chief Inspector Uhl who's constant need to figure out the illusion made me laugh.Although i'm sure it was not meant to be funny,Giamatti is hard not to giggle at.The plot was very predictable. and i do sometimes tire of seeing Rufus Sewell play what seems like the same character in over an estimation of ten films. but i would watch it again because it's not a bad film ,it's just a little of an equivalent to a Friday night TV movie or a straight to video release. You know that ""just a movie"" movie well this is it not much is special about it.If nothing else was on this is what you'd watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Best Movie I've Seen All Year,"I was completely and utterly captivated by watching The Illusionist. The storyline is very clever and beautifully written. Edward Norton did a phenomenal job, which was no surprise since he is amazing in every movie I have seen him in. I am very impressed with Jessica Biel. She was amazing. And of course Paul Giamatti was great as always.At first I did not think Biel and Norton would have chemistry, but really did. You, as the viewer, could feel the passion that these two characters had for each other. I was almost speechless.The Illusionist is one of the best films I have seen all year. It is absolutely beautiful and I would DEFINITELY recommend people to watch it. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Beautifully-Photographed Near-Classic with One Developmental Flaw,"""The Illusionist"" (2006) is a very beautiful film I suggest with a splendidly attractive surface that founders on only one vital point, the impossibility of the illusions created and being used by its central character to bring down a tyrant. Neil Burger has directed this film in classical and intelligent style, never striving for sensational effect and getting the very most out of his cast. The story altogether too-obviously I assert was developed from a 'short story' from Steven Millhauser ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"", by the director. As is the case with too many films of recent vintage, including ""You've Got Mail"", ""Devil With a Blue Dress"" and dozens of others, the fundamental key to the film's full-realism was never discovered. This leaves the viewer with a very rich-looking modest-budget fantasy about the Hapsburg Empire's leadership class and its tendency toward totalitarianism and emotional instability. The subplot concerns the Crown Prince Leopold's bad character, that leads him to a desire to overthrow the Emperor. But the piece's main plot concerns the love of a man, now an Asian-trained world-class illusionist, for the Duchess who was his first love and is also the marital key to the Crown Prince's nefarious plan. This effort's dozen producers have achieved a surprisingly effective and sustained ""look"", in my judgment, through the use of horse-drawn vehicles and major buildings of the late 1800s--two theaters, a palace, a large house, a railway station and several streets, as well as attractive outdoor settings. For this unity of design, Cinematographer Dick Pope, Production Designer Ondrej Nekvasil, Art Directora Stefan Kovacik and Vlasta Svoboda, Set Decorator Petra Habova and Costume Designer Ngila Dickson all deserve high credit. Philip Glass's music never makes a complete point but it is lush and unobtrusively applied to the gorgeous tapestry of this period romance cum mystery, in my opinion. In the realm of acting, which for any costume film is so central to successful believability's being achieved by any filmmaker, the curious lack of development of characters at once makes the casting of vocally-competent players easier but also hamstrings their best efforts. They are, in effect, too-often reduced by this failing to two or three lines, in one scene or two. This lack I suggest is partly due to the failure of the adapter to develop the original story beyond its two lovers and two opponents; but it is also a result of the secretive nature of all three characters, none of whom is able to confine in anyone. Among the supporting cast, Robert Russel as a Spiritualist leader and young Elias Bauer as a messenger are given noticeable one-scene roles. Others having meaningful parts included Aaron Johnson and Eleanor Tomlinson as the youthful friends destined to be lovers, Karl Johnson as the Doctor, and others who are given two or three lines here or there, which seem surprisingly performed well in all cases. There are even theatrical, crowd and street scenes of impressive attractiveness and utility. As the Crown Prince, the mad Leopold, Rufus Sewell, works hard but is sometimes out of his depth in a part demanding a classical training. The same must be said for Edward Norton. His intelligence and theatrical competence allow him to execute the more-demanding speeches adequately or better; but much of the time he appears to be a merely thin and somewhat gangling character actor unable to find an approach to playing a charismatic leader of men; he is not helped by having no confidant to play off throughout most of the film, which leaves him often standing alone in large rooms and being questioned by others. Jessica Biel is sincere and lovely as the Duchess Sophie; all she lacks is a stage-trained voice to be added to all her other impressive credentials. So, I claim, it falls to narrator and Police Inspector Paul Giamatti to carry the film. This, I argue, he does in splendid Oscarworthy fashion from beginning to end. He alone in the cast is given a variety of moods as well as scenes to play; and the strength of the film's logic and his own success at achieving the effect the director desires are perhaps the project's greatest strengths. It should be noted that the narrative is not swift-paced but is nevertheless very satisfying throughout, even in theater-site scenes that in lesser hands might have slowed up the progress of the work. With a great leading man, such as the story deserved, and a solution to the believability of the illusions being depicted, which are so powerful they mystify an empire's best minds, the film might have achieved much more even than it did. What results, I argue, is an unusually handsome and very-well-told cinematic story, a near-classic well worth the seeing more than once, if only for its economy of means and unusual physical beauty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Jessica Biel surprises,"Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell are all accomplished, intelligent actors and turned in very good performances, as expected. The question mark for me was Jessica Biel, after just watching Scarlett J, who is supposed to be the much better actress, doing a terrible job in Hollywoodland, another period piece. Doing the math after the end of the back story on the characters' childhoods, I wondered how Biel (who I think is still under 25) could play an aristocrat in her mid 30s when her last co-star was a talking plane. Instead she did a great job. She gave her character some depth and provided enough justification for why two very capable and powerful, each in his own way, men would fight for her. She reminds me of Jenny Agutter, an actress that I've always liked. Hopefully I won't see her in Blade 4 or Stealth 2 and now she'll get an opportunity for better roles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Illusionist is a brilliant, dark film","I literally knew zip about this film when I decided I wanted to see it. All I knew was that Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti were starring, and that it was about magicians. And I must note this; I love magic, David Blaine never ceases to make my eyes bug out. Then there's David Copperfield who I saw perform in person. That is what put me over the edge, for awhile I wanted to be a magician. That's why I think this film looked so compelling to me. Though, while there are sequences of magic tricks, you can tell they are just CG. That takes some of the magic of the magic tricks away. Nevertheless, this film is a great period film, with a twist at the end you don't see coming till two minutes before the film ends.The title basically speaks for itself; ""The Illusionist"" is about an illusionist. I'm not going to elaborate on the plot, because one such reviewer did, and ruined an integral part for me. I'm not like that, so I'll leave it at that. Edward Norton does a great job as Eisenheim the Illusionist. Though I've noticed he's never really played a character other than the quiet and slightly disturbed ones. Paul Giamatti, who is always brilliant, plays Chief Inspector Uhl who is investigating whether or not Eisenheim is dealing with the supernatural. And, to tell you the truth, Jessica Biel as Eisenheim's forbidden love interest, Sophie, did admirably. I'm glad I got to see this marvelously crafted film because originally it wasn't supposed to come to Saginaw. Fortunate for me, it did.So, other than a few minor quirks, everything was amazing. The plot was engrossing, the pacing and timing moved well, the cinematography was beautiful and filmed in a slight sepia tone, and the dialogue was well written except for one scene, where I guessing he had writers block.Overall, this is a magical, dark, and funny film. But after seeing a trailer for another magician film-""The Prestige""- released next month, I'm predicting ""The Illusionist"" will disappear.Rated PG-13 for some sexuality and violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"A mysterious magician becomes the talk of 19th century Vienna. He runs into trouble, however, when he insults the crown-prince and is seen hangin out with his girl.","Nothing you haven't seen about 1000x before. Edward Norton is laughable. Paul Giammati is, as always, a powerhouse performer- he alone saves this movie from being a total joke. (Jessica Biel is also very good, but her role is so stupid you can't really connect.) Oh, and I forgot Rufus Sewell. Too bad. My guess is a chick-flik trying to attract a male audience but failing pretty badly.If you like this sort of superman-mastermind genre, see The Usual Suspects. If you want a good, fun fantasy movie, try The Princess Bride. My advice? Only see this movie under one of 2 circumstances: -It's your girlfriend's turn at picking the movie. -You haven't had a really good nap the entire day.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Go to see The Illusionist for a reminder that film is magic.,"So far, none of the ""real' critics are suggesting this film as an Oscar possible, and I wonder why. It's not self-conscious like All the Kings Men, convoluted like Hollywoodland, or dragging heaps of unresolved issues behind it like The Departed. The Illusionist is satisfyingly complete and completely magical.The plot carries you from an engrossing look at Eisenheim's--the illusionist's--childhood to his final appearance. His magical meeting with an old magician started him on this path, but like everything else,the stunning image of the magician plying his trade beneath a gnarled tree, comes to us second-hand, through a narrator. What should we believe? We can believe absolutely in the romance between the magician and his noble born beloved, a countess he met as a child. She was forbidden to play with him because he was a peasant, the son of a carpenter, but they managed to meet anyway. The same distance lies between them when they meet again as adults, but Eisenheim now possesses adult powers--or are they just tricks? As the plot takes you to its mesmerizing conclusion, you yearn to believe everything the illusionist does is real.Edward Norton's performance gives the film a magnetic center, with great supporting players in his orbit. When Norton makes a little red ball roll lazily over the back of his hand and through his fingers, it looks as if he has been doing nothing but magic forever. The evil Prince (Rupert Sewall)is satisfyingly evil and Paul Giametti's inspector Uhl is convincingly drawn in by the illusionist, as we are.A driving sense of urgency gives The Illusionist its power and makes it Oscar-worthy. Consumed by the events playing out before us, we're always enmeshed in the film's incredible beauty; the lush, inventive mise-en-scene, however, never seeks adulation because it's part of the whole, not an attempt to show how clever the director and/or cinematographer can be. Go to see this movie to remember what film can do best. It can create images that replay in your mind, like the two butterflies you'll still see after you leave the theater. It can remove you to an intact, other world, where you can revel in the playing out of human strengths and frailties. Although The Illusionist isn't overtly political and is set in the nineteenth-century, its themes of father/son battles over power, censorship, spiritualism versus materialism, and sustained love instead of carnal knowledge resonate today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Wonderfully romantic,"To me it seemed to more of 1870's Vienna. At essence is difference in class between Eisenheim and the royalty in Austria. A subplot might be the democratization of Austria. The power held by the crown prince is implicit. The castles, countryside and city cobblestone streets add to the mood. The lighting levels and tones are crafted to generate the air of mystery it so masterfully presents. The costume selections were great. There was even a green steam engine powered passenger train. The story line did not drag. I did need to go back to figure out a few details. I hope this movie is retained in the next round of format change.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

I felt transported into another time and place, and though the ending can be determined well into the film, I was never sure if I was right. And if I was right, I wasn't sure how it could be accomplished.I did notice what I considered to be a plot hole. The girl that played the young Sophie had some crooked teeth (refreshing in today's cookie cutter world) and the grown Sophie did not. I wasn't aware they had orthodontia in Victorian Vienna. Modern dentistry of our time, however can make false teeth to match just about any description. It's a petty thing. Another equally petty thing...what was with all the bad dye jobs on everybody's beard. You could see the blonde roots and other patches of blonde hair on the face of several characters.

Disappointing,"I had big expectations from this movie, but I was very disappointed. While the Giamatti character has life and is enjoyable, the illusionist himself (Edward Norton) isn't really likable and seems too cold and lifeless. While the settings are really good and the old Vienna is shown in its beauty, for me this movie has 5 big flaws:1) The Edward Norton character is too cold and rigid 2) The illusions aren't explained 3) The big turn of the story isn't really so big and you can easily anticipate it at about half the movie 4) The story is not engaging at all (apart the Giamatti search for the truth) 5) microphones are often seen hanging down above the characters heads, and this is a bit annoying6/10 ... and I am being generous.Nothing to compare with ""The prestige"", that is ways ways better than ""The illusionist"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A very well done mystery!,"I have seen this movie, and was greatly impressed! It reminded me of that wonderful movie of the great Swedish director, Ingmar Bergmann- in 1958- called ""The Magician"" listed as ""Ansiktet""- a similar tale of illusion- the acting in ""The Illusionist"" was superb- it was wonderfully staged in old Vienna (Czechoslovakia, I believe). So many items were left to the imagination- how did he pull off the supposed death of his loved one-(shades of ""Romeo and Juliet"")- and, in the end, as the realization of how it was pulled off, became clear to the Inspector- who liked magic and admired the magician- his facial reactions were perfect!I love a mystery- and just to see the illusionist sit on the stage, with a wonderfully appreciative audience, waiting- waiting- one was left with the feeling; what was real, and what was illusion!

A brilliantly conceived story brilliantly executed,"The Illusionist is one of those movies which not only demands a second viewing but demands a second viewing immediately after the first viewing has concluded. As soon as the closing credits begin to roll you'll want to go back and watch it again right that very minute to unravel this film's mysteries. What is illusion and what is real? The joy in this film is in finding the answer to that question.Set in Austria in the early 1900s The Illusionist has all the terrific visuals and costumes you would expect of a period piece. It also has terrific acting performances, most notably from Edward Norton as the title character, Eisenheim the Illusionist. Jessica Biel, after appearing in a string of altogether forgettable films in which she was required to do nothing more than look pretty, makes a bid to be taken seriously as an actress and absolutely succeeds. Rufus Sewell, who makes for a great villain, and the always reliable Paul Giamatti round out the key figures in the terrific cast. There is also a wonderful score by Philip Glass which sets just the right mood throughout. But for all the great visuals and acting and music what makes this film great is its story.The central figure here is Norton's Eisenheim who puts on a highly popular magic show in Vienna. One night Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, attends Eisenheim's show and here things get very interesting. Considering himself to be quite the intellectual, Leopold will be exceedingly frustrated by his inability to expose what he feels must surely be sheer fakery by Eisenheim. He will soon be even more frustrated when it becomes apparent the woman he intends to marry, Duchess Sophie, as played by Biel, would much rather be with Eisenheim than with him. It turns out Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood friends and now they clearly wish to reconnect. But the Crown Prince stands in the way. When Eisenheim takes the opportunity to embarrass Leopold in front of the elite of Austrian society Leopold takes it upon himself to make things rather difficult for the illusionist. Leopold can, and does, threaten Eisenheim's career but that is of little concern to Eisenheim. He simply wants the girl. Suffice to say Leopold can make things rather difficult for Eisenheim in that regard as well.There are plenty of twists and turns along the way but it is hard to see how Eisenheim and Sophie, these ill-fated lovers, can ever be together. Leopold simply will not allow it and you do not argue with the heir to the throne. With the aid of Police Inspector Uhl, played by Giammati, whose position requires him to serve the Crown Prince's every whim, Leopold is determined to keep Eisenheim and Sophie apart and, just for good measure, expose the illusionist as a fraud as well. It is obvious that while Leopold is utterly dismissive, Inspector Uhl has a healthy respect for Eisenheim and his abilities. Just what is Eisenheim capable of? As the movie progresses Eisenheim changes his act and begins to perform an entirely different kind of illusion. No rabbit out of a hat stuff here. These illusions are utterly shocking and serve to incite Leopold more than ever which it seems can only lead to Eisenheim's arrest. What exactly is Eisenheim up to? Why would he put himself in such a position? It all comes back to the simple question...what is illusion and what is real? In the end, all is revealed. Well not all, because that wouldn't be very magical. But we learn enough to appreciate the brilliance of Eisenheim. And we also can't help but appreciate the brilliance of this movie's story and the exceedingly clever way in which it unfolds. It's a fascinating, thought-provoking story and it is performed wonderfully by a terrific cast. Watch it once and you'll want to watch it again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Accents,"Was anyone else completely turned off to this film right at the beginning after noticing what little effort ANY of the actors put into their accents? I'm sorry, but no one sounded like they were born in Vienna. They all had these horribly overdone semi British accents where you just over pronounce every word to make it sound like you are speaking the dialect. I thought it was really pathetic, especially because Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are such great actors. There are language coaches in Hollywood, right? Or do filmmakers just not bother with that sort of thing anymore? Sorry, but it made the entire film unbelievable.Beyond that, pretty much everything else in the movie disappointed me also. But my first and major complaint would have to be the accents.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Worth the price of admission.,"It was either going to be Whicker Man or The Illusionist and thanks to IMDb we chose the better of the two which was The Illusionist. I read a few comments on this film and most of them were praising it. There were a few that said the acting by Jessica Biel was bad and that the ending was predictable. I didn't think Jessica put in an Oscar performance but she certainly wasn't bad - she did a fine job, i would have to say there was a part or two that were a little predictable but by no means did these two things make the movie bad in anyway. The movie keeps the viewer very much interested and Ed Norton does a great job as usual. Paul Giammati proves once again why he is one of the better actors in the business right now, he does a great job playing a chief inspector trying to discover how the mysterious magician played by Ed Norton does these very fascinating illusions. It is a little bit of a love story but it is not over done in anyway, it is suspenseful and will have you anxious to see the outcome, which I'm sure will not let you down.

Instead of trying to come up with adjectives to describe the experience, I will suggest instead - or rather implore - that you vigorously ignore any comments that will give anything away about this magnificently masterful (OK, OK, those are adjectives) film and just go see it.And no, I am not just saying this because Paul Giamatti (whom I have a group for at Yahoo - a not-so-subtle plug: http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/talkpaul/) co-stars in it and turns in yet another seamless, brilliant performance, and no, I'm not just saying this because I've always been a huge fan of my fellow Leo Edward Norton, who had me at hello years ago when I caught him in Primal Fear; this is an actor who has grown immensely with every role he's tackled since then, and his performance in this movie - along with Giamatti's - is Oscar-worthy.The Illusionist succeeds on levels that are far beyond the scope of any words, in any review. From the opening credits, there is a spell being cast, a palpable otherworldly feeling which permeates every frame of this masterpiece. What I'm saying is, the film starts off great and gets even greater. If you love movies like you say you love movies, this is the movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Illusory entertainment,"Neil Bunger's 'The Illusionist' most naturally compares with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', two large-budget films about turn-of-the-20th century magicians that came out at around the same time. Neither film is perfect. At times, 'The Prestige' felt unduly mechanical; 'The Illusionist', on the other hand, is arguably easier entertainment, but is in places corny, I don't really understand the bizarre range of accents heard in what is supposedly Viena (some actors speak in a Gemranic English, while others speak pure American) and the plot, though entrancing up to a point, doesn't quite make sense. 'The Prestige' pushed plausibility, and even invented its own laws of physics to explain its story, but it was internally consistent (and indeed, like most good stories, a story of dealing with constraints). 'The Ilusionist' appears, on the other hand, to rely on what seems like genuine magic: at the end, one of the leading characters has a sudden revelation as to how it was done, but the explanation still leaves a lot unanswered. In some ways, films like this one suffer a problem: they leave too little to the imagination. One goes to a show, one thinks one knows what one has seen, and the ""magic"" is that we have been tricked into having failed to grasp what has really happened. But the neutral, third-person point-of-view of a film seems to make a definitive statement as to what has occurred, so making illusion concrete and at the same time fantastical. This is a flawed film; but still an entertaining one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A thoroughly entertaining Millhauser adaptation,"Anyone who enjoys Steven Millhauser's fictional world of 19th century marvels of technology and engineering will be thrilled at the way this is all brought to life in this splendid adaptation, which is a feast for the eyes from beginning to end. Strong performances from Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell, effective scoring by Philip Glass, and excellent location photography (in Prague) add up to one of the best new pictures I've seen in years. A flashback sequence at the beginning which mimics the grain characteristics and transitions of early films is a marvel in itself; not only Millhauser's world is captured, but also the atmosphere of the waning days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. I can't imagine how it could have been better done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
It's a mystery....,"....why many rate The Illusionist so highly when it's average at best. There's a half decent cast nominally led by Edward Norton but his performance is erratic and unconvincing. However it's Paul Giamatti movie as he effortlessly acts every other player off the screen. Jessica Biel is incipid and Rufus Sewell plays the evil villain of the piece. At the heart of the plot is a love story so unbelievable it undermines everything the movie is trying to do and the big reveal at the end is so eye rollingly obvious you'd have to be blind not to see it coming. However at the core of the plot is a magic trick where the eponymous illusionist manifests ""ghosts"" on stage and even on one occasion has his conjured spectre walk through the audience. However this trick is never explained and that's a problem as it's the only genuinely interesting plot element. On the plus side the movie is well staged with good wardrobe, props and location shooting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Where is Edward Norton's Oscar?,"Superb acting, photography, directing and editing. Note that this is not even similar to PRESTIGE. Edward Norton pulls off another fantastic performance. Easily one of the top 3 consistent actors in the last 20 years. This is a love story, and a criminal story that you think you have solved within the first 30 minutes, but then the movie shows you more...did I really see and hear what was earlier? The illusions in the movie are fantastic tricks that make you go WOW! My wife & I ""marked out"" (carny term for believing) for the movie twice and we talked about it after the ending. Great way to spend 2 hours with family and friends enjoying a great mystery movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Too much talent doing very little effort,"The trailers proudly boast this production company also gave us ""Sideways"" and ""Crash."" The cast list indicates top notch talent usually doing their finest work in independent productions. But this film disappoints on so many levels. With the lone exception of Rufus Sewell, every other major performance is substandard work (I thought Edward Norten was sleepwalking and Jessica Biel seemed intend on keeping her dialogue a secret). Paul Giamatti made a half hearted attempt to give his character more layered traits than two dimensional cardboard performances of the others and his facial expressions were interesting when not being so forced.Rufus Sewell did explore new directions in villianry which was lost only once in that silly scene where his Crown Prince character went ""undercover"" as a commoner. Otherwise he, and he alone, was the only performance worth watching.The usual suspect when talent this good does performances this bad is an uninspiring script. And yes, Neil Burger's script is mainly the culprit. Right from the opening he uses trite devices of too much dialogue to start the story; committing the same crime of triteness at the end when 35 seconds of flashbacks is all we get for a payoff. Not that there was that much memorable dialogue to begin with. Maybe Jessica Biel, who whispered too much, had it right. You know a script writer is failing you when it is easy to mouth most everyone's next line because it is all so predictable. I did too many times.And for a real farce, Director Neil's staging of the Obligatory Sex Scene was more comical than anything else. It was unusually original for a bedroom scene but there is a good reason no one else has tried that approach.""The Illusionist"" main redeeming quality is the careful attention to detail to show 18th century Czech Republic and Budapest. It was a delightful 99 minutes of good history and colorful old world charm. I would have appreciated it more if this uninspiring movie was not in the way of the documentary and travelogue.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Smoke and mirrors,"The Illusionist is like the last ten minutes at the bar, right when bartender screams, ""Last Call!"" You're talking to a chick, so you think, you're chatting it up and doing great and floating on air...than the house lights come up. No. Cover your eyes, she's not so hot, not even a woman! A good movie starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell in a story about a magician that challenges the Prince of Austria for the love of a woman. Norton plays a celebrated illusionist Eisenheim, who's in love with a Duchess, Jessica Biel, but she's about to wed the prince, Rufus Sewell. The two lovers plan to deceive everyone and run off forever.The first half sets everything up and the second half shows us the con of the prince unfolding before us. If you like magic, than this is the film for you...well, for the first half of the film. Norton starts conjuring up ghosts and the city of Vienna rallies behind him because they think he's a spiritual leader. All the while, Sewell wants him shut down because the people like him.Two things I have against this film. Eisenheim seems to be such a good magician/illusionist that he doesn't fail at all...ever. The movie becomes a showcase of Eisenheim's skills and we're left with watching him pull off this con of making his love, the Duchess, disappear. Which you figure out if you had a half of a brain. Which brings me back to why I compare this to the last the minutes at the bar. You think it's great but once you start thinking back and breaking it down, the movie doesn't look good under the house lights...too much smoke and mirrors for me.A good film if you like period pieces, magic, mystery, strong performances by Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti and a good con. Better than most.3 stars Cave Man Reviews",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Stellar Performances,"I love rewatching this film. Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell and Eddie Marsan all give great performances. That being said, In my opinion Paul Giamatti stole this movie. He is the victorian gruff voiced police inspector who finds himself caught between the antagonists and protagonists. Caught between his admiration and duty.I'd seen him in his early character actor roles, but I've been following his career closely since 'Sideways' where he proved he could carry a film as the lead. He towers above some amazing actors in 'The Illusionist' which speaks to his abilities.

"All the right ingredients, but lacked that touch of magic","With a superb cast such as Norton and Giamatti, and a sprinkling of rave reviews from friends, I was expecting to see a film that would impress. What I got however was something far from a masterpiece and nowhere near the class that was 'The Prestige' which deals with a similar subject matter.So what was good? In a word, nothing. Norton did nothing to endear the audience to his character, in fact he was quite 'bland', which is disappointing as he has done some fabulous turns in other films. Giamatti gave a more solid performance, but tended to overact in parts and his face in the last scene was priceless! Biel did well as the elegant Princess Sophie, but she wasn't really around long enough for her character to actually do anything. In fact the best performance came from Sewell who made a convincing baddie that we all love to hate (but then he's done this before in 'A Knight's Tale' hasn't he?). Coupled with the poor acting the characters were just not strong enough.Then there was the plot. For me, the major problem in the whole film was the twist and my reasoning is this.. I am the last person to figure out twists, and when they happen I am normally stunned, shocked and confused - ""how did I miss it??"" This makes me the perfect person to watch mystery style films as I will always give the desired outcome. ""Why is this a problem?"" you ask. The problem is that I SAW THIS TWIST COMING A MILE OFF!!! Which meant for the rest of the film I was simply waiting for the answer to be revealed.And it was revealed... in a 'here's how it was all done' fashion, which when the likes of me can see the twist, it is slightly patronising to then reveal it in this way. In fact, had they had skipped this over-dramatised, ""look how clever we are"" scene, I could have been almost to my car and on my way home!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"Captivating story, incredible illusions, and all around great film!","The illusionist is the first film I've seen in a while where I had no idea what it was really about. I have to say that I was not disappointed at all! The film has a good story that really draws you in with mystery and romance. The illusions done by Norton as Eisenheim the Illusionist are FANTASTIC! The give the film a novelty feel that you are watching both a magic show and a movie at the same time. Furthermore, I've seen that some people are worried that the film will give away some secrets of how the tricks are done, but don't worry, aside from one comical scene between Giamatti and Norton, most of illusions remain as such throughout the movie.For the people who claim to be able to guess the ending, I agree with you, it is possible if you actively pay attention to whats going on instead of being drawn in by the overall story. However, I think that takes away from the fun of the movie, so unless you're the kind of person that must know how the trick is done instead of appreciating it for what it is, I would say, just sit back and enjoy the magic of The Illusionist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Excellent movie but for the lead casting,"One of the few movies of 2006 that is, in my humble opinion, worth watching. Viewers instantly empathize with the young Eisenheim, who loves a girl beyond his social status. My only complaint is with the casting of the 2 leads - both Norton and Biel are not the best choices to play Victorian characters.Norton's youthful voice fails to convey the melancholy and gravitas one would expect from Eisenheim. After all the teen shows and movies, Biel seems too lightweight to play Sophie's role. Their English accents were beyond laughable.The rest of the casting is stellar - Giamatti is superb as the inspector, as is Sewell as the crown prince. The background music is excellent and so is the soft lit cinematography. Kudos to a well written screenplay that mostly keeps you engaged.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The trick is to get people to watch this rubbish.,"With mixed reviews and opening closely to another magic film 'The Prestige' it is with trepidation I go to watch 'The Illusionist' and unfortunately the reviews were right. Ed Norton, complete with magical training prior to the role, is OK as the mephisto type conjurer and Paul Giamatti is brilliant as the Chief of police but elsewhere Jessica Biel is stale and Rufus Sewell as the prince spend most of his screen time looking like Kenny Everret. The story is basically a rehash of Romeo and Juliet and is so incredibly simple in its execution that the twist pretty much smacks you in the face. With very little plot and annoying voice-overs the film doesn't even benefit from a score by Phillip Glass and the fact that most of it is filmed in a sepia tinged haze, I imagine to suggest it is set in the past, makes it all the more frustrating to watch. What is quite a nice idea could have been handled better and would have resulted in an interesting movie; sadly it just ends up as boring and ultimately a big let down.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
This movie restrores me back to life,"There are 5 films that did just that to me: The Fountain, Taxi Driver, Fight Club, Deer Hunter, and Gattaca. The entire sequences of the film reminds us of the forgotten art of black-and-white films. The way the lighting and the camera focuses in the middle of the scene, the breath-taking use of lights, and gorgeous composed music. This movie makes you feel as if you are in a dream, hypnotize...whatever you may call it; and leave you thinking and trying to find the secrets that lies beyond the illusion...but you won't find it until Neil Burger give you a glimpse of what is going on, since you are already became a part of the illusion. You will feel magical. REAL magic is what this film possessed. And the best part of it is: you absorb the movie and it became a part of you. Those feeling never left. That overwhelms me with indescribable warmth that surge through me until now, that I am typing this.Do not compare this with 'The Prestige'. Just because 'Spartacus' is set in Rome doesn't means it is the same as 'Cleopatra'. But since 'The Prestige' came out first, the shining light of this film is blackened.This one deserve a watch.

"Magical, mysterious, miraculous mosaic of the magician's art.","I was absolutely amazed by the storyline and the dramatic presentation of the magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton). When the young magician initially tries to perform a ""disappearing act"" and fails, I was disappointed. However, when the magician goes ""east"" and studies the magical art and then returns to Vienna to perform ""a convincing disappearing act"" in public, I wondered who taught him and how he performed the act. The ""disappearing act"" throughout the history of magic has been associated with the esoteric knowledge of ""dematerialization."" The artistic renderings of the magician's art of ""disappearance or dematerialization"" in the movie reminded me of the story of the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana (a neo-Pythagorian), who magically disappeared from the court of the Roman Emperor Domitian in the first century C.E. In the case of Apollonius, in contrast to the illusionist Eisenheim, the disappearance was not an illusion.

Wonderful Film,"I recently watched this remarkable movie on DVD and all I can say is that I want to apologize to everyone involved who was responsible for the making of this movie. To the director, actors, writers and producers... I'm sorry for not having paid to see this at the cinema and for not supporting it sooner. I now own a copy on DVD and I'm recommending it to everyone I know.The Illusionist is a heady and heartfelt instant classic in my book. It dabbles with mysticism but never loses sight of character. It tells a wonderful story and keeps you guessing throughout. Marking its true greatness is the fact that the director utilizes every bit of the phenomenal acting talent that he assembled. Norton hits a home run, Giamanti is perfect and Biel displays acting chops to go along with her stellar beauty.

Now you see her ...,"Writer-director Neil Burger's adaptation of a Steven Milhauser short story, ""The Illusionist"" transports us to late nineteenth century Vienna, Freud, feudal lords and ladies and phantasms, the spiritualists' promise of a personally intimate hereafter.The setting is a flash-forward of fifteen years from the film's beginning in which we meet two teens, a young cabinet maker's son, set on his life's path after a chance meeting with an itinerant magician, and young Sophie, born to a much higher station. He presents Sophie with a hand-carved wooden locket containing a secret compartment into which he has put his photograph. Viennese society abhors the vacuum between their states; and so they are forcibly separated. We soon feel as if we're caught up in a fairy tale, made a bit uneasy by the proposition that these wizards and villains are real.Having adopted the stage name of Manheim the Illusionist, the young man, now an adult, Edward Norton, is fast becoming the darling of Viennese society; and at one performance, he asks for a volunteer, in response to which Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell, offers his beautiful companion, Jessica Biel, who happens to be Sophie.Leopold attends such entertainments as these not so much to be amused as to display how clever he himself is at unmasking the performers' gimmicks. He does not suffer frustration easily; and so vents his on Chief Police Inspector Uhl, Paul Giamatti, himself an amateur magician, always looking to learn more. Giamatti, son of a butcher, faces the same societal barriers and ceilings that the two youngsters encountered fifteen years earlier. The detective's career and political future are firmly tied to the level of approbation he receives from the nasty, vindictive Crown Prince. After a particularly embarrassing challenge,thwarted, Leopold insists that the Illusionist's stardom in Vienna must end. The volatile Leopold also announces his intention to marry Sophie. One is left to imagine his reaction at Sophie's rejection.After a time, Mannheim buys an old abandoned theater and makes a comeback, presenting a new type of illusion. No more sprouting orange plants or handky-bearing butterflies, Mannheim now conjures spirit emanations from the other side, astonishing and giving renewed hope to audiences in search of their own immortality. Can such trickery bring down a monarchy or threaten the succession?Edward Norton is both steely and vulnerable as the title character. Giamatti portrays Uhl, at once pressured, avidly inquisitive, deeply knowing and positively manic for things well done. Jessica Biel brings a vulnerable yet fiery Sophie into the plot. Rufus Sewell is both seething, condescending elitist and emotionally tortured perfectionist with no tolerance for disappointment, especially in himself. We get the feeling that the prospect of the throne, for all his display, weighs heavily on his shoulders.The absolute stars of the film are cinematographer Dick Pope and the magnificent settings provided by Petra Habova and Ondrej Nekrasil. If one listens carefully to the Philip Glass score, there are recurrent echoes of Glass' 1983 themes of ""Koyaaniqatsi.""One is reminded of the title. In this context lies the single flaw in the production. Yes, while photo imagery was a practiced art by the turn of the century, as were the wonders of smoke and mirrors, there does come a point where the envelope is pushed just too far; and at this point, the ability of the audience to suspend disbelief is diminished.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

The is enticing story perfect mix between genres it makes you think it's going to be a run-of-the-mill tragic romance story, but yet it mixes in drama as well as mystery and keep you wondering wants gonna happen. The first half of the movies dedicated primarily to setup the characters. Edward Norton does a good great job as This very soft-spoken calm, philosophical showman who you want to root for. While you really don't know all that much about him like apart from one narration very little details, but apart from that you don't know much about him but that in someway adds to his mystery. All of the show scenes has the camera angled low makes it feel as if you're more in the audience watching him and put in focus on what's going on to emphasize the theatrics around the Show.

"""The Illusionist"" is one of the best movies in years!","OK, I will not be setting any spoiler's in here.

This movie, I had not seen, due to it not getting it's ads, like so many, that was no where near as good, as this was! The plot is, a carpenter's son, that has a passion for being a magician. Then he fall's in-love with the duchess, as they are childhood friends. The settings are set, back in the early 1800's, where they are using those beautiful horse's and carriage's. That seem to set the mood, while watching the movie. The music in the background also helps. Pretty much everything comes together as a great movie! Edward Norton plays his character seamlessly, with his stare and so much more! Jessica Biel plays her character perfectly, as well. She set's the set, with her energetic personality, to find what she has been missing, for years. While, she feels she has to hide that energy, around certain people in the movie! But, the one that surprised me the most, was not the 2, that played the 2 main role's. But the man, who played the chief of police, which happens to have an enthusiasm in magic tricks and etc. Paul Giamatti plays his role, like I have never seen him play his role's! He also did his character perfectly! Rufus Sewell, play's his character, just as well as the other's did! I mean, they acted together, as a whole, not as separate parts. But, to inter-mesh them all together, to form one simple plot. But, with force behind it! The way they set the stage's up(The movie stage's and the character's stage's.), they set them, to seem, like they were from back in the early 1800's! I give props to not only the main cast. But the carpenter's & etc, that built the scene's! They all worked together, like their live's depended on it! The energy behind the whole movie, with the whole cast, is like they loved playing the character's and building the set's! I give this movie an easy 10, for their work on it! They did not use a ton of special effects, that did not go with the movie, like so many other producer's would love to do, just to spice-up the movie's. This movie has all the right special effect's, that does go with the movie! Now, I do suggest watching this movie at least 2 times. So, you can catch everything!

Illusionist vs Prestige,"Illusionist, to me, was an OK movie. But I was really seeing, and judging, it in the shadow of The Prestige. Both movies seemed to be fairly similar in many ways, but I thought Illusionist was more predictable, and also more confusing in some ways. Without getting into any spoilers, I felt all my questions were answered in the Prestige, while Illusionist left a couple things hanging. I suppose walking away with a little mystery sometimes isn't a bad thing. But in this case, it felt like I didn't get the answers promised or expected. Adding to that having guessed the ending early on, while Prestige was more of a surprise to me, made Illusionist less of an overall enjoyable experience than Prestige.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Great period drama movie,"The Illusionist (2006) was the first movie to be written and directed by Neil Burger. I just got done watching the movie and it was pretty good.Positives for The Illusionist (2006):
I like the premise of period piece setting of this movie and it has some amazing production value with the sets and the costumes. The movie's premise is very solid and I wa invested with what was going to happen. Edward Norton does a great job as Eisenheim the Illusionist and he manages to be very charming while also having some mystery surrounding his character. I also was surprised to see a very young Aaron Taylor-Johnson in this movie and even though he's in the movie for that long, his presence does make a impact on the movie. Paul Giamatti is great as the Chief Inspector who is very suspicious of Edward Norton's character. And finally, I liked how the movie ends and it had a pretty good twist to it.Negatives for The Illusionist (2006):
The movie is little too long and the pacing wasn't very good. There are moments where I thought the movie was halfway over, only to find out that it wasn't. It was strange and bizarre to see Jessica Biel in a period piece drama because she is too modern day looking for me to buy into her character. While the twist ending was good, it was clearly telegraphed early on in the movie.Overall, The Illusionist (2006) is a good period mystery drama with great performances and production value, but it's a movie that didn't do anything for me to it make a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"A Great Departure, and Moody Film","One reviewer call this film a fable. I think that's probably as good a term as any.What a different kind of direction. Yes, it's starts with a love story, which becomes a constant throughout.That love is written and played out in a genuinely meaningful & passionate way.The illusions themselves are best unexplained. One reviewer gave the movie a low rating because the illusions weren't explained. Really? That is ridiculous for two reasons. One: It's a movie, and by all accounts, a tale. Two: My wife & I have seen Criss Angel twice in Vegas and then from 3 feet away after the shows, and his magic/illusions were exponentially more outrageous than anything in this movie. The point is, nobody understood remotely how these things were being done and it's that very fact that made the show beyond excellent. In fact, his feats just plain defied mass, gravity, the flesh and space. They were impossible while being a reality.All that to say, somethings need not, and/or cannot be explained. And that is often what makes them entertaining. Can't we lend that to a good movie?Paul Giamatti was excellent, and as it happens, ultimately, the brave hero of the film.And Rufus Sewell is a natural as the bad guy. Not just a bad guy, but an arrogant, self absorbed, jealous, hostile jerk, not to mention a woman-beater. In fact, a character to be despised; even more so than when he played Winslett's total lowlife X boyfriend in 'The Holiday'.It's always a great blu ray watch; I'd say, once every couple years or so.Bob R.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Expect the 'expected' unexpected.,"Any film with a title like this is bound to have a sting in its tail, and the sting here isn't going to cause anyone much pain: in fact it's one of those unexpected twists we've pretty much come to expect. The ever dependable Paul Giamatti is the best thing in the film as the morally dubious chief of police, living in the pocket of the half-mad Crown Prince but still near enough to the streets to identify with Edward Norton's master illusionist. Norton is good, but he's a little difficult to swallow in a period piece, and his European accent is a little suspect at times. The reveal, when it comes, is a little sketchy  especially about Eisenheim's powers of resurrection, but it doesn't really spoil the film that much. I'm quite surprised at its high rating, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
too easy to guess the twist,"This movie really wasn't that great. First, it is to easy to guess what happened to Sophie when she is seen riding off slumped over on her horse by Inspector Uhl. If a movie is about illusion, then doesn't it make sense her death is another illusion.What I didn't like is the movie makes no attempt to explain Eisenheim's magic tricks. It makes him seem like a warlock. How did he make the ""spirits"" appear? And this is more of a love story. Eisenheim love's a girl above his social class. He is forbidden to see her as a boy. He eventually travels the world and learns his craft. He comes back to win her over. Only problem is she is to marry the crown prince. She can't leave him because the prince would hunt them down and kill them. So, Eisenheim must come up with a plan to keep the prince from trying to find them.FINAL VERDICT: The illusions performed were just to much on the supernatural side. Plus Ed Norton is too old to play Jessica Biels' love interest. I didn't think they had much chemistry.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Love Story wrapped around a mysterious plot!,"Director: Neil Burger, Genre: Drama, MysteryThe story is loosely based on Steven Millhauser's short story, Eisenheim the Illusionist. Director Neil Burger has ensured great visual consistency, with the story weaving fluidly through various locations, he has treated each locale as a vital part of the story. The movie is a love-story about a young carpenter boy who is in love with a duchess, but they are separated due to society constraints. He comes back as a reputed magician. Alongside, the duchess is about to marry a prince who has decided to overthrow the emperor. Rest of the movie is about the boy's clever plans to get rid of the Prince. Neil tries to bring in the romance, suspense, love, hate, jealousy, arrogance and ego in divulging the nuances of various characters. In spite of the movie having different threads all flowing simultaneously, Neil manages to tie them all together very well and never lets anyone get too far ahead of the other. The actors too have done a marvelous job. Ed Norton (the boy) is mesmerizing, Jess Biel (the duchess) is stunningly beautiful and Paul Giamatti (a police officer) playing an admirable role takes the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. Even though illusions were not clearly explained in the end, the grand finale where ""all is revealed"" remains a satisfying conclusion for the patient viewer fulfilling the lofty promises of the themes presented throughout the work. As a whole, the movie was a nice experience. It clearly portrays how the ambition can take its toll on even an intelligent man while love can make people do anything even if it is murder in a sort.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The lighting scheme and art direction are just top of the world in this film.,"The lighting scheme and art direction are just top of the world in this film. The cinematography is apt and so are other departments but the way the light is used has to be well appreciated.It's a period film on an illusionist and his love story and is brought out compellingly as any good writer director does. But what's interesting is the point of view. All the while when we presume that it's based on what the illusionist perceives, it's also what people around him think. Acting by Edward Norton as Illusionist is worth a mention. This is a great story interlaced with a good screenplay combined with fine acting and setup exquisitely beautiful. So we have a winner as a film aficionados and I loved this for all this.The climax where he brings back his own past, did mesmerize me just as it did to all the audience withing the film. Yes, he performs shows and shows illusions, some are just unbelievable. It is engrossing for sure but has a few lapses with long scenes like the one where the illusionist is grilled.All said and done, I recommend this movie for those who want a fantasy film that has mysticism embedded just to enthrall us to a very good amount of time.

Magically romantic,"The plot line here is simple enough. An adolescent romance is forcibly interrupted because of class differences between the boy (a commoner) and the girl (a duchess). Years later, they by chance reconnect, and the boy, now a man, is determined to overcome that pesky detail of class difference, and win back the love of his life. Around this simple core is woven a beautiful tapestry of beautiful cinematography, and a well acted tale that reaches into the realm, at times, of the hard-to-believe. The male of the romantic pair is a renowned illusionist/clairvoyant billed as ""Eisenheim,"" who successfully awes late 19th Century Vienna with his masterful illusions. His love interest happens to be a Duchess who is unhappily engaged to the rather self absorbed Crown Prince. How can he free the unhappy Duchess, and reclaim her for his own? This is where his skill in illusion really pays off, and for us, challenges our sense of the believable. However, I found that I really wasn't too concerned about how incredibly the plot came to resolution (I am deliberately trying to avoid spoilers here); I am a sucker for a good romance, and I felt sympathetic to the impassioned pair, so I went with it...and enjoyed it very much, lack of realism notwithstanding.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Good - but not earth shattering,"This is the type of movie I would like to have the leisure to watch at home as a rental - or an evening movie presentation on TV. Maybe I'm spoiled by cerebral twists at the theatre, but this movie was promising to be tantalizing but ultimately failed to deliver the expected punch. The character (Sophie), played by Biels, was two-dimensional at best. I was left puzzled as to why Norton's character - the Illusionist - found her so unforgettable - I certainly did. One kind of hopes that someone with his supposed depth would be mystified by someone with some zip or zap - not sip and sap. Sophie is an aristrocrat who the young illusionist befriends as a youth - and we're led to believe that puppy love blossomed between the two children until the young cabinet maker's lad (who later grows up to be the Illusionist) is sent away and the friendship is broken due to social class systems. Time quickly progresses and we see Norton again as a very talented magician. What follows is a rather hard to swallow plot - even for an illusion. Maybe I've grown cynical and need more to go on than baby love between two characters that have yet to convince me that I am rooting for their togetherness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

The Non-Prestige,"Let me first say that I had seen 'The Prestige' when it first came out, and was struck by how two so seemingly similar movies could come out at the same time...( like when a song called ""The Power"" came out in the early 90s to several artists.Of course having seen the movie, the two have nothing in common. They are so different it is a shame to even compare them. That being said I consider both to be wonderful ways to spend a few hours.I like Edward Norton..on a scale of 1 to 10, I like him about a 7, but he doesn't appeal to me nearly as much as Christian Bale, a supreme actor in my opinion; and although Hugh Jackman has done some stinker movies, when he is good he is really good.Paul G. may not have had a perfect accent, his mannerisms certainly made up for it. Bravo to him, I love that guy.The shooting in each is lovely, with a slight edge to The Prestige. The acting is great in each with a slight edge to The Prestige as well. Where this movie has a victory is ironically in it's simplicity. It is far more conventional a movie than The Prestige ( as one would expect given the directors ).I think that although The Prestige will have a long lasting cult following, this movie will in the end get the most accolades due to it's accessibility-chronological plot, conventional romance sub-plot, etc.Either way we all win. Both movies are great.MAN NOTE - I give Scarlett the credit for a cute face, but Jessica is surely the more mature sexual woman :) BOTTOM LINE - This film 7.5/10 ( damn worth watching ) The Prestige 9/10 ( A must see in my humble opinion )",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Guess I'm in minority, but The Illusionist fails on many levels","There are many positive reviews of The Illusionist out there, which can be a bit disconcerting to one who's just seen the movie and found it to be lacking on so many levels. I have to add my review here, just to give potential movie-goers a more balanced view, and share my own experience. I appreciate that so many who liked the movie include the fact that it is different from so much Hollywood fare (different in look, content, locale), but--while these elements 'could' have made for an engaging movie--they aren't enough. Despite its old-world look, The Illusionist actually reminded me of those abundant mediocre sci-fi films that forget that despite unusual locations and visuals, a movie requires a character-driven story and effective pacing to be interesting and engaging.Paul Giamatti (so outstanding in Sideways) tries to inhabit his 'inspector' role, and to create an interesting character. Edward Norton also can't be faulted for his acting. The problem is, this movie is terribly boring, and to offer a more cogent analysis, the screenplay (and/or direction) simply fail in so many areas to create any dynamic energy, give us an intimate view of characters up front that we want to follow, or create a story of real interest that pulls us in. It is wonderful that the movie is set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, but there are no panoramic shots of the city and architecture, or close-up shots of human activity and 'bustle,' that might help that location become a vibrant character in this film. There is no setup of political/historical context; later in movie we are supposed to become absorbed in political intrigue (the 'baddie' toward movie's end gives an impassioned outburst about his political mission), but we aren't familiar enough with his motives and mission, or the political climate and undercurrents of the city, to be interested. We are supposed to feel a connection to Edward Norton's character (Eisenheim,, a magician)we met him in childhoodbut there are no intimate, solitary, moments in the film to give us a sense of Norton's own connection to his childhood, or really any sense of his character or what drives him. There are magic scenes, but the movie seems to lack (again) an intimacy that would help us really feel Eisenheim's personal connection (or even obsession) to his craft, one that has surely occupied much of his time and energy, and there is a lack of real tension in most of the magic scenes. Long-shots of the audience, and their rapid-fire questions, also do little to really pull us into what could be strange and even mystical events unfolding in the room. There's a love story, and Jessica Biel is pretty. But she isn't interesting. We don't know her, on any level, or what (if anything) drives her character. Her scenes with Eisenheim lack (once again) the intimacy, or thoughtful dialog, or perhaps a slower pace, that might help us grow to feel an attachment to her. Her reaction to the 'baddie' character, who she has a relationship with, lacks substance or realism. She does not appear to be apprehensive about him, or respond to him with any amount of caution. If we could experience this tension with her, and she occasionally bravely stood up to him, we'd cheer her--but because she's always entirely unaffected, this potential device is wasted. This only contributes to another fault: the 'baddie' character is not well developed (we hear he does bad things, but we haven't seen those bad things, and we don't witness closely what drives him, so we don't feel he's particularly menacing or have much interest in him). He is merely a caricature, with occasional violent outbursts.This movie is heavy on dialog between Eisenheim and the inspector, but the scenes aren't intriguing. There is nothing pulling this movie forward. The end (I'll admit) was a surprise, mainly because the movie started moving at a faster clip and seemed to be communicating something. I was not expecting much of interest to happen. But it only illustrated how much better the lead-up could have been handled. In some ways, the movie tries too hard--it has the components that make for an interesting movie, but it never gels. A very weak screenplay and weak concept seem to be the problem. (I was so bored I left for an unnecessary trip to bathroom, and also explored the Art Deco/Egyptian hieroglyphics on the wall near my theater seat.) It was simply a very weak film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Magic Sleights,"""And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion . . . ."" Hecate in MacbethRomantic Vienna circa 1900, Crown Prince Leopold is too smart his lover says and Eisenheim the Illusionist may be even smarter. Director Neil Burger creates an entertaining and rich tapestry of sets and costumes to enhance the heavily woven plot that pits star-crossed lovers from different classes and thrusts the chief of police squarely between the crown and the magic. Phillip Glass's minimalist music is an effective counterpoint to the intricate décor.When Eisenheim (Edward Norton) entertains the prince (Rufus Sewall), not only is the first half of the film mesmerizing (literally and figuratively), but it is also charged with challenges as the prince wants to know Eisenheim's secrets, the biggest of all being Eisenheim's childhood friendship with Sophie (Jessica Biel), a renewed relationship with potential for much more.Once the film establishes the combatants, the chief (Paul Giamatti) is a referee with a growing conscience. Giamatti once again inhabits a role with bulging, darting eyes that say much more than dialog ever could. At any rate, the last half of the film devolves into intrigue telegraphed by the director, at odds with the whole theme of illusion. In effect, we know too much to keep a sense of wonder established by the early stage performances of impressive magic tricks.Lost to us as well is the innocence that made us believe all we see in film, the greatest illusionist of all time. But then, love is for some an illusion, for others a reality too hard to bear. The Illusionist shows us both sides, and we're never certain where the truth lies.

As the film progresses, it manages to captivate its audience with an array of unbelievable magic, inspiring wonder and a sense of mystery, as I believe it intended. The story was somewhat predictable, as movies of this kind seem to reveal suspense at the very end. One such example is The Prestige.

"Very pleasant, entertaining and well done.","This film is a kind of romantic tale based on the seemingly impossible passion between a poor boy who becomes an illusionist and a rich girl who belongs to the highest aristocracy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Separated in their youth, they will be reunited years later, but she is engaged to the cruel Crown Prince. When she appears dead, the magician will do everything he can do for the Prince to be investigated.The first thing I must say is a warning: this story is totally fiction, although it has been made on a historical background. The Austrian prince of this film never existed. Now let's continue... When I first started watching the movie I realized one thing: it's pleasant, entertaining and the main characters are good enough to make the public feel emotions about them. The audience will probably like the magician and the duchess but will also quickly feel angry for the prince. This mix of emotions links the audience more strongly to the screen and will hold their attention until the end. However, the ending was what surprised me the most, since I was hardly expecting anything more, but when the movie seems to be over, the final part truly begins. Edward Norton was quite convincing in the character of the impassioned illusionist, as well as Rufus Sewell and Paul Giamatti. Jessica Biel also looked good, although her character didn't have the same presence of the male cast. In short, this film is very interesting and is really well done.

"Beautiful, engrossing film just misses full satisfaction","The interesting, surprisingly effective casting of Norton, Giamatti and Biel in the title role, the police investigator and the lady involved with a prince (even, to a lesser extent, Sewell's slightly over the top crown prince) combine with outstanding cinematography and an atmospheric story to make a film that just misses being a quiet classic.The fascinating tie of the original short story (and screenplay) to a period of European history once wildly over worked in popular theatre and literature - the Mayerling scandal - has enormous potential for reexamination. The story's (by then) married crown prince killed himself some years LATER at his hunting lodge at Mayerling for reasons which have never been adequately explained with a woman who may or may not have been his mistress. His successor in the position of heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire had his own tragic but passionate love story that culminated in the start of the First World War following his assassination on his 14th Wedding Anniversary (he had taken his Sophie away from the strict court protocol of Vienna to oversee maneuvers outside Serejevo as a romantic gesture for their anniversary).None of this unfortunately is touched on in this lush, enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying film. Would that it were - rather than merely offering a simple, nicely told, but all too fictional special effects mystery/love story.So much of the history we think we know comes from our popular entertainment (Shakespeare's RICHARD III is a rattling good thriller, but lousy history), it is more than arguable that writers on the page, stage or screen who take their settings and inspiration from our history have an active obligation to get as many of the FACTS right as possible. Ultimately, it even makes good commercial sense (how much longer would THE ILLUSIONIST have stayed in theatres with the added intrigue of knowledgeable audiences arguing if something like this could have been the reason Leopold ultimately killed himself!?).Since both of the essential figures at the center of the film we were given were based on real people (the actual illusionist lived to be murdered by Nazis in the next century under Hitler's rule), how much we ought to wish that the writers had worked harder and woven their story closer to actual known events. It could have only enhanced the basic story they chose to tell.The research as to the look and feel of the movie - as far as it went - is admirable, but there are distressing misconceptions in the director's commentary on the DVD. For the most part these are simply the misconceptions of a partially educated but bright - and very talented - 20th century film maker, but they contribute to the few weaknesses in the film itself.Case in point: the director goes out of the way to point out that the scenes at the ""crown prince's estate"" were filmed at one of the actual estates of the eventual heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. It was, in fact, his hunting lodge (at a time when a royal hunting lodge was a palace), and the director remarks disapprovingly on the high ceilinged hall covered with the Archduke's hunting trophies. The director calls the hall ""horrifying"" and speculates that the ""bad karma"" of the ""thousands of slaughtered animals"" eventually caught up with the archduke when he himself was murdered. That analysis *might* seem apt for the heavyhanded (slightly psychopathic) Crown Prince Leopold the director is painting from a 21st century perspective, but IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ACTUAL ERA OF THE STORY, it would have marked the hunter - as it did our own Teddy Roosevelt who helped establish our National Park system - as a committed naturalist and the opposite of the image the director imagines.This was a real opportunity missed, but a very enjoyable film for what is there. The screenplay keeps the audience guessing a little too long - one or two slightly more obvious clues earlier on would have paid off enormously later on in the satisfaction level. The unexpected depth of Norton and Giamatti's performances however finesse most problems of what one initially suspects are ""tricks"" more CGI ""sweetened"" than they may actually have been (if the director is to be believed).Worth a look. For most of us, the biggest problem will be wanting a film we enjoyed to have been even better. It could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Enjoyable 19th-Century Mystery-Fantasy About the Power of Illusion,"In the wake of the Enlightenment of the late 17th and 18th centuries, the 19th century saw a rise in interest in the occult, mysticism and magic. Séance ceremonies, fortune-telling, occult literature, and magic acts became widespread in popularity, and much of this interest in matters supernatural and the inexplicable have survived into the 21st century. However, from circa 1845 until the death of Houdini in 1926, magic and illusion were some of the most popular theatrical acts in Europe and America. (Previously performing magicians were often among traveling shows, and today only a handful of magic performers have national and international fame.) ""The Illusionist"", starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel, is a throw-back to the 19th century's obsession with mysticism and magic.Edward Norton, in a compelling atypical performance, plays Eduard Abramovich, an Austrian provincial, who has made a name for himself as Eisenheim the Illusionist. The film begins in 1889 with the last of a series of controversial theatrical illusions in which apparitions of dead people appear on stage at Eisenbeim's bidding and speak to the audience. Chief Inspector Walter Uhl (Giamatti) stops the performance and arrests the illusionist on the grounds of disturbing the peace. He was sent to arrest both Eisenheim and the performances by Crown Prince Leopold of Austria (Rufus Sewell). Giamatti then meets with Prince Leopold later the same evening and recounts the story of Eduard Abramovich and his rise from lowly peasant to magic superstar who has a following similar to Harry Houdini.Most of the film is a flash-back from a young Abramovich meeting an elderly magician and then befriending a girl betrothed to the crown prince, Duchess Sophie von Teschen. The two are caught spending time together, and are separated not only because of class but because the duchess is already promised to the crown prince. Fast-forward 15 years, and Abramovich, now known as Eisenheim, is wowing audiences with incredible tricks. The crown prince and duchess, intrigued with rumors about the magician, attend one of his performances, and the duchess is selected to participate in one of the spectacles.Intrigued, the crown prince invites the magician for a private performance. Then Eisenheim inadvertently humiliates the crown prince in a trick involving the prince's sword, and the love between the duchess and the performer is rekindled. Sensing the magician is not only challenging his political power in the eyes of his subjects but may have designs on his fiancé, the crown prince orders the arrest of Eisenheim. His lust for power and control ends in an unexpected fatality.This is just a really entertaining movie, somewhat similar to fantasies in the earliest days of Hollywood entertainment. Transitions between scenes sometimes use the old-style kaleidoscopic/tunnel wipes often associated with silent movies. Certainly, Norton's character is the center of attention, but equally good are the supporting characters played by Giamatti, Biel, and Sewell. Giamatti does a fine job of straddling between the inspector of Vienna pledged to uphold the law while doing the bidding of the power-hungry crown prince. Biel is convincing as the duchess not quite enamored with the power of Austrian royalty. I also thought Sewell's performance was superb as the crown prince who seems at first very sure of his existing political power but then finds himself gradually losing its grip. A nice twist at the end makes for a very satisfying cinematic experience. Maybe not quite ""The Prestige"", one of the best films on a similar subject, ""The Illusionist"" still uphold very well on its own.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
What mystery?,"The real mystery is why anyone should put up the money to make such a blatant piece of garbage. Badly written, badly directly, badly photographed, and excruciatingly badly acted, there is nothing to recommend this at all. If you liked the Phillip Glass, then go out and buy the cd. Otherwise don't waste your time. One can easily why an egomaniac like Norton wanted to do this. He gets to do an 'accent'. The problem is, his English accent is abysmal at best and embarrassing at worst, and often just plain non-existent. As to the others, only Giamatti manages not to embarrass himself (except for the fact that he did this trash in the first place). As to the mystery, there is none. It's obvious from the first 20 minutes to anyone with half a brain. So the remainder of the film just slogs along to it's inevitable conclusion at a snail's pace. Hopefully, the writer/director won't soon be allowed to make another such piece of trash for some time, but I doubt that. This is what passes for 'intelligent' in today's Hollyweed, more's the pity.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
I love it!,"The Illusionist is well-crafted, keeping the audience in suspense with its blend of mysteries and twists. It's similar to The Count of Monte Cristo and The Prestige, which were both released in the same year.Edward Norton's performance as Eisenheim is outstanding. He dominates the stage with ease and even pulls off an ambiguous British accent. As Detective Uhl, Paul Giamatti gives a great performance, struggling between loyalty and justice. Jessica Biel's performance as Sophie, however, falls short, with her unconvincing accent detracting from an otherwise decent performance that is overshadowed by her co-stars.Despite my preference for more naturalistic color grading in cinematography, the heavy gold tint used in The Illusionist adds a unique visual style that works well. The decision to use a full-screen aspect ratio instead of cinemascope also contributes to the movie's overall appeal.Deciding which movie is better between The Illusionist and The Prestige is a challenge. The Prestige offers a more cerebral experience, while The Illusionist takes on a more romantic tone. Both movies, however, are worth watching for their unique features.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"A Slight Misfire, but Fine","""The Illusionist"" is not really bad, nor is it really good, setting it aside form the far superior ""The Prestigfe."" The performances are good, and the leading actors show us just how much fun they had making the film. Paul Giamatti is especially brilliant as Chief Inspector Ool. His accent is purposefully comical, and he brings the much-needed fun factor to the film. Ed Norton and Jessica Biel are given very little to do dramatically, but they do it just fine.The real problem is that the film is not particularly interesting. The plot is very typical and dull at times, involving an arranged marriage, a wicked prince, a poor lover, doomed love, and a police investigation. The end, which I will not reveal, is also a disappointment. A word to the creators: there does not need to be a logical explanation for everything. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.Still, ""The Illusionist"" has its kicks. Some scenes have a fittingly magical quality, the costumes are terrific, the set pieces are fitting and enchanting, and the Oscar-nominated cinematography is beautifully golden and crisp. It's a good film, but lacks greatness. Still, I would recommend it for the fun performances and beautiful look of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

OK period piece,"Like THE VILLAGE, THE ILLUSIONIST is a romance and not a thriller. Unfortunately, like THE VILLAGE, THE ILLUSIONIST was advertised as a thriller. Edward Norton plays a German woodworker's son in the late 19th century who falls for a beauty of aristocratic birth, portrayed by small screen actress Jessica Beale. They are forced apart but run into each other again years later, when Norton has returned to town as a prestidigitator known as Eisenheim. The remainder of the movie details their attempts to help her escape the clutches of a nefarious prince, played by Rufus ""Dark City"" Sewell, who senses in Eisenheim a threat to his rule. It is a classic plot, one that has been employed since the days of the Greek Empire. Paul Giamatti plays the stern but secretly compassionate chief inspector of the city. Surprisingly, Eisenheim's magic tricks are subdued and subtle, and the CGI is used sparingly, at least until the big finale. The costuming and sets are first-rate, and the unusual cinematography creates a definite mood. Unfortunately, the twist ending is telegraphed early on, and once more I want to warn you this is a romance, not a thriller. THE ILLUSIONIST plods along a bit, especially after misfortune besets the lovers, and Norton underplays his role to the point of being almost absent. Beale is a natural beauty, but unfortunately not much of an actress. See THE ILLUSIONIST for Sewell, a much undervalued actor, and the jovial Giamatti, who gets the last laugh. Also, the legendary Philip Glass wrote the haunting score.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Excellent and atmospheric,"One of the best movies I have seen in recent years. I went to see it mostly because I like the art of illusion and I have a 12 year old son who is learning card tricks. I ended up totally immersed in the film. Great and intriguing story, romantic but never cheesy, that ends on a totally unexpected twist. Fantastic performance from Giamatti and Norton, as for Biel, well, she is beautiful. It is also artistically filmed, very atmospheric, with good dialogues and sense of humour. Reading a few negative critics, some people seems to complain about the unrealistic nature of the illusions. It seems that they have never watched illusionists like David Copperfield or Darren Brown. I was in Courchevel three weeks ago and in our hotel we had a magician who everyday was performing excellent tricks and was making things disappear right in front of you. I didn't complaint because I couldn't understand how he was doing it! But I guess it's a genre you like or you don't. I watched the movie with my wife who loved it and her sister who didn't like it at all, and usually they always agree! Anyway, I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Its one of those films that i could watch five times over in a row. A great compliment seeing as it is not the fastest film in history. Edward Norton demonstrates his unbelievable ability play a wide range of characters. The only performance which tops the illusionist is of course American History X.

enjoyed movie but was frustrated with filming,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movies acting. The script development was superb. I enjoyed the shots of the castle. I had just visited Vienna and enjoyed seeing familiar buildings. You really have to pay attention through out the movie if want to understand it. It sort of reminds me of a M. Night Shamalyan movie. You have to really pay attention to details. Nothing is as it seems. Ending didn't catch me completely by surprise but still enjoyed. My only frustration was the microphone showing up at the top of the screen. It kept appearing in at least 3 scenes. It was very annoying, especially for such a high budget film. Either the grip or editor should be docked in pay. Other than that, I recommend seeing the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion."" - Eisenheim","After seeing such a disappointing piece of garbage like 'The Black Dahlia' last night, I was really praying that the next film I'd see this weekend would be better. Towards the beginning of the film I had my doubts due to it's semi-lagging pace, but once it sped-up and ended, I realized I just saw one of the best films of the year, thus far. 'The Illusionist' is not only a compelling and very well made motion picture, it's a throughly enjoyable one as well.Edward Norton, after taking a huge break, comes back to film as Eisenheim, a very famous and mysterious magician in turn-of-the-century Vienna. Eisenheim is a very articulate magician who is anything but arrogant. After impressing pretty much every citizen in Vienna including a bumbling police inspector played by Paul Giamatti, the prince of Vienna played by Dark City's Rufus Sewell comes to one of Eisenheim's shows. It is there where Eisenheim lays his eyes on the Prince's soon to be wife, Sophie (Jessica Biel), whom he had fallen in love with ten to twenty years prior. That's about all I'll tell you about the plot of 'The Illusionist', in fear I may give something away. It's a film that should be experienced without a lot of prior knowledge about the plot. Just remember it's a period piece about a magician.'The Illusionist', the second film by Neil Burger, is a masterfully crafted film. Although it has it's flaws like being poorly paced at the beginning and a little bit towards the middle, the film captivates it's audiences once it starts going and doesn't let go. Burger's directing is well-done, but it's his writing that one should admire the most out of the two. The film is filled with first-rate performances all around, which one could argue is the strongest aspect of it. Edward Norton delivers yet another incredible performance as Eisenheim. He makes the character his own bringing this strange sense of warmness to Eisenheim I feel couldn't have been done by many other actors. Paul Giamatti is marvelous as well in a role he usually doesn't play, which is perfectly showcased by his performance in the ending sequence. Norton and Giamatti play off each other perfectly, not too much of a surprise seeing as though the two highly- gifted actors were roommates in College. Even though Norton and Giamatti steal pretty much every scene there is in the movie, Jessica Biel is quite good in her role. She actually makes me believe for the first time in her career that she could be labeled a ""very good actress"". Sewell is great in his limited role as the mean-spirited prince and British actor Eddie Marsan (21 Grams, Gangs of New York, Vera Drake) is solid in a small part as Eisenheim's manager.In conclusion, 'The Illusionist' a great little surprise this fall that will satisfy most of it's viewers. I highly recommend it based on the stellar performances and smooth script alone. Grade: B+ (screened at Harkins Arizona Mills 24, Tempe, Arizona, 9/16/06)",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Severely under-acted,"It's really a pity that a movie with an interesting script twist, so rare in Hollywood, strong actors, beautiful costumes and landscapes is acted in such a disastrous way. Only Giamatti is above reproach, and Sewell does his part well, even though it's only 'black hat through-and-through'. Norton for some reason never even tries, maybe, cannot figure out what is it exactly that he's doing. The biggest problem are extras - somehow they all manage to speak in unnatural voices - as if they try very hard to emulate Austrians, but have no clue what those strange creature are supposed to sound like. Also keeping costs low makes ""crowds"" in Vienna ridiculously small - it's hard to believe that this ""mob"" of 40 people will storm precincts.Again, a real pity given a promising plot...",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Disappointing but, mysteriously, worth it","When reading the multitude of usual press guff in the dailies, this film appeared to be mature, intelligent period piece, which appealed to me because it tried to combine a conventional story of magic and special effects, with something altogether more adult, namely the themes of government and conspiracy.Turn of-the-century Europe was beautifully evoked with marvellous ornate sets and locations. The highly-polished and painstakingly lit cinematography portrayed a stuffy and hierarchical society and was aided by superb, understated special effects when master-illusionist Eisenheim stuns his rapt audience with amazing tricks. Burger used his scenario of illicit lovers (as Eisenheim tries to steal his childhood sweet-heart back from the arrogant, sadistic Prince Leopold) as a means of providing an alternative history to the birth entertainment for the masses. Leopold's hatred for Eisenheim is generated not only out of romantic competition or the usurper magician's veiled insults, but by the possibility that Eisenheim might steal the Prince's subjects. Eisenheim's generosity to street children, his rags-to-riches story and his attraction of the people are metaphors for the power of the media to undermine a country's rulers. The magic tricks, perhaps made possible by back projection through smoke in one instance, are early forms of computer trickery which typify much of modern cinematic output.Sadly, these themes are dissipated as the story continues.The script began to focus on the rivalry between Eisenheim and Leopold over Duchess Sophie, and thus the story boiled down to history of rivals in love. Eisenheim and Leopold became crudely delineated protagonist-antagonist, the former generous and mysterious, the latter cruel and boorish. There is no doubt where our sympathies should lie, and this lack of complexity undermines the film's context, that of a Europe on the cusp of the twentieth-century and inevitable war. Eisenheim and Leopold could have acted as a metaphor for an increasingly fractious political climate, but they simply become duellists.Nor does the film's plot sustain much interest in the third act. The 'twist' that arrives is not unexpected because of a framing device used at the start of the film and Eisenheim's very profession: we know he will save his greatest magic for the end, and it won't be on stage. Furthermore, the subsequent interpretation of Eisenheim's masterstroke by policeman Uhl only further detracts for the air of mystery. As a result, the last third suffers from serious dull patches. The film leaves a lasting impression but only on the technical rather than scripting level: the sepia-toning, excessive grain on the print and frequent iris shots all indicate the birth of cinema, taking place inside the film's time frame. This perhaps makes one reflect on the very construction of cinema, and how much it has changed since the 1900s, but it does not make one think of how history is written.That said, I'm probably taking this much too seriously. Come on people, when was the last time we saw a film that took such care in telling such potentially hokey story, and succeeded in loading it with such thematic weight? Can't think. And for all my complaints, it remained an engrossing yarn. This is worth seeking out  it cast quite an incredible atmospheric spell over me at times  but be cautioned: it is never quite as entertaining as you might want, nor as intelligent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

Don't mention The Prestige!,"If I might start with an incredibly clichéd opening line, you wait years for a movie about magicians (which doesn't include a lightning-scarred moppet as the central protagonist) then two come along at once. And just as Armageddon followed Deep Impact, Neil Burger's The Illusionist followed Christopher Nolan's The Prestige to the screens back in the summer of 2006. Now that both are available on DVD, it gives all of us amateur film critics that populate this website a chance to evaluate them on their own strengths but in truth, the only real similarity between the two is the presence of stage magic as a plot device. And while I must admit to having enjoyed Nolan's movie far more, The Illusionist is without a doubt the more sophisticated of the two.While The Prestige relied on showmanship and a scantily clad Scarlett Johanson you see, The Illusionist relies on acting. To put it simply, there is not a single bad performance in the entire movie. Paul Giamatti for instance is fantastic, a dignified and mature performance who comes to be the on screen foil for all of us watching the movie; perplexed by the magic, he both desires and rejects its secrets, while at the same time wishing the damn magician would just do what he's told, yet rejoicing when he doesn't. Ed Norton meanwhile puts in another reliably magnificent turn as Eisenheim the Illusionist. Norton as should be common knowledge now is one of the finest actors of his generation and he inhabits every inch of his character. As such, Eisenheim is both a brilliant man and a lonely one, with a couple of odd quirks about him, the sort of person you'd go to watch in a theatre but wouldn't stick around to collect the autograph afterwards.They are ably backed up by Rufus Sewell as the scheming Prince Regent of Vienna and Jessica Biel as his betrothed, secretly in love with Eisenheim. Sewell is so deliciously evil he could have walked out of a Sherlock Holmes novel, while Biel shakes off any sense of being a teen pin up icon and handles herself adeptly alongside all the 'proper' actors on screen. She also seems remarkably relieved to be in a film where she can be a little more feminine than usual and not have to worry about blowing things up all the time.Excellent though the acting may be however, the underlying story sadly, isn't as effective as you might hope. The plot synopsis on this page sums it up nicely so I won't bother to reiterate the details, but it unfortunately turns into a rather straightforward revenge drama. Compared to the cat and mouse games of the Prestige, it follows a far more linear path and isn't anywhere near as tense, intriguing or exciting.On the plus side however, the magic tricks are a natural high point, though I'm sure there will be plenty of you out there frustrated by the lack of explanation for all of them. So while we might get a glimpse at the document which explains how Eisenheim is able to grow an orange tree out of a pip in the space of a few minutes, a glimpse is all it is. Even so, this refusal to reveal the secrets perhaps gives The Illusionist a lot of its strength, for it imbues Eisenheim with an otherworldly and supernatural air. Is he really performing all these tricks for real? No, he can't be...Watch it with the lights switched off and a few candles burning and it'll be a delightfully unreal evening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Quite predictable, but great anyways.","I don't get why people try to compare the plot twist of this movie to movies like the prestige or memento, the ending part was, at least for me, predictable and didn't shock me at all.

The thing is, with everything looking so real and fascinating, the movie doesn't really have to have an insanely complicated plot or a superb plot twist at the end, it kind of amuses the viewer just by that.

Another Great Edward Norton Movie,"I have to say Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti made a great work in this movie. I like Edward Norton's accent(as I liked in ""The Painted Veil"").

But after that many years, why they are still in love? That is the most important part of movie which was skipped. I remember Rufus Sewell from Dark City. But this time I think he was not that good at all. He was playing a jealous prince, is this really a picture of jealous prince? I don't think so.

The boy grows up to be a young man with a special talent which amazes people where-ever he goes and threatens those who it have it all and think they deserve it.Pity those who do not understand this power or the magical love planted in the hearts of young ones trapped in unforetold destiny.Along with the usual attractions, The Illusionist accomplishes something few movies do - all the characters were extremely interesting.

I found myself actually paying attention to everyone in this movie just like we pay attention to a magician who is about to attempt tricking his audience.You may have noticed I rated this a 7. There are problems and that's why I didn't rate it higher. The Illusionist needed a better score. while it was pleasing for the most part, it seemed out of synch during some important parts of the movie.

Honestly couldn't tell if it was the poor Cinemark projection system in our brand new theater, or whether the film was intended to have many ""soft spots"" (focus), and soft edges (again, focus). Paul Giamatti (Stern's ""Pig Vomit"") did an outstanding job with the film. Very talented actor! Worth the money to see the film, but was a little disappointed in the ""culmination"" (you'll understand if you see it). Weakness, to me, was in the lack of sense that there was any strong love interest (probably on the editing room floor to cut the time down).

Light touch and great performances,"The Illusionist is set in the Vienna (not Venice) of the turn of the last century and draws on the Mayerling Affair as one of the threads of inspiration for the story on which it is based.

Edward Norton continues to demonstrate a talent normally associated with only a few exceptionally great actors on the order of Olivier and Orson Welles. Paul Giamatti is excellent as is the entire cast. What is most striking is the evocation of the period in the cinematography.

"Beautiful, unusual and eminently watchable","Is there any acting role that the fantastically talented Edward Norton can't pull off? In ""The Illusionist"", he takes on the role of Eisenheim, the turn-of-the-century Viennese magician and entertainer who gets caught up in a love triangle. And what we get as an audience is a real treat: A beautifully-shot, superbly acted, mind-bending mystery and love story.The plot is at once simple and complex. On its face, it's a basic love triangle between Eisenheim, his childhood love, the Duchess Sophie, and her fiancé, who just so happens to be the Crown Prince (and who has a streak of jealousy and a nasty temper). Eisenheim and Sophie reconnect after she attends one of his performances, and the tension builds as the audience is left to wonder how the whole thing will play out.Edward Norton plays Eisenheim as an inscrutable, mysterious man who can speak volumes with his eyes. Paul Giamatti is a pleasant surprise in his role as the not-entirely-corrupt Chief Inspector Uhl. And Rufus Sewell is a treat as the villain in the movie, Crown Prince Leopold.The one thing that threatened to ruin this movie for me was the casting of Jessica Biel as Sophie. A lot of people maintain that this movie proves her acting ability; I disagree. She was wooden, cardboard almost, and her performance looked ridiculously amateurish next to the skills of Norton and company. Sorry, guys, I know you might like to look at her, but she can't act.Besides that, this is a fantastic movie and is highly worth seeing. No, I won't ruin the ending for you, if you haven't been spoiled already.

"A decent magic-based film that suffers from inevitable comparison to ""The Prestige""","""The Illusionist"" is an interesting period piece set in turn-of-the-century Vienna. It centers around a magician (Edward Norton) who becomes enmeshed in political intrigue when his highborn lover (Jessica Biel) becomes engaged to the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell).I have long been a fan of Norton's but for some reason he seemed slightly out of place here. Strangely, Paul Giamatti, whom I expected might seem out of place was in fact ideally suited to his role. Nevertheless, Norton does deliver a skillful performance, as do the other principle actors, namely Giamatti, Biel & Sewell.The script grabbed my attention with a mix of political intrigue, phantasmagoria and romantic pursuit. However, I did get the feeling that the story was stretched just a little too thin in the long run, which is not so surprising considering that the source material is only of short story length. It is also worth noting that the story is noticeably slight in comparison to the similarly-themed film ""The Prestige"".The direction and score are ably handled but not especially noteworthy. The effects surrounding the various magic tricks are well done if not exactly breathtaking. More importantly they are not overemphasized to the point of detracting from the story.In the end, I found the film enjoyable as a whole. Not perfect but certainly magical enough to make for a memorable viewing experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

The Illusionist,"~Wow! My boyfriend and I had heard of the Illusionist movie but had not planned on seeing it. I think the problem was that we had not heard enough about it. He went to blockbuster to rent a few movies, one of which was ""the prestige"", however, when he left he didn't know the title. He mistakenly grabbed the box for ""the illusionist"", which we had expected to be the other movie when he put it in. after watching a little while and realizing it was not the same movie, I checked out the box.~ After watching this movie, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was wonderful: ACTION, DRAMA, FORBIDDEN ROMANCE, SUSPENSE, and of course, MAGIC! I stayed on the edge of my couch throughout most of the movie, The twists and turns plus all the action totally kept me into it! A great movie to see!! It was definitely worth the money to rent it, even the late fees! I wish I could've seen it in a theater!!! ~After taking this back and renting ""The Prestige"", I could hardly even keep my attention on it after being so wowed by ""the illusionist""!~",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
I expected more,"This film had great reviews. I had heard it being called the years favourite magician movie. This coming in the same year as Christopher Nolan's fantastic ""The Prestige"" came as very high praise. It had Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti in it so that just improved the excitement level.It was mediocre. The plot was alright but i just felt a little disappointed. The film lacked punch. Giamatti was pretty good as the Inspector but what i was most disappointed with was Norton, on cruise control throughout the entire film. I've read other people say he's mesmerizing and fantastic. He's not. Compared to American History X and Fight Club, this is a very reserved performance. Just because he has an accent doesn't mean its a masterful performance. Its average. As is the film.Its an enjoyable watch. But not enjoyable enough to be a romp. Its good, but no way near good enough for award recognition. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Edward Norton is intensely persuasive, and the whole film is captivating, plot in suspension - ever the 'mindbending' reservation of truth or illusion","""The Illusionist"" is a treat of a period costume drama which we've not seen much lately in cinema (""Age of Innocence"" and ""Somewhere In Time"" came to mind). Hollywood is not short of epic period movies with action/battle scenes. Here, it's a different kind of battle - one of the mind - an almost 'whodunit' plot line weave in with romantic love story and 'mindbending' magic. A remarkable feature film formidably delivered by writer-director Neil Burger, with supportive producers who are just as passionate about the production of this film. The magic is not of the 'usual' kind employing mere tricks to the eye - it is more perceptual and hypnotic.Impressed by Edward Norton's performances ever since his chilling antagonist role in ""Primal Fear"" 1996 opposite Richard Gere, and in ""American History X"" 1998, he practically outdone himself. Following ""Fight Club,"" he made his directorial debut ""Keeping the Faith"" 2000, taking a break from his intense roles and having fun acting with Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman in the delightful romantic comedy. With Julie Taymor's ""Frida"" and Spike Lee's ""25th Hour,"" he's such a skillful actor that there's no disappointment ever. In ""The Illusionist,"" his focused intensity is mesmerizing and sure grabbed audience, on screen and in cinema, alike. He would make a person disappear in front of your eyes. Will he make himself disappear, too? The question did cross my mind for an instance. The involving story (a magician, a countess, an inspector and a prince at the turn of the century Vienna) continues to be evolving, as we follow Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl - we are caught up with his questions and suspicion, and the challenge from the Prince's skepticism on hoax magician and his ambition to 'modernize' the monarchy.Everything about ""The Illusionist"" is superior: the re-creation of the period (in Prague and Tábor of the Czech Republic), the interior and exterior locales (castles/fields, theaters/city streets), the costumes (aristocrats/commoners), armory (swords/pistols), equestrian/carriage details, set decoration, production design. Cinematography by Dick Pope (who worked on many Mike Leigh's films); music by Philip Glass (can't be more befitting); of course, adapted screenplay and direction by Neil Burger. The cast is impeccable: besides Norton, Giamatti took on a mustache and beard (well, they all do), and a different tone to his voice to become Chief Inspector Uhl - turning in another convincing performance. Rufus Sewell (""Dark City,"" ""Dangerous Beauty"" 1998) as the Crown Prince Leopold, he certainly is - his demeanor and that 'unbesmirchable' arrogance, indeed. Jessica Biel (in Rob Cohen's ""Stealth"" 2005, boldly right up there next to Josh Lucas and Jamie Foxx) as the serene beauty of Countess Sophie, yet the inner strength exudes for a turn of the century woman. Her scenes with Norton (first time we get to see him with a quiet intimate side) are wonderfully captured.Yes, truth or illusion? ""What you see is illusion."" Do you believe that? There is suspense and mystery and not until the end - well, could Uhl's deduction be reality? We want it to be true. Whatever it is, ""The Illusionist"" is a masterful film, enjoyable at best. Highly recommended.(The teaser trailer of w-d (""Memento,"" ""Batman Begins"") Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" for fall release has an impressive cast with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson - an alluring film about magicians and the mystery of their tricks?)",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"Not particularly bad, but there just isn't much to it","""The Illusionist"" looked like it had promise coming in. It had a loaded cast of not just stars but talented stars headed by Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton but even continuing on to Rufus Sewell. It had the second-best film composer alive, Philip Glass, writing the score. It sounded like it could be a fun tale of intrigue surrounding a stage magician. The only real worrisome part (admittedly a very large one) was screenwriter/director Neil Burger, who had only a faux documentary that didn't do well with critics or the public to his credit. Burger brought down the rest of the elements to make the film a middling mess.The film's script is an issue because it pulls an unwanted sleight of hand, changing the film from a mystery a la ""The Prestige"" (which is how the commercials and trailer made it appear) into a very slight and trite period romance. Even the mystery element to the plot is loaded with thievery from earlier films, most notably from Carol Reed's ""The Third Man,"" which makes it far more predictable and thus less exciting than it seems it should be. The dialogue is also oblique and stilted. Even beyond these problems, the characterization is very poor, with no character ever really being fleshed out and no character showing ANY arc whatsoever.That last script issue is the main problem with the acting, which is competent but in parts that require so little cannot be impressive. Some of the casting is also questionable, such as placing Jessica Biel in the position of the beautiful rich countess, but not bad enough to be truly damaging. Paul Giamatti's accent is also an issue, as it seems to fade in and out throughout the film.Appropriately enough for a film that is so contrived and unoriginal, Philip Glass's score is loaded with retreads of his brilliant earlier work, most notably ""Powaqqatsi"" and ""The Hours."" It's still effective music, and none of it isn't at least reorchestrated, but for someone who knows Glass's earlier work it is a disappointment at least.This leaves Burger's direction, which is uninspired. The film simply doesn't look any different from any other period romance of the same time, save perhaps for the embarrassingly silly effects during the performances. The editing is generally standard, slowing down for the more ""romantic"" moments and speeding up for the higher-tension moments. However, some of the decisions are so appalling that they make one question Burger's mental capacity. For example, the opening scene shows Giamatti speaking to Rufus Sewell about the results of the manhunt for Edward Norton--then later we see the manhunt. Though there is a twist involved here, one cannot be interested in the search when we've been told the result. The editing does its best to heighten the search's tension, but it can't overcome the basic issue.Overall, ""The Illusionist"" is maddening because of its lost potential, and the muddled final product isn't terrible. If you're interested in seeing a period romance with an above-average cast and a few special effects, this film is for you. Otherwise, the film isn't really worth the time and money.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Stylishly crafted illusion that's definitely worth a look.,"Based on a short story by Pulitzer Prize winner Steven Millhauser, The Illusionist is a stylishly crafted film (illusion) with the right combination of romance, politics and supernatural mystery elegantly handled by writer-director Neil Burger. A periodic film, it features a stylish, charismatic and a strong performance by Edward Norton as the enigmatic magician who decides to risk everything for the sake of his love. Writer-director Neil Burger does a great job in keeping the story rolling along, and like with any good mystery story the clues are nicely planted along the route. The film is shot with a lovely, old world and an aged feel which helps enhance its strong sense of atmosphere. The on-stage magic tricks are nicely presented, but this movie relies less on the magical arts and more on a simple illusion. A magician's appeal rests not upon his tricks, but his bond with the audience. Those watching know they are being misled, that all they see is nothing but an illusion. But it is how the magician presents that sleight-of-hand that holds the crowd spellbound.The Illusionist keeps you guessing and wondering right up until the end and like any good magic act, finishes with a satisfying flourish. A must-watch!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

"""Everything you've seen here is an illusion.""","This highly suspenseful film is full of ghosts, magic, and murder. It is great entertainment as you the viewer try to figure out whether the film is about magic and illusion or revenge and murder. The story takes place in the last 1800's in Vienna during the reign of the Hapsburgs. In fact, Crown Prince Rudolf is a primary player in the story. Rufus Sewell, who has played every European king in one film or another, does a super job of play Rudolf. But the primary story is about a young village boy who becomes fascinated with magic and a young aristocratic girl. Ed Norton plays the adult magician, Eisenheim, now grown up and returning to seek the girl he has never forgotten. His magical skills have increased exponentially and they are the tool by which he makes his living, and by which he courts his long lost love, and by which the film's mysteries are finally resolved.The characters are masterfully portrayed by the cast and help carry the viewer along as they experience the situations generated by the fascinating story of an individual who rises to the top of his profession as an illusionist but is in love with that unobtainable women who is the object of all he desires. This movie is powerful and effective and carries the viewer along on a ride that offers fantasy mystery with adventure and romance thrown in as extras. The settings and ambiance leave little to be desired and establish an aura of romantic intrigue that compliments the outstanding acting on the part of the entire cast. The background music and surround sound never overpower the dialogue and the overall balance produces a highly effective movie that leaves the viewer wanting more.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"

The overall tint of the film was made to look historic and old timey, but it was still very fresh and crisp looking.

The Illusionist and The Mike - Hello!,"This interesting, well acted, beautiful with-a-twist feast was surprising. Surprising too was the number of times the modern mikes would drop into the scene from out of the sky. From mid-way through the film through the remainder of the film, we had several (too many to count) scenes with Mr. Mike. First it was fuzzy mike and then it was striped mike and then it was black mike. Our movie audience went from giggling at Mr. Mike, laughing at it and then exasperated with it. How come no one has mentioned the stupidity of the mike being in these scenes? How could they release this film? Not because the story - which was very engaging - but because they released it without editing out the idiotic extra character.

All done with mirrors,"An entertainingly old-fashioned historical mystery thriller (I think that covers it!), spiced up with magic and political intrigue. At heart a love story between a commoner (Edward Norton's Eisenheim character) and a noblewoman (Jessica Biel's Lady Sophie), their youthful affair is sundered by her outraged family. Fate brings them together again as adults at which point she is unwittingly and somewhat unwillingly being used as a political pawn in the machinations of Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) to usurp his father's throne and he has developed a reputation as a master illusionist. Her rekindled love for Eisenheim jeopardises the Prince's plans as well as stirring his jealousy, rendering the men implacable enemies, with the Prince employing his chief of police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to discredit Eisenheim and ensure Sophie plays her part as his consort. How Eisenheim strikes back at the Prince with a daring new illusion forms the main suspense as the film reaches its conclusion.Released at around the same time as Christopher Nolan's similarly themed and for me more confusing and overrated ""The Prestige"", I preferred the relative simplicity of the narrative here, with the characters' motivations being much easier to discern. Beautifully shot in golden suffused light to enhance the period detail, well acted by all concerned and with Philip Glass' compellinhly hypnotic score in the background, it looks like a well portrayed theatrical production, at times like watching a play within a play.While the ending isn't hard to work out and the Police Chief's ""Eureka!"" moment somewhat contrived, still all the loose ends are conveniently explained and tied up by the end, making this a satisfying and easy on the eye entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
WOW ..this is pretty bad...,"I can't believe anyone would find this movie entertaining.This is hands down Edward Nortons worst performance.I guess he was doing the best he could with the script but his character was very one dimensional and wooden.His accent drifts from a faux Austrian inflection to a subtle British tone interspersed with his normal American voice it's truly awful .All that aside there is virtually no plot and you can't even enjoy the illusions because you as a viewer want to tell the audience in the film, who are all so astonished,you know how it's all done..It's not mirrors people it's call CGI.Yes CGI something that has been used to death in Hollywood.I think they should have kept the effects more organic but I don't think it could rise this production above fodder.Even if your a fan of Norton skip it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Lead Miscast,"Every now and then, you get a year where studios drop very similar movies the same year.Like the year Tombstone and Wyatt Earp dropped.The Illusionist dropped the same year as The Prestige.And The Illusionist is to The Prestige what Wyatt Earp was to Tombstone, as epic failure.Why?Because you can't help but compare the 2.If The Illusionist or Wyatt Earp had come out during years where there wasn't such competition from a similar subject movie, I might see them both a bit more favorably.But as it stands, I'd give them both a 6.(6 being 'the better end of a one time watch.)
Interesting enough, the 2 that won these battles were the ones that chose entertainment over trying to be serious with the tone. And the both had better writing.My biggest gripes?1. I like Ed Norton, but don't think he was a good fit for this. He simply doesn't look the part at all. All of the skills in the world can't save that. And it's really unfortunate because the surrounding cast were all bringing their A game, and cast beautifully.2. Should have went for tricks instead of magic.

Period Thriller -- Very Well Executed,"The ""Illusionist"" is a well-made movie with excellent performances from Edward Norton as the maker of illusions, Jennifer Biel as the aristocrat he loves and Paul Giamatti as a detective inspector in the service of the Austro-Hungarian Embassy. The script is tightly driven, maintaining a surprisingly high degree of tension considering that many of the scenes toward the end of the movie consist of Eisenheim (Norton's character) sitting in a chair on an empty stage staring out at the audience until a person apparently materializes on stage, says a few words and then vanishes into the thin air from which he or she originally came. The fourth principal in the film is a prince of the empire, to whom Biel's character is affianced. The prince, who is plotting to stage a coup ousting his father, becomes Eisenheim's deadly enemy, operating through the detective inspector, hoping to become a grand figure if his patron succeeds in his plot.

Perhaps this is where my idea of child's program bears fruit..! Was it a ""platonic"" relationship..?? And still moreover, the court intrigue is stale and contrived.

He returns as a talented magician and causes quite a stir with the shows he puts on in his native Vienna. One evening, a crown prince attends a show with his fiancé, beautiful Duchess Sophie. The prince volunteers his lady for a magic trick and it is a stunner. But, more important, the two old friends are reaquainted.

"A great, entertaining movie, but ultimately quite flawed.","The Illusionist is a tale set in early 1900's Vienna, to which it tells the story of a Magician believed to have superpowers beyond the realm of 'illusion', but when he meets with his lost love, who is now being married to the Crown Prince, accusations fly from the Prince himself as to if his tricks are indeed illusions or in fact 'magic'.The music is great, but there's not really enough of it, the movie seems almost empty in places. The acting is superb, a great cast and a fantastic leading role played by the ever-great Edward Norton. The costume and set designs notably, are visually great and the direction is unusual but well done, especially considering the (until now) unknown director.The movie however, has far too much missing. The ending especially, seems to be going for that 'we'll leave it up to the audience' conclusion, but the fact is it doesn't make you wonder, it just makes you frustrated. The most obvious example would be how the movie explains quite freely how a lot of the 'illusions' are done and indeed quite easily pieces together a lot of the unsolved scenes of mystery, yet refuses or even IGNORES the explanation of the most significant parts of the movie.However, This movie is quite entertaining, it tips along at a nice pace and is VERY intriguing, but it certainly left me disappointed.

Jessica was a poor choice for Duchess Sophie,"I enjoyed this movie, but like another poster above I thought that Jessica Biel was miscast as the Dutchess Sophia.

This move is not slow or boring, despite an overall lack of what we've come to know as action (basically brawls, cat-fights, chase scenes, people doling out and receiving violence, etc.). The plot is entertaining, the glimpses of the world of the magician are interesting, albeit not very detailed, and the love story that basically holds it all together is believable and well-acted by the protagonists, Edward Norton and Jessica Biel. Edward's role is understated and, at first glance, might seem wooden, but overall he is able to gain our empathy with his character, Eisenheim, and Eisenheim's dilemma and self-appointed mission.It is beautifully filmed and keeps you so well entertained that the surprises along the way become that much more enjoyable, given the fact that you're so distracted. It certainly lives up to its title. The Illusionist is not only about a magician, but it weaves a magical spell all it's own.

terribly sentimental and dull.,"The illusionist is one of the most contrived, dull, sentimental films i have seen in a long time. every cliché from every bad Hollywood period piece has been employed. somber expressions, bad British accents, childhood flashbacks, all used to somehow draw the viewer into a story with no chemistry or cohesive theme. i saw absolutely no point in making this film. jessica biel and edward norton were great, and paul giamatti almost poked fun at his cliché character. the acting was good and the cinematography was awesome, but other than that this film is simply a romantic vehicle with a barely feasible twist. i was bored throughout, except for the hilariously bad sentimental moments that had me choking and laughing incredulously at the outright sentimentality of the film. this is not art or film, it is a crass piece of ""entertainment"". the potential of this film was totally squashed by the commercial hands that obviously got ahold of it and crushed the life from it. entertainment? sadly this doesn't entertain, it leaves you emotionless and bored. a horrible failure.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Edward Norton is no illusion.,"Edward Norton is certainly one of the most brilliant actor of his generation. One can remember his first role in Primal Fear and we knew we had a strong actor in the making. Norton showed that Primal Fear was no luck and he went on with solid performances in movies like: The Score, Fight Club, American History X and many more. What characterizes Norton is his ability of disappearing behind different characters. His versatility makes him one the best and intriguing actor of his generation with Leonardo di Caprio, and some others.The Illusionist is one of the rare films this year which is not an action pack, a thriller, an horror slick or a comedy. The Illusionist is much more than that. This movie is the essence of cinema. Like cinema nothing you see is real!!! It's all a big illusion.In this movie fellow actors teamed up with Norton to give the audience a real troubling romantic story rarely seen on the silver screen. I'd like to mention the excellent Paul Giametti ( Lady in the Water, Sideways) along with distinguished beautiful Jessica Biel and the subtle Rufus Sewell in the revolting Prince Leopold.The cinematography takes, here, a serious option for best in the next Oscar race. Dick Pope pictured Vienna at the turn of the century like we never seen before.If you haven't seen this movie run to see it. Not only you'll spend a good time but you will also see a superb performance by an actor names ED NORTON who is not an illusion.10 out 10 The movie of the year.Roger Cardinal 30-08-06",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Count on Norton,"I have to give the guy credit, besides maybe The Italian job, which was because of contractual obligations, he always picks the right movies to be a part of.I must admit I probably would have skipped this one if Norton wasn't in it. He's one of those actors for me that I will see a movie he is in, no matter what the genre or story. I was pleased with this movie.Paul Giamatti probably took the rug out from under Norton in this one however. He is just fabulous as the police detective assigned to keep tabs on Norton's magician character. Giamatti's quirkiness and facial expressions make him a joy to watch. Jessica Biel didn't do anything to detract from the film, which is good i guess, in fact she is not bad in it. Norton, Giamatti, and Biel I must say all hold those Austrian accents very well.The story is somewhat predictable and losses steam in certain parts. The ending you can sort of see coming but the film as a whole is an enjoyable mysterious romance.Great sets and costumes. The visual effects are also well done, very subtle, which for this film is a necessity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Beautiful and Intelligent,"This movie truly exceeded my expectations. It was undeniably the best photographed movie I have seen come out of Hollywood this year. The cinematography was exceptional. Each scene was well thought out and filmed with incredible precision. The performances were equally executed. Norton was amazing as usual and both Giomatti and Biel surprised me with what I believe are their best performances yet. With regards to the story, although it is at its basic level, a love story, it is the most intelligent film in theaters (especially when compared to its box office contenders ""Snakes on a Plane"" and ""Accepted"") and keeps the audience enthralled in the illusion right up until the final bow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The illusion itself,"You hear as the sound goes on, you see how the people are moving, how the environment changes as they go on, and then you wake up, only to see that your still inside the dream. That was how I felt when I saw this movie. The beginning that went on and suddenly turned to an end.Regards to the actors (Edward Norton) (Paul Giamatti) and (Jessica Biel). The whole movie feels like, that you go inside someone's dream, and you don't wake up until you've seen it all.So much to say but so little time. See it and find the dream for yourself.PS. If something seems wrong it's because I'm from Sweden and my English isn't what I always want it to be. :P",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Magic entertainment,"This movie will inevitably be compared with Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"", another story about turn of the century stage magicians which also appeared in 2006. It is however a different kind of movie, quieter, and intense rather than spectacular. The setting is Vienna in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is a successful stage magician who unfortunately incurs the ire of the arrogant and autocratic Crown Prince Leopold (Rupert Sewell). We see the story through the eyes of Inspector Uhl, (Paul Giamatti) who is sent by Leopold to investigate Eisenheim. In fact, both Leopold and Eisenheim are in love with the same woman, Sophie, Duchess of Somewhere (Jessica Biel). So we get a tussle between power and intellect. No prizes for guessing the winner, but there's plenty of surprises on the way.We are treated to four very fine performances. Edward Norton as Eisenheim gives very little away and yet we sense his feelings. Paul Giamatti is more assertive than in some of his earlier roles  a bit like Claude Raines as the shady policeman in ""Casablanca"". He too, acts with his eyes. Rufus Sewell, who has very large eyes, does villains just as well as heroes, and does a very hiss-able one here, though on occasion I was strangely reminded of Jack Lemmon as the comically stark raving mad Prince Hapnik in ""The Great Race"". I haven't seen Jessica Biel before (a soap princess, it seems), but she has just the right fragile beauty for Sophie.The re-creation of the period is faultless, with Prague and environs filling in for Vienna. The film-makers were able to use Konopiste castle, the former Czech country home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which has an unforgettable hallway decorated with the heads of thousands of deer. Yes, you think, this is the home of someone who likes shooting things. The character of Leopold is based on that of Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the throne, who is supposed to have committed suicide with his mistress at Mayerling in 1889, though it has been suggested he was murdered to forestall an attempt to overthrow his father. Franz Ferdinand was Rudolf's cousin (and subsequent heir to the throne) whose assassination in 1914 tipped Europe into the First World War.But the film is not historical, neither is it a mystery. You can believe in spirits if you like, or you can accept the rational explanation of the illusionist's ""magic"". This is a surprisingly entertaining film. What I find very interesting is that the director, Neil Burger, who also wrote the script, has apparently little prior experience in film-making, yet somehow managed to produce a tight, well-made entertainment. In the audio commentary on the DVD I watched he makes it clear his movie-making instincts are right on the button. The film is a credit to the Czech film crew as well. The producers, though, had the last laugh. This film cost $16.5 million to make and grossed over $32 m in the US alone. ""The Prestige"" grossed $53m in the US but, made in the much more costly US, cost $40m. Good films both, but in their different ways.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
«Nothing is what it seems»,"The IllusionistThe film The Illusionist is based on Steven Millhauser's short story, ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"". The film was written and directed by Neil Burger and starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, and Jessica Biel. The film was premiered in 2006 and was a commercial and critical success. The film has one Oscar nomination and more than 10 other awards.These facts made us to pay attention to this film. Of course, someone will say that the film is boring and pretty mediocre. However, for me it's the perfect combination of everything that needs to be in a good film. It has a little bit of drama, ROM-com and historical. There is something to laugh and think at the same time. ""Bittersweet"" end of the film is something like the cherry on the cake. Unexpected plot twists on the one hand, is quite expected, and on the other hand appears to the viewer as a complete surprise. So I don't advise you to read the spoilers before watching this wonderful film.This film tells us about love and hatred, magic and cunning tricks, politics and political decisions and about life in general. It tells about the life of the rich and the poor desire to succeed, about how you can lose everything and find in a moment.Sure, The Illusionist has a very similar atmosphere with The Prestige, but it is quite another product of cinematography and it has its own unique semantic load.I think you need to see this film at least for to be able to draw your own conclusions about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Sepia-toned period thriller,"I enjoyed this beyond-magic thriller a lot, even though the ending was pretty easily determined ahead of time by any Conan Doyle aficionado of Sherlock Holmes mysteries due to close similarities to at least two of his stories. But, the film was so well done that it more or less overshadowed that obvious bit of copy-cat that gave the film a Sherlock Holmes mystery look and feel, and especially due to all the horse-and-buggy clop-clopping through the old city streets. I fully expected Sherlock to emerge from a buggy at any time, hot on the trail of the perp.The sepia-toned filter used in all scenes gave it a perfect touch of faded age, and the Prague locations used provided the necessary quaint but regal 19th Century look of golden years class that few cities today can provide for horse and buggy age films. The film had a look of quality and class throughout and was mostly very accurate in its period details.Edward Norton was terrific in his usual inscrutable-faced way as the magical illusionist carrying out his own illusion of a ""murder"" mystery, and Paul Giamatti continued to amaze me with his growing virtuosity in another demanding character piece, this time as a deadly serious but role-conflicted police chief trying to solve the Big mystery, more for his own satisfaction in the end than to bring the perps to eventual justice. The Scarlett Johannson-lipped Jennifer Biel was innocently effective as the main squeeze, but Rufus Sewell was a bit much and over the top in his overtly vicious villain role as the emperor's scheming nut-case son. Amusingly, his obviously fake mustache made me watch it in amazement all the time instead of watching him as he progressively chewed the scenery throughout his crazed evolution from a quietly jealous and pompous royal ass to a violently drunken and murderous maniac. Who else noticed his really bad fake mustache and why didn't the director catch it?Most of the reviews here are very enthusiastic and are mostly well deserved as it was a fine film, but if you know Sherlock Holmes' stories well you will have the ending figured out far before it actually ends and that will away take a bit of your overall enjoyment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist,"Im not a fan of Norton's I found him drab and irritating in Fight Club (which for me was a boring pointless film, start to finish) But in this i was mesmerised from start to finish, it held my attention constantly and the romantic storyline was fresh and heart warming. The sepia colour to the film made it nostalgic and captivating. I enjoyed the soft focus scenes and the flash backs. Paul Giamatti was perfect as Inspector Uhl.

Go see this!,"By all means, go and see this movie, once. It moved a little slowly, but compellingly to its conclusion. I saw some of the plot coming, but was completely blindsided by the ending. The acting is very good all round, and the sets and costumes have a feel of authenticity about them, as do the relationships between the aristocrats and the commoners who serve them. Paul Giammatti as the Chief Inspector is completely believable in his role, especially when he inwardly seethes at the restrictions placed on his investigations by the aristocracy. Norton is intense and passionate, a young man skilled beyond his years, working inexorably towards his goal.I felt that, on the whole, this played more like a TV movie than a theatrical one.

No Illusions Here,"This movie is a mystery with a romantic twist. That's all it tries to be. Is that a bad thing? No.There's a plot line that is actually interesting, and it never insults the audience's intelligence. It's beautifully made: the acting, direction, effects, and music are all very good. If you want to watch an interesting movie and the genre appeals to you, I recommend it. If you're expecting the next Titanic, you may be disappointed. The ending of the movie could have been done a little better in my opinion, but it worked and pieced most of the plot ends together. Eisenheim managed to hold my attention throughout the movie, despite the fact that he spends very little time talking.

A fresh and brilliant movie,"An absolutely brilliant movie with an excellent performance by Paul Giamatti in the role of the detective. Passed over for the Oscar in many fantastic performances, Giamatti should finally receive the coveted gold statue for this characters role and his creativity to bring about not only his detective role into the realm of reality but also for truly bringing this movie to life. Many period piece movies often are left leaving the viewer only imagining what that period of time must have been like. Giamatti and Edward Norton's role in this film lend the viewer the opportunity to actually put yourself into the story and the year. Of his various characters Edward Norton during has played during his career, this one is by far his absolute best and most believable. He adds mystery and a sense of class to his character and gives an unimaginable performance that should by rights, land him an Oscar in this performance as well. Not to be forgotten, is Jessica Biel's role as the duchess and love interest of Norton's character as well as the soon to be king. In this film she steps away from the cutesy girl role that has, in my opinion, molded her into a medium grade actress at best. She and her character shine very notably in this role. In this place and time setting she travereses far beyond her previous roles and presents herself as a lady of character, substance and real depth in her acting. To give this film less than a 10 would be a crime when compared to such horrible actors such as Will Ferrel who receive accolades for shoddy dim-witted performances these days. This is a truly fresh and brilliant movie that compliments itself in it's ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist is a superb  movie.,"Besides my amazement at Edward Norton's range, and the magnificence of the whole movie, I was mesmerized at the location because I was in Prague attending a conference at the castle of Liblice in the early seventies, and visited another castle with the hall full of mounted antlers of the hunt trophies where so many of the scenes were filmed. Of all the Edward Norton movies I have watched I think this is by far his masterpiece of acting.

The plot is really well putted, and filled with heart-stopping elements which will masterminds your soul every time you think you've finally discovered the secrets of The Illusionist. Edward Norton is again at its best. He is proving to the audience and the critics that if you are really an amazing actor, all you need to do is show to the public no more then twice in a year. This is a level which Leonardo Di Caprio and Johnny Depp can put. I think the supporting actors were also well chosen, because I haven seen a human being that didn't fit into its role right. Even the servant of the emperor, he was really looking like one, his clothes,every tiny piece of element, was so mathematically well put, that most of the time I was just trying to overcome the fact, that I am watching a movie, which hasn't really made a mistake. Some words should be spoken about the soundtrack also. It was again, well fitted into the whole atmosphere into the movie, and it was also enough effecting, so the audience won't have a slip of breath to use until its genius end. I can really say that this movie is not just worth to be watched, but it should be added to every DVD or at least a fan movie, or at least guy who is using his television, not just as a cupboard.

Enthralling from start to finish,"When one is still running the details of a movie through ones head two weeks after leaving the theatre, that says a lot.

Once in a while, a romance appears without much fanfare and captures the imagination of the viewers. ""Marty"" did it in a different era. This movie certainly left an indelible impression on me.

The Power of deception.,"What you see is what you believe.Or is it?The Illusionist tricks the audience both in the film and the moviegoers.It is left to the audience to believe whether all that was all a trick or real? It's a solid entertainer.Two hours worth your time in the dark.You'll be hypnotized,mesmerized and fascinated by the Illusionist himself,as you continue to decide whether it's supernatural powers or it is real.The film leads to many suspenseful moments and intense drama until it reveals everything right before the end credits,and you are satisfied.Because it doesn't cheat you.Eisenheim the Illusionist started practicing magic when he was young,and in that very young age he falls in love with a young girl Sophie.As they are forbidden to see each other they still somehow find ways to meet up until they are separated forever.Returning 15 years later as a renowned magician performing in public,Eisenheim faces challenge and rivalry from Chief Inspector Uhl who is loyal to the Crown Prince Leopald.But as Eisenheim learns that Sophie is marrying Crown prince,Eisenheim starts to confront the crown price.And Sophie has already fallen in love with Eisenheim.As they both try to get together,the Inspector and Leopald must separate,or else they shall receive dire consequences.The film shifts to into a murder mystery,and the mystery leads to a satisfying conclusion that will have you smiling that it never cheated you throughout and that it was all in front of your eyes but you believed what you saw.The Illusionist may have a simple story about forbidden love and all but its execution makes it a more intriguing work.There is mystery,romance,politics,intrigue,drama,thrills,suspense,twists and turn all in one film.While suffering in many areas,the Illusionist still comes out as a winner with its splendid performances given by the actors and its deft direction.The film boosts a gripping and absorbing feel and atmosphere.The productions designing is well done and evokes the 1900s.The cinematography is rich and a brilliant score aids along.Slick editing aiding its magic tricks.And visuals that deceive your eyes.And a few tricks of magic really have you at awe.The film's magical tone will have you glued to your seat.Its magic tricks are really well executed and it really feels like you are watching a magic show with your host hypnotizing you ,making you believe what he wants you to believe.Its deceiving moves are really what makes the film an illusion.Director Burger has written a good script.One that relies on character development and one that has a brilliant plot.The story is simple but its development is terrific.He keeps his film from falling as there were many areas where it could've collapsed and you could've walked away from the film.As the film takes the mystery turn,it kind of drags a bit and becomes clueless.We don't understand what is going on.But as everything comes to focus and we slowly start seeing the big picture,we get our moneys worth.The director has a great vision and he is the ultimate illusionist.The film lacks strong emotional impact.You don't feel much for Eisenheim or Sophie,but you do care to see them together.Halfway through,the whole thing kind of got slightly predictable and obvious.I somehow realized the twist early on,lucky guess.And the film's pace is uneven and it looks old-fashioned at times.And some of the magic tricks are left unexplained.Edward Nortan is a versatile actor,and the films he has done in the past few years are amazing.He is terrific both as good and evil.And he is terrific in any role you give him.Here,he is at his absorbing best.You are hooked into the man that you don't know what his motives or plans are.He tries to make his character as mysterious as possible,and Norton looks dashing as an Illusionist,and he is very convincing with his accent even when he slips in that.Rufus Swell is an underrated actor,and though he has a larger role,he is given less credit than Jessica Biel.His character's jealousy is well portrayed.He makes his character's anger feel real and you wonder what he might do next to our lovers.Jessica Biel is a real surprise here.Not only does she handles her accent with decency,but she can act.Her small presence was felt as a beautiful and charming Dutches.Though,there is little romantic chemistry between her and Norton,and her character isn't well written,she still manages to leave her mark.The real star of the film ,however,is the multi-talented Paul Giamatti.His portrayal of an officer who is bound to obey the Crown Prince is excellent.His intense confrontation with Eisenheim is superbly executed.He brilliantly captures the confusion and guilt of the character.He has no clue how to arrest Eisenheim with no evidence and yet he wants to help Eisenheim.Like the audience he begins to question his power of perception.Like the audience he is unsure whether Eisenheim really have supernatural powers.And we as an audience are as surprised as he is when the big reveal is shown.His accent is well done and he plays the character with juice.A mesmerizing work.The Illusionist is one of those Hollywood films that makes Hollywood the best in the world.It has those Hollywood ingredients and feels like a big budget film,at its core its more independent and original.It's pretty much like an illusion.It's a perfect entertainer and you will likely be captured by the Illusionist himself.Good writing,brilliant directing.Strong acting and rich look makes this the years most worthwhile film.And if you ask me,I would say this is slightly better than The Prestige another film about magicians of that same era.As that film relies on tricking the audience than developing a good story.In a way,the Prestige is more complicated for no reason and has powerful twists and turns that you never see coming.Whereas,The Illusionist may seem simple,it pulls a trick or two to be able to compete with The Prestige.But on the whole,The Prestige somehow cheats the audience by playing with them,while this film grabs the audience's attention throughout and giving them satisfaction.I really liked this really good film that was really close to being great.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Very Good,"I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone.My only beef is with casting.Though Ms. Biel was very good, she was 10 years too YOUNG for the part.Ed Norton is 37 and she is 13 years younger than he is, come on.When she showed up as the present Sophie, I was taken out of the movie at the inconsistency.Other than that point, the movie is really the cat and mouse game between Norton and Giamatti, and that is the pleasure of this picture.It is a good, old fashion Hollywood movie and I will have to get a copy of it for my friends when it is release on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
If you don't appreciate the efforts of the Actors then it would be an insult to comment on this movie,"The Illusionist was set in a unique environment as a period piece compared to many of the modern set movies. While the plot was good and there were some plot twists, the movie was somewhat standardized and technical. The Illusionist did keep true to its name by resolving the ending with both illusion and a man's need for a rational explanation. It could have been longer with more character development but due to the setting many unappreciative viewers would have been lost.Overall both Edward Norton and Jessica Biel did an excellent job. Edward showed a seriousness not seen since American History X. He studied hard for the role and it showed in his face and his mannerisms. He pulled off the role quite convincingly as a ""magician"" who truly believed what is was doing and provided doubt for the audience to keep them interested.Jessica was finally able to show the emotional and linguistical range that she is capable of. She showed strength and bottled up emotion of a duchess who was caught between an engagement of power and love. However, Jessica still did not get enough screen time similar to Elizabethtown. The only two movies were Jessica acquired enough screen time was in Stealth and Blade: Trinity. Those movies however were both action types which was a breakout role from her TV series. The Illusionist will allow her to gain appreciation for her skills and her upcoming comedy with Adam Sandler will be fun to watch.Based on the acting alone the movie was excellent. Great job Edward, Paul, and Jessica.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"""Perhaps there is truth in this illusion.""","A highlight of 2006 that stands out above the rest, Neil Burger's ""The Illusionist"" is a superbly crafted period piece that manages to succeed in being both an endearing historical drama as well as an absorbing and suspenseful mystery/thriller.For starters, I was especially intrigued by the filmmakers' somewhat ""avant-garde"" approach in making this film in the sense that they always seemed to be conscious of conveying the film as a truly dated period pieceand by that I mean their use of certain film-making methods (i.e. the use of irises as a transitional device; a technique that is rarely if ever used in contemporary cinema and was usually common in the era of silent films). Such methods succeeded in giving the film an overall aura of antiquity. I really liked that the filmmakers' tried something different, and it immediately grabbed my attention as a sincere film enthusiast.Aesthetically, the film was strikingly picturesque. Cinematographer Dick Pope certainly deserves kudos for bringing such a vibrant and plush quality to an expectedly dreary and lackluster turn-of-the-century Vienna. Every frame was appropriately toned to fit the sentiment of the scene, which only helped to heighten the film's overall effect. And though its not his most noteworthy comprehensive work, I was especially fond of Philip Glass' accompanying score. His trademark minimalist, tonal style was a welcome delight and successfully aided in communicating a sense of enchantment and fantasy that aptly matched the film's narrative.The film's casting was brilliant across the board: both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are exceptional and personal favorites of mine and, in my opinion, are two of the utmost talented (and at times underrated) actors working today. They always prove themselves to be incredibly diverse in their career choices and are both blessed with the capacity of undergoing transformation in order to mold themselves into a particular role, making the characters they play that much more believable. I thought they sparred exceptionally well together and I always relished the moments they shared on screen. As always, Norton is nothing short of spellbinding; I was practically hanging on his every word, gesture and subtlety. I'm so glad he finally decided to take the plunge and partake in a period piece for the first time in his career that has spanned over 10 years. For a supporting role, Giamatti seemed to stand out just as much as Norton, if not more. I almost feel as though Chief Inspector Uhl was the main character in the story and not EisenheimI'm not entirely sure if that should be accredited to Giamatti's acting or to the format in which the story unfolded, but perhaps it's a little bit of both. And I must admit I was especially impressed by the usually pedestrian Jessica Biel. Never in a million years did I think she'd be capable of being convincing in a role like this, but she somehow managed to exude poise and grace on an almost effortless scale. Rufus Sewell was also memorable as the brooding and maniacal Prince Leopoldhe is always able to startle me whenever he goes on his burly tirades: the moment, for instance, when he strikes Sophie across the face with a slap she didn't anticipate, and her cheek slowly flushes into a painful looking crimson was especially disturbing.If you're wondering if this movie is a life-changing experience or whether it will be the recipient of prestigious nominations/accolades come awards season, I'd decidedly say probably not. The central plot and the overall outcome were not especially unique or innovative by any means; you might in fact call them ""predictable"". I contest, however, that that did not lessen the enjoyment I had while watching the film. You have to remind yourself that despite the triteness of some age-old stories that have been done time and time again, there are other elements added into the mix that can turn a ""been there, done that"" story into something refreshing and relevant. You will find that with ""The Illusionist"".I reiterate that this is without a doubt one of the better and more impressive films to have come out of 2006. For grossing almost $40 million at the box office alone, that is an impressive feat for a film of this variety and is one of many indications that ""The Illusionist"" vouches to enlighten and entertain those who have the pleasure of viewing it. From an avid film watcher who has tendencies of dishing out harsh criticism, this comes highly recommendedso don't pass it up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Down with Magic Movies,"So last summer we saw two magic movies, The Prestige and The Illusionist. Both of these movies stunk, but The Prestige is the winner IMO for a couple of reasons, but here is why both movies are pretty much garbage: 1) The Illusionist makes absolutely no attempt to explain how Norton's character performs his magic. So we are left to wonder how a man can make spirits or something similar appear. The answer is, he can't. Since the director doesn't want to show us how Norton performs his tricks we are left to figure it out ourselves and since it is not plausible or possible, it makes what Norton does ridiculous.2) The Prestige attempts to explains it's ""magic"", but it's magic is actually sci-fi garbage that makes no sense as well. Tesla can create machines that duplicate objects now can he? Both movies are extremely implausible, but at least The Prestige attempts to explain it's tricks, even though they break the rules the film maker sets for us in the first half of the film.

"If you want to be Wowed, check this one","This movie will hold you from the start to the end; it will ""wow"" you all the time, for its great filming style, its well written story and the best of all: The amazing acting.The Actor Edward Norton is on what I believe to be his best work so far, but no, he is not the only one; Paul Giamatti, the actor from ""Lady in the Water"", does a superb acting job as well, nailing the part perfectly, but only to be overcome by Rufus Sewell who plays the ""evil"" character.Overall, this movie is a must see for any one who enjoy a good conspiracy/detective/magical story, filled with surprises and plots, in addition to three awesome performances from the actors I honored above. Not to put aside the presence of the actress Jessica Biel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Ed Norton makes your breath disappear!,"The photography and even the cinematography of this fine thrilling epic reminded me of the ""Age Of Innocence,"" and I see Dick Pope is familiar with Turn of The Century plots as he also did the film version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" back in '02! I see this magickal mirage as a potential Oscar contender even if for Costume and Cinematography but also Paul Giamatti should be given the nod in Best Supporting Actor as the tortured Chief Inspector Uhl - does he do the right thing and become totally corrupt or does he allay his soul and forever seal his humble beginnings? His other ignored work was with Arnold McCullers in Duets, but when he was acknowledged for Sideways? Somebody definitely passed the bong around too many times! Ed Norton was despicable as the villain of The Italian Job, he has fought Robin Williams in ""Death To Smoochy,"" and has worked with Spike Lee in a role nobody expected him to take on but now he reaches up his sleeve and pulls a new trick in his role cards! His character's deft weaving of an ethereal tapestry against the poor typecast Rufus Sewell again as another villain, this time as Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (he also sneered in - Knight's Tale; Bless The Child & The Legend Of Zorro - if Rufus played a hero, his performances have obliterated it from most folks' heads)! Jessica Biel as the duchess who dared to love ""beneath"" herself, is a far cry from the action gal with the laser-bow in ""Blade: Trinity""...The plot itself was a view on many things - the timelessness of true love; how love sees no class/color/religion; what really is truth? How life and death can be intertwined and made to exchange places if only for a pulse...Also? The importance of planning and how you never think you can outsmart a magician, it was rather like the British TV series ""Hustle"" in terms of the deftness of sewing up the threads of the fine plot and movie - time to disappear! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Very few movies even make my shortlist. This one got into my collection without even being on the shortlist!,"If you go into this movie expecting a wonderfully original storyline, you'll be missing the point.The basic plot is the simple period piece, which is still used because it works, even though we've all seen it before (Yawn). However, combine the period piece with another old favourite, the mystery, and you have the potential for an Oscar, which I honestly believe this movie deserves.I respected Ed Norton before The Illusionist, now he's one of my favourite actors. He seems comfortable in any role thrown at him (Think Fight Club, then watch this.) Jessica Biel backed up her beauty with some truly accomplished acting, Paul Giamatti gave the chief inspectors internal struggle depth and realism, while Rufus Sewell almost became the ruthless Prince Leopold.I loved this movie. It made me cry, it made me laugh and it reminded me to tell my wife how much I love her. The effects, even though computer generated and not illusions, were wonderful and somehow still managed to retain some of that old-world feel. The cinematography weaves a wonderful tapestry all around you, while creating a visual masterpiece (of course, Jessica Biel always helps...)Period films, as a general rule, are not my favourites - maybe because there are many mediocre ones out there - but the mystery and romance embroidered into The Illusionist helped it work its way into my heart, and my small DVD collection.Forget the nay-sayers, just watch (and love) this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Excellent,"Illusionist Eisenheim (Norton) recognizes his former childhood love Sophie (Biel) who is assisting in a magic trick on stage and becomes smitten again. Prince Leopold (Sewell) sees the possibility of Sophie slipping away from him and wants Eisenheim shut down. Oh, oh, can Eisenheim make the prince disappear?This is a movie worth watching for pure entertainment. It is nicely paced, has good acting, dialogue and oh, yes, magic. What's not to like? Of course, the magic is movie magic, but who cares? It's all very well done. And, watching Inspector(Giamatti) Uhl (where do they get these names from?) try to discover how Eisenheim does his magic is a joy unto itself. We hope he will fail because we like Eisenheim and Sophie. Edward Norton seems to have an ability to really initiate good chemistry with his leading ladies. You buy into the relationship fast.Yes, there is a little bit of The Sting and The Usual Suspects in here and one could expect no less. I am not advocating the movie or the stars for an Oscar, but it was truly amazing. Was it the mirrors? Anyway, very good entertainment.

One gold  word: MASTERPIECE,"I will not write nothing what you have not read before. This movie is very good. I like it's beginning, course of action, camera, drama, love and the most off all the end. While watching this movie, I was under impression that I know who is dead, who is alive, who has gone mad and who is reasonable. I was right just on the detail about one man, chief of police, who is reasonable man and who will, in the end put all pieces of mosaic together. Although movie is not filmed in Austria, I never noticed one small detail which will made me suspect it is filmed in Czezch republic. I am also living in ex Austro-hungarian republic, in city which can replace some of the locations, but if it was filmed in my country I wouldn't know the difference.This movie is one whole completed part, it is a masterpiece that will keep your attention whole time, and which secrets will be revealed at the very end.Hope this help a little. Be sure to watch it. I loveeeee it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Masterpiece!,"This by far is one of the best films i have ever seen. I have never heard of this film during its theatrical release and heard about it when it was just release and my sister rented it. I didn't expect much from it, i thought it would be just a Friday night movie. Oh, how i was wrong. This movie was incredible. It has everything - suspense, romance, thrilling twists, mystery, all into one film. It does have an unoriginal beginning, girl and boy love each other and they cant see each other. It has a Romeo and Juliet element in it that is common, but what i love about it is how they made that common element into a thrilling, suspenseful mystery with twists that keep teasing you and keeps you guessing. It has the amazing actor Edward Norton (Fight Club) who plays Eisenheim The Illusionist and does a stunning performance. Also, there is the beautiful Jessica Beil who play the Duchess Von Techen. Paul Giamatti plays the Inspector of the film and plays an outstanding act. Beautiful job by all the actors, you couldn't ask for any better actors. All characters are preformed beautiful. They all had the vivid and accurate accents that just blended into the movie and you wouldn't believe that they were American. The setting is also extremely perfect for this film. The Directer, Neil Burger, picked to the city of Prague to show the old city of Vienna in 1900, and it was beautiful. The castles, the clothing, and the streets were shown accurately and was very well done. Not only that, but the film has BEAUTIFUL music by Phillip Glass and it plays the exact mood of the film. The Music itself has a mystical element and fits beautifully in the film. Some people believe that it is predictable, but i was on my toes, waiting to see what would happen and the ending just blew me away. Some people believe that everything was predictable, i just have one message. You go make a film that is better than this, then i will agree with you. Making a mystery, suspense, romance, and a thriller in one film is pretty hard, and the makers did it beautifully, I highly recommend this film. It is one of my top 3 most favorite films ever in my life and will be for a while. I have seen this movie at least 8 times since its release on DVD, watched it with my family and friends and they all loved it. A True Masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
A Magical Story,"A magician's trick is his alibi, his lure, his identity. At a young age, all Eisenheim(Edward Norton) wanted to do was disappear with his love, Sophie(Jessica Biel). The two were from different casts but did not care for social differences, yet the aristocrats interfered with their relationship and broke them apart, leaving their love forever unfulfilled...The Illusionist is a fantastic film that not only displays the genuine love between two destined individuals, but brings viewers on a journey which reveals the depths of it. Although this movie is fictional, it is the plot and imagery that gives The Illusionist its sheer beauty.Everyone has a love for magic deep within them. Some grow out of it at an early age while others continue their passion. Whether Eisenheim practices magic primarily due to his love for the art or for Sophie is subject to debate, but he certainly demonstrates the true power of his heart.Viewers can argue about the validity of various details and the discrepancies of the plot with the time frame, but regardless of any inaccuracies, the true meaning of The Illusionist is found in its core - the story. This tale about a man and a woman keeping their spark alive through the most difficult of times is a beautiful one that deviates from the standard mold of contemporary romance, and shows that love is magical.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist  A disillusioned film,"The Illusionist presents the story of a magician's love affair with a duchess that has been promised to a crown prince in turn-of-the-century Vienna. The cast includes Edward Norton (Fight Club, Red Dragon) as title character Eisenheim, Jessica Biel (7th Heaven, Summer Catch) as love interest Sophie, Rufus Sewell (A Kight's Tale, Tristan & Isolde) as prince Leopold and Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Cinderella Man) as the city's chief investigator.In general, movies ask their audience to suspend belief for the short hours they spend in the viewer's chair. For the most part, when a movie is well made, it does not matter what the content as long as it is able to draw its audience into the world it has created and keep them there for the duration of the story. In this movie there is one major flaw: it cannot hold its audience captive. The words that the actors say, the clothes they wear, even the places they go all seem right but they fail in that one particular way. They fail to be real.Sadly, the female lead, and virtually only female character, is the worst of it all. Biel's acting comes across as mechanical and lacking true emotions. Maybe it is because she and Norton have no chemistry, or maybe it is because she should stick to fun but flimsy teen movie roles. Also, though it is quite obvious that both Norton and Giamatti are confident in their acting chops, and rightly so, it is hard to take either one too seriously when they are given such clichéd moments to portray. Even Sewell, usually the excellent bad guy, becomes slightly ridiculous toward the end when he rages over his crumbling world.The idea for this film is ingenious. A sort of displaced Romeo and Juliet, almost the love story of Titanic but with a little magic thrown in could have been a brilliant hit had it been properly executed. Unfortunately, despite the lavish costumes and dreamy camera work, nothing could keep this movie from being just not good.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Eisenheim, The Illusionist ,  Intrigues His Audience","""The Illusionist"" is a mystery from the early 1900 time period. The imagery is dark and adds to the mystique. I have seen ""The Illusionist"" several times and I predict that this movie will become a classic film.Eisenheim, (Edward Norton), is a turn of the century magician living in Vienna. He is charismatic and his gaze is described as mesmerizing. He is called a charlatan and a tricker. His words are intriguing leaving the audience spellbound, asking for more and demanding answers from his illusions. One night, Crown Prince Leopold, (Rufus Sewell), brings his fiancé Sophie, (Jessica Biel), to the show. Years earlier, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood friends. It is their secret. She recognizes Eisenheim and contacts the magician later regarding their past. A love scene involving the two reveal their romantic tendency. Sophie then refuses to go away with the Crown Prince and it appears she is murdered. Eisenheim gives up everything and begins a new show leaving the grandeur of the theater behind. Before leaving, a mob outside demanding to know more, leads Eisenheim to confess to his followers. ""It is not real. It is impossible to speak with anyone from the other side."" Inspector Uhl,(Paul Giamatti), leads an investigation and all evidence points to the Crown Prince. I don't know if I like the ending. It reveals a twist in the plot as if it was all staged and I think the ending may be unrealistic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Absolute greatness, well written, superbly acted, and executed.","I went to see The Illusionist without any idea of what it was about. I really didn't expect much, just something to pass a little time away. I was taken in by the pure magic of the film, and remained totally engrossed throughout the whole viewing. I haven't enjoyed a movie that much in years. Today it is hard to find a movie that can bring out a little of the innocence and faith of a child in us. Edward Norton's greatest illusion was making me forget the actor, and focus on the character of Eisenheim, who for a moment in time had me spellbound. I have not really seen Jessica Bel in any movies that I remember, but she was beautiful in a soft and genuine way, which transcends outer beauty, and without thinking about it you understood why Eisenheim never forgot Princess Sophie. Only a combination of equally great writing, directing, and acting skills could have you feel the love of these two people, with such a limited coverage of their distant past. I have always enjoyed Paul Giamatti's performances, and his portrayal of Chief Inspector Uhl called for a transition in the character ,and the best part comes toward the end of the film...perfect execution. The casting of Norton, Biel, and Giamatti in their respective roles was sheer genius;add the writing, directing, and acting skills and the result proved to be the real predictability in this film. The greatness I found in this intricately woven tale was that it embraces three of the most important needs of life;Faith, hope, and love. My thanks to all involved in bringing it to the screen;Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
"Now You See It, Now You Don't Unless You Pay the Admission Price","Personally speaking, I consider Edward Norton the drollest actor of all time. I'm not saying he can't act, but inspiringly? No way.Paul Giamatti isn't exactly a firebrand either despite being totally brilliant in ""The Cinderella Man."" And so, in ""The Illusionist"" we have two rather boring actors who could have put the entire theater to sleep had it not been for two things--an OUTSTANDING plot and a magnificently manufactured atmosphere of 1900 Vienna. Mix them together, wave a magic wand, up comes a bit of smoke and presto, we have an eight out of ten film.Highly entertaining albeit a mite draggy in spots but still worth the viewer's time and money. It is 9/4/06 and thus far, the best film I've seen this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Truly entertaining movie,"I bought this movie based on the high caliber of Edward Norton's previous performances. Expecting a very good performance, this movie exceeded my expectations and became my favorite movie of the year, possibly two years. A love story in a mystery, it leads you down what seems an inevitable path. You'll be amazed at the illusions and enjoy ""The Usual Suspects"" manner twists. Paul Giamatti's performance as chief inspector should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor. Edward Norton gives another great performance, believable as a magician/illusionist possibly reaching into supernatural realms. Only one scene with extremely brief nudity (unfortunately, it reminded me of the impossible-number-of-hands-all-over-the-body scene in the comedy ""Top Secret"") seemed too underdeveloped; however, you'll forgive this minor point.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Truly magnificent movie,"My eye was drawn to this movie because it stars Ed Norton(who made his name in cult movie Fightclub) and Jessica Biel.This movie is set in Vienna. It follows life of a brilliant man Eisenheim through eyes of local chief inspector. Norton portraits Eisenheim very beliavble and introduces us in the world of Austrian prince, dutchess and the magician.The script is one of a kind, it truly moves us and creates illusions within us. It touched me, made me cry and laugh at the same time.I strongly recommend watching this movie weather you believe in magic or not, this is a movie about a man who broke out of his world and amazed and deceived (in a good way) everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
The Illusionist,"I agree, a wonderful, truly awe-inspiring film, and likely to remain one of Edward Norton's most memorable performances in what is now sure to be the career of a great actor. In addition, Philip Glass' score was excellent, a perfect supplement to the beautifully muted cinematography. Watch for the carriage ride with the Crown Prince in disguise where his Chief Inspector played by Paul Giametti reminds one of Orson Welles. I wasn't impressed with Mr. Giametti in ""Sideways"" but this film establishes his credentials. Rufus Sewall and Jessica Biel should also not go unmentioned-both are outstanding. Another thing that impresses about the film is the attention given to the lesser characters...The Manager, the mysterious Magician, the Doctor, the police aides. A piece of craft and a thing of beauty...You won't want Eisenheim's performance to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Not since Primal Fear,"I went to see this without expectation and actually thought it was a Houdini expose', so wasn't anxious at all. Hoo Ray was I surprised! Ed Norton was fantastic! I readily think he could have done the entire movie without speaking a word! The body language, facial expressions, and eye movement spoke volumes. Paul Giamatti was very convincing, almost to a British end, entirely to the finish. Jessica Biel does wonders with her earthy beauty, developing her character from the proper little girl to the well off ""girl next door"" with a repressed ""happiness"" yearning to be free. A love story, mystery, drama, and thriller all in one. Very well put together and the ending was phenomenal! I'm sure seeing it again would have me thinking a lot more about events in the movie.

Better than Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.,"It's hard not to compare this movie with The Prestige since it shares a lot of similarities.Both movies managed to keep the audiences guessing to the end, which in it self is a bit of an achievement, but with very different result.Where The Prestige settled with the conclusion being tragic and sci-fi, The Illusionist managed keep it fictional and ended with happy ending.I think it's a lot harder to have a convincing happy ending with fictional believable story than having tragic sci-fi these days.In terms of cinematography and visual treat The Prestige has the edgy because it had more budget and the director had the ability to utilize it but as a whole I think The Illusionist worked better as a film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Not as PRESTIGE-ious as other movies,"One of main problems with The Illusionist is that is tries to stay grounded in reality, but the illusions are too fantastical to believe.

Pick a card any card,"""The Illusionist"" is a movie about an illusionist. The illusionist, Eisenheim (Edward Norton, one of the coolest actors ever) , was born in Vienna and as a young boy met a magician who showed him some cool tricks. He becomes fascinated with magic and decides to follow it as a career path (the movie is unclear whether he studied it at Uni or anything). As he grows up he forms a close relationship with a young girl called Sophie (Jessica Biel, who I've heard of but never seen in another movie, until I looked on IMDb.com and realised she's had bit roles in crappy movies such as ""Elizabethtown"" and ""Cellular"", which my friend Darren loved). Sophie is of noble blood and is strongly told not to hang out with Eisenheim, eventually seeing her taken away from him altogether. Eisenheim eventually runs away and travels the world.After many years he returns to Vienna to do some shows. His amazing tricks amaze everyone he encounters. One night he calls upon an audience member to volunteer and guess who it is? Sophie! Eisenheim becomes focused on getting back together with her and after an evening where they express their love physically he hatches a plan. It won't be easy though as Sophie is engaged and about to become a royal. Will the plan work? See it to find out.A great movie that keeps you enthralled and never misses a beat.

Not a fan of the directive style personally,"I'm just going to put a disclaimer: it's an opinion and I'm not trying to invalidate anybody's experience especially because you can't invalidate mine.I'm going to be frank: I wasn't really a fan of the Illusionist. When it boils down to it I just think the creative choices and the direction in this movie were not good and sometimes even distracting. I guess I'll start with what was good. The sound and music in this film were well done and painted a picture of the time period pretty well. The acting was very good, Paul Giamatti being the standout performance. And that's about it really.The story, while it came out before the Prestige, doesn't quite hit the same way. The characters and their motivations are laid out for the audience which is good but I did not relate to any of them and they felt bland. The shows in the theater felt boring because the audience itself gave very boring responses, which made those shows for me boring in return. I don't know if it was YouTube where I watched it but there was a blurred circle around certain scenes that didn't work for me at all. The lighting at times was distracting and I couldn't focus on what the story needed me to. Minus the illusionist aspect of the movie the story is unoriginal and formulaic. This movie feels like it could've worked better if made in the 90s since a lot of these director choices felt that way even though the movie released in 2006.Anyway this is just my opinion and a lot of this goes back to the creative choices of the top crew. Ed Norton might at times appear pretty uninteresting but I feel like the direction is more to blame here. With a different director I feel like I could've potentially not been as distracted and could've enjoyed the movie a little more. And who knows, maybe you'll still like it; it's a pretty well received movie by audiences and critics alike.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
Nothing is what it seems !!!,"What a movie... I didn't expect a movie to be this good, after everyone had threw this out, seeing The Prestige. But for me,(although I haven't seen Prestige)I have been blown away. A movie based on the late nineteenth century, early twentieth century. During the days of the monarchy of Austria.I will not go into the story, being a simple romantic story, but the magic tricks shown, plus the screenplay... WOW !!! I mean just WOW !!! Absolutely amazing. Edward Norton fit like a glove in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist. Although I was skeptical, because this is a kind of unlike of him. But he was brilliant. Paul Giamatti, is also wonderful in his role as the narrator/Police Chief Uhl.But nothing tops the magic. The magic trick, the illusion is unbelievable.

Incredible.,"The Illusionist left me speechless. First of all, the cinematography and use of flashbacks in the film are beautiful. The scenes from the past open out in faded vignettes. The acting is phenomenal. If you think that thinking of the 'forbidden love' plot may remind you too much of Romeo and Juliet, once viewing this film, all thoughts of unoriginality escape you.It unfolds like a jaw-dropping illusion- revealing layers of truth and lies to the world. It snakes around, escaping predicability.The movie is about ""Eisenheim"" a magician who had a childhood romance with the beautiful Duchess Sophie, and his magnificent illusions. It shows the effects of power hunger, and need for finding the truth.The ending of the film made my jaw drop and repeat the word 'Wow' multiple times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
An absolutely splendid story,"One of the overall finest movies in years, this story has all of the elements of an Oscar winning film. Since the only special effects in the movie are contained in the illusions themselves, this production stands on its own merits without the need of the extra sensations, and the bells and whistles that move most of todays cinematic efforts.The ensemble acting, and in fact all of the scenes, are top quality. The sequences are all essential and meaningful parts combining to make a greater finished product. Attention to the ambiance of the era, costume and design, lighting, and especially the direction make for an excellent production. Very engrossing, and very entertaining.Norton is, as always, engaging and skillful in his character. Eisenheim is more polished, more mature, caring, and powerful than is Norton's more common character role of Mr. Nasty. In this story, Norton does exceptionally well as the one being accused and victimized, while all the while remaining a gentleman, as opposed to being the one usually doing the victimizing in other portrayals. Likewise, we see very convincing portrayals from police chief Giamatti, Crown Prince Sewell, and romantic interest Biel. (And isn't she gorgeous in this role?).At the ending of the story, even though the twist is just a little bit predictable, it is done with such polish that no one really cares and just applauds. The highlight of the production, as in all successful endeavors, is the combined effort of the entire company, the directorship, the technical crew, and the period research. Will there be a sequel? We hope so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, History"
