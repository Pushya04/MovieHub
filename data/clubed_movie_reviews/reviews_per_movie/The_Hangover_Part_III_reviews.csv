The Hangover becomes Mission Impossible,"Not so long ago in the year 2009, The Hangover exploded onto the scene and was praised as one of the funniest films of the decade, with its witty cast and the hilarious ""re-tracing our footsteps to find out what we did"" routine running as the main plot. The Hangover Part II simply changed nothing at all, and offered nothing new with the attitude of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" What will please fan's the most with The Hangover Part III, is that is does not follow the same formula that the first two did. However, a lot of fan's will be headed into disappointment when they realize that this third instalment decides to take a completely different change in direction than that of its predecessors. And by completely, I mean very much drastically.The story follows the Wolf Pack yet again as they try to help Alan (Zach Galifianakis) get back on track due to him being off his meds, and soon enough they get thrown into a Mission Impossible-esque mission to save their friend Doug (Justin Bartha, who yet again takes a miss on all the excitement) from Marshall (John Goodman), an angry gangster who wants' the Wolf Pack to find Chow (Ken Jeong, who has a much larger screen time in this instalment) and return to him to them with 21 million dollars in gold bricks that he stole. If not, Doug gets the offing.A major plot point is the development of Alan. His friends Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) are mature and grown men who have happily settled down, but he is still very much stuck as a spoilt rotten teenager within a man's body, and his life is going nowhere. Throughout the adventure, it really is a tale about Alan and watching him grow into the man he should have become years ago. Fans of The Hangover owe it to themselves to watch it, whatever their final opinion of it may be.Whereas The Hangover Part III doesn't match the quality of its first part, it definitely doesn't deserve all the negativity it has been getting. The film does a good job of balancing the well known Hangover humour with the Mission Impossible-esque set pieces, and all the recurring stars do well reprising their roles. One of the biggest changes that The Hangover Part III entails is that there is no actual drinking/hangover sequence. There's also no wedding or no missing person (or a pot smoking monkey). Instead, it plays it much straighter and it knows what it wants to set out to do, which is to stray far away from the formula of the first two chapters. And by doing so, it makes the finale to The Hangover Trilogy one to remember.My Verdict: The Hangover Part III is a fitting end to the trilogy, but despite its changes in directions fans will be divided, resulting in a love or hate for this final chapter.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fitting conclusion to the trilogy,"The Hangover Part III is a funny comedy that concludes the trilogy perfectly. It's not as good as Part I, but it was definitely better than Part II. It's definitely not as bad as the IMDB user ratings suggested it to be. I thought it had funny and comical moments that made me laughed. Sure, some of the humour didn't land well, but it didn't bother me that much. Overall, it's an enjoyable movie that perfectly wraps up the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Hangover Pt. III: The End- A Whimpering End to the ""Adultolescent"" Trilogy that has Very Little Amusement but Loads of Ugliness and Cruelty","More often than not people end up learning the hard way that it's usually better to leave a good thing well enough alone, which might be a lesson truly lived in regards to the quality of what can be deemed as The Hangover trilogy. When the exceptionally lazy Hangover Pt. II was released two years ago it highlighted the immense limitations of director Todd Phillips' storytelling capabilities as it traveled a carbon copy of the first film's intoxicated mystery and amplified vulgarity to different scenery but forgot to bring the laughs along for the trip. Now it seems the Todd Phillips created Hangover trilogy has taken to unintentionally embodying the stages of an actual hangover with the first installment's introduction serving as the party, the dirtier and lazier sequel acting as an unconscious blacked out sleep, and the newest final part becoming a nauseous, unbearable aftermath. The Hangover Pt. III: The End promises the conclusion of what could have been a respectable ""adultolescence"" comedy franchise and after experiencing the third installments descent into darkness and bitterness let's hope it's a promise that is inevitably kept. Todd Phillips and co-screenwriter Craig Mazin (Identity Thief, Scary Movie 3) have tossed aside all sense of wit, surprise, and genuine humor this time around replacing those qualities evident in the first Hangover with sociopathic cruelty, foreseeable plot changes, and zero sense of amusement diminishing any admirable attempt to change up the plot formula. All the fondness audiences have gained towards the characters of Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms) will be tainted in this final chapter as a mixture of performance idleness, poor script follow through, and a lens focusing on their purely sober qualities makes these three characters less than sympathetic, even bordering on incredibly unlikeable. What's ironic is that Todd Phillips has gone out of his way to appease the vilest of criticisms towards his uncreative writing and yet ends up highlighting his true creative limitations by not being able to drift away from a familiar structure. Unfortunately for fans of the series and audience members hoping for a strong summer comedy The Hangover Pt. III: The End ends this less than comedic trilogy with a desperate whimper and through its mean-spiritedness becomes a barely recognizable thread to the humorous and delightfully ill-mannered film that started it all.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Zach is super annoying, not as funny, but it has heart","Zach Galifianakis is now super annoying. When this started, we were laughing at him but his shtick is now tiring. They needed to downgrade his antics from mean-hearted to just simple stupidity. I know Todd Phillips is saving it for Alan to grow in this movie. But it started to happen too late.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms seem to be going thru the motions. We miss the face tattoo. They needed to do something to replace it.Ken Jeong is actually doing something serious. In the first two, he was lovable bad guy. From the first moment as the naked guy in the car truck, we thought he couldn't do much damage. But in this one, he is causing real damage to the group.John Goodman is doing a new character Marshall. He's a new bad guy looking to get Mr Chow for stealing his gold. So he kidnaps Doug to force the group to catch Mr Chow for him. It's rather serious, and not that funny.It was good to see that Alan finally grow up, and dealt with Mr Chow.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Almost completely humourless.,"I'm not going to sugar coat it: this movie stinks. After the gut-busting hilarity of the 2009 original, this comedy franchise has been struck down with a severe case of sequel-itis. The carbon-copy second instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a handful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of Zach Galifianakis' socially demented Alan; this episode however, is almost completely devoid of humour. The writing has become increasingly reliant on the natural charisma of the headlining star trio - with the plot here being laborious and woefully lazy - and the irritating Chow (Ken Jeong), the weakest link in part one, inexplicably gets even more screen time to screech and make our eardrums bleed. If it weren't for an amusing set piece atop Las Vegas' Caesar Palace hotel and a best-for-last gag during the end credits, I would've given this the one star treatment. I was desperately hoping this series would regain some form and finish with a bang, but unfortunately the wolf-pack's last adventure barely makes a whimper.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Better than the second, not as good as the first.","The Hangover Part III ReviewThe truth is that Part III of this decent trilogy was pretty good, but not great, and definitely not awesome. I too was lured to the cinemas, due to the fact that there was a lot of controversy (and of course, a lot of advertising) to see if that film was good or not.The cast was pretty good, with Zach Galifianakis returning -of course- and giving a great performance as the funny and weird character of Alan, who is actually why a lot of people went to the cinemas for.The story advanced pretty well, with no actual ""Hangover"" this time, but with a bunch of nice story twisters and clever lines.Unfortunately, the film didn't have the charm of the first film, the film that introduced us the great company of the ""Wolf Pack"" but I believe it was better than the second film, because the story progressed better, and the actors were more direct and lovable.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Only good for few Nostalgia-laughs.,"You know that one joke you tell at every party? It was hilarious the first time you told it. So you kept telling it over and over again. You told your mom, your friends, your wacky uncle and heck you even told it to your baby sister. Each time you tell that joke it lost some of its charm and you know this in your heart, but you keep telling it because it made you someone who was at least bearable at the office party. The Hangover Part III is THAT dreaded, self-destructive joke.The first The Hangover was a surprise to everyone. It was a smart, engaging and an all-around funny move. It made the three protagonists into overnight stars, along with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. It's no surprise then that The Hangover made these guys in demand, and had the audience craving for more. So what better way to give the masses what they want than bringing the Wolf Pack back together for two more subpar movies. The Hangover Part III brings the crew back together for yet another wacky adventure, this time getting them to go to Tijuana and back to Vegas. There isn't really much to tell you about the plot that you can't figure out yourself. So it makes very little sense to go in any further detail about it, and I can move on to things that worked.By far the funniest moment during the movie for my money's worth was when some girl in the theater screamed out loud after seeing one of the main character dangle for his life. The whole theater roared, and it was a genuinely hilarious moment. Too bad the same can't be said about the rest of the movie. No doubt there were some funny moments and personally the best bits of the movie were when Melissa Mccarthy was on the screen. Some of the other funniest moments were throwbacks to the original. I found myself doing a lot of ""ooh I remember that from the first movie. Ha ha that reference is funny."" Unfortunately that is all this movie is, it's a reminder of how great The Hangover was and we should nostalgia- laugh (is something I just made up) because we once thought there was no one funnier than Zack Galifianakis. Other than that any original content was drab at best.The best laughs came from all the supporting characters, and the 'Big 3' it felt like were just there to collect the pay check. Bradly Cooper was by far the worst of the bunch. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who was nominated for an Oscar not very long ago. Ed Helms and Zack Galifianakis were at least trying.It was the overall chemistry of the three characters that made the original so great. The Hangover was a perfect recipe of Mac and Cheese where you threw in random ingredients and IT WAS THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE YOU EVER MADE! You tried replicating the original time after time, and tasted nothing but cheese and disappointment. It was just another Mac and Cheese. Sure it was served its purpose of feeding your broke student ass, but you yearned for that perfect gourmet Mac and Cheese fit to serve Gordon Ramsay himself.The Hangover Part III is not a movie for people who are looking for genuine comedy. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones. If you're going in expecting a repeat of The Hangover then don't waste your time and money. If you were disappointed by The Hangover Part II this movie will only throw salt on your wounds. It's sad to see such an initially brilliant trilogy end like this. Hangover 3 was nothing but one last attempt at squeezing every last dollar from the franchise. The Hangover Part III gets 5 nostalgia-laughs out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Funny Third Part!,"The Final Film in 'The Hangover' Series, 'The Hangover Part III' is A Funny Third Part! Its entertaining, crude & nostalgic. Surely, it doesn't conquer greatness, but it still delivers an ample of good laughs!'The Hangover Part III' Synopsis: When one of their own is kidnapped by an angry gangster, the Wolf Pack must track down Mr. Chow, who has escaped from prison and is on the lam.'The Hangover Part III' works, because the Screenplay Written by Todd Phillips & Craig Mazin, is interesting & humorous. There are some nice twists & turns in the narrative & some jokes, through crass & utterly rude, are laugh out loud funny. Only glitch lies in its slow-pacing in the first-hour.

Editing is sharp.Performance-Wise: The Wolfpack of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms & Zach Galifianakis are back & they deliver superbly, yet again! Ken Jeong is given a lot of importance this time, but he's very over-the-top. The Always Excellent John Goodman rocks in his portrayal. Justin Bartha supports well.

A waste of time,"You can't deny the success of the Hangover trilogy and its notoriety, and yet typical of many sequels before it, The Hangover Part III fails at almost every hurdle. From humble and I dare say somewhat original origins from the first Hangover, out is produced a loud-mouthed, vulgar and humourless successor. Little in this film captures attention in an admirable light. Abundant is the nonsensical, violent drive that paved the way for a series of good jokes in the first film, yet now no longer we see the laughs, merely the stupidity left in wake. There is no humour, no sense of longevity beyond a month or two, or even the mildest gesture towards good entertainment. Instead, a monotonous undercurrent of rushed scenes, placid dialogue and exaggerated violence carried throughout makes ""The End"" quite well a heavy thud into in-existence for the Hangover franchise.Did anybody really expect brilliance? Likely not. Which is good, it should just make this final flick a forgettable yet entertaining encore to the previous films. But it's not. It's just a mess of too much money and a desire for more.Nothing about this film appeals, nothing makes it worth seeing. Go to the park. Walk the dog. See something else. Just don't waste your time. One day everything will come to an end. Prolong your success with a final, exciting goodbye, or keel over into nothingness as one of the many forgotten films of Hollywood. The Hangover Part III likely won't dent the enjoyment most people think of at the first film, but it has formally announced that this, truly, is ""The End"".",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the Laziest Comedies in Recent Memory,"The Hangover Part III (2013)* 1/2 (out of 4)Man, if you thought things couldn't get any worse than THE HANGOVER PART II then sadly you were mistaken. The Wolf Pack are back and this time a gangster (John Goodman) are after them because Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) stole forty-two million in gold. I'm really not going to waste anytime writing out everything going on here in regards to a plot synapses because why should I? It's clear that director and writer Todd Phillips along with stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis just made this thing either for the money or they had some sort of contract that required them to do so. While watching this thing it became rather sad because there simply weren't any laughs but what was worse is that it didn't seem the group were trying to make anything funny. This here is without question one of the laziest comedies I've ever seen because the filmmakers don't even bother to even attempt any laughs and what laughs there are are usually just winks to the first picture. It's really amazing to see how this series has fallen after a clever first film but the old saying that sequels usually end up poorly is certainly true. Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis fit their roles just fine but there's just no energy to be found here. Perhaps even they knew the screenplay was lackluster. Jeong is good in small doses but putting him into so much of this just made his character annoying. Goodman was good in his part but sadly he wasn't given much to do, which is the same for Mike Epps and Heather Graham. THE HANGOVER PART III claims to be the final in an epic series of films and lets pray that it really is. Bad movies happen sometimes even when everyone had their hearts into the project. There's just no evidence here that anyone cared about anything other than money. Part two proved that people would show up no matter how bad it was and the filmmakers got even lazier by delivering something worse.",,Anonymous,Crime
It's all about Alan,"I thought this one was better than the second sequel but of course, the first one is still the best. This movie doesn't even have a ""hangover"". It's just about the same characters and revolves around Alan. The movie begins in a disgusting way, with Alan decapitating a giraffe. They really shouldn't have showed that.Any ways, Mr. Chow has stole some money from a gangster and the gangster believes the Wolfpack is the way to find it. He holds Doug hostage and wants the guys to bring him Chow. They track down Chow and rob a house and get back stabbed and then go back to Vegas. And even more hi-jenks ensue. Alan even meets a lady.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, had some funny moments, but I don't think anyone expects it to be as good as the first one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
awesome....,"This could easily be my favorite of all 3. The plot, story-line is great and keeps you interested.

Also, you know they are going to ""end"" the series, and they did such a good job at getting closer.Also, hat-tip to screenwriters, etc., bc this one doesn't have anywhere near the ""shock"" value humor that 2 and 1, relied so heavily on. Instead, it's actually pg-13'ish, and you can tell they weren't going for over-played locker-room humor, but rather but some effort into the script.All in all, it's awesome and definitely worth seeing.Oh and Alan (Zack G.,) by far has the best lines in the movie, he's amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

As someone who actually thought Hangover II was even funnier than the original, I was looking forward to seeing the third installment which promised to take us back to where it all started ""Las Vegas"" with more of the same humor?? How wrong I was to believe that! Gone was the spontaneous feeling you got from the Wolfpack waking up not knowing what has happened to them, which I felt was the most interesting part of the first 2 movies as you followed the characters as they hunted for clues into the night before! In this 3rd serving we get a boringly flimsy storyline that dragged on, very few laughs, a short visit to LV and a script that could have been written by a ten year old! Stu (Ed Helms) has few interesting scenes and is for some strange reason constantly put down by Alan (Zach Galifianakis, who has now been given the central role of the movie along with Leslie Chow(Ken Jeong) who's antics were bordering on childish stupidity.

Saved by the post-ending short video,"I went to the cinema knowing that I shouldn't have high expectations, but I did (unfortunately). First movie ,best comedy of the previous decade; second movie, a very good comeback; the 'epic ending' movie, a really bad attempt to copy the first two.Alan and Mr Chow were the centrepieces of this story, mostly because there isn't really a story. They try reproducing the stupid events we like 'oh so much' from the first two movies , but they fail completely. I can't blame it on the actors, they did what they could. Can't really blame it on the producer or director either because it's not their fault. The script was poor, the story is simply ...simple, no more could have been done with it.I loved the beginning, it really was to my expectations but the trailer shows most of the interesting sequences of the movie (unfortunately). The post-ending video, with which we've been made used to see, was great and I truly hope that it represents the start of the 4th Hangover story, otherwise its a bad ending of the trilogy.Leaving all the bads aside, I am still a fan of Hangover and always will be and even if the movie is not as good as the first two I still recommend it as a get-together way of spending some time while having a couple of good laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Where the comedy fails, the action will keep you entertained","The now infamous ""wolf-pack"" needs no introduction. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis return for the third and final sequel of The Hangover. Breaking the pattern of the first two films, the story doesn't begin with a bachelor party and morning after hangover wherein the pack is left to try to recall what happened the night before and find the missing wolf. The Hangover III begins instead with a funeral.A funeral is a good way to introduce it's audience into this much darker world the wolf pack finds themselves in. Thankfully the comedy doesn't seem as desperate, trying to squeeze laughs out of us with shock and disgust, as the previous sequel did. No, Part III focuses more on a revenge story filled with almost non-stop action.The original Hangover film is a classic and introduced the world to the genius that is Zach Galifianakis. It was fresh, original, shocking and hilarious fun. The Hangover II was not only one of the weakest sequels ever made but also one of the saddest excuses for a comedy. It lacked any originality and came off more as a bad remake than a sequel. For instance, instead of Las Vegas it was Bangkok. Instead of a baby, they had a monkey. Instead of a rooftop, it was an out-of-order elevator. The only bits that weren't the same as the original, as I mentioned above, were additional low-brow shocks.The Hangover Part III, though not nearly as bad as the second film, still doesn't stand out as a great comedy. In fact, it's more of an action/thriller with some very dark comedy mixed in thanks to Zach Galifianakis' character. What truly holds the film back is the character of Mr. Chow, who, as in the previous films, is as irritating and degrading as a character can get. He only works as a villain yet it seems director Todd Phillips isn't sure whether to make us hate Mr. Chow or glorify this cocaine-loving, sexual deviant with absolutely no redeeming qualities.The funniest part of The Hangover III is that as an action/thriller, it is better than anything else Hollywood is currently producing in the genre. So where the comedy fails, the action and thrills are guaranteed to keep you entertained. It's also refreshing to see a Hollywood film with action that doesn't seem to be secretly funded by the CIA.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not too bad, but wait until it come's out on DVD.","So this has been panned by nearly every critic and I can see why.

In this case I was a fan of the first film, I kinda liked the 2nd and this one was also okay.So I thought this was better than the 2nd. (Not by a huge margin) It has its laughs consistently, but they were small laughs, almost giggles. Just enough to keep you entertained. The film was pretty much about Chow and Alan. If you like those two characters then it makes it easier to enjoy the film.There's just not much to say about this film, there nothing much wrong with it, expect just being a mediocre film. So Id recommend just waiting for a DVD/Br purchase of this film.My overall rating is.3/5 Stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jeffrey Tambor had the right idea.,"Kudos to director Todd Phillips (who should really be directing action flicks) for not giving audiences another carbon copy storyline of the original; even though this movie is set in Las Vegasagain. In saying that, Phillips seemed to have had only one goal in mind when making ""The Hangover Part 3"". And that was to make something better than the insanely lazy and disgusting retread that was ""The Hangover Part 2"". But while this isn't as offensively gross or vulgar, it is offensively tame and dull and uneventful.The Synopsis: Like one of those stupid Fast & Furious sequels, the gang's all back. This includes the likes of Zach Galifianakis as Alan, Ed Helms as Stu, Justin Bartha as the other guy and Bradley Cooper, as the guy who can't put these movies in his rearview fast enough. In this final installment, the guys stage an intervention for Alan becausewell, maybe because it took them three movies to realize how mentally unstable he actually was. They plan a trip together in order to get Alan some treatment, but, through a series of lazily plotted events, they end up getting mixed up with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) again inYou know what? Instead of writing my usual long-winded review, I will mix it up a little and do something a bit unconventional. Just to preface this next statement, I usually take notes while watching a movie. But, since this was touted (from the trailers) to be the epic finale to these inexplicably beloved comedies, I decided to keep a tally of laughs instead. That is to say, instead of notes I counted all of the times ""The Hangover 3"" did its job and made me laugh.

Chow's the only saving grace,"I heard both positive and negative reviews for this movie, and decided to give it a watch. Here's what I think -Is the movie funny? YesIs the movie funny as Hell? NoThis time around the directors wanted to reap the popularity of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong)and decided to give him a larger than life role. To tell you the truth, Chow doesn't fail you. Ken Jeong gives the best performance till date in a Hangover movie. However, the key problem is this movie seems a lot focused on Chow and not on Wolf pack. If you have seen the movie, think of it in this way -- How many scenes can you remember from the movie that weren't funny solely because of Chow. Okay so you found few. Now remove all the scenes that were funny for Alan's solo act. Yup, now you can count them on fingers.I was okay with the plot and all the dark humor. In fact, I liked this new plot. However, what I wanted was -- Wolf Pack takes a lead and Chow be in backseat. Somehow, many (not all)would be feel that this movie is more of a spin off of Hangover movies with Chow taking the lead. I'm not saying that this is solely a Chow movie. What I'm saying is whenever Chow appears, he seems to take the lead and he appears a lot!On a bright side, the movie manages to string together events of all the three movies (again via Chow)! But the title doesn't seem appropriate as there was hardly any hangover (save for the awesome end credits scene!)The movie was quite funny, but the wolf pack was hardly funny anymore. If you remove Chow, the movie wouldn't be half as amusing. And thats a disgrace to the Wolf-pack. May be if this was an individual movie (not from Hangover franchise), I'd have liked it a little more.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A decent ending, but please no more.","Did the First Hangover need a sequel, the answer is no. But we have two and i have thoroughly enjoyed both sequels. The second i found very funny but did not love as it was a repeat of the original. But Part 3 definitely goes in it's own direction. It may not have given me the belly laughs of the others. But i was giggling for most of the film.The story contains, this time NO hangover, NO piecing together of the night before. what happens is the Wolfpack are taking Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who is off his med's to a treatment facility. When they are accosted by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman) and the returning black Doug (Mike Epps) , and they force the Wolfpack to find Mr Chow (Ken Jeong) who has escaped prison in Thailand. And kidnap Doug (Justin Bartha) for insurance.It is refreshing that the story is different on this occasion. Going in much darker and much more dangerous places. Zach Galifianakis is excellent as the overgrown spoilt man-child Alan. With Galifianakis and Director Todd Phillips taking the character in even stranger and more awkward directions. Alan is now effectively the lead in the movie with Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms having surprisingly little to do. But react to Mr Chow and Alan's antics, and give typical eye rolls at the situation. Also this time the film adds a little more heart to the proceedings with a minor characters death, and a intimate moment involving. In usual scene stealing form Melissa McCarthy.The Character Mr Chow in this does become almost the second lead in the film, and I personally was never that bothered about the character and found him a funny nuisance for the gang. I know some really really hated him and his increased prominence in this may alienate some people from liking the movie. Also I was disappointed in the lack of use of Helms and Cooper. Who are both talented comic actors and also grounded the films comedy in response to the craziness of the other characters. Credit has to be given to Justin Bartha in possibly the most thankless role in any franchise in movie history.In the end this is a decent way to end the series and gives the characters a decent send off. Supplying enough silly laughs to make this worth a viewing. Stick around for a funny bonus scene, which hopefully is just the last hurrah and not the indication of a fourth.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
No photos at the end :(,"I had more fun compared to the second part, because Vegas is simply more attractive to me than Bangkok. After all, it's something that's been there before and especially the ending without the party photos. I'm disappointed. I wasn't really into the second one, but at least I enjoyed the photos at the end, but nothing here unfortunately. Otherwise, the aforementioned Vegas is good, but it's getting repetitive. The ending wasn't bad, but as I said I really missed the pictures. For me, an average movie that I don't recommend. Unfortunately, in my opinion, this series didn't do very well and the first installment surpasses the previous ones quite a bit for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is not the case for part 3!Personally, I thought this was a film of two halves. The first half was extremely funny and had me laughing throughout. The second part summarised the film, whilst lacking in the volume of the comedy, it was still present. I definitely would recommend anyone to go see this and judge it for yourself.

"Flawed, yet worthwhile return","The wolfpack is back, for the last time apparently. But whilst The Hangover Part III is definitely an improvement over the series' carbon copy first sequel, on the whole it still is just a shadow of its former self. Don't get me wrong though, it does have its moments, and is a worthwhile experience in the end.After a rather gruesome incident involving a giraffe, it is decided that Alan is to be placed in a mental home. Of course, Phil, Stu and Doug accompany him to this location. Along the way, they are attacked by a group of criminals who take Doug hostage and threaten to kill him unless the remaining trio retrieve a recently escaped Mr. Chow, who has stolen a substantial amount of money belonging to the criminals.Perhaps after the critical panning that the second film received, Todd Phillips has decided to move in a more original direction plot-wise, completing removing the titular hangover element, in which the protagonists are forced to retrace their steps from the drunken night before. This is quite risky, as it deprives the film of its unpredictability, and instead gives the impression of a standard chase film. Nevertheless, the formula still works, if not as well.In terms of the characters, Ken Jeong as Chow seems to have taken over the comedic role usually played by Zack Galifianakis, who is now reserved to the odd awkward one-liner or moment. Though I loved Chow in the first movie, it does get quite tedious watching him repeatedly yell out phrases such as: ""I LOVE COCAINE!"", all for the purpose of a cheap laugh. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms aren't given enough comedic focus as they could, which is a shame, as they are both quite talented and capable of such, as shown by the first film.It's nice to see a lot of references to the previous movies, with appearances from Black Doug, and even Carlos, or Tyler, from the first film. This, alongside the presence of Las Vegas in the final act, is quite a nostalgic turn, inspiring good memories from the original Hangover. The comedy is quite darker than the previous films, which I found worked quite well, even though it sometimes leaned into more of an action-thriller category rather than a standard comedy.Ultimately, although The Hangover Part III does falter, I would recommend viewing it, if anything to say a final farewell to the characters that we have grown to love over the past few years. Though not as funny or as insane as the first film, it is still decent viewing, and there is the odd flash of brilliance, which is something I can't say as sincerely for the second film. It is quite a melancholy, bittersweet affair, as the final scenes do truly indicate that this is the last time we'll see the wolfpack. That is, until the box office returns are revealed.Final note: There's a mid-credits scene which in my opinion is the funniest part of the whole film. Make sure you stay back and watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
the wolf pack is back,"I don't really know why everybody is the giving this sequel negative reviews. I can't believe it's 6 out of 10 on IMDb. I'm a huge fan of the Hangover and I gotta tell you that i didn't really like the second sequel it was a copy of the first movie but this one is really good. it keeps you on the edge of your seat, the wolf pack are amazing as usual, ken jeong is epic and it's hilarious. I really loved the movie. I watched the movie and I wasn't really expecting it to be good because lets face it every sequel on earth is the same as the first one. what makes a sequel ? a great movie , a great idea and when you try to make another one you will always fail to bring the same excitement. maybe because every one expects to watch a movie just like the first they got so disappointed but believe me it's not bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hangover 3 is different from the first two movies,"I give a director credit when they can come up with a new idea instead of trying to rehash the same old one over and over. Hangover 3 is different mainly because it does not keep with the formula of the first two films.One of the more unique things about this Hangover film is that is uses plot points from the first Hangover film to explain this story. For that reason alone, I felt this was a good movie. Most directors probably would have just gone with more sex and gratuity.So I think this Hangover film has a good plot that flows with the first film. The irony is that by taking this approach it actually left the door open for a 4th Hangover film that could realistically go back to the original formula and it be believable as a story.But maybe like some of the cast members have said, the Hangover films have run their course. Overall though, I enjoyed Hangover 3 and would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This director seems to view mentally ill as people with some pitiful existence,"While I think Hangover 1 is absolutely a masterpiece and work of genius, but Todd Phillips seems to have a troglodyte's view of people who are...'different'.I know the movie makes fun of everyone, but it lampoons Alan's character as typical, stereotypical guy who is socially awkward with shelves filled with books who says the most inappropriate stuffs at the wrong time. While all his friends seemed to have hot girlfriends, this idiotic director somehow thinks he can't and will not do better with the most unpalatable match in a cringe worthy lollipop sucking scene.I would have given it a 3 star but Todd Phillips - it seems without watching the new Joker movie- is carrying on his schtick as if mentally ill tends to be loners, incels, socially awkward...""But...but...look how FUNNY Alan is!! They made him the hero. He can recall everything in a cool meditative session and jive with kids. He is almost a lovable, fat Buddha whose statue you see in a laundromat.""Well STOP making him a hero then. Stop trying to make 'them' - the people with vague, subjective illness (and trust me I know everything about it first hand) into some sort of stock character. This director is probably the type who will invite a bunch of Italians and go: ""Hey!! Welcome! Came a bit late. So what do you Italians love? Pasta? Right? Great. I made some meatballs.""Well STOP ffin trying to make them/these character and these people quote unquote better. You are not helping and only muddling and messing the whole thing up.They made Alan so desperately begging for friendship that it is just pukeworthy. I know Zach Galafanakias.. or however the hell you spell his name is a total stud and amazingly funny and creative and can help himself as he is a big boy and he doth get all the ladies and Oscar stars... but that is beyond the point.This moronic idiotic director thoroughly detached from reality and sees everything in frat party black and white eyes as if people like Alan craves and needs attention and are so pitiful and woe-is-I and poor-little-me who will die otherwise without a social touch is disparaging, insulting, degrading to people who are deemed by society as otherwise aberrant and what not.This guy wouldn't find nuance if it was giant sledgehammer in a donut store. And he gives me extra reason to deliberately hate on the Joker movie and gladly pass it on without getting on with the bandwagon and hype as if we should celebrate HIS distorted view (and albeit a butchered image of the iconic villain) that mentally ill people are loners who needs a little hug.Finally, without veering onto his new crappy movie and Alan, the movie in general was 'ok'. Had some funny moments, Chow was overdone and over milked and it broke the template which was refreshing. It was a bit dark and had some crass humor but that was to be expected. Would've given it a 3 or a solid 5/6 but this person seems totally out of touch with reality.Here's an idea Todd Phillips. Maybe go to your local group therapy session of a psychiatry department and find how totally normal we people are and we don't need to have people pitifully patting us ending up ffing an old, fat, dyed hair hag.Thanks.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

It Needs To End!,"The Hangover Part III is the ""conclusion"" to the Hangover trilogy. Well, let me tell you something: If it's marketed as a conclusion and you even give it the tag-line ""the end"", then why don't you end it?!The story is that Doug is held hostage by a fat guy played by John Goodman. So the rest of the Wolfpack have to bring him Chow in order to save their friend. But it all turns into a tug- of-war with the Wolfpack between John Goodman and Chow.I was looking forward to The Hangover Part III, mainly because I surprisingly enjoyed The Hangover Part II. I don't know, I guess I have a thing for repeated formulas. Another reason I was looking forward to this movie was because the tag-line said ""the end"", and the commercials even stated ""the epic conclusion to the Hangover trilogy"". I always like when series end, because I always look for satisfying conclusions. Hell, Toy Story 3 is one of my favorite movies. I have at thing for conclusions.However, The Hangover Part III is nothing of what I expected. I hoped it would end. It doesn't. There is no conclusion in this movie. And don't worry, this is not spoiling anything. This is just a fair warning for those whose expectations are high. This is by no means an epic conclusion to the saga, leaving you satisfied thinking ""man, we had a great run"".Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the good stuff. First off, Hangover Part III is pretty funny. However, it is not as funny as the previous movies because of two reasons: One is that there is no hangover in the movie. Two is that it's more of an action thriller rather than a comedy. Now don't worry, it's still pretty funny. But it's more like those buddy cop movies where there's an equal amount of action and comedy. The best example I can think of is Beverly Hills Cop.However the biggest problem with The Hangover Part III is that it's just so incredibly bland and uninteresting. It doesn't leave you with any thoughts about it really, other than that it was a huge missed opportunity.There is a pretty touching scene during the last half of the movie, but I won't say anything about it, other than it was probably the only time it lived up to the name ""the epic conclusion of the Hangover trilogy"". It took the series in a nice full circle, but nothing significant or anything. It doesn't qualify either way.Overall, The Hangover Part III is a fun movie to watch if you don't have anything else to do. I mean, it's still a funny movie to watch with friends. But it's by no means the best comedy of the year so far, and you probably won't be satisfied with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great conclusion, not its full potential","First off i wanna start this off by saying, This is a more personal opinion review I'm only saying that because this movie has got a lot a Bad reviews and i understand why but its not as bad as every one says. Hangover 3 has been criticized a lot for its change plot which is the first thing i disagree with this because after two the plot already feels dull because you already know what happens and its just rehashing the idea of the first one. When i first heard the plot would be Alan focused and not involve a hangover i was like aww yeah cool man it sounded like interesting way to breath new life in the series but that obviously wasn't the case The second thing i hear a lot of is the film is not good because its not funny and that the movie isn't really a hangover movie because it isn't a comedy, this is true because the film isn't really about the comedy its about the characters. The problem is the hangovers target audience is people looking for a laugh and not those who are looking for a real coherent story just raunchy jokes and cheep laughs, I'm not saying i wasn't apart of that audience I'm just saying i still enjoyed the movie for what it offered. It sucks that film was given really low reviews because it wasn't terrible the lowest the ratings should be 5-6 or 3- 3.5 depending on however you review its somewhere in the middle but me personally i give it a 7 great tunes great nostalgia in small doses good jokes and pretty satisfactory conclusion too the series could be funnier but the way the tone is it works sorry for the poorly written review but it gets my point across - Ethan",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nothing great, but enjoyable.","The Hangover Part Three initially didn't draw very much excitement from fans of the series, but when it was announced that John Goodman would be in the film, that stirred up interest from people who weren't even fans of the original. However, the film didn't seem to make very good use of the incredible actor. He gets very little screen time, but for what he does have in the film, he is fantastic. The Hangover Part Three is most certainly an enjoyable ride, recalling scenes from the first Hangover, and adding in a sense of conclusion to the series. Don't get me wrong, the movie is nothing great. It most certainly will not go down in history as one of the great comedies. But it is easily better than The Hangover Part II to say the least. And not as if it really matters in the quality of a film, but the film is certainly far more appropriate than it's two previous films. The acting is hilarious, especially on the part of Galifianakis, who is fantastic in each role he has ever been given. Cooper is also a great actor in the film. I would suggest the film to anyone who watched the other two, or even just the first one. It doesn't live up to the great originality of the first, but it's certainly fun, and has a few laugh out loud moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"When it's funny, it's hilarious. When it's lame, it's painful.","The Hangover Part III is pretty different from the first two films. The comedy remains vulgar, crass and rude. There are scenes of murder, animal cruelty and racism, so it's another day at the office for director Todd Phillips and his team. The difference with this one is the fusion of the action-thriller genre. Some scenes are surprisingly serious and intense. Don't get me wrong, this is still primarily a comedy, but there's a certain level of malice here that makes it feel both fresh and uncomfortable. It isn't easy to find the comedy in the suffocation of a rooster or the cold-blooded execution of a man into a pool. At least the plot-line here doesn't repeat the blueprint from number one.The thriller element aside, the comedy is mostly still here. Zach Galifianakis once again takes the spotlight as the juvenile Alan and Ken Jeong gets a much bigger role this time round. They both provide laughs, but they're also both quite irritating. The great thing about the first film is that Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms provided a relief of sorts from the moronic actions of these two characters, not any more. Their collective craziness get thrust into the foreground and it becomes a little exhausting.In terms of comedy, The Hangover Part III does provide laughs, but it isn't consistent. When it's funny, it's hilarious. When it's lame, it's painful. Todd Phillips can certainly direct comedy well (he has also directed Road Trip and Old School) and he delivers some pretty funny moments. He has definitely upped the style in his direction this time round. Some sequences are stylishly directed and choreographed, others are annoyingly self-absorbed.All in all, The Hangover Part III is a mixed bag. There are things to enjoy and there are things to dislike. It's better than the second entry, but it still isn't close to the first.

....oh dear god,"The epic conclusion to one of the strangest trilogies wasn't as epic as I had hoped. The Hangover 3 opened and I was excited because the Hangover 2 was a giant disappointment due to the similar antics as the first movie. I got to say, this movie was different but different was far from better. The Hangover 3 was no better than the Hangover 2. It was less of a comedy and almost more of a B rated action movie. I hope you are ready for a rant because I got a good one. I can feel it in my fingertips, here we go. This movie is called THE HANGOVER. They don't get hangover. There is no drinking and all the changes made from the original didn't work. All of the actual funny parts were shown in the trailer. The only funny parts were the giraffe, the singing, and well that's really it. I can honestly say I laughed more during Evil Dead then I did in the Hangover. I don't know if that makes me a sick person. Somebody please comment and tell me they agree with me so I don't feel crazy. The main problem with this movie was Chow. I like the actor who plays Chow but I hate his character. I don't find him funny and he is over used. He is like a bottle of ketchup. You don't give up on that bottle until every last bit is out. You keep tapping on the bottom until you physically give up. He was perfectly used in the first movie but I didn't like him there either. He was at least funny in the original but I still thought he over did it. In this movie he is a main character and that drove me nuts. The focus on the movie was mainly on him when it should have been on the wolf- pack. Other than him all the comedic material was focused around Alan. Alan is supposed to be a lovable idiot who has witty jokes and makes you laugh. He pulled it off se well but in this movie he lost his edge and turned into a jerk. His jokes were flat and most of the time he just made fun of Stu. Stu is supposed to make fun of Alan, that is where his comedy originates from and he wasn't funny at all in the movie. All he does is complain and whine. Bradley Cooper was flat as well. He gave little to no effort in the role and you see it in his performance. He was boring and not funny either. Something was missing in the wolf pack and they tried to fill that with the silliness and over the top actions of chow and for me it didn't work what so ever. I knew the story would be crazy and overall it would not be a good movie but I didn't go in expecting a good movie. I went on to laugh. I was really hoping for a strong opening scene with a lot of laughs but it failed to impress. It was focused on Chow and it spoofed Shawshank Redemption, which I did not appreciate. When Chow wasn't on screen the movie wasn't that bad and it was decently funny. Most of the theater wasn't laughing either. I set myself up for the best chance possible for s good time and even the audience was flat. They were just as bored as I was. The occasional burst of laughter but it was a full theater and laughter usually builds off of others laughing. I know people and critics won't like this movie and that is a shame because the first one was so good and different. It is a shame a great title had to come to this. I hope and pray there is no Hangover 4, but knowing Hollywood there will be. John Goodman was in the movie and he was great. He wasn't funny but his addition to the movie saved me from hating it. Evert time he was on screen I was satisfied and happy. He made references to the first movie and little bits and pieces like that I liked. Black Doug comes back along with the stripper and baby from the first. There are a few cameos from the first movie any huge fan will appreciate. I liked that and it put a smile on my face. The best scene was when Alan reunites with Carlos and they have the cutest conversation. It was funny and adorable at the same time. It was a nice break from the crazy antics for some good ole fun. The main thing that aggravated me the most was the 90 second scene during the credits. It was hysterical and it showed a little glimpse of what the movie could have been. I won't spoil it but they wake up hangover, and it was another night they couldn't remember. That 90 seconds was funnier than the entire movie. I burst out into laughter the point where my sides hurt. It was funny but added to my frustration towards the fail this movie really was. Overall, The Hangover 3 blew it. This movie could have been really good and hilarious. The script was poor, the focus was messed up. Chow and Alan needed to be rewritten and it needed to be funny. This movie was not funny. The car chases and gunshots needed to be cut and added with witty comments from Alan and funny reactions from Stu and Phil. Should you see this movie? Sure, why not. It wasn't a disaster but it was close. If you saw the first two then go ahead but don't expect anything to great. The Hangover 3 gets the Willyt A for Effort, better luck next time.

The other characters are less elaborated and even a splendid actor like Bradley Cooper has to strain to the utmost.

"Do you even know, what's going on? Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work, I'm his assistant and you are standing there looking like an idiot!","The end of one of the most unnecessary film trilogies is finally here. First, I have to say I never was a fan of the first Hangover. I never understood why such a mediocre comedy is getting so much attention and praise. There are so many more better comedies who would deserve more attention and praise, or a sequel. The original spawned two more follow- ups, where the first one got a lot of backlash for bringing the same narrative structure and plot. Critics disliked it and fans disliked it. Although I enjoyed the Bangkok adventure more than the first. Mainly because of the direction and the situations the characters found themselves were actually funny. While watching the first movie I just couldn't find the situations funny, the plot seemed too serious to me. That wasn't the case with the second one. Director Todd Phillips even said himself in a recent interview that all the hangover films are not straight-up comedies and they never have been. The second one went a step further and became a black comedy which appealed to to me much more tan the bland first one. The Hangover Part III goes even further, but not probably in the the right direction.It was obvious from all the previous Todd Phillip's movies that he desperately wants to make an action movie. In every single one of his films there is at least one actions usually involving a car. Warner Bros. studios probably didn't let Phillips make an action movie so he jammed a gangster story involving kidnapping, robbery and dead bodies into this so-called comedy.What worked in the previous films was that there wasn't a main character, all three of them were main characters. The story didn't focus on neither one of them. This time the story focuses on Alan, played by Zach Galifanakis, who again plays the man child, which he is famous for playing in every movie he is in. His annoying mentally retarded fattie worked the previous movie for his limited screen time. That is not the case her. Part III is his story only, but luckily his character goes through some development here and in the end he there is an catharsis waiting for him. The rest of the Wolfpack, Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) are reduced to supporting characters this time. In most of the scenes they just stand by and watch Alana and his crazy escapades. Unfortunately the man who shouldn't be allowed near a camera, and a very unfunny man, Ken Jeong (originally he was a doctor but then he became an actor) as Chow gets more screen time to the point of being quite unbearable. Doug (Justin Bartha) once again disappears from the story right in the beginning, which is a pity. I wish he would be present at least once in the Wolfpack's adventure.In the previous Hangover films lot of the humor came from these shocking moments, this time the shock value has reached a new high. There is a lot of abuse to animals - dogs, chicken and mainly a giraffe. This film features a giraffe decapitation scene, you have probably seen it in the trailers but in the movie you see much more. You see the decapitated head flying through the air. I know it is CGI so I shouldn't be offended but I don't find this funny.If you are a die-hard Hangover fan then go and see this movie, but if you are looking for a comedy that will make you laugh,then keep looking because this one will just bring a few smiles.P.S. Since Old School Todd Phillips has such great cinematography in his movies, I dare to even say beautiful cinematography, this film is no exception. Also he has an excellent music choice using here once again Billy Joel or Harry Nilsson. Every song he uses in the film fits perfectly to the mood of the scene or as a great joke.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unlike the 2nd one this is funny and different. A good conclusion to the trilogy. Even if you didn't like #2 watch this. I say B+,"""Feels good to be out. Tell no one. I'll be in touch, Chow."" Two years after the events of Bangkok the wolf pack is settling back into normality. Normal for Alan (Galifianakis) is not taking his meds and buying giraffes. After the death of his father the group gets together to take him to rehab. While on their way they get stopped and are given an ultimatum. They must find Chow, who has stolen money from this man, or their friend Doug will die. I enjoyed the first Hangover but didn't go crazy over it like everyone else. The second one I didn't like mainly because it was just a remake and rehash of the same jokes. I was a little leery going in to this one because of that. This one actually has a different plot and that fact alone made it better then the second one. Rather then piecing together the events of the previous night this one is about the events the group gets into trying to catch Chow (who in my opinion is the best part of the series). This isn't really a review that will convince you to watch or not watch since it is the third in the series, but I will say that I really liked this one more then I expected. Overall, if you liked the first two you will love this. If you didn't like the second one you will like this. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

What's with all the flak?,"OK, so I actually loved this movie. Hangover 3 manages to pull off the near impossible (and super rare) feat of being true to the original while presenting a fresh story. In part one, I'll remind you, four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, but instead of a few pleasant antics involving alcohol, recreational drugs and maybe a one-night-stand they wake up with their lives in complete disarray and without a clue as to what happened the previous night. Part 2 was kinda the same deal, but this time in Bangkok. Part 3 starts off completely differently: Alan has finally lost it, and the wolfpack sets off to take him to the looney bin. Then they end up in Tijuana, Chow turns up, and it looks as if we're in for another Hangover, this time in the Mexicali. Then things take a completely unexpected turn.I would bet good money that you will love the third installment if you were partial to the humour of the original film. If you're not into its innovative but very physical and crude humour, then you should obviously steer well clear of the sequel.What I don't get are all the highly negative reviews, both on and off IMDb. Much of what I read is just plain wrong. The jokes a spot on. The plot is anything but a sad rehash of Hangovers one and two. There is no obvious or excessive product placement (if there is any). And so forth. Hangover 3 is bound to be one of the best comedies of this year, and even my girlfriend liked it. So there.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Could you not spit inside my minivan, please? Jesus!""","Wow, this film is hated. It's because it was the least funny one in the trilogy, I'm guessing? I suppose there's some truth to that. Although not to the point of hating it as much as plenty of people do/have.With the first two, the similarities seemed to be the main problem for people; now, you have the final film in the trilogy, it's different, and people lose their minds. I know those two examples don't go hand in hand, but I find it interesting that the prominent problem people had was changed, and people ignored it to use something else as a substitute to hate this film the most; and that something is (?) how it wasn't as funny. All you had to do was say you're incapable of enjoying films.If that's why the majority hated this film, I think it's ridiculous. Yes, it could've been funnier, but the EXTREME hate is/was unwarranted. You don't know how to enjoy a film that isn't by no means horrible/terrible/awful/dreadful/appalling/abysmal/atrocious/laughable/pathetic/unbearable/intolerable/insufferable, all of which many would probably use to describe it. I can't imagine how you view films that are.As usual, the cinematography by Lawrence Sher and the soundtrack was great. Even the score by Christophe Beck was surprisingly good, and I say 'surprisingly' because I don't remember the scores in the previous two films sticking out. That's probably due to the more serious tone.I prefer the soundtrack of the second film the most, with the first film's soundtrack as a close second, or more so tied, with maybe the first film's soundtrack in the lead by a centimeter, but this film's soundtrack is right behind them. And the cinematography was better in the first two as well, but again, this film's cinematography was right behind.I liked how the story this time was different, as that was an aspect of the second film that somewhat impacted it; even more so, I liked how it wasn't random; the writers circled back to the previous films. They could've done something new, as in 'different,' instead of intertwining this film's story by adding to the other films, but they didn't, and I respect that.As far as I'm (and my opinions of this film) are concerned, I enjoyed it. I think it was better, or at least more enjoyable, than the second film, which, now that I think about it, was somewhat weak, despite the typical elements (cinematography, soundtrack) being great. That made me think of it in higher regard, but overall, the second film was a little too ambitious, as well as with the Bangkok setting, which didn't pay off as well as it could've, and this film was better. It wasn't as great as the first film, the OG, which is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy across the board. It was still great, though.Furthermore, the ending, with the song ('Dark Fantasy' by Kanye), including the flashbacks, made me feel some way; ""In the Air Tonight"" by Phil Collins during the end credits had the same impact. Without knowing it until now, I guess I became attached to these films and their characters. I want more. Even though this was a fitting end to this trilogy, I want a fourth film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bullcrap,I don't know what the writers were going with this movie but it certainly isn't about making people laugh.

"Some laughs, hopefully they let the series rest for now","The same cast is back for more shenanigans, but without the same effect. Alan has become a caricature of himself, and it really seems like they're making more movies just for the sake of it. The laughs are few and far between, and the movie simply doesn't have the energy of the first part. The post-credits scene just seems thrown in to leave a possibility of a sequel, and was not necessary. John Goodman's character could have added a lot more to the story, as we've seen him in other comedies. Leslie Chow also has the same problem of Alan, with having become a caricature of himself. I would recommend this movie to fans of the hangover since it has the same cast, but not the same comedic value.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
No charm here,"They should have stopped after 1, though 2 was not terrible. This one, however, was simply a way of sucking more money out of the series, and they got some of ours (though fortunately at matinée prices). There are some laughs, but not nearly as many as you'd expect, and they've turned Chow into too significant a character. He was much funnier in the shorter role in the original. They've also put too much emphasis on the suspense portion of the plot (an it's not particularly suspenseful at that). Alan's character moves from being that of a naive innocent to something far crueler and darker, which I didn't enjoy either. The funniest part of the movie, and the one that takes you back to the appeal of the original, occurs after the credits start to roll, so don't run out in disgust once they do.If you really want to see how the series ends, save yourself some cash and wait for the video release. Wish we had spent out money on something else.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""It's one of the worst movies to end a film series just like The Matrix Revolutions!""","I watched The Hangover Part 3 in the movie theaters the day before yesterday. This time the main plot of Part 3 doesn't involve with a bachelor party & wedding but, in the aftermath of Leslie Chow's escape from maximum-security Thai prison and the death of Alan's father, Phil, Stuart, and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) a.k.a The Wolfpack( that of course includes Alan) made a decision to take Alan to the mental hospital to get his mental issues treated. But things start to go wrong on the way to the hospital as The Wolfpack is assaulted and Doug is taken hostage by a gangster Marshall (John Goodman) and Black Doug (Mike Epps), who was from the first Hangover film. Marshall made them aware that, during a $42 million gold heist, Chow stole half of the gold and has escaped from the Thai prison. In order for The Wolfpack to save Doug from Marshall, they must find Mr. Chow again and get the stolen gold. The film takes place in L.A., Tijuana and Las Vegas again just like in the first film. Heather Graham reprised her role as Jade, the sexy stripper who married Stu from the first Hangover movie. The film also stars Melissa McCarthy as Lathe pawn shop owner Cassie, who is the first women that Alan immediately falls in love with.I honestly thought the movie was awful. The motion picture pretty much did not made me laugh at all except the beginning and the post credits scene. If you are all curious about the post credits scene you all have to see it for yourselves, if you all want to. The rest of the film definitely had poor comedy & acting and it wasn't as really funny as the previous two Hangover films.In some ways, The film had two out of place genres Dramadey (Comedy-Drama) and Crime thriller. The film also had some dramatic acting that is also out place of the comedy genre of the film and it did not amazed me at all.If the main plot of the film involves with a bachelor party and wedding it would still be terrible of course because it would pretty much repeat the same related plot and jokes from The Hangover part 1 and 2.Even The Hangover part 2 pretty much repeat the same related plot and jokes from the first one. That's the reason I think The Hangover should of have just been a stand-alone film with no sequels at all. Another problem that I have with the film is that it takes place in Las Vegas again just like the first one. The Wolfpack went to Las Vegas again just to look for Mr.Chow and the stolen gold in his condo in Caesar's palace hotel & casino and bring him to Marshall.Here's my advice for the film: ""Do not watch this film in theaters, if you buy a ticket to see this movie it would be a waste of money!""

It was hard to get past the opening which was one of the stupidest opening movie scenes since Grown Ups 2.Zach Galifianakis stars in this while Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms play supporting characters who are fairly unnecessary. Even the character of Chow is more important to the film than Cooper or Helm's characters.Chow was a fun character in the other movies. In this film he is just dark and bitter like the movie itself.This film is a comedy without any real comedy. There is just swearing instead of funny dialogue. It is also an action movie without much action.

Acting by support characters is also ok.Screenplay of the movie is nice although it could've been better. Direction is good.

They have learnt lessons so no more parties,"The fun continues, is it! yeah, kinda. This third Hangover was a different one to the other two movies. There were no more bachelor parties, looked like have they (movie characters) learnt the lessons so. But still the movie had a similar track jokes like pursuing something to get away from another thing. So there's no short for fun but the story was not greater like earlier two.Yes I enjoyed the movie from comedy aspect but the roles played by the cast, I was little not favour to it. I mean the Bradley Cooper now a big star than what he was when the first hangover movie came. Whenever I see him in this movie I though he was forced to do the role in the movie as he was part of the earlier installments. So there's no surprise this movie is going to end with this third part.Everyone performed equally good in all the three movies. But Zach Galifianakis was the highlight in all the three while Justin Bartha was the disappointment. No doubt, it is now one of a best comedy trilogy and I can recommend it to anyone if somebody asks for a good dude's comedy theme in near future. Sad that they decided to end the franchise with this but in another angle it feels that was the best option than dragging it to nowhere and making audiences especially 'The hangover' series fans to sloppy.Like I said the story was told in not the usual stream but we know the trademark of hangover movies so the movie ends with a style. Still I am curious about the fourth from the bean it spelled during the middle of the credit and I am hungry for that as a detailed explanation in a movie.

Not a bad hangover to wake up to,"When The Hangover came out, I thought it was just another sex comedy movie, not realizing how funny the movie was. Here with number 3, this isn't a bad Hangover to end the trilogy, though I guess a 4th, wouldn't go astray somewhere down the track. In ill favor of a lot of other people's responses, I found this one the funniest, though I guess there were certain bits lacking in it to the first. Looking back on the third one, the only one I saw at the cinema, me and my friend, the only two at this session, I would kind of pass it off as kind of cheesy cheesy, but this has everything, some twists, some rather serious moments, hand gliding, and many many laugh's. Check out Allan's operatic voice, an undiscovered talent, or the unforgettably priceless start when Alan's illegally hauling a Giraffe. I won't tell you what happens to the Giraffe, but it's not pleasant. Why transporting Allen to a mental facility, on the count of him being a recluse, sponger, or just being a plain 42 year old idiot, The Wolf Pack encounter some trouble with some big guns headed by John Goodman, an actor who just keeps impressing me now. They are after Mr Chow, who's escaped from a tight prison (ha ha) where they kidnap one of the pack (have a guess which one) so we must find Mr Chow. Not an easy thing. I couldn't understand why so many people panned this one, honestly, I was querulous. Alan even finds his love, and to the final goodbye between Mr Chow and Alan, almost brought a tear to my eye.

The Extra Scene in the End Credits Saved This Film,"The first Hangover film was a irreverently funny film that unexpectedly made a lot of money in 2009. Strike while the iron is hot, so a Part II came two years later, with practically the same story set in another city. Despite that bad sequel, there is now this Part III another two years later. I still say it should have ended with the first movie.The Wolfpack, namely Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), decides to help Alan deal with his mental problems by bringing him to an institution. However, on the way there, their car was attacked by a gang led by Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall told them that since Chow had been in communication with Alan, he wants the Wolfpack to get back the gold bars Chow had stolen from him before.The movie went by so fast that when the ending comes, you will wonder where the time went. The plot here was so thin. Part III was more about Alan (Zach Galifiniakis) and Chow (Ken Jeong), two side characters in the first two films who end up with the biggest roles in this final installment. The Wolfpack were just supporting here. Bradley Cooper hardly did anything substantial to deserve his top billing. I do not know what the producers were thinking to make that disgusting Mr. Chow practically a lead in this film. He was okay as a minor comic relief in the first film, but his role here is just too much. Seeing Chow suffocating a chicken is simply too annoying for words.The humor is pretty dark. An animal loses its head in a cartoonish fashion in the very first sequence. Then, someone's dad died. There was NO wedding with a disastrous honeymoon hangover to recover from at the beginning, so at least they tried to change things. Unfortunately, this new formula was hit or miss, with very few hits. The guest appearance of Melissa McCarthy as Cassie from the Vegas pawn shop is quite cute though, despite her brief screen time. It was good to see Heather Graham there again, as well as the baby in the first movie now a big boy.Ironically the biggest laughs were reserved for an extra scene in the middle of the ending credits, and no, it was not only a funny photo album this time.

Since the announcement of the third and final film (hopefully) I had no interest in it but because of my curiosity to see what becomes of the wolf pack it won me over. I'm glad to see the film makers take a different approach so it won't be an exact copy of part one but because of the new approach there were no laugh out loud moments, just a few cheap chuckles. Other then Allen & Chow performances and the only ones in the film that were funny, the movie just dragged along. Showing nothing interesting in the film what so ever. I guess because of the new elements they took that's why it wasn't at its best nor funniest but they could've done a complete better job with their jokes.

I really wanted my money back after watching this atrocious movie they call a comedy. None of the audiences even laughed or even chuckled including myself, except maybe for one joke near the end. None of the cast seemed to be trying anymore except maybe Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong. But even they just try to be overly obnoxious and tries so darn hard to be funny with crap materials. I was so anxious to leave the theater that I missed the extra footage at the end but I just didn't care.3.5/10",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Honestlt I was so disappointed,"So I just came from seeing the 10:30am showing at Arden Fair and I gotta say all I could think about was walking out and having a cigarette. Yes, the movie had its few funny lines, but NOTHING like the 1st or 2nd that were FULL of comedy. Not a bad movie, meaning I've seen worse, but NOT the can't catch my breath comedy I've come to expect from the trilogy! The actors did great as always but the story-line did too much and made the ""funny guys"" almost extras to a poor movie. I'm sure many will run off to see this movie as I did BUT if I knew then what I know now, I'd wait for it to come out to the Redbox for $1 (SERIOUSLY). The upside since a refund isn't an option is I'm hoping Walmart lowers the DVD price of HO2 to $5 to complete my collection, since I'm clearly not interested in buying #3.

"Bits and pieces glued together, but it works well enough","When ""Hangover II"" came out some people we're pretty angry about it, mainly because they felt like they had paid for the same movie twice. Same plot, same jokes, same ""surprising"" twists, I still enjoyed it but at the same time I wasn't blind for its lack of creativity. Luckily, the third one is very different. Somewhat less luckily, this movie is just all over the place. The other ones have clichéd plot(s), but at least they were as coherent as this genre is ever going to get and had a clear structure to them. This one well, even after you've seen it entirely you're still not sure what the hell it was about. It just doesn't gel that well, it's very fragmentaric. On the other hand though, it does do something that's rare for a part 3 these days: it actually adds something to the franchise. Not only does it have a lot of funny new set pieces (the burglary is definitely one of the best parts of the entire franchise), but it even sorta develops its characters and provides some very decent closure. I particularly liked what they did with Alan, he isn't just a gimmick anymore but actually tries to change his ways here and there (if he feels like it, obviously). The ambiguous relation between the Wolfpack and Mr. Chow is also explored very well, the question whether Chow is a friend or foe pretty much fuels whatever little story there is. I also liked the throwbacks to the previous ones, this can be seen as a standalone movie but probably shouldn't. And lastly, John Goodman is incredibly under-used but at least he's there for a brief while to be hilarious as ever. If you hated the other ones, you'll probably hate this. If you liked the other ones, well I honestly don't know. All I can say is I quite enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Support the anti-human trafficking movement by NOT seeing it. Here's why I walked out of Hangover II and will never see Hangover III,"Here's a blog I wrote about why I walked out of Hangover II, and the reason I will never see Hangover III!I have to say, I was a fan of the first movie even though I felt it crossed a lot of lines into inappropriate territory, but it was so funny! I was sitting in a very packed movie theater tonight when the ""Thai strip club"" scene caught me completely off guard. The strip club owner was offering to sell a ""young kid"" for $2000. Then he said, ""Maybe more, depends on how young you want."" This got a huge laugh from the packed house. I felt like I was going to be sick.I had to leave. I have to believe that these producers simply don't understand the ugly reality of the situation. The fact is, in Thailand, and even in America, you can certainly buy a little child if you have the money...you can purchase somebody's precious little child as young as you like who has been raped up to forty times a day, drugged and often beaten into submission. I assure you, it is the most wicked thing I have ever encountered and American filmmakers using this as comedic fodder is just unacceptable. Is nothing sacred? The issue of human trafficking is incredibly serious. 1.8 million children are sold against their will and sexually abused, transported throughout our world each year and held captive at the hands of people who treat them like animals. It is a huge problem and how incredibly insensitive to make a joke like this. If you ever have the pleasure of meeting a child who has been rescued from this atrocity, I assure you, you won't think it is funny any longer. It takes a lifetime for these kids to recover from their trauma and abuse. I would just ask you to please consider the incredible power and influence you have been given and use it wisely. You have the extraordinary privilege as film makers to impact the world. Please consider the thousands of men and women around the world who have dedicated their lives and resources to rescue and rehabilitate children who are bought and sold in modern day slavery. Please educate yourselves and exhibit some grace and respect for their lives. People have given up everything to fight against this horror show and here comes America, glamorizing evil yet again. I don't usually chime in on these things, but this totally shocked me.http://ow.ly/lnv9T",,Anonymous,Crime
Really hoping it would be funnier,"My husband and I and our friends have a tradition of going to dinner and seeing the hangover movies the weekend they are released (it also happens to always coincide with my birthday) and we've always had a blast. This time, after 3 hours and numerous pitchers of margaritas, we made our way to the theater to await our final Hangover night. We desperately wanted to be wowed. We wanted to spend the next 2 hours laughing until our faces hurt (as we had with the last 2). It just didn't happen. Now, don't get me wrong, we liked it and it was funny. It just wasn't nearly as funny as we were all hoping it would be. I was really thinking they would make the franchise go out with a bang and really ""bring it"" for the last. I'm honestly not sure what went wrong though. I think they were trying to be more serious, which is fine (and again, the movie was good). But this audience wanted to be rolling in the aisle laughing. As others have said, the funniest part (by far) was the scene during the credits. Now THAT is what we wanted for this movie. Why couldn't we have skipped this 3rd one and gone straight to that one?

A bit of a letdown,"I suspect that there was a desire to avoid making a movie that was just a repetition of the two first Hangover movies. Unfortunately what we ended up with is rather mediocre and not at all as hilarious as the previous two movies.First of all, there is really no hangover involved. This means that the entire let-us-discover-what-insane-things-we-did part is gone. Instead we are treated to a much more conventional comedy story. As I story I guess you could say that it holds together much more than the one in the previous movies but that also takes away a lot of the fun-factor.Alan is as frustratingly stupid as always. I never really thought this guy was that funny but more served as a vehicle to put the rest of them into silly situations. Mr Chow is the same lying and cheating bastard as before. Actually I think this guy is quite annoying as well and the dog chow eating scenes is just silly and disgusting. The movie as a whole is a decent enough comedy but where the previous ones where really sticking out above the sea of ""mediocreness"" this one is content to float on the surface. It is just another comedy in the crowd.Actually the only two really hilarious parts where the first ones with the giraffe, although they were a bit cruel to the poor giraffe, and the last ones in the middle of the aftertexts.An enjoyable movie but only just.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I won't bore you with the details of the ""plot;"" just know that the movie begins with a giraffe decapitation, then goes downhill from there.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms play virtual straight men to Zach Califianakis and Ken Jeong, the latter as the notorious Mr. Chow, whose theft of $20 million worth of gold from mob boss John Goodman winds up getting all the boys in trouble. The least member of the Wolf Pack, Justin Bartha, lucks out yet again by being safely escorted off-screen for most of the duration.

"Not the Trilogy we Asked for, but the Ending we Deserve","If the movie trailers and the posters live up to their promise, this is the end for The Wolfpack as we know it. Not disliking Part II myself, as much as everyone else, I still held reservations against Part III. Going in with low expectations, I can say that The Hangover Part III makes up for the disastrous Part II, but comes nowhere near the level of the original.Breaking formula, there is no hangover this time, but there is another missing person. Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) are reunited once again to mourn the loss of Alan's dad (Jeffery Tambor). Alan's outrageous antics and almost cartoonish behavior have elevated to the point that his friends and family make the executive decision to banish him to a special home until he is deemed fit to reenter society.Before The Wolfpack can even make it to Arizona with Alan they are ambushed by Marshall, a drug kingpin who has direct connections to ""Black"" Doug (Mike Epps) from The Hangover. Six degrees of separation brings Marshall to reveal that Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) has stolen $21 million from him. Marshall kidnaps ""White"" Doug and forces Phil, Stu, and Alan on a merry chase to find Mr. Chow and his money.The tone is set in a much darker place. A real life is in serious peril with Marshall threatening to kill Doug unless they bring him Chow. This plot development is a fantastic way to tie all three movies together, but it rarely finds a way to works itself in with the subplot of Alan needing mental help. Drifting away from the trouble with Alan to focus on finding Chow, there is never a feeling of urgency to anything that makes us care for Doug's safety, which ultimately lessens Alan's story.As Part III begins as a cry for help from Alan, we never see a progression of his change until the very end when he meets Melissa McCarthy. Her scene with Alan makes more sense as a gag than an actual instrument to influence the character. This moment is way too forced and is resolved too quickly. However, it is nice to see Phil and Stu bring a calm balance to the overly exhausted random acts of words that spew out of Alan's mouth. These actors have a great chemistry together, but nothing in this story helps grow these characters from what we know of them already.On the other hand, Mr. Chow is a greater force to be reckoned with this time around and you can actually tell how threatening and sly he can be. And although Jeong works well in Part III, his atrocious accent and Asian caricature is still unbearable. John Goodman is a decent commanding villain, but is never given much to do. What irritates me about his threat is that since they are in the U.S. The Wolfpack never bother to call the cops or are given an ultimatum by Marshall, which lacks tension.For a sequel that no one really asked for, Part III does a reasonable job at clinging on to audiences that have not lost faith in the franchise. Unfortunately it was an uphill battle from the beginning after Part II left its mark. You could, however, skip Part II and hardly miss a beat aside from one joke. Almost every element of the first film is re-introduced in the third to bring the trilogy together in a neat little package. Even little Carlos makes an appearance, and it happens to be the most genuine scene in the movie.The movie is visually slick, like any under Todd Phillips' belt, he uses every ounce of his budget to his advantage. With what comedy there is, the timing from every actor is just as smooth as ever. Again, Phillips makes use of a killer soundtrack and fits it well into each scene. There is a rendition of ""Hurt"" from Nine Inch Nails that would make the band cringe, but it is timed perfectly for this film. ""Dark Fantasy"" by Kanye West, ""Down in Mexico"" by The Coasters, and many others work in favor of the film keeping up a high energy.Helms, Galifianakis, and Cooper have gotten their character dynamics as The Wolfpack down to a science. As much as it hurts to see these actors fill the shoes of these characters again – because it feels like they're in it for the paycheck – they all do a great job running through the motions. I did have a good chuckle here and there, but most of those moments have been easily forgotten. There are some clever elements that I enjoyed, but for the most part this movie is bland and fails to elevate the franchise one inch.And even though the stakes are much higher this time, it never really appears like anyone cares about the safety of Doug and his kidnapping is one more annoyance they have to suffer through to find a happy ending. Doug's kidnapping is basically used as a running gag at this point to keep him out of the film. What I would have liked to see is for Todd Phillips to completely depart from this franchise, maintain the same rules, and try something daring to give us something fresh for these characters to do.Fans of The Hangover won't be entirely disappointed by Part III as much as they were with Part II. By no means does it reach the same caliber of the first, but it is coherent enough to work as an subpar sequel. At no point does Part III feel like an enjoyable farewell experience, and that's a shame. The actors make this film entertaining enough to get by, but The Hangover Part III never succeeds in being anything more than a way to cleanly tie up loose ends.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Hangover 3 is probably the worst in the trilogy, even losing out to the lack-luster 2nd instalment that everyone found to be too dull and boring.","The Hangover 3 is the conclusion to the trilogy. The story revolves around Alan, who has been off his medication for awhile and is up to a lot of bizarre Behaviour. The Wolf Pack, which consists of his friends Stu, Doug and Phil, takes Alan on a road trip to Arizona to get some help, only for them to get stopped by Marshall. Marshall is after his half of precious gold that Leslie Chow stole from him, and taking Doug as insurance, he tells the rest of the wolf pack that they must get Chow and his half of the gold to Marshall in three days or else Doug will die. How are the Wolf Pack involved, you ask? Well, you need to watch to find out. That's if, you can survive the first 20 minutes.The Hangover 3 is probably the worst in the trilogy, even losing out to the lack-luster 2nd instalment that everyone found to be too dull and boring. The Hangover 3 manages to take away most of the comedy aspect of the first two and turn it into a dark thriller, which some may find a little bit too much to handle. The film manages to let you know what your in for in the first 5 minutes, with Alan driving with Giraffe on the highway only for him to decapitate it and cause a big accident. The scene is probably the funniest thing about the film, but even than, the scene wasn't even funny.The first hangover is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so to top that would be impossible. The Hangover 2, while at least tried to be wildly funny, was basically the same as the first The Hangover, but had nothing much to offer. The third strays away from ""The Hangover"" formula and goes into a less comedic, more thriller type film. The film fails in that aspect and makes us wish the series ended after the first.I bought this film thinking I was going to get something funny. I love the first Hangover and could tolerate the second, but I didn't know this film would be this dull. It had nothing going for it, and concentrated too much on Leslie Chow and Alan, who may have stole the show in the first Hangover, but you get tired of them in this one. Maybe you can't have too much of a good thing.Grade: D",,Anonymous,Crime
Should Have Been Better!,"The third and final installment in the Hangover franchise has to be looked at as a slight disappointment. Due to the lack of a positive critical response for the last film, director Todd Phillips decided to change the formula. I think that may have been a mistake, because I loved the first two films because they were incredibly hilarious. While there are some funny scenes in this film, this is more action-packed and the jokes are far and between. It was nice to see everyone back and while the film is entertaining at times, it doesn't live up to the first two films.Phillip's film has the Wolfpack returning for one more adventure. Alan is suffering from a mental crisis and the rest of the crew decide to get him help. While on the road, they are taken by a crime lord named Marshall who is punishing the crew from the events of the first film. Now they must capture an escaped Chow or else one of their own will be killed.The acting is pretty good, depending on who you look at. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms continue being great as their respective characters of Phil and Stu. Zack Galifinakis is beginning to be annoying at times. He is funny at certain points, but his antics are growing old. The same can be said for Ken Jeong. Funny during some points, annoying in others. John Goodman makes a great villain, but he could have used more screen-time. Also, Melissa McCarthy makes a small cameo and she was pretty funny.Overall, the Hangover Three is not a bad film, but it lacks in comedy and real depth compared to the first two. People complained about the same formula, but I really liked it and it would have been a lot funnier that way. Some of the noticeably funny scenes involved a giraffe and I'll give them credit for that. It's a good movie at times, but it's certainly mediocre for the rest. I rate this film 6.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Departure from the Usual Shenanigans,"Plot: ""The Hangover Part III"" takes a departure from the typical formula of its predecessors, offering a different kind of adventure for the Wolfpack. This time, the film focuses on rescuing their friend Doug from a dangerous criminal, leading them on a wild journey that involves heists, a road trip, and unexpected twists.While the film retains the core characters and some comedic elements, it shifts its tone towards a darker and more action-oriented narrative. The plot moves away from the raunchy, drunken escapades that defined the first two films, aiming for a more character-driven and story-focused approach.However, this departure from the established formula may leave some fans disappointed. The absence of a wild bachelor party and the over-the-top comedic situations that made the previous installments so memorable is replaced with a more serious tone. While there are still comedic moments, they are fewer in number and often overshadowed by the film's attempts to conclude the trilogy with a different tone.The performances from the main cast, including Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis, remain solid, as they continue to display their comedic chemistry and bring their characters to life. The addition of John Goodman as the antagonist adds a compelling dynamic to the story, with his strong performance adding an extra layer of tension and humor.Director Todd Phillips delivers his signature polished style, incorporating sleek visuals and a well-paced narrative. The film maintains a sense of energy and momentum, even as it veers away from the outrageousness of the earlier films.While ""The Hangover Part III"" may not reach the heights of its predecessors, it still offers some entertaining moments and a fresh take on the characters. Fans of the series may appreciate the attempt to bring closure to the story arc, even if it means sacrificing some of the familiar comedic elements. If you approach it with an open mind and a willingness to embrace the change in tone, ""The Hangover Part III"" can still provide an enjoyable conclusion to the trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Probably should have left it at number two,"It goes without saying that 'The Hangover' (part I) was a great film. Its sequel (part II) was met with a mixed reception (personally, I quite liked it, while thinking it wasn't quite as good as the first one). However, now with Part III, they really seem to be dragging something out simply to make money.The sad fact: Part III just isn't that funny. There simply aren't enough jokes in there to warrant calling it a 'comedy.' Other people have noted how they've 'changed the formula' with this one, i.e. there's no actual hangover in this one where the cast wake up, not knowing what they did the night before and having to piece together the clues. Of course if Part III HAD followed this rule, everyone would be saying that it was just a second copy of the original, so the film-makers probably couldn't win either way.Also, coupled with Part III being a little low on jokes, Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan' has completed changed since the last two movies. Before, he used to be a lovable, but dumb sort. Now he's a complete idiot (and not a very nice one at that), leaving us finding it much harder to root for him during this third outing.However, whether you notice, or are that bothered by, the change in his character, it doesn't make much difference to the script, i.e. it's still short on jokes. Yes, the movie is watchable and short enough not to make me think I'd wasted an hour and a half of my life, but, when you compare it to Part I, it's noticeable how far it's fallen.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

In this film he tries too hard and my facial express didn't change one bit.

Not completely devoid of laughs but a severe disappointment once again.,"'THE HANGOVER PART III': Three Stars (Out of Five)The third, and supposedly final, chapter in the blockbuster comedy series that began in 2009 with the surprise sleeper hit 'THE HANGOVER'. That film launched the movie star careers of it's three leads Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis. They all reprise their roles in this film (for the third time) and Todd Phillips once again directs. Phillips and Craig Mazin took over writing duties from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore in the second and third films (along with Scott Armstrong for 'PART II'). This time around the three buddies (along with Justin Bartha, reprising his role again for the third time) are taking Alan to rehab when their attacked by gangsters and Doug is kidnapped. It's a different formula than the first and second films (which we're almost identical) this time around and not nearly as funny. Like the second film it's a major disappointment from the classic original.The story focuses around Alan (Galifianakis) who's been off his meds for several months and keeps getting into lots of trouble. His father, Sid (Jeffrey Tambor reprising his role), dies as a result of the stress from Alan's actions. Alan's buddies Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Bartha) decide to take him to get the treatment he needs for his mental issues when they're attacked by a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall wants revenge on the drug dealer, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong reprising his role), who recently escaped from prison. He kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the other three friends bring Mr. Chow to him. Sid, Stu and Doug come up with a plan to drug Chow and take him to Marshall but things go horribly wrong.The original 'HANGOVER' is one of my all time favorite comedies! I was so disappointed with 'THE HANGOVER PART II' for merely imitating the original film (almost exactly) and not coming up with any new laughs of it's own (a lot of the old jokes felt forced the second time as well). Here the filmmakers came up with a new formula and adventure to get their popular characters into but failed to deliver the laughs once again. For one thing the three leads are sober the whole film; how can you do a 'HANGOVER' film without getting the characters hung-over?! The actors give it their all and Phillips is always a decent director but the main problem with both sequels is Phillips thought he could replace the excellent two writers of the original film. He and Mazin don't know how to deliver the humor and fun that Lucas and Moore did (and the main reason this film isn't funny is it's lacking the fun). It's extremely dark, violent and just bizarre. It's hardly even a comedy film. Not completely devoid of laughs but a severe disappointment once again.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ucjLaVv_8",,Anonymous,Crime
Underrated but still....,"OK, I'm not a really big fan of the hangover series but I like it for the entertainment it provides to the audience.let's coffee top the point:This movie started off like any other typical comedy movie, wait did I say comedy? Well that's not actually the word to use here. Being a part of the hangover series one would definitely expect comedy but I must say this movie made me think thrice whether it belongs to that genre or not...This movie was centered more on the characters and action that it barely seemed to belong to the series, they tried to use a different formula which the character didn't get a hangover...reminds me, this movie should even be called the hangover part 3 , maybe just The Return of Chow or something.However, if seen from another point of view than a comedy(which is quite difficult) , the movie doesn't seem as bad as it is made to look...if we can forget the previous installments, then this movie could be enjoyable as well. Something that bugged me was that, Mr.Todd Phillips was trying to create something memorable or nostalgic but it didn't quite seem to work out(their return to Vegas, jade, Carlos etc) . It's just not that bad as it seems, nothing great to blow your mind but just a few laughs with nothing new to offer but entertainment and satisfaction.

Finally a sequel. More entertaining than funny,"In this one Phillips really gives us a sequel. The movie reflex on what happened in the prequels and the characters evolve on a dramatic level. It's funny, but it borrows a lot from the action genre. It's not a recollection of ""what happened last night?"", but more about facing the consequences of what happened the last two movies. It smartly uses this to connect it with the leads' journeys, showing a coherent evolution of their personalities and their relationships. And even if it is over the top still, I believe that it all goes back to the first entry levels of plausibility, which is a good thing.The director shows his touch to let the drama sink in and make the characters more human, with realistic and more natural reactions to what is happening to them.The script is pretty good, with a reflexive first half that sets up a crazy second. It's funny throughout, but the first 40 minutes are slower and really well written, without the use of outlandish stuff. Well, except for two really lazy and outdated jokes in the first 15 minutes.

Worst movie of the trilogy...,"""The Hangover Part III"" is the worst movie of The Hangover Trilogy. Willngly or not when you have a trilogy you get into the comparison process of the movies there are.Except of a really nice and unpredictable start of this movie the rest of it was really below average and I was really disappointed of it. This movie has to do of course with another Hangover but this time is a little bit different from the two other times. In this movie the three friends are trying to track down Mr. Chow.Finally I think that the story and plot of this third movie was a little more interesting from the other two movies but that was not enough for making this movie better.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
not. funny.,"Those guys should stop it already. its not funny anymore. never was.Well.... maybe was... once. The 1st movie was kinda good and it feels like a fresh idea. But now, its just another pathetic effort for some cash grab. The wolfpack didn't give us something new here. the action scenes weren't good either. Its just like when peter jackson decided to bring up a mere, small, simple, short story of a little hobbit into a much much much longer-than-needed trilogy. but, that's fine.While this movie.. not. stop it.

Funny!,"I am a huge fan of the first hang over movie and this movie is almost as good. To be honest I was one of the people who was very disappointed with the second installment of the franchise which was just basically different versions of the same events from the first movie but I think it works better in this third movie.First of all more Zach Galifianakis is always a good idea the guy is hilarious and the best part of the first two movies. I think maybe there is too much focus on him as the lead of the third movie because he was so good as the outside character but it still works and is a funny movie, totally worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too much of anything makes you feel sick,"The summary actually sums it up. Too much of the same kind of lewd one liners which the same expressions and actions gets too suffocation to the point of cloying. The first part was fantastic, the second was a little lower in standard and that is when you know you stop the franchise, but unfortunately everyone in Hollywood is so bent on continuing franchises and this is the result.Throughout the movie, you could see similarities to previous ones, similar situations, similar dialogues, one liners. The movie lacked creativity, it did not seem like a different movie. It was more of a modified version of the previous editions.Not saying it was totally bad. Some of the scenes really did make me crack up, its just they were not enough. Please stop now and don't continue the franchise coz it will only end in disaster.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Better than the sum of its parts,"The third part in the Hangover trilogy is as to be expected. It is crazy and over the top, with less laughs than the original, but provides a solid entertaining viewing.This instalment picks up some years later and following the passing of Alan's father his friends and family stage an intervention to put him in a care facility. Phil, Stu and Doug agree to drive him there and it is on this journey that things start to get crazy and land the 'Wolfpack' in trouble that they need to address.The movie can be summed up by the old phrase of being better than the sum of its own parts. By that i mean If you are familiar and enjoyed the previous movies, you should enjoy this one, even if it doesn't stand up to the original. We see more of Alan, which is always a good thing. We are familiar with the character and what they have been through. Mr Chow returns and provides some genuine laughs whilst being core the the whole story.Ultimately as a stand alone movie its not that memorable, but as part of the trilogy that nods its cap the the previous along with many calls backs to the past and its characters it is a sound watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Lame Attempt,"I was expecting so much more from this movie. I'm not especially picky when it comes to the movies I watch and I'll give anything a chance: from art house to blockbuster, Bollywood to Nollywood, shorts, whatever. I welcome movies that are entertaining, thought-provoking, beautiful or just plan kooky.This none is none of those things.The setup is one we expect: The gang is back. Cue the road trip, the disappearance of that one wolfpack member who always disappears, and the hijinx that ensue from the boys trying to save their friend. But the pacing grinds to a halt in places, the dialogue feels like it was written on the fly, and the characters remain undeveloped.This movie seemed to drag on forever, in no small part due to the lacklustre writing. At least 15 minutes was spent with one or two characters narrating a laborious back story. The main characters seemed to be in a perpetual state of shock, which was repeatedly expressed by the lines ""F&*k me!"" or ""WTF?"" There was nothing witty or amusing about the script. The actors seemed like they were just going through the motions and their performances were as stilted as the pace of this movie.For all these reasons, I just could not connect with any of the characters. I didn't care what happened to them one way or another.The only thing I enjoyed while watching this was hanging out with my husband and eating popcorn for an hour.While I relished the first movie, the only reason I imagine why this one was created was as a thinly veiled attempt to siphon as much money out of the movie-going masses as possible.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

okay,"uman pain and embarrassment may be the essence of comedy, but animal cruelty â"" outside the context of a ""Tom and Jerryâ? cartoon â"" is hardly funny. Director Todd Phillips' third film about the so-called Wolfpack touts its giraffe decapitation in its trailer; the film also includes the smothering of a chicken with a pillow and the poisoning of dogs. If you complain, you will be told to ""lighten upâ? or that ""it's just a jokeâ?; these are the same fallback responses employed by the despicable to defend racist and sexist humor, too. The first ""Hangoverâ? was troubling yet funny and ingenious; the retread sequel was xenophobic; ""Part IIIâ? is merely pointless, as the insufferable Phil (Bradley Cooper), the spineless Stu (Ed Helms) and the pathetic Alan (Zach Galifianakis, squandering a unique and once-promising comic creation) are overshadowed by the reckless and hyper gangster, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), in a return trip to Las Vegas.

Funny but not Hangover 1 Hilarious,"I think Hangover 1 was a comedy game-changer. Two and, now, three, just don't match it, there's no denying it. Whilst three was an adequate comedy, with quite a few laughs, in jokes and addenda to the first and second films, it's just missing something. I don't know what. The final Wolfpack trilogy sees the gang back together: Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug (Cooper, Helms, Galifianakis and Bartha respectively) pitting their wits against Chow (Jeong) and also a new character played by John Goodman.The gang are back in Vegas but also travel to Mexico, there's lots of high jinx, car crashes, crazy animal scenes, embarrassing scenarios and as always credit extras. Anyone who leaves straight away after the film misses the climax as with all of the trilogy. It's an entertaining film, well worth the view, and not regrettable by a long shot but it's missing something that would make it a great comedy rather than a good one. Perhaps it's that the first one had the element of surprise and it was so different. Cooper, again, is the star, the alpha wolf in the pack, and is more or less the straight man across from all the back and forth of Alan and Stu. Chow of course is off his head insane and he Jeong does that so well, but he's not as freaky as he was in the first two. Not so offensive, but still not vanilla, rude, crude and silly it's a giggle but it is not an exaggeration to say that it seems the writers have run out of laughs and ideas.Would recommend it, but go in knowing it's not as good as the first one. Don't have your hopes too high and you'll come out pleasantly surprised. Watch to the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I mean I think they could of done it a lot better. Bradley Cooper didn't seem happy to be in this movie at all! The acting was OK you could say. The plot was all over the place and like I said sadly no hangover just a completely pointless plot. it could've been better about 100%. The Audience wants to see a hangover not something else of course that is why it's called The Hangover.

"Weak, But Worth a Look","Hangover III is billed as the final chapter in the Hangover saga. The familiar characters that form ""the wolfpack"" take on a new adventure. This time, there is no bachelor party and no hangover that requires them to recreate their lost time. Instead there is a road trip, a kidnapping, and a life threatening adventure for 4 familiar faces. The story is filled with adult humor, offensive language, and references/flashbacks to the previous Hangover movies.""Chow"" is back and shares top billing with his new best friend ""Alan"". Chow has stolen some gold bars. Alan and the wolfpack are forced to hunt him down and find the gold or face dire consequences. The search leads them to Las Vegas where they all have bad memories from their first Hangover.Hangover III is more drama than comedy. The story was well told and easy to follow. The humor was accidental and infrequent. People who expect a hilarious movie will be extremely disappointed. Those who want to see misfits take on a challenge will be entertained.The credits begin to roll and there is additional footage which leads us to believe that there will be another Hangover to deal with. This added segment is the best part of Hangover III and is absolutely worth the price of admission. This segment is laugh-out-loud funny and the most unpredictable part of the movie.III was the weakest of the Hangovers, but still worth a look--best to view on cheap movie night or when out with the guys. I give it 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Less of a headache than the other Hangovers, but a long way from anything special.","Contrary, seemingly, to everybody else, I didn't care much for the first two ""Hangover"" films - the sheer volume and all the charging around had them feel like more was going on than actually was... It was to my tremendous surprise, then, that I took to the third film of the trilogy, which is certainly enjoyable if you try to put the first two films out of your mind and enjoy it for the rather daft causality driven thriller that it is. If you gave it a tweak here and there; kept the overarching plot devices and other content, ""The Hangover: Part 3"" becomes a little like an Elmore Leonard story or one of Westlake's 'Dortmunder' novels - luckless characters on the wrong side of some even worse people depicted as trying to get out of the jackpot whilst having a hard time obeying the law.The film, unlike the other two, chooses not to revolve the story around the aftermath of a night of drinking - the characters here are not relegated to attempting to piece together the remnants of a botched boozy fiesta from behind the veneer of a seemingly incoherent set of clues. Rather, the film grants them sobriety and lucidity: they know exactly what the score is and are otherwise in a state of able-mindedness to go about fixing it. The 'Wolfpack' remains unchanged: Bradley Cooper; Ed Helms; Justin Bartha and Zach Galifianakis are back playing Phil, Stu, Doug and Alan, respectively. In sticking to tradition (sort of), they lose Doug and even, for a brief few scenes, reacquire a familiar face played by Mike Epps.The reason for Doug's disappearance this time is the very real and very dangerous threat of a gangster named Marshall, who puts the wind up our established foursome and is played by John Goodman with satisfying gusto. For reasons not otherwise entirely convoluted, events dating right back to the first film linked to an off-screen a drug deal one of the Wolfpack was inadvertently involved in have caught up with them, and they must find the irresistible force of international man of mystery Lesley Chow (Ken Jeong) in order to put things right.Much of this is a cue for mayhem, particularly when Chow himself tricks the gang into stealing something for him which they really ought not have done, but mayhem which just seems to be under a tighter rein that before. Perhaps it is because I am too often a sucker for films such as ""City of Industry"" when they come along that I enjoyed this Part Three, which essentially depicts (sort of) the aftermath of a heist and those on the wrong end of a betrayal during said heist who then strive to get their 'share' back. Broadly speaking, American critic Christy Lemire is right when she writes that the film ""...runs a different sort of risk by going to places (different) than its predecessors, both artistically and emotionally. It dares to alienate the very audience that made 'The Hangover' the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time.""In a move which should, for all intents and purposes, have made me dislike it even more than the first two, the film combines the elements of its predecessors: the espionage and action-orientated fluff of the second, which is interwoven, partly, with the locale and the players of the first. The tone seems more grown up - there is more at stake; none of our characters is having fun in this particular adventure. Gone is that sense of it being a bit of a romp or a bit of a laugh, and it stays on a track that stops it from veering off into the nightmarish territory of the second. In a crucial moment which represents, more broadly, the maturing of the series, the film dares to have its characters express both disgust and exasperation when their misadventure forces them to roll back into Las Vegas to find what they're looking for.The film is far from anything fantastic; it is no tremendous experience, neither moving nor affecting. It possesses little-to-no especially attentive character study beyond the crew's lamenting of being forced into confronting old hunting grounds and crossing paths with old enemies: Galifianakis' character opens the film with a sequence you will not have previously witnessed involving a sports car and a giraffe - from here, his day gets worse when he suffers a bereavement at home and then faces being carted off to a psychiatric institution. In terms of individual film characters having a bad day, rarely does it get much worse. But where does any of it go? By the end, he is still a liability. Has he changed? We can't say, as the film terminates just as a new chapter in his life opens up. If there is never again another ""Hangover"" film, it would not bother me in the slightest, although, to my minute shame, I did enjoy this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

One Hangover Too Many,"This is what happens when one tries to force a capstone film on a trilogy that really did not need one. The fact is that the first two movies were big because the first one had a refreshing and unique take to it and let's be honest, the sequel just recycled it. This movie eschews that formula entirely. In fact there is no ""how did this happen?"" hilarity but rather a lot of bland, forced narrative. In fact, its biggest mistake is taking the two characters best used as momentary oner-liners and scene-stealers and trying to develop a whole movie around them. It leaned far, far too heavily on the very dry Alan and the 'Chow' character. He was a million times better jumping naked out of a trunk.They avoid exactly what made them great to force a storyline that 'wraps up' the trilogy.

"In honor of our recent loss Ray Manzarek, ""This is the end...""","In ""The Hangover III,"" the mystery comes from a reinvented formula; there is no wedding or missing groomsman. No actual hangover to speak of, and a lack of scenarios fueled by alcohol from which to recover. Instead, the film is produced as more of a caper than a comedy. Despite not being 'good' movie: a litany of crude humor that becomes repetitive that falls flat for a majority of the film, the third act does provide a few moments of genuine charm and appeal. And yes, this is a real stretch, but I'm trying.The latest misadventures by the antisocial man-child Alan (Zach Galifianakis) cause buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) to stage an intervention. But on their way to hand deliver Alan to a mental health clinic in Arizona, they experience an intervention of their own. The group is captured by crime kingpin Marshall (John Goodman), who needs their help in tracking down the fugitive Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Mr. Chow stole $21 million in gold bricks from Marshall, and pressing the ""Wolfpack"" into service may be the only means of recovery. In the meantime, he'll hold Doug for safekeeping.""The Hangover III"" is the most sentimental, (hence the finale), and yet the darkest of the franchise where the eccentricity doesn't always work as well as it should. To it's credit, there are some escapades and plot twists along the way (from Tijuana to Vegas), and it's never out right boring, all set to a bizarre soundtrack that incorporates Hanson, Danzig, and Schubert.You get the feeling director Todd Philips would rather be making a straight-up action movie, as opposed to creating a string of comedic episodes. The on screen disaffection of Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms reeks of paychecks already spent, leaving Zack Galifianakis to fill the void with material that works better around the margins. Ken Jeong reprises his role as a lunatic criminal with the bare minimum of effort. He appears more animated in the Bud Light commercials when compared to this outing. The post-credits epilogue does provide a truly twisted array of images, a fitting send-off for a series recognized as being the highest-grossing R-rated comedies of all time. This is in fact the end - and it is what it is. We've had some good laughs. Let's part amicably.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Todd Phillips owes me a refund!!!!,"When I saw The Hangover in 2009, it was the funniest movie I had seen in years. I went to see it multiple times. It was crude, but very funny, but also there was an odd sweetness in seeing these 3 guys looking for their friend that made it more enjoyable. When the second one came out, I like most of the original's fans was disappointed. It was a carbon copy of the original but set in Thailand. It had its moments but overall it wasn't close to being as funny as the first one. One of the reasons that it wasn't as funny is that the movie felt more ugly, almost cruel. There were laughs but much fewer and far between.Then on to the 3rd one. Todd Phillips and company had learned from the lessons of the past film right? They would return to at least the tone of the first film and finish the ""trilogy"" on a high note, right? Well the answer is a resounding NO! The Hangover 3 is so off putting and unfunny that I think it shouldn't be called a comedy. The Wolfpack find themselves again in a situation looking for Doug. They meet a drug dealer that is looking for Mr. Chau and tasks them to find him. it all sounds like it would be funny, but it isn't. First I think that the problem with the 2 sequels is that they weren't written by the same team as the original. Second, Ken Jeong as Chau is one of the most annoying character in a long time. In the first one, he stole every scene he was in, but he was not a focus. This film he becomes a main character. Ken Jeong is an actor that is fearless, and can be hilarious, but this character is cruel and unfunny, and is the biggest negative about this film. Bradley Cooper does nothing but react to the craziness, Ed Helms does what he can, and Zach Galifianakis has a few moments as Alan that remind us of why the first one was so good. I don't understand how anyone thought that this was funny. Todd Philips wrote this script and I think he has shown to be a one trick pony. He became a hot director because of the first film, but has done nothing good since, except cash in. There is one moment at the end of the movie that is outrageous and hilarious and definitely proves how unfunny the rest of the film was.This was in my mind by far the worst film of the summer and one of the worst sequels ever made.Grade: D- (not an F because of the final scene)",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Hangover III – No Hangover required,"So this is a film which I was really hesitant to go see as The Hangover II left me with an utter sense of disappointment, But never judging a movie by its trailer (Usually trailers give far to much away) I decided to go watch this film with two of my best friends.This film has a great beginning which although less chuckle worthy sets the film in motion, which helped drive what plot there was along, This characters are all still there but with more of a focus on the weird and wonderful Alan, Now for this point the film should not have been called the hangover III it should have been called Alan the movie which all in all is not a bad point BUT This film works on more of an Action / Thriller genre with humor thrown in where needed, And as a comedy, the writing has certainly changed to keep it fresh without the constant use of old jokes (Baby masturbating / monkey wenis) The comedy is extremely funny in places but with some obvious cheap laughs thrown in because some of the scenes would seem bland.On the directing front this is still directed by the same director todd phillips, although with the directing style and the cinematic shots you would not honestly be able to tell. But this also goes to show he is a diverse Director with a good future in action movies in his future too As with all the hangover films the soundtrack is brilliantly chosen which adds to the chaos we usually see in the film Some fresh faces turn up here and there and some old faces that was not quite as memorable and lots of type cast roles (John Goodman) but still with some great acting This film will have you laughing but wishing it was better than the original This film scores a 7 / 10 Not too original but also a better than average comedy",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hangover 3 - Good but not the best,"I thought that the Hangover III was a really good movie. From my opinion, there were many scenes that were really funny. Some people claim that there are inappropriate scenes where sex and drugs are involved but from just hearing the name ""Hangover"" that should not be a surprise. If you enjoy comedies I would recommend you to watch this movie. I would not say it is one of the best and funniest movie I have ever seen but it is sure one of my top 10 on my list. However, it lacks the charm that made the first Hangover movie so good. This movie would be a perfect movie to watch when you are ridiculous hangover and feel to relax and watch a really good and funny movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Disappointing,I made the huge mistake of getting my hopes high for this movie.I waited the whole time to see a humorous scene where i could laugh like the other parts of hangover but instead it ended with a very disappointing note.Maybe I had my hopes too much for this sequel.Its not a comedy movie but instead its genre should be drama. The only positive part about the movie is Mr. Chow (Ken jeong).He just stole the show from the wolf pack totally.If there is a hint of smile in your face after seeing the movie is because of this guy. I wonder what would happen if his role wasn't characterized properly. Overall my rating is very low for this movie because Hangover was one of my favorite movies of all time..... :(,4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Better Than You Expect, Not Better Than You Hope","Some time after the events in Bangkok, Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) have turned thankfully towards mundane lives with family, but Alan (Zachary Galifianakis) remains unsettled. The ramifications of a giraffe purchase send Alan's father (Jeffrey Tambor) into cardiac arrest, reuniting the Wolfpack with the intention of sending Alan to a mental rehabilitation facility. On the way, the four are attacked by a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman) who wants several million dollars worth of gold returned to him after being stolen by Chow.The first film in this series was a breath of fresh comic air - timely, hilarious, a real ""guy movie"" that the ladies wouldn't have any part of. The sequel was a summer blockbuster; not as funny, considerably darker, but still a worthy addition to the Hangover brand. The finale drops the premise of its prequels to focus on three action packed days with nary a mention of the drugs and alcohol that sent our heroes into a memory loss stupor. The third is different entirely from the first two, and therefore can't be compared as the third in a trilogy, but as the sequel to the first two.One of the most fascinating characters is Stu, the dentist with a dark side who does things that I'm not sure I am able to write about here without being reported. The most tame act he commits is a sham marriage to a baby-wielding prostitute, yet in the third film he manages to drive a limo around. Crazily. Phil, the level-headed macho man, makes the obligatory call to tell the others the trio has give up. Here, he helplessly looks around as Chow plays them for fools. Even Alan, played by the expert comic Galifianakis, only gets chuckles as he hits on the fat girl from Bridesmaids who expertly plays the fat girl from Bridesmaids.The characters are less developed and do less, which should be expected in the trifecta, but perhaps we expected more out of Todd Phillips and his crazy, drug-addled world. The formula is gone but the characters are there, the hilarity is gone but the situations are there. It's difficult to judge The Hangover 3. It plays out like it has been filmed but not finished; as if this is the bow hastily tied on to the series before the temptation to make more could be unwrapped.",,Anonymous,Crime
Wolf Pack Conclusion,"Whereas the second 'Hangover' movie was more of a rehash of the first adventure than a true sequel to it, this third 'Hangover' entry does some decidedly different things with mixed yet mostly positive results. Most notably, the film taps into several of the original's subplots as the drug dealer's unseen boss from the first film gets a face with John Goodman in a performance that delightfully references 'The Big Lebowsk'. The fact that Goodman decides to hold on to Justin Bartha (Doug) while forcing the rest of the Wolf Pack to work for him never quite feels like the right move (a more ambitious sequel would have had Doug finally share his friends' adventures) but there is little disputing how well the three main players interact with each other and Ken Jeong gets more screen time than ever before, as well as scattered character growth. Mike Epps and Heather Graham also make welcome returns to the story with the film possessing some truly touching moments as the friends visit Graham's baby from the first film, now at an age at which he can walk and talk. The less said about Melissa McCarthy's extended cameo here, the better though, and some gags (giraffe) push the boundaries of good taste, but in general there is quite a lot here to like with the film actually building on the events of the first two movies rather than just aping them.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Chow down on some formulaic drivel,"The one positive of Hangover III is that there was at least some attempt at an original story. Not much of an attempt granted, but still more imaginative than the previous godforsaken sequel. Regardless, this is another dreadful film that further tarnishes the reputation of the perfectly enjoyable original. All the jokes are worn extremely thin and even Ed Helms has become grating by this point. Mr Chow, one of the worst characters I can remember seeing in any film, is given an unacceptable amount of screen time and predictably butchers every second of it.

Just another another average flick.,"Let me start off by saying that I am an avid movie, film and TV show watcher and collector. However, as with any review, this is just my opinion. I know a lot about movies, but that does not qualify me or anyone to tell someone what is a good film. I believe that a true movie fan, should watch any and all movies. But that is not possible, so we read reviews to decide what to watch. Just take reviews with a grain of salt, if you want to see a movie... do it. Don't let bad review(s) detour you.Now I am a fan of the Hangover movies. I have seen the first two, and own both of them. The first one is great, the second one not so much. This one is radically different then the first two in the series. First, the third one has more of a plot than the second and even the first. I think this is a good thing, I love the first one but I wish it had more going on. Second, the film is not as explicit as either of the first two. The second one especially was just a lot of gross out humor. Even the first one had some, but Hangover: Part III goes for more awkward situations. To top it all off Hangover: Part III is not even about a hangover.In short I thought Hangover: Part III was average and forgettable. I give it 5 out of 10. It is loads better than Hangover: Part II and stills fails to live up to The Hangover. There were a few giggles for me but over all I didn't even find it that funny. I will not be buying this one, and I bought Part II. The director Todd Phillips has shown that he has skill when it comes to comedy with films like Old School and The Hangover. I just wish he would stop making sequels to The Hangover.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Maybe if you are bored and you saw already the best movies of this year, you can watch this but don't expect much. This was a really disappointment movie, and a bigger disappointment if you compare it with the other parts.

The Wolfpack is back at it again!,"""I told myself, I would never come back.""I had read so many bad reviews about this third installment of The Hangover that I kept putting off this movie until I finally decided to watch it last night and was glad I did. The second film was a lazy copy of the first (which I had loved), but I was let down by that sequel and wasn't expecting much from this. I guess that my lowered expectations helped me enjoy this film a lot more because I had a great time at the movies and laughed during several scenes what I hadn't laughed in any other comedy I'd seen this year (Identity Thief, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, He's Way More Famous Than You, The Guilt Trip, and This is 40). The Hangover Part III is a lot funnier than any of those movies were, and it is better than the first sequel; just don't expect it to be like the original. I'm glad Todd Phillips decided to take an entirely different direction here and incorporate some action. I didn't find this movie dark like a lot of people are saying it was and I didn't think it was serious either. I laughed several times and enjoyed the new characters. I think the film could have used a little less of Ken Jeong and not have made Zach Gallifianakis's character as mean as he was here, but overall I still think this film worked. Todd Phillips has had several hit and misses in his career as a director, and I would say The Hangover Part III kind of stands in the middle. It helped me that I went with such low expectations for this film and left the theater entertained.The wolfpack is back together again for a third time, although this time no one is getting married and there is no bachelor party. Doug (Justin Bartha) convinces Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) to help him take Alan (Zach Galifinakis) to a mental institution after he has decided to stop taking his medication. Alan has been having a bit of anger issues, and so the wolfpack decide to get together again to drive Alan to an institution, but on their way they are assaulted by Black Doug (Mike Epps) and his boss Marshall (John Goodman). They kidnap Doug and are forced to find Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). If they don't find him in less than 72 hours then Doug will be dead. Apparently Mr. Chow has stolen from Marshall a large amount of gold, and he wants it back. This is where the madness begins, and the three friends are forced to locate Mr. Chow and bring him back in exchange for Doug.I really enjoyed John Goodman's performance here although he didn't get much screen time. He was really good in his role as Marshall and set the tone of the film. There is a lot more action and thrills in this third installment. Another new secondary character in this film is Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), although she's barely five minutes in this movie. I thought she was funny, but I don't agree that her scenes were the highlight of the film. I'm not in love with her as most critics are, and have only enjoyed her role in Bridesmaids. Maybe Identity Thief is still to fresh on my mind and it doesn't allow me to enjoy her more. The Hangover Part III is a worthy sequel and I think a great place to end the trilogy. None of these films will be as fresh as the original however.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
0/10 Hoped this would make up for H2,"I had very low expectations and even those weren't met .H1 was good and that's where it should've ended. H2 was bad , the $100m budget for H3 may have been spent on marketing and possibly on the opening 5 minutes and royalty cheques were cashed in very soon and no one was really bothered about the comedy as the laughs were simply non existent - hope those who were tricked into the cinema got their money back - please don't make H4 - Please it just waters down the brand -OK Aiplane 1 & 2 were both good but rarely do comedy sequels measure up they're just a cash cow - look at the Police Squad films - hopefully Dumb & Dumber to might buck the trend :)",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
How the Mighty Have Fallen,"I liked Hangover. It was a cool movie with a really fun story and a great cast with a damn good script behind them. One of my least favorite aspects was Alan and Chow, the two characters with the least amount of actual good writing. Now the actors worked with what they had, but overall outside of anybody in high school they weren't that funny.I read somewhere that Jack Sparrow , essentially a side character in the original pirates movie, was modeled sort of like Han Solo. Start of as a side character and then given a prominent role. Now anybody who watched Return of the Jedi will attest to the fact that Han Solo is actually the weakest part of that movie next to the ewoks. Same as Jack sparrow until the series was actually tailored around him he made the series worse the more he was there. Case I'm trying to make LESS is MORE.Alan might be funny to some people, but he essentially ruins any believability in the movies. Granted in the first one he was a nice guy and was loyal. He was dumb, sweet, and awkward, but there was redeeming qualities about him.Now he's just a jerk. There's nothing to like every problem the main characters have is because of him after Hangover 1. Now this wouldn't be such a big problem except all the jokes in Hangover Part II are tailored around him and Chow.I love a lot of things about both this and Hangover Part II. They are significantly darker and have a lot more realism then the first movie. Which totally gets undercut by having alan and Chang in ever scene acting impossibly over the top and stupid. I like that this is basically a thriller and that the laughs aren't as important, but even then the thriller aspects aren't handled very well.The Best Hangover movies right now are Hangover 1, Pain and Gain, and Horrible Bosses. There's your trilogy 3 great movies which understand story structure and dark humor and silly absurd humor. We all know these obligatory sequels are impossible to get away from.

Hangover part 3 on the other hand in not. I don't remember coming out of a comedy, even if its crap, and not laughing at least once.

They also ruin the character Alan in this movie, which I thought would have been an impossible job but they managed to do it. He comes over, yes as a retard, but also as an ass and a character that I loved in the first two movies I now dislike in this film. The only good thing about this film was the plot line. I thought the plot was actually stronger than the other two movies and I know I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had any funny bits at all.

Bradley Cooper is amazing, as well as Zach, who stayed true to his role. Somehow, I feel it was quite boring, not really believable, honestly, almost fallen asleep in the theater.

Did We Need Part III? Yes. Did We Need This Plot? No.,"There's just no way around it: The Hangover could have used a third (and final, hopefully) installment, but this is NOT good enough, in any way, shape or form, to match up to the excellent original and solid sequel.The main issue is the plot, which feels as hashed together as I can imagine the entire film was. The performances of the main characters are still as solid as they've ever been, but Bradley Cooper has come a long way in between Hangovers and his presence is almost...overbearing? It's hard to pinpoint, but none of the actors (including a more involved Ken Jeong as Chow and a unnecessarily involved John Goodman as the film's antagonist) are helped by the thin and void story.Without spoiling it, I'll just say that the plot itself chokes the humor out of the film. Each of the previous Hangovers worked by creating situations that were, in and of themselves, hilarious, and then adding the reactions of a handful of excellent comedic actors. A bit of improv must have come into play as well, and even that feels cut off for most of Part III. The potential danger that created the tension in the first two films is diluted to the point where it doesn't work how it's supposed to work: as a platform for the humor. Nothing is better than a good laugh when you might be expecting things to go wrong...and even when they go wrong in Part III, you can't seem to find it in you to care as you once did.In the end, you'll most likely wonder, like myself, why any of this had to happen in the first place. I'm not talking about the film, but the story within, which is absolutely ridiculous to begin with and gets no better as it continues to unfold. There are some truly funny moments...with such an impressive cast, it was an impossibility to completely avoid that. But these are too far between a shoddy script to justify itself. A poor idea laced into a great overall idea (concluding the series with a bang) makes the entire thing...below itself as a franchise installment.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Flawless franchise..,"When your first movie is so well received you think of turning it into a franchise. And then come movies carrying the branding they got from the first, but with mediocre stuff - this is the inevitable reality with almost all franchises.And if your franchise runs on comedy, you better be kidding if you think the sequels will meet the expectations. Making a single comedy movie that is appreciated by people with different levels of sense of humor is the hardest act in movie business. I mean there's setting, plot, execution, twists, ending and then the jokes itself - getting all of it right.So the ""Hangover"" franchise is one of the very few outliers in the history of comedy cinema, where you have 3 movies, and all three are exceptionally good - I mean rib-tickling to the very end. Todd Philips and his writers get credit for that- and yes, they would still not be so successful if they weren't dealing with a genius cast - Zack, Bradley, Ed Helms and Ken Jeong.These movies are some of those things that make life worth living!!

Hangover III: Chowabunga!,"The movie opens with Alan in the midst of transporting a giraffe in a trailer he is pulling. I don't need to elaborate that this trip does not end well. As the result of Alan's mishap we see the gang first appear together at a funeral for Alans father played by a scene stealing Jeffrey Tambor. The fact that the film starts at a funeral instead of a wedding is a not so subtle hint that this hangover will prove to be even darker than the first two. The introduction sequence ends with the gang driving Alan to a mental health spa after an intervention.The film takes another tangent and the set up for the inciting incident comes from a gangster out of the past that kidnaps one of the gang and sending the wolf pack back into action to rescue their own. This is quite a bit different than the initial two films. There is not hangover and they didn't do anything wrong...yet. The gangster is played by John Goodman and there are not many actors that are such a sure thing as he is in any role. There is even a surprise character here from the past that while this may not have been the most creative plot, they were a stickler for detail and a lot of attention is paid to the details. if you keep your eyes open there are shout outs and homages throughout.The movie here really focuses on Alan and Mr. Chow as not only the main characters, but really the only characters. Stu, Phil and Doug could have just been cardboard props for the movie and you would have saved a ton of money and lost very little in the way of acting. Ken Jeong, as Mr. Chow, absolutely steals the show. His character should have a place in all time best character anti hero. This film would not be watchable without Mr. Chow. he takes a film on life support and gives it a level up to a pretty decent movie. It's not a great film, it's a pretty decent movie. It's shot wonderfully, lit perfectly, great audio, decent to really good acting and enough plot twists and nostalgia to be worthwhile. Make sure you wait to watch the credits. It's a steal at redbox or the Dollar show and if you get your tickets at costco like I do it's a fair deal. Big screen is always best.

An inconsequential end to a deteriorating franchise,"The Hangover Part III is one of those movies that I forgot about merely seconds after the end credits started to roll. I thought what I had just seen was a mirage of some sort. A comedy so unbelievably weak that it cannot simply serve as the end to one of the wildest saga of comedy movies ever made. But alas, there is just no way around how bad this final Hangover really is.When the first film debuted in 2009, it opened to mixed critical reviews but to a strong word of mouth consensus amongst its audience and became one of the biggest unexpected hits of the year. It launched the careers of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifinakis from comedic players to top billing superstars. It was an even bigger hit on DVD, and a sequel was already in the works. The future really did look bright for comedy, and for Todd Phillips as his directorial career had now found itself in a massive resurgence.Then, when the sequel debuted in 2011, audiences from across the country piled into movie theaters in hopes of another summer laugh riot. These hopes were quickly dashed when it was realized that the Hangover Part II was a carbon copy of the original. It was one of the biggest disappointments in comedy since Ghostbusters 2, but it did supply us with a few memorable quotes and inspired insanity if nothing else.Now, we have The Hangover Part III. The question remains, why does it even exist? Who was asking for it? I couldn't name anyone who wanted anything to do with the Hangover after its disastrous second part. But, there it was, Hangover III. Whether you like it or not, your getting it. Whats more is that it isn't even remotely similar to the two movies prior to it. In fact, there's no hangover to be found at any point in this film (minus the end credits). Quite contradictory to the title, or even the WHOLE PURPOSE of the franchise!Yeah, I guess Todd Phillips and co. were so terrified with what they received with the second movie, that they insisted on abandoning everything that constituted a Hangover movie and instead leave the memorable characters to revel in black comedy and senseless melodrama. If you can believe it, this movie is even more black than its sequel (and that movie included jokes about cocaine overdoses and the victims of the Vietnam war). Yes, we are forced to focus on the mad inner workings of Alan's mind, and why he is a burden to society and everyone close to him. Alan was once the most lovable inappropriate man-child the world has ever seen. Now, I wanted to strap him down and pluck every last whisker from his beard. We also focus on Leslie Chow's crazy antics again because. well LOOK ITS CHOW AGAIN!!! He's so crazy, right?Everything else is just flavorless and boring. Even Melissa McCarthy can't save this mess. I'll admit that a few of the jokes made me laugh in a twisted Terry Zwigoff sort of way. But other than a few of the dark jokes. there's nothing really that enjoyable about this Hangover. So we bid thee, farewell. I don't think we'll miss you, Wolfpack.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Inevitable, but unnecessary and lazy.","So I came to a movie theater, sat through this film for 100 minutes and when the credits started rolling I was like, ""OK guys, the joke was too long, and now show me the real third 'Hangover' that I came to see. It turns out that there is no real third 'Hangover' and we have to get what's given. And what's given is too little. Yes, the first two films did well in the box-office so the third part was inevitable but it's not an excuse for this film being such a lifeless comedy. There is no drive, no epicness that were in parts 1 & 2. The Wolf Pack look tired and absolutely not interested in being in this film, some other characters appear just to show a familiar face and don't have memorable scenes and the storyline feels superficial and concocted out of thin air. Yes, I did have a couple of good laughs and maybe it would work better as just another comedy but you expect much more from a Hangover movie.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A subdued and good enough goodbye to The Hangover,"I'm glad it wasn't a copy of the first like the second one was but had it's own story. It was clearly a goodbye movie tying together the trilogy and with that mind, it was done well enough. It had laughs and I wanted some more of the wolf pack so I got it. But I am glad they stopped after this. The Hangover is just so amazing that the good feelings from it carry over to the other two less-than-perfect films and satisfy that craving to watch more of The Hangover adventures. This is what it was and I liked it and I would definitely go back and watch The Hangover itself a few more times. The direction, the writing, the cast, the music, the editing - everyone did a very, very good job! Kudos!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Trust Hollywood,"Trust Hollywood to take a good movie and wreck it by making mindless, craptacular sequels.The first Hangover movie was good: hilariously funny at times, and more intelligent than your average Hollywood slapstick. It did seem to run out of new ideas and steam at about the 1 hour mark though.That concluding lack of steam and originality carried through to The Hangover II. It was pretty much a copy-and-paste of the first one. Different location, but very similar plot (and, obviously, the same characters). Interesting at times, but mostly fairly predictable and mundane.The Hangover III is even worse. Stupid, pointless, not funny at all. Zach Galifianakis' character, always the worst and most irritating aspect of the Hangover movies (or any movie he is in) is even more irritating than before.Hopefully there is no Part IV.Avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Dull, random, poor quality plot.","None of the three Hangover movies have been spectacular, but the two first ones were quite amusing. The Hangover part III however, is another story. The movie started off very dull, and the supposed funny scenes were by no means amusing, its was just stupid. The part about the giraf could have been funny, if it hadn't been used in ever SINGLE advertisement for the hangover!. However the plot does develop, just not into anything good. The whole concept of hangover, and the feeling of ""shit, that's happened to me"" does not apply to this movie at all. There is nothing anyone can related to, unless they have been involved with gang-people ofc. I know I laughed three times during the movie, once it was actually genuinely funny, and the other times I laughed because I felt stupid having wasted so much money watching this movie. It is simply just a fail. However, based on the ending of the movie, there is potential for a 4th one, but the 3rd one should never have been made.

He didn't even stick to the same concept, indeed we're not in the post-party morning situation anymore, where the Wolf Pack has to put the pieces together.

"A pointless film with an astoundingly shallow plot, whose sole purpose is to be as nasty as possible in an attempt to humour us. The result - we rarely rejoice this Hangover.","Hangover III is a kinda pointless film with an astoundingly shallow plot, whose sole purpose is to be as nasty and crass as possible in an attempt to humour us. The result - we rarely rejoice this Hangover.Unlike everybody else present in the theatre hall, I haven't seen the previous instalments in the Hangover series. And yet I felt throughout as though I was watching not a film but a season of Hangover; littlest thought has been given to the plot, and the characters have simply been thrown into a couple of pretty straightforward situations and given some silly sketches to perform. And it doesn't help that our three leads sleepwalk their parts, totally unenthused by the material. Even as a non-fan, I can clearly sense that Hangover has jumped the shark.What writers Todd Phillips and Craig Mazin do here is expand a few loose threads from the previous films or rather 'episodes'. It begins with our jailed Korean lunatic Leslie Chow escaping Klong Klem prison after creating a prison riot to distract authorities. On the other side, rich bum Alan seems to live his life leisurely, buying a giraffe and accidentally killing it and indulging in similar misdemeanours. That's when Alan's family and his buddies, including fellow 'Wolfpack' members Phil, Stu and Doug, decide that he needs an intervention.And so our four heroes embark on another journey, expecting nothing to bother them this time. But soon their journey turns to another wild ride when a couple of guys in pig-faced masks ram their vehicle and kidnap them in broad daylight. They are taken to an isolated spot, where we learn that their kidnappers are Marshall's men, which includes Doug; Doug had a minor role in the first film and Marshall's name was only mentioned by him once in that film.Marshall informs Phil, Stu and Doug that their friend Alan has been in constant touch with Leslie Chow via the internet; the two crazy net-pals loved sharing the inane and insane misdemeanours they committed, it seems. Marshall wants to hunt Chow down and get the gold-bricks (worth millions) that Chow stole from Marshall's men (they in turn had stolen it from the bank) years ago. Now that he has found the only link to Chow, he gives Phil, Stu and Alan the task of finding the madman and bringing him to Marshall. If they fail, Doug, who shall remain with Marshall's men, will be killed.It doesn't take much time to find Chow as the guy tells Alan via internet to meet him in Mexico. Chow is really a disgusting piece of sh*t who shall, for Christians at least, die a horrible death in hell! The insane guy who speaks very much like Hannibal Lecter, brags how he spends his time in Mexico (you know the way most people do) cockfighting, giving men blowj*bs etc (certainly going to hell!... According to Orthodox Christians, at least). The four make a plan to retrieve the stolen gold from 'Chow's mansion' in Mexico, and they succeed, except that it's not Chow's mansion but Marshall's and the 'stolen' gold was Marshall's half that wasn't stolen by Chow before (but it is now, obviously).Now it would hardly make sense for Marshall to rely on Phil, Alan and Stu but the makers of Hangover need an excuse to harass our trio further. So Marshall orders them to find Chow, get gold or Doug's dead. The makers also need to come up with an 'intervention' for rich bum Alan, so there's a 'what-can-at-least-in-this-case-be-deemed- as-touching' moment between him and Jade's son Tyler (Jade is recurrent character from Hangover 1) plus his romantic connection with Cassie, a pawnbroker who rejoices in treating her mom like sh*t. All roads finally leads the three to Vegas, where it all ends indeed.There are a lot many times you'd hear the f-word in Hangover III, usually in flat and unimaginative dialogues like 'F*ck!' 'What the f*ck's going on?' 'Motherf*cker'. We chuckle a couple of times, then start wondering whether it's really funny. Do the filmmakers want us to guffaw like an idiotic teenager whenever the 'f-word' is spoken? Is being nasty all the time real comedy?Even the situations in which the characters are thrown are given very less thought. Consider the scene where Chow and Stu enter the mansion to disable security cameras and buzzers before the rest can proceed. Except for Chow acting like a mad dog (literally), crawling on his fours, sniffing Stu's butt and later saying he's color-blind while instructing Stu which color wire to disable, nothing else is done to make the situation more interesting. Hangover III has one-dimensional situations, and that's just sad.The trio of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are barely risible and act like they've been given a chore. On one hand, a cardboard would've looked more excited than the disinterested Bradley Cooper and on the other hand, Ed Helms does bad comedy. With more focus given to Zach's character Alan this time, he fares better yet totally fails on occasions. Like the part where Alan complements Phil's body in a Diesel t- shirt (never include product placement in a joke): a total FAIL. It's only fresher (to the series) Melissa McCarthy as pawnbroker Cassie who injects some freshness to this feeble film.The movie says 'It all ends here' but Tyler's and McCarthy's introduction plus the post- credits scene hint there's more Hangover in store. Wish these guys would hang up their boots and retire and say ""Nevermore!"".",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Hangover III: Charmless and Humorless,"This film is not recommended.I don't know at what point I began to truly dislike The Hangover Part III. There were so many opportunities before the film descended into an incoherent mess. Was it when the giraffe was decapitated? When a rooster was slowly smothered to death in the misguided name of comedy? Was it when Ken Jeong's annoying character, Mr. Chow, entered the film and was neither decapitated or killed?Who knows, but I can tell you this: The film's 100 minute length seems interminable, devoid of any humor or merit. Its sole purpose of existence is making a buck or two million from its undiscriminating fan base who lap up this cinematic swill. The film's disclaimer states that no animals were hurt in the filming of this movie, but the movie-going audience does suffer and needs to be put out of its misery...fast.The filmmakers take their successful formula and rarely stray from that premise. The formula of vulgar jokes and inane debauchery again follows the mishaps of three closely knit child- men, four, if you count Doug (Justin Bartha) who usually is MIA during most of the film. (Mr. Bartha needs to thank his agent for his lack of screen time here.) The boys, Stu and Phil (Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper, disrespectfully), are united once again to bring Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to rehab. Along the way to Arizona, they encounter a mobster (John Goodman) and are sent on a mission to retrieve some stolen gold and the aforementioned Mr. Chow, landing them back in Sin City, NV.Mixing the Hope / Crosby 40's road movie format and the Three Stooges slapstick antics, and adding more than a dash of gross-out sophomoric humor and ribald sexual comedy, The Hangover Part III lacks any originality or clever moments. (Even the Wolfpack trio, as they are called, too closely resemble Moe (Cooper), Larry (Helms), and Curly (Galifianakis) in their character hierarchy.) There's nothing new here. The film rehashes itself in a desperate attempt to appear to be hip and cool, but the results are merely contrived and dull.Misdirected by Todd Phillips and poorly written by him and Craig Mazin, The Hangover Part III is sloppy drunk in its execution. There are no funny lines and hilarious situations, just tired and lazy writing. The sight gags don't work. The decision to give the obnoxious Mr. Chow almost equal screen time as the three lead characters was a major misfire. All of the actors, who have proved to be fine actors in other films, are certainly slumming here. I guess the cast's ability not to look remotely embarrassed spouting off the film's lame dialog and non-zingers does amount to the lowest possible form of acting, but it's such a waste of assembled talent for this movie, although only Galifianakis gives his character some nuance.This series so proudly wears its gross-out comedy status on its sleeve. While the first installment had some genuine laughs, the second entry had few and was a major disappointment, even with its pot-smoking, penis-nibbling monkey. This third (and supposedly) final chapter is laugh-less and lifeless. What happened in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas, or never have even begun. The Hangover Part III is truly awful.

I hope it doesn't mean there is another sequel in the future. Count me out.",,Anonymous,Crime
Game (Hang)over,"I found the first 'Hangover' film funny, but somewhat overrated. The sequel I found less funny, but conversely underrated.

On the plus side, at least it's not a re-hash. On the down side, the mystery aspect was the best part of the first two films.The cast all seem fairly bored here. Cooper, who has become a legitimate movie star in the interim, seems downright embarrassed.

Half-Full Circle,"Events of the past two parts of the franchise come around to a close in what is (hopefully) the final movie of ""The Hangover"" series, when misfit criminal Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) escapes Bangkok prison (with a reference to ""Shawshank Redemption"") bringing a dramatic blow-back from events past. After the death of his father Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is to be sent to an intervention camp to deal with his latent adulthood issues (worsening after being 6 months off of medication). Accompanied by Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), the Wolf Pack is out for one last ride. Unfortunately for them drug-lord Marshall (John Goodman) holds them personally responsible for the misgivings of Mr. Chow, who several years ago in Vegas stole 20-odd million worth of gold from him. Marshall takes Doug hostage and tasks the remaining threesome with recovering the gold. Or else...Thankfully the screenwriters decided to ditch the concept of retreading worn down paths of the original story (as was the key issue with the Bangkok excursion), instead tying together the knots of previous parts to deliver a new take on the matter. Unfortunately however the comedy is totally lost on the way and save for a few forced laughs, this is the most unfunny and laboured effort of a sequel I can remember. Most of the cast just seem feed up with the characters, playing them to minimal effect, only Jeong and Galifikalis milking it out the best they can. Cooper especially seems to have moved on and sleepwalks through the movements of a story lacking invention and punchlines. At times a couple of ideas and jokes manage to work, but overall it lacks freshness and even Bangkok outdoes it in terms of humour. Which unfortunately speaks volume as to how poor this final part of the series is. Hopefully this means good riddance for further follow-ups, as evidently the joke has run its term.Funnily enough the only truly spot-on part of the movie comes with the end credits, when a wedding ends in another bout of debauchery and memory loss with some hysterical consequences.

The Hangover Part III feels like pretending to be drunk at a funeral.,"In an attempt to modify the formula that made its predecessors all so popular, this third chapter shifts drastically in tone. The crazy drunken shenanigans have been replaced with beheading a giraffe, suffocating a chicken, snapping the necks of dogs and witnessing a heartless murder. Blatant animal cruelty aside, this ""comedy"" lacked laughs and general entertainment, thus resulting in a boring conclusion to a mildly humorous trilogy. ""The Wolfpack"" are forced to find Mr. Chow who has escaped from prison in Bangkok ('Shawshank Redemption' style) and stolen a vast amount of gold from a criminal kingpin. Understandably, director Phillips and his crew altered the direction that this film would take in order to prevent a carbon copy of the original (much like its sequel was). However, in doing so he has removed the essence of mild hilarity that made its predecessors so watchable. There is no hangover, there are no regrettable decisions and there are no laughs to be had. The consistency in characters remains adequate, with the narrative focusing on Alan in an attempt to further develop the character who was (emphasis on ""was"") the funniest of the bunch. Cooper looked like he couldn't be bothered and Helms, as I've said in my previous reviews, still remains irritatingly dull. Aside from Goodman who was strangely captivating, the lack of new characters makes this crime caper even more monotonous. And no, including McCarthy did not help. Yet again, the inclusion of Chow felt forced just to provide a few laughs that were had in the original. The pacing was decent though, the story moves along at a brisk pace visiting locations of new and old. But overall, this third chapter lacks the humour from the previous two and, to an extent, is so purposefully changed that it loses itself. Atleast it concludes satisfyingly, so hopefully there will not be another sequel. Yet much like the stench of any alcoholic beverage, I'm sure it will come back...",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

An okay sendoff,"The first Hangover is truly outstanding-intelligent, engaging, and hilarious. The chemistry between the cast is incredible, and Mr. Chow serves as a fantastic side character/antagonist. Since the release of The Hangover, the four main actors have all become household names: Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became well-known for his role as Andy in The Office, Zach Galifianakis has continued to build his comedic career doing beetween two ferns, and Ken Jeong was good in Community. It's clear that The Hangover was a major turning point in their careers, leaving audiences eager for more. Naturally, the studio wanted to bring the Wolf Pack back together. However, they failed in evrey aspect, just making the same movie all over again. So they attempted it again, sending the group on yet another adventure-this time to Arizona and back to Las Vegas. There isn't much to say about the plot that isn't predictable, but it's a fine watch.In my opinion, The Hangover Part III is funnier than Part II, largely because the jokes feel more original and effective. I liked the chemistry between Melissa McCarthy and Zach Galifianakis, and some of the nostalgic references to the first film worked quite well, though others did not.The strongest comedic moments came from the supporting characters, as the main trio seemed off. Bradley Cooper just felt off, while Zach and Ed at least made an effort.What made the original Hangover so memorable was the dynamic between the three lead characters. If the first film is Coke, the second is Pepsi, and the third is Dr. Pepper-trying be something fresh but ultimately missing the mark.In my view, this trilogy should never have existed. The first movie was perfect on its own, and there was no need to continue the story.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Part III leaves aside a good part of the comic tone and structure of the previous films, ending the trilogy in a anticlimatic way","After the second part has practically repeated the story of the first, this third brings what had been expected previously, changing the structure while trying to end the trilogy by connecting elements from the previous films. Despite having a good time, it ends up being the worst of Todd Philips's trilogy. In view of the criticisms received that the sequence was nothing more than the repetition of the first in another location - Las Vegas leaves, Thailand enters -, director Todd Phillips decided to radicalize. The Hangover! Part III leaves aside a good part of the comic tone of the previous films, which bordered on the absurd and abused the politically incorrect, to tell a story that has the function of moving forward in the trajectory of the characters. Or rather, two of them: Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Chow (Ken Jeong), who basically move everything that happens in this new sequel.The Hangover- Part III begins as the third part of a franchise should begin, the second chapter of which has been severely criticized even by a large part of its audience. Its first minutes are epic and involve a rebellion in a Bangkok prison and a major accident on a road that ends in death. And what is better: all this is done with the black humor that caught the attention of the audience in the first film, a big surprise in the middle of 2009, when it made almost 500 million dollars around the planet at a cost of 35 million. The best jokes and situations are in this first act, which end in an ""intervention"", those meetings of family and friends in which the group decides to give the loved one, so that he wakes up for life. In this case, people want Alan (Zack Galifianakis) to go to a clinic to start taking his medications and improve his behavior. It is up to the wolf pack to take him for a third lap of the car, which ends again with the kidnapping of Doug.What happens next is closer to a heist movie than the puzzle comedy from previous adventures. From the middle of a road in the interior of the United States, the group goes to Tijuana, bordering Mexico, to meet Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and from there to Las Vegas, where the cycle of parties and troubles must end. Even Heather Graham returns as the prostitute Jade and her son Carlos in a quick scene, but which serves to show (or question) Alan's maturity, the great motivation of this film.The presence of the villain in the story comes from a good view of the writers, enjoying a dialogue without much relevance from the first film in the series. Then begins the great duel of the third film, which puts on the one side the flock of wolves formed by Alan, Phil and Stu and on the other the Chow himself. If in the previous films Ken Jeong's character has always emphasized the bizarre side, whether because of his behavior or his politically incorrect profile, here he is remembered for what he really is: a dangerous and threatening person. This is the first big surprise in the film, as there are several sequences that explore the tension arising from the simple presence of Chow. Of course, his striking features have not been forgotten - the character's typical laugh is there - and he even makes people laugh at certain times, but his participation in the story has a much heavier tone than usual.The story as a whole is heavier, much more dramatic than in the other films in the series. Not only because of the new threat, much more serious than a blackout suffered after a night of drinking and drugs, but also due to the presence of violence. In addition to a previously unheard of Chow, the film has a serious tone due to Alan's maturing process, which takes place throughout the entire plot, and also the inevitable tension arising from the threats from Marshall and, of course, Chow. In other words, the film even has comedic moments, but it also has a dramatic and suspenseful side that surprises not exactly for what happens, but for its presence in a series whose politically incorrect humor has always been its trademark.If You Drink Don't Marry! Part III is well connected with what was shown previously in the first two films. Old characters reappear (the prostitute experienced by Heather Graham, this time in a much more behaved model, and her son, the baby with dark glasses, both in light participation), Chow needs to escape from prison in Thailand (where he was left in If You Drink No Part II, 2011) and Las Vegas is once again the scene of the biggest messes committed by the 'wolf pack'. However, it is much more of an adventure film, with some (few) funny moments, than an electrifying comedy full of surprises, which is what everyone expects.Phillips, who in addition to signing the script also commands the direction of the entire trilogy, places the plot and the new characters well, but the option for a less chaotic development of the plot in relation to the other films undermines the comic content in this one, which instead to support himself throughout the narrative, he has only good casual moments. This is also due to the fact that a large part of the gags is based on references to previous features, depending necessarily on their knowledge so that they are understood - and even then, they are not always effective. In the first two films, the development of the plot was based on events that had already occurred, with the characters retracing their steps from the previous night to discover what had happened and how they could get out of the situation in which they found themselves. In this, the story is totally open, with the characters having to deal with problems that are presented to them, making us think that the weak rhythm of the work is a reflection of the difficulty of the writers in adapting this type of narrative to this specific series.Despite the effort, Phillips again runs into the same mistake of the uninteresting continuation. In the first film, the transgressions committed by the protagonist trio were just one step beyond reality, generating a real identification with the audience (mainly male) with absurd events, but likely to happen after a night of intense drinking. In order to extrapolate this limit, the director raises such confusions to a level of increasing violence in his continuations, which, of course, does not mean to make them necessarily funnier. Philips demonstrated to connect one gag after another, transforming them into the plot itself, in the original film, not seen here. In addition to being sporadic, the jokes are all so loose that they look more like broken pieces than something previously thought, with the purpose of taking them somewhere. And it is even more frustrating to realize that, in this feature film, absolutely nothing leads anywhere. The very short-term mission stipulated in the premise is dragging in an incomprehensibly slow and urgent manner. When, finally, the search for the pack of wolves guides them on an expected return to Las Vegas, taking them against the crazy Mr. Chow in an explosive combination of break-in party, prostitutes, call boys (just announced, never seen) and a lot of drink, the sequence is abruptly interrupted, ending like every action scene in generic comedies.Philips management also fails to establish the seriousness of the situation in which the trio of protagonists finds themselves. Even with one of his best friends at serious risk of death, Phil, Stu and Allan convey a level of concern that seems to know that everything will work out in the end, which is totally inconsistent in the film's diegesis. Although the script favors scenes with Galifianakis - trying to take advantage of the actor's humorous competence even when there is nothing to make fun of - Jeong stands out most, stealing the spotlight in Chow's shoes, who gains greater importance in this third part, with the plot spinning around it. Unfortunately, the good cast does not disguise the failures of Phillips and Mazin, who, while showing creativity in the elaboration of interesting and potentially memorable situations, fail to develop them satisfactorily, forcing the public to just wait for more exciting moments that never arrive.It is curious to see that Phil, the heartthrob experienced by Bradley Cooper - in his first role after the Oscar nomination for The Good Side of Life (2012) - is attractive and obviously the leader of the group, but the most without function, practically nonexistent away from others: for him there is no romantic involvement, there is no imminent danger, nothing to gain or lose. It is difficult to connect with him, therefore. And Stu (Ed Helms) remains responsible for the most unexpected revelations (the sequence during the final credits is to shock anyone). Other additions, however, that should contribute to comic relief, such as the participation of Melissa McCarthy and Goodman himself, end up being wasted in contexts without much interest.Like any self-respecting trilogy ending, ""The Hangover! Part III"" rescues several elements of the first film The problem is that the insertion of these elements is done in a forced way, sounding more like a film in homage to the franchise. Frustration is noticeable at the end of the projection. There are funny moments, others very busy, but nothing memorable or absurd as seen before in the series. Despite being quite different from the other films in the series, this final part of the series is not bad. On the contrary, it draws attention precisely because of the boldness and the focus on the different. However, it should be noted that the film is far from provoking laughter as in previous episodes and that, in this new proposal, the characters of Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms were reduced to supporting actors of Alan and Chow, without anything really relevant happening to them. Highlight for the soundtrack, with several successes reflecting the mood of the characters, and the self-referential side to the series.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

"3rd time is not the charm, but is not terrible either.","I watched all 3 Hangover movies in one afternoon and evening. Pretty entertaining. The 1st 2 used the same template. Vey funny. The 3d could not do that again quite the same way, so apparently lots of unhappy viewers of the 3d. But I liked that it drew on all sorts of previous bits to create a story that ties up loose ends that we didn't even know were loose. The 1st one took us to Las Vegas, the second to Bangkok, and the last one to Tijuana and full circle back to Las Vegas. Halfway through this last one, Melissa McCarthy is a treat as a possible love interest for Zach's character. Watch for Helms gagging, after which Cooper appears to be breaking, and they left it in. John Goodman is always a pleasure to watch, though in this case not enough, like McCarthy. They are just tantalizing. And though some (most?) found Ken Jeong too prevalent in the storyline, I enjoyed him. During the credits, the 1st two movies run some photos that depict what gang did during their alcohol blackouts that set up the storylines, but the 3d has a scene not photos that carries on a gag of which Helms has been the butt in all 3 movies.

Weakest in the franchise. 5/10,"Review: I know that a lot of people wouldn't agree with me, but I thought that this was the worst one in the franchise. I missed the wacky jokes and the mad situations that the 4 of them found themselves in. The first one was the best one for me but this movie lacked the shock value. The Chinaman got on my nerves a bit and the storyline wasn't as outrageous as the others. That's not to say that this is a bad movie. It's good to see the 4 of them back together again and as this is the last of the series, it will be good to watch them all together. The ending was hilarious, which was what I was hoping to see in the rest of the movie, but I'm glad that the director left it open for a, maybe, fourth one. Watchable!Round-Up: There isn't that much to say about the performances because they have all been the same in all 3 movies, There isn't the usual pictures to look through about there mad night, which was one of the really funny bits in the other 2 movies.

The Wolf Pack as been lead astray.,"Remember when The Hangover was released in 2009 and it became the most popular comedy in a long time, being one of the most quoted movie until...well even today. Then Part II was announced, and while it didn't touch the gold that was the first, it managed to piece together enough laughs to be a half decent and worthy sequel. Now Part III. And all I have to say is, as a Hangover movie, this was a complete and total disappointment.The Hangover is arguably one of the best comedies of the modern age. It was a movie full of gut-busting laughs, and some of the most famous quotes in recent time for a comedy. It was stellar to say the least. All of those laughs, iconic moments, everything, minus a couple parts, is all missing from this not funny comedy. It's almost as simple as that, The Hangover Part III was barely funny, and in the eyes of its predecessors, failed miserably. A few scenes in the very beginning, a return to Cesar's Palace and the very very end are all that got a laugh from me. This movie tries to be an action comedy, and maybe if you view it as its own action comedy, without the Hangover name on it, it wouldn't be half bad. But as a Hangover movie, it did not work one single bit. More bullets than laughs in this movie, literally.The once hilarious and unpredictably crazy cast has gone almost completely stale. In the first and even second films, Zach Galifianakis's portrayal of the socially and mentally strange Alan Garner was just hilarious and so lovable. That magic that the character once had has gone almost completely away. Nearly all of the things that Alan delivers in this movie are just boring and not funny. I was sitting there waiting for something to follow what he said and then nothing. It was really disappointing to see a once beloved character go stale. The rest of the Wolf Pack, Phil and Stu, played by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms respectively (I don't even include Doug anymore), also have lost their touch. As much as I love Bradley Cooper, you could tell at times that his heart wasn't there anymore and that he wasn't giving his best efforts. Ed Helms is probably the best of the gang, but even so, not the same as the first or second parts. Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) has become the center of attention and the movie's plot, and while he has his funny and insane moments, his magic seemed to have lost it's touch as well. A funny movie can't be funny without great acting or a great script.I had hopes that the Wolf Pack could return to their former glory with a new and fresh story, and a sort of clean slate from the decent Part II, but what I discovered was that this Wolf Pack has been separated from what it once was. Little to zero laugh out loud moments, more of an action than a comedy, a cast that's lost it's touch, and an overall poor script all spelled doom for this movie and the series. At the very least, stick around for a mid-credits scene that was possibly the best in the movie. The Hangover Part III (which doesn't even have a hangover in it by the way) is a massive let down as the cherry on top to what could've been a terrific trilogy.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Most Underrated Sequel,"Although it is very different from the first two, and has a much different feel, The Hangover Part III is a very amusing, entertaining, and nostalgic journey through the franchise- that has plenty of moments throughout to keep you engaged. Many criticize this film for many reasons. A main reason is the obvious one, that being the film doesn't necessarily revolve around a new hangover itself. However, having seen the second one and not being too impressed by any means, it's refreshing to see a different take on the world of this franchise, and to see the darker side of the characters involved. I enjoyed the cast in this one, but Bradley Cooper can at times feel like he isn't too keen on being in the film. He isn't horrible by any means, I don't think Cooper is capable of that feat, but I did feel like he phoned it in a bit. Ed Helms does a decent job, as well as the returning Ken Jeong, and Zach Galifianakis gives some of his best moments of the whole franchise. John Goodman and Melissa McCarthy find themselves some roles in this flick, and I enjoyed both of their performances quite thoroughly, as different as both of their roles are. There are plenty of hilarious moments throughout the film, and though some jokes don't work as well as they hope to achieve, for the most part, they are more hit than miss. I enjoyed the look of this film, as well as the soundtrack surprisingly. Todd Phillips seems to have had a vision for this film and franchise which I both appreciate and enjoy. I believe this film is criminally underrated, it's not great by any means, but it is by far the best sequel of the franchise, and one of the better comedy sequels I have seen in a while.

An unpleasant 100 minutes,"Some film-makers form a trilogy to tell a tale, finding it a unique way to fashion a story and give the beginning, middle and end enough time and breathing space to flesh out on their own, forming stand- alone pieces that work just as well on their own in the process. Others, like The Hangover helmer Todd Phillips, use it to squeeze every drop of money out of a proved formula and fool an audience into thinking that, given the success of a previous instalment, they're in for a guaranteed good time. Only The Hangover Part II was terrible, and Part III is even worse, to the point where the franchise is barely recognisable from the hilarious and charming surprise it was back in 2009.Ditching the formula that saw our three bumbling heroes wake up from a particularly heavy night in a variety of terrible states to find that one of their part is missing and no memory of what went down, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are instead roped into a plot involving an escaped-from-prison Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and the gangster looking for him, Marshall (John Goodman). But also ditched is any sense of humour or even any actual jokes, and in its place comes cruelty and distastefulness. Opening with Alan towing a giraffe home on the back of a trailer, events take an expected unfunny turn as the animal is decapitated and Alan is convinced that he needs help. It's on their way to rehab that they find themselves confronted by Marshall and Black Doug (Mike Epps), the latter returning from the first film.Conveniently brushing Doug (Justin Bartha) out of the way again as Marshall holds him captive so the threesome can try and generate some laughs, The Hangover Part III becomes a pedestrian bore; a series of set-pieces that quickly run out of steam. In an attempt to make up for the clear lack of inspiration, Chow's role has been beefed up even more, but Jeong's hyperactive and excruciatingly annoying shtick gets old very quickly. A scene near the end sees Chow parachuting through Las Vegas screaming obscenities, and I was left scratching my head at just how the sleeper-hit of 2009 ended up at this point. When there's a rare chuckle to be had, it comes from Galifianakis and franchise-newcomer Melissa McCarthy, who at least manage to lend a little heart to what is quite frankly an unpleasant 100 minutes.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unfunny second sequel brings its trilogy to a disappointing conclusion,"In 2009, we were introduced to the wolf pack: Phil, Alan, Stu, and Doug, along with Mr. Chow, who brought the insane hilarity and laughs on the silver screen when they woke up in Las Vegas with no memory of what happened the previous night and their soon-to-be- married friend Doug missing. Two years later, the wolf pack dealt with the same hilarious scheme, only to wake up in Bangkok with the younger brother of Stu's fiancée missing. Apparently, the critical failure of the second film didn't give a clear signal to director Todd Phillips for the series's retirement, and the result is a third film of the franchise that fails to bring the fun and laughter that made the first two films enjoyable.Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha), and Alan (Zach Galifianackis) are back once again with the film opening up Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) escaping from prison in Thailand, while evading a violent prison riot and guards who are after him. Meanwhile, Alan purchases a giraffe and decides to take it home on a trailer. However, when the giraffe's tall figure is too high for a highway overpass, the giraffe ends up decapitated and causes a major highway pileup. Soon, his family and his friends Phil, Stu, and Doug become increasingly worried about his mental wealth and proposed to take him to a mental institute called New Horizon. The plan quickly becomes thwarted when they are attacked and kidnapped by mobsters lead by crime boss Marshal (played by John Goodman) who assigns Phil, Alan, and Stu go after Mr. Chow who is in possession of half of his money, and capture him. With the three guys on the search for Chow, Doug is held hostage by Marshal and his henchman.This movie takes the characters to Tijuana and later, back to Vegas where the first film was set. Unlike the first two film, this one goes a whole another direction. Instead of the characters going out for a bachelor party for one of them who is getting married, and waking up with absolutely no memory of the previous night, this film has the characters going on a road trip to capture Mr. Chow who has become an international criminal. So basically, this acts more as a spy thriller than a hardcore comedy, and the results are a lack of laughter and humor to satisfy. The characters are not funny this time around, Mr. Chow isn't even funny anymore. While he manages to choke out a few humorous lines, his character seems warn out from laughter. Alan isn't even funny here either. The film tries to make him funny by simply making more dumb and more absent-minded than ever, but it fails to bring the laughs out. Furthermore, this film doesn't seem to try to be funny. There are many scenes that rather dark, including characters getting shot and killed, and Mr. Chow ends being more sinister than funny as he manages to kill a few animals in some scenes. The plot itself pretty much takes away all the hilarity and deprives the characters from their humor. This film may sound better than the second film for taking another direction, but sadly, it only ends up worse.The Hangover Part 3 is one of the most disappointing second sequels I have seen.

Like a Zany Breaking Bad,"I enjoyed this film, despite the scenes simulating animal cruelty (which were mercifully brief). Ken Jeong gets more airtime here and that's a good thing, because he's hilarious. This movie has nothing to do with a literal hangover and is more like Breaking Bad meets the Marx Brothers. It's good fun with star turns by the likes of Melissa McCarthy and John Goodman. Lots of exciting stunts, and an especially scary one on the roof of Caesar's Palace in Vegas. If you liked the other Hangover films then you'll enjoy this one, too, even if it's a tad darker in tone. A quality production by the same team that brought you ""Joker.""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wolf Pack never Showed up,"When the closing credits hit, I felt cheated and sad. The magic that surrounded the first 2 films was non existent and the closure given to the series was deflating.Relying on Allen's immaturity and continual involvement with Chow, The Hangover Part 3 left out the fun and over focused itself on transforming Allen into a real man. From staging an intervention at the start, to ending the series with his wedding, Part 3 left creativity at the door.Chow Breaks free from prison, and a villain from season 1 emerges to kidnap the Wolfpack with the hopes of leading them to Chow. With the Kidnapping of Doug, the remaining 3 must journey from Tijuana, Mx back to Vegas to capture Chow and save their friend.Departing from Part 1 and 2's amnesia adventures, Part 3 was spoon fed to the viewer. The mystery was simply missing. Chow himself plays a more central role and the movie is dependent on every action he takes. This intimate view of Chow spoils the character's idiosyncrasies, and lowers his value along with the entire movie. Any bond or trust between the wolfpack at this point has been sadly broken at the expense of having a plot for Part 3. When Chow escapes death to kill Marshall, the movie quickly ends without a party or a tribute to what the series, for the most part, represented.With all the post credit pictures, Mike Tyson special appearances and wildness that the first two films embodied, watching part 3 felt like a never ending Hangover. The writing on the wall is clear. There will not be a Part 4.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worst jokes of the year,"OMG!!! What a disappointment.!!!! The last installment from the Hangover Franchise is one of the biggest disappointment of the year. The comedy is really boring. The movie lacks the plot and the screenplay is really embarrassing. I didn't expect this kind of treat from Todd Philips (Hangover & Due Date were excellent, Hangover 2 was OK). But this was terrible. Zach's comedy was also irritating and nothing new in this movie. And in fact, the one of the worst movie of the year..

Borefest!,"Hangover 3 was the worst sequel to be released this summer. Singularly unfunny, unbearably scripted, and unfeelingly acted, thank god the trilogy ended. I do not even see the reason for this being a Hangover film, considering that none of the characters actually have a single drink, forget about a hangover.Ah, but Todd Philips was seeking closure after all. So we have one last adventure of the Wolf pack, up against their nemesis Chow, Alan finally growing up and only because he finds his lady love. While the headless giraffe at the start pointed to a truly wacky finale, the ride went downhill all throughout. Less of a raunchy comedy and more like a run of the mill action thriller, this is a movie that leads its loyal fans to an endless journey into nothingness. Bradley Cooper sleepwalked through the movie, Zack Galifianikis and Ed Helms put slightly more effort, John Goodman seems to be itching to disappear from every scene he is in, while Ken Jeong is the usual party popper that he is in every movie he acts.There is nothing to even sum up for The Hangover 3, except to say that I am terribly disappointed, and that itself is an understatement- 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A tad more heart than before, yet easily forgotten","When it's time to end the ""Hangover"" trilogy, the formula of the two first films are changed somewhat. At least superficially. ""Part III"" drops the eponymous concept of its leads waking up with a blackout in favor of a generic crime plot. As far as the execution goes, ""Part III"" is still as formulaic as its predecessors. While a bit less raunchy that the second part of the trilogy, ""Part III"" delivers laughs, mainly from genius deadpan surrealist comic Zach Galifianakis, however they are still far fewer than in the first film, as are the surprises. A welcoming addition is director Todd Phillips' attempts at some character development, at least for the part of Galifianakis' Alan. After all, when the trilogy ends, that's the only character that will be remembered.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hilarious movie! The best of the Hangover trilogy.,"The Hangover Part III continues with the misadventures of the Wolfpack consisting of, Phil(Bradley Cooper), Stu(Ed Helms) & Alan(Zach Galifianakis). After Alan's father passes away, Phil, Stu & Doug(Justin Bartha) decide to take Alan to a rehabilitation center to address his mental instability. However, in true 'Hangover' fashion things go awry & they are chased down by an angry gangster named Marshall(John Goodman). He tells them that Mr. Chow(Ken Jeong), stole 21 million dollars worth of gold from him & that the Wolfpack has to find him. Marshall takes Doug as insurance to ensure that the Wolfpack brings him Chow.I would like to start by saying, what's with all the bad reviews? This was an extremely funny & entertaining movie. It's not supposed to be a masterpiece or a classic. It's just a fun time pass flick & I think people should watch it that way. People who didn't like it, should get a sense of humor. I liked the fact that this time around, the makers didn't follow the same formula of the guys getting hungover, one of them's missing & they frantically search for him. In fact, in this movie the Wolfpack's not even hungover! As usual, the highlight of the film was Alan. Zach Galifianakis does an outstanding job in portraying him. Bradley Cooper is brilliant as Phil. Ed Helms is great as Stu. Justin Bartha is spectacular as Doug. Ken Jeong is hysterical as Mr. Chow. Chow was also given more importance in this film. John Goodman is impressive as Marshall. Melissa McCarthy is hilarious as Cassie. Heather Graham is effective as Jade. Mike Epps is effective as Black Doug. Sasha Baresse, Jamie Chung, Gillian Vigman & Sondra Currie are effective as Tracy, Lauren, Stephanie & Linda respectively. Last but not the least, Jeffrey Tambor was great in his cameo, as Sid. The Hangover Part III is the funniest movie of the year so far. Stick around for the post credits scene, which may very well be the funniest scene in the film!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A courageous attempt at the send off this trilogy doesn't quite deserve,"For the record, The Hangover is, in my book, one of the greatest comedies of the 21st century. No one has quite mastered the comedic twist of the whodunnit as well as Todd Phillips did in the original smash. I also did not find Part II to be a disappointment - lots of genuinely funny moments (especially from Stu) even if it was sad to see the writers cling for dear life to their proved formula.Part III should be commended for trying something totally new, and really messing with the formula to try and take this from comedic whodunnit to an edge of your seat, stake-fest. The problem - while striving to be original, they completely forgot about the comedy. So many scenes in this film were just threatening or horrific without any laughs peppered in there - guns in faces, hostages, phone calls. It was more focused on raising the stakes for the Wolfpack then it was making us laugh. This issue was epitomised with John Goodman's ""Marshall"" character - were they even attempting to make this guy a funny villain? If so, no dice...Marshall could have come straight out of a B-grade mob movie without changing any of his tics or dialogue. Sure, it's cool that this was a dangerous situation but it is still a comedy. Gives us a more simple plot for more laughs.The other major problem was the rudderless arcs of the trilogy's main comic nuclei - Alan and Chow. It was as if the writers sat down and said, ""Hey, people love those guys, let's turn them up to 11,"" without actually considering that what made these two funny was that they were somewhat believable - an, albeit exaggerated, version of the outcast or loony in your own social circles. By taking Alan from a spacey goofball to an aggressive and unhinged mental case made it unbelievable that Phil and Stu would still want anything to do with him. Chow was a hilarious supporting act - as the centre of the film, his profanity got tired fast.This movie also gave itself a glowing pat on the back that it hasn't exactly earned - the constant self-referential gags, throwbacks and winks sort of made it feel like they were disproportionately elevating the status of the first two films. The post credits sequence is the worst example - a victory lap would've been acceptable if all three movies were comic gold. Sadly, only one of them was so filming the Alan-Chow goodbye as if it were a Michael-Fredo kiss and going for a Deathly Hallows-esque ""everything connects, this is the epic conclusion"" plot really just felt a little congratulatory.Massive points here for taking some tonal risks (which work best with Chow singing 'Hurt' or Alan's reunion with Carlos) but overall they changed a formula without considering why it had become a formula in the first place - it worked.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why?,"When the studio wants to beat a dead horse they sure do kick the hell out of it. The third installment of the Hangover franchise has audiences asking, ""Why?"" ""What's the point?"" and ""Did this really need to be a trilogy?"" The first Hangover film I thought was great. I thought gold was struck with that concept and those actors. Then The Hangover Part II came out to prove that the first film had been a stroke of luck that couldn't be repeated well in the slightest. And then we come to the raging pointless stupidity that is The Hangover Part III.Part three of this milked to death franchise begins with a scene that sets the absurd slapstick pace of the movie. We meet up with Zach Galifianakis' character, Alan, who has just bought a giraffe, accidentally knocks its block off with a freeway overpass, which in turn leads to Alan's father's fatal heart attack. Jeffrey Tambor ditched the party before things got completely stupid. It's then decided that Alan needs to go to rehab, and it's the wolf pack's job to get him there. So the gang gets together, but are stopped short by gangsters looking for Mr. Chow, the loud and obnoxious Korean dude from the first two films, played by Ken Jeong who I normally really like, but it just got old here. From this point a whole chain of events are set in motion and the typical Hangover shenanigans begin as the film constantly tries to, just as part two did, one up its predecessor.There really is no point to The Hangover Part III and it's not good for much more than a few laughs. But honestly, what more can you really ask for. My expectations for this film were set dreadfully low, and I think that helped me to not hate this film, but instead just shrug my shoulders and say ""sure, why not.""Don't expect any great laughs though, expect more in the chuckle range. This movie isn't really all that funny, and most of the time it's trying way too hard. The wolf pack lost their natural charisma and charm from the first film, and now it just feels like actors being forced through three increasingly dumb movies. The comedy is no longer genuine, its all full of scripted and forced laughter. The Hangover Part III wants to be fun, it wants to be wacky, and it wants to take you on a ride. The problem is it's too obvious on where it wants to take you, and I just can't get into it. It's silly and mindless entertainment, but I can't deny that by the end I found myself asking, ""Why did I watch that?""",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fantastic Finale,","The Hangover Part Three is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly thrilling storyline that is a lot more serious and dark than the previous installments.It definitely wasn't as good as the first,but I thought it was a huge improvement from the second,mainly because it didn't follow the same formula as the previous two,I don't understand why the movie got negative reviews,I was very pleased and thought it was a brilliant farewell to these characters I've loved since 2009,they wrapped up a lot of loose ends and I really loved that.The cast are as good as ever,and I think the best performance goes to John Goodman,his character was scary and very intimidating,an almost Oscar worthy performance.Fans of the previous two Hangover's will definitely be happy with this final farewell,but if your like me,your gonna wish there was more,id be happy with another three movies,thats how much I love these characters.When Doug is kidnapped by a man who Leslie Chow stole gold from,Phil,Stu and Alan must find Chow in order to save Doug's life.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Revisits Las Vegas but can't recapture the magic,"The good news is that Todd Phillips and co. figured out the mistakes they made with Part II. The bad news is that they didn't figure out how to fix them. Instead of just repeating the identical plot in a new location, the guys are back in Las Vegas with a plot involving fall-out from their previous actions. That's the good part. The bad part is that it's actually kind of boring and the jokes have become pretty tiring.Doug, Phil and Stu are delivering Alan to rehab (finally a place where he belongs). However, along the way they get hijacked. Marshall (John Goodman) and his team of thugs including Black Doug kidnap our Doug because the Wolf Pack needs to track down Mr. Chow and his stolen loot. So off we go to Mexico and back to Las Vegas on a ridiculous trail of crime.Just like Part II, everything is bigger and bolder, and it loses even more of the wit and creativity that we had with the original. There's also way more Chow. If you think Alan and Chow are funny in small doses, imagine how unfunny they become in large doses. The insolent and rude humour usually surrounding Alan that was introduced in the sequel is still very much present. The first off-colour joke that we saw in the trailer, really was just as it was portrayed in the trailer. Alan beheads a giraffe and that is supposed to be hilarious. Nobody laughed.Luckily Phil and Stu are always alongside the troubled man-child. Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper have quickly proved that they're the stars of this franchise. They're able to add a likable factor to the disastrous Wolf Pack that we're cheering for their success even though it's about time that we all part ways. Phil is no longer just the arrogant asshole who wants all women and everything else in the world to go his way. He has settled down and he does his best to settle the rocky relationships and situations around him.The beginning of the film takes them to Mexico in an attempt to befriend and then betray Chow. But that part moves surprisingly slow with our only two likable heroes not providing any of the comedy. When they follow Chow to Los Angeles, things do pick up. Alan meets a woman (his soul mate) and Phil and Stu use their smarts and charm to relive the glory days of The Hangover.This third story really didn't need to be told and we're left hoping that the Wolf Pack and their arch nemeses will learn to just let sleeping dogs lie.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
I'm so glad it is over...,"The first part of The Hangover will always remain as a surprise hit, and one of the favorites. Thats that. After that it was total downhill. The second part was pretty much similar to the first part, except that it contained less humor and more violence. We eventually forgot it,since we were still hungover with the first part. Then came the third part. No one asked for trilogy on the saga of wolf pack, still it can as an asteroid above our head, and by mistake I happened to see it.Initially I thought they had studied their lesson and they are changing their tracks. This time they hadn't any bachelor party and no more roophies to get hungover. Still, one of them had to be vanished. This time it was a hostage situation, and this time too, it was Doug. I must say that I had a few laughs because they reminded me about the first part here and there, with the visit to Jade and Carlos, but soon, it became intolerable. A useless heist plot and Chow as a villain, and above all, a climax which made no sense at all.Briefly, if you haven't seen the second part but the first part, be happy with it. You are on a safe zone and further journey will be really bumpy. If you have seen the second part, just give it a try, because it is as bad as it's predecessor.

A Departure from Formula with Mixed Results,"""The Hangover Part III,"" directed by Todd Phillips, marks the third and final installment in the ""Hangover"" trilogy. While it attempts to break away from the formula of the previous films, the result is a mixed bag that lacks the comedic freshness of the original and the cohesion of a compelling narrative.Unlike its predecessors, ""The Hangover Part III"" does not center around a bachelor party or a forgotten night of debauchery. Instead, it follows the ""Wolfpack"" - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis), and Doug (Justin Bartha) - as they become entangled in a plot involving a heist, a crime boss, and the return of the eccentric Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). This shift in narrative focus is a bold move but one that doesn't fully pay off.The performances of the lead actors remain strong. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms continue to bring their characters to life with their established chemistry, and Zach Galifianakis' portrayal of Alan provides some humorous moments, though his character's antics feel less impactful in this third outing. Ken Jeong's Mr. Chow takes on a more central role, and while Jeong's performance is as committed as ever, the character's increased screen time does not always translate into increased laughs.One of the main issues with ""The Hangover Part III"" is its tone. The film veers into darker territory, with more emphasis on action and drama than on the comedy that defined the series. This tonal shift leads to uneven pacing and a sense of uncertainty about what the film is trying to be. While there are attempts at humor, they often feel forced or fall flat, lacking the natural comedic rhythm of the original.The plot itself is more convoluted compared to the straightforward narratives of the first two films. The absence of the mystery element that propelled the previous movies results in a lack of urgency and engagement in the story. The film tries to tie up loose ends and provide closure to the series, but in doing so, it loses much of the charm and humor that made the franchise popular.Visually, the film is well-produced, with solid cinematography and production design. However, these technical aspects are not enough to elevate the overall experience. The soundtrack, while fitting, also does not stand out particularly.In conclusion, ""The Hangover Part III"" is a departure from the formula that brought success to the series, but it is a departure that doesn't fully succeed. The film struggles to find a balance between its darker elements and the comedic roots of the franchise. While it has moments that capture the spirit of the earlier films, they are too few to make this a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. It earns a 5 out of 10, being a passable but ultimately unsatisfying end to the ""Hangover"" saga.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Face value,"It seems to me that Todd Phillips is primarily interested in character- driven stories. Comedy is a part of that, because some of his characters are tragic/pathetic/helpless, which very often can be funny.But that also means that the characters to some extent decide where the story goes. As it happens, this particular story turned out to not be a comedy. Considering what kind of person Chow really is, that isn't so surprising. Lets face it, he is a full-blown psychopath. He may seem funny at first, he did so in Part I, and to a lesser degree in Part II, but in Part III we get a really close look. He isn't funny. He is actually damn scary.A lot of people, judging from the user reviews, were expecting a comedy. And since Hangover Part 3 isn't all that funny, they gave it 1's and 2's. I mean, seriously? A rating of 1 means that there was absolutely no skill involved in making the movie. And that simply isn't true in this case. It's a very well made movie: it's well written, well directed, well played, and well timed. It just isn't a comedy. It's a STORY. It's a gritty and realistic portrayal of some pretty messed up people, in some pretty bad situations.I enjoyed the movie a lot. I got no promise from Todd Phillips that I would get a comedy. It's right there, on the poster, for all to see: 3 grim men, dressed in black, in a black environment. That's a poster that says: THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!In fact, one could argue that Part I and II set the stage for Part III to really have an effect on the audience. It certainly had an effect on me, i won't be forgetting it anytime soon. It's an eye-opener, that's for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Movie review by Divyam Saran,"The third and final part of the trilogy revolves around Alan, who after the untimely demise of his father decides to change his ways and start living with some new standards to renovate his life. But all things don't go as planned and the four again land into trouble when Chow's enemies abduct Doug. This film too is very entertaining but what I found is that it lost its very own essence of the hangover. In the film, you see only Chow enjoying the hangover, while the four are always in trouble. The film is very humourous and good comedy too but still I would highly recommend the previous parts over this especially the first one.

"Just like the first ""Hangover"", this one is Destined to Achieve Cult Status in the Pantheons of R-rated Comedies","Rating: 3.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)The blow hot-blow cold taste of the second installment has been completely washed away and we are fortunately left with evocative memories of the classic comedy of the first ""Hangover"". This film is quintessential R-rated hilarity at its sublime best. The kind of comedy that can even make absurdity look believable and flaws look inconsequential, just because it's so damn funny!Moreover, the film accomplishes the arduous task of never falling into the trap of vulgarity or going overboard with its expletive words and gratuitous obscenity - a fate suffered by many adult comedies just for the sake of extracting a few forced guffaws. Now I'm certainly no prude, and I love nothing more than some good R-rated fun, replete with abusive words, wicked scenes and a bit of obscenity thrown in for good measure. But good measure is what needs to be stressed on. It's when these gimmicks go overboard for lack of good content, inability to script funny scenes, or a dearth of hilarious dialogs and performances, that R- rated fun becomes an ""Un""-rated torment. Well, that being said, lets continue with the praises for this delightfully side-splitting film.""Hangover Part 3"" is overflowing with laugh-out-loud moments and hysterically funny dialogs, that are backed by the effortless comic timing of Bradley Cooper, the adorable goofiness of Ed Helms, the pseudo-flamboyance of John Goodman, and the devious wickedness of Ken Jeong (Mr. Chow) coupled wit his one-of-a-kind China-man accent.But, finally, it's Zach Galifianakis who completely steals the show from the first frame to the last. Make no mistake, ""Hangover Part 3"" is Galifianakis' film out-and-out, and he potently shoulders it, proving, that in the end, its talent that ultimately talks in cinema and nothing else.P.S.:- Remember to stay back after the end credits start rolling. There's one last sequence you are treated to - like a final swansong to the ""Wolf Pack"". In fact it just might be the best after credits sequence yet, and it plays out more like a minute long short film. You also don't need to wait that long.

You really get the feeling that you've seen the end and in some way needed it.It seems to me the director/screenwriters really listened to what the public wanted. It's as if they sat in the cinema for the previous ones and went ""Ok, people are really cracking up on the performances of Alan (Zack Galifianakis) and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) so let's put more of that in the last movie""And that just worked great for me. It really is crazy. Zack Galifianakis is really out of this world and so is Ken Jeong. If dementia and horrible moral values with a hint of nonsense do not make you laugh, you won't like it though.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fitting End to the Adventures of the Wolf Pack,"Who would've thought the surprise comedy hit of the summer of 2009 would go on to become a full-blown trilogy? It's a baffling prospect because each film became progressively less successful as the series continued until THE HANGOVER PART III found itself lucky to squeak by with enough domestic box office to recoup its budget. I loved the first film, and I wasn't as hard on the second one as most other people were. I was disappointed that the filmmakers felt the need to adhere so close (insultingly close) to the pattern of the first film in an effort to mimic its success for the second film, but I was happy to find it breaking away from the mold for the third and final film. Of course, by the time part three was released in 2013, most people had grown tired of the shtick and it was lucky that it didn't totally tank. The third adventure of the infamous Wolf Pack finds Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) confronting Allen (Zach Galifianakis) about his reckless insanity and convincing him to enter a clinic to help him balance out. En route, they're hijacked by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). You see, Leslie Chow stole millions of dollars worth of gold from Marshall and he believes the Wolf Pack is his best chance of finding him. Kidnapping Doug as collateral (because what's a HANGOVER movie if Doug's part of the team?), he gives the guys a deadline and tells them to bring him Chowor else.Personally, I'm not sure what people hated so much about this movie. I actually liked it. It's a refreshing break from the formula of the first two and takes itself a little more seriously than the second film. Whereas the second movie was sort of a parody of the first movie, taking it to new extremes while rehashing a lot of the same gags with a wink to the audience and an oh-no-not-again vibe, THE HANGOVER PART III is more original and gives it's characters more to do than stumble from one clue to another. Ken Jeong's now iconic character of Leslie Chow has gone much farther than I ever anticipated he would as he's gone from an amusing addition to the first film to being the focal point of the final film. This means we get plenty more of his loud, obnoxious, flamboyant style. So, if Chow was your least favorite part of the previous films, you'll want to skip this one because we get plenty more. And, yes, you get the obligatory full frontal Jeong shot if you stick around too long after the end credits begin to roll. At this point, I think it's written into his contract. Chow must be a fan favorite; I can see them making a movie centered on him to keep the interest alive long enough to profit from the final film. It works well enough. I don't hate the Chow character and he's a little more toned down in PART III, going for more bizarre and threatening and less in-your-face loud.John Goodman is a nice surprise as the villain, Marshall. He doesn't really have much to do beside yelling and threatening people. Goodman's good at that sort of thing, so he's a nice fit. Melissa McCarthy is on a roll right now, so she's got a minor part as a love interest for Allen. Yeah, you read that right. Honestly, I can't think of anyone else who could've played an odd enough character to match wits (or witlessness) with Allen. And then we have a bunch of returning cameos from the first movie. Director Todd Phillips tries to bring it all full circle with the Wolf Pack returning to where it all began and encountering familiar faces along the way. And he does it all with a fresh approach. I can appreciate that and I think that's why I enjoyed this movie so much more than most other people. The HANGOVER movies, at their best and worst, are redeemed in the interactions between the three buddies at the center of the adventures: Phil, Stu, and Allen. They've got a great chemistry and that's why, even at its lows, these movies are fun for me. Turning THE HANGOVER into a trilogy might not have been the best idea but it wasn't the worst and each movie has enough of it's own flavor to make them entertaining. THE HANGOVER PART III is a fine end to the adventures of the Wolf Pack and I think we can, at the very least, be glad this one didn't start with a bachelor party and roofies.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Funny?,"The first surprise about ""The Hangover III"" : there is no hangover. Secondly, ""The Hangover III"" is not very funny. What happened? A little Mr. Chow and Alan go a long way. And there is way too much of Ken Jeong and Zack Galifianakis in H3. Director Todd Phillips strategically miscalculates focusing them in the foreground instead of the back. I actually thought ""The Hangover II"" set in Thailand was hysterical, even though it was criticized for being a clone of ""The Hangover"". ""The Hangover"" was inspired originality—one of the funniest movies ever. Amazing Bradley Cooper returns as solid Phil. He is the straight man relegated to saying, ""What the f***?"" Granted seeing nominated Cooper in ""Silver Linings Playbook"", he has outgrown this, and I acknowledge his loyalty. Anyway, I am in complete agreement with Phil.""The Hangover III"" comes full circle and concludes the trilogy in Las Vegas. Mercifully, what happens in Vegas should stay there. In a bizarre twist H3 is more an action movie than comedy—very disappointing and totally baffling. This is not the comic equivalent of ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Promisingly, John Goodman enters as mob heavy Marshall who again takes kidnapping steady Doug (Justin Bartha). This vendetta relates to Mr. Chow (Jeong) stealing money from H1. Philips and Craig Mazin's erratic script douses whatever possible hysterics. Stu (steady Ed Helms) is not the butt of the thematic joke. Heather Graham reprises as Jade, the stripper single Mom, but her talents are not at all leveraged. We are mostly left with Alan and Chow's bewildering bromance. Again, this gets old after about 15 minutes.Dark comedy abounds in the beginning with a gruesome giraffe highway sequence and a really disturbing family death all surrounding clueless Alan (Galifianakis). This summons The Wolfpack to intervene on Alan's behalf and well-being. The tragic flaw is that Alan is vastly unsympathetic. The best narrative consequence of it all is Cassie played by uncompromisingly funny Melissa McCarthy. H3 does have its moments particularly with Alan's man-crush on Phil. In a ridiculous exchange Alan ask Phil about his shirt, ""Is that from Diesel?"" Risking his life scaling down the hotel balcony, Alan takes a Smartphone photo of Phil. Phil asks, ""Did you get that?"" Too bad there isn't more of that instead of chases and shooting.The funniest scene of H3 occurs at the very end. Stu is the object of a visual joke that is laugh out loud hysterical. Seems to me that should have been the premise of ""The Hangover III"", where the Boys seem completely at home. What a squandered opportunity. I guess we can take solace that they were funny before.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Wolfpack 3, not quite Ocean's Eleven","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.This is the one that diverges from the previous formula, and suffers, if slightly for it.While this has plenty of ridiculous events, it loses the mystery aspect that kept the interest up. This becomes more of a pauedo mystery and more of a heist / gangster movie. Almost a like a Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.The end of this one hints at a more spiritual sequel and I can't wait to see that.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Laugh riot,"Well honestly I didn't care about the rave reviews which this movie has got. I watched it and felt satisfied. Movie was a laugh riot. Zach and Jeong are spearheads for the movie. The couple of twists and turn in the movie makes you anxious about the upcoming scenes. Though the female nudity is less compared to previous parts. And not sure why people are giving this a low rating. This is the only way it can be ended.Personally I am a fan of Todd Phillip movies and Zach. Todd Phillip has improved his screen writing in every movie he gives us right on from old school to H3. And Zach what more we can ask from him? If at all they are planning for part 4, they might lose the charm of the hangover series. On the whole power packed entertainer!!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome Way To end This Franchise,"I don't know what all the complaining is about with this film. This is a solid comedy and it lives up to the first film in the series. To say this movie is humorless and not funny at all is crazy. I guess some people just like to complain.If this is truly the last episode of the Hangover franchise they went out with a bang. This was not the complete rehash of H2. There is actually a pretty good story and some good laughs all they way through the film.The acting is solid and the jokes are fresh. There are some references to the past two movies but that is expected. In my opinion, the move delivers an all aspects. There are a couple of unbelievable moments that happen in order to drive the story but that happens in all movies.I would love to see H4 but I know that would be impossible.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Still good even though the first two were better.,"My wife and I decided to rewatch the three movies from The Hangover as we already enjoyed them a lot in the past. It's just our kind of humour. I get it that not everybody finds this funny but it's just impossible to please everybody with comedies as we all have a different sense of humour. The first two movies were the best ones (we both scored them a nine) but this one is still a very good comedy. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha are at it again, this time not on a bender but still a lot of crazy scenes and situations. Ken Jeong is definitely the best character in all the movies. His hyper energetic character is just a delight to watch. To me they can make another Hangover, it will give me a reason to rewatch them all again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"reject comedy, embrace joker","What a heel turn! This film does a powerful rug pull, tearing down and abandoning the formula that it built up with the two preceding movies.And that's a good thing. Too many franchises these days play it too safe, bringing nothing new to the table with every new iteration. I found the story engaging and captivating. Todd Phillips and Craig Mazin clearly wanted to show that they can make a ""serious"" action movie, and WELL DONE. These guys made Joker and Chernobyl, and this movie was a demo launchpad for their writing prowess.Best joke in the movie: the mid-credit scene seems like a slap across the face of fans who were expecting another twelve more hangovers, and a miniseries, and a theme park.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
It Works Because It Relates ♦ 75%,"I feel bad because it has ended. One of the coolest trilogies. Dandy characters. I'll miss the wolf-pack. 7.5/10.The setup continues and this time it's all based on Chow. I loved Stu's performance among the three in this installment. Alan's demeanor is lovable and it has lots of twists in store for you. The plot is kinda weaker than the prequels. It slightly gives an impression that it was made-up. The things that Part 3 misses is the originality, humor intensity and adventures. It lacks the latter a bit much. Also, the prevention of nudity, sex & drug abuse is quite a good approach to end the franchise. Nice.Music is, as always, good. Screenplay is good. The second half being more lively, I enjoyed the movie to the fullest because every time it shows a flashback, I experienced goosebumps. Lovely. I won't reprimand much for its goofs, illogical sequences & timid writing, because the idea itself is worth an applaud. Good job, Todd Phillips & crew!BOTTOM LINE: A watchable sequel, but not a laugh riot. If you've enjoyed the series, this is a must watch. Otherwise, Part 1 is 10/10 & Part 2 is 9/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

From The Hangover Part III you expect only the worst,"From The Hangover Part III you expect only the worst, 2 part was already of medium quality, losing all the merits of the original. And then in the 3 part a new plot is presented. Yes, it is simple and only suitable for cheap B-movie. But it relies on the original story. The Hangover Part III gives a new one in contrast to the sequel and serves all this interesting. The assessment of critics is not objective. This is clearly not a bad comedy with an excellent ending to the Wolf Pack trilogy",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"On humor, Hollywood, and autism","This weekend I went to see the final installment of ""The Hangover"" with some neurotypical (those who most would call ""normal"") friends. Actually, there's nothing really typical about them. Can't say they are really great friends, nor are they particularly wise, but I feel relaxed around them. They don't seem to understand much about autism, nor how much the movie portrays some of my characteristics when I was younger (they have been involved with schizophreniics), but at least they are open-minded.I probably laughed harder than anyone in the theater at the character ""Alan"", who is played by a very funny comedian. Alan is a 42-year-old man who lives with his parents, holed up behind the walls of his room, and he couldn't be more of an abusive ass. He also exhibits nearly all of the characteristics known to people these days of Aspergers Syndrome (good and bad), plus some traits which aren't associated with autism at all. Nobody actually used either word aspergers or autism, but it was more than implicit.Although I laughed, I have found much of this movie (and the current direction of Hollywood comedy in general) to be no laughing matter. I can laugh because I have learned to laugh at myself, being one who has had to live with some of the symptoms which the movie characterizes (albeit grossly exaggerated). If I couldn't laugh, I doubt very much that I would still be alive today at 46. This may be just a comedy, and of course I know better than to look to any movie for education or vindication on anything - still, I've been on this earth long enough to see just how influential even a slapstick production can be on opinions.What isn't funny about Alan is that he is implicitly portrayed as autistic, he has very little trouble expressing himself verbally, yet he is an insensitive bum. I have always worked hard for what I have, although my parents provided college funding and I stayed until I was ready to go a few years later, I never, ever asked them or anybody for money! The portrayal of the adult aspie as one who is intentionally nasty, and won't do anything for himself is extremely unfair and defamatory! Alan doesn't understand appropriate self-regulation of his social behavior - fair enough, but I haven't met any autistics who would do anything particularly manipulative, much less drug their friends! Adding to this the implied pedophelia is just sickening, and completely unfounded.What was mostly lacking was Alan's pain, with all the crushing shame that would haunt a typical autistic adult when he makes social mistakes. Autistic people are highly intelligent, and this does not spare them (myself included) the perception of insult or emotional harm if they have caused that to another person. They can be deeply empathetic regarding any pain which they may have caused - the problem is with not understanding how they have caused others to hurt, thereby making their social navigation profoundly confusing and accident-prone. Well, of course there's nothing funny about pain!I realize that we must be able to laugh in order to be healthy, and that means we need something (and usually somebody) to laugh at. But when Jack Nicholson spoofed Tourette's Syndrome in the seventies, he didn't attempt to portray the underlying personality of his character, therefore any misrepresentations had to be far less egregious. There once was enough creativity in Hollywood to produce characters who which were very funny, but not too close to anybody who would likely exist in the real world that it would influence real-world opinion. What causes me feelings of despair is the fact that this modern-day comedy went too far in exploiting the aspergers condition, and it went almost entirely uncensured (as the Google evidence makes it apparent). In a time where child aspies have never been more the target of bully hatred, the comedians have picked the aspie as their new whipping boy, and they are inspired by a culture which tends to believe that the line between that multimillion-dollar-joke and cruel defamation is wherever they decide to plant their feet!",,Anonymous,Crime
Loved it 🤗,Finally after watching hangover trilogy I felt so happy and had a lot of fun watching this movie I dream of this kind of friends around me all the actors portrayed their roles fantastically but screenplay is little messed up it's hard to make people laugh with comedy but this trilogy is ultimately a good one to watch adult comedy,,Anonymous,Crime
I really enjoyed this sequel,"While part 3 has nothing to do with the predecessors, other than the characters, it doesn't diminish the charm or humor of this one. I was pleasantly surprised. Actually ""surprised"" might be overstating it, since I was expecting to like it anyway. I have two very minor problems about the film: Giving Ken Jeong a bigger role, and the scenes with Melissa McCarthy. Again, these are just minor problems. Mr. Chow is funny, but not that funny. What's funny in small doses isn't necessarily funny in bigger ones. At least the guy isn't annoying. Also, I didn't think Zach or Melissa had any chemistry here. Aside from being attracted to one another, the scenes in the Pawn Shop serve no purpose. Otherwise, the movie is very funny and entertaining.*** out of ***",,Anonymous,Crime
Funny sequel to parts 1 and 2.,"If you want to watch a movie that generates almost nonstop laughter, this is the movie for you. Although this is the third installment of the wolf pack, featuring the usual cast of characters, this movie actually is more about one of the characters, Doug, and his strange and highly amusing relationship with Mr. Chow, who is one of the funniest characters in movies today. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are wonderful, but they serve as straight men as Doug and Chow deliver all the funny lines. Ken Cheong is outstanding as Mr. Chow, but it is Zach Galifianakis who carries this movie. What a great comedic actor. Many of his lines generate immediate laughter and since he has most of the gunny lines, there's lot so laughter. Some of the humor is low brow, but so what? It's a comedy. And the presence of Melissa McCarthy makes this movie even more hilarious. A she-wolf may be joining the group.",,Anonymous,Crime
"we get the point, now please put the pack to rest","The Wolfpack has come howling back for more in this vapid, unnecessary third installment which, if interested viewers remember, once began with a really fresh, clever, and outrageously funny first installment. Phil, Stu, and Doug have gone on with their respected married lives, but are forced to stage an intervention when Alan--the most troublesome member of their notorious crew--has lost control and created a brouhaha following a tragic occurrence. Meanwhile, the infamous Leslie Chow has escaped from prison and has a long list of enemies, including a particularly nasty piece of business by the name of Marshall (Goodman) who demands the Wolfpack find Chow or else suffer dire consequences. Contrived, protracted, and barely funny, this is only likely to satisfy viewers who will enjoy seeing that same zany group of characters from the first two films reunited for more strange shenanigans. A few chuckles here and there, but enough already. **",,Anonymous,Crime
