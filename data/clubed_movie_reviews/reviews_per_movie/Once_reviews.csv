Music Music Music Music,"This is a wonderful, fun and touching movie. At a screening at Sundance 2007 the director described it as a musical, and it really is. The primary actors are musicians and their songs tie the movie together and tie you to them. Although the primary cast aren't actors as a first profession, they are very natural together and the film flows very well because of it. Everyone involved in this film has a great passion for music, and it is very infectious. It is one of the few films I have seen in 7 years at Sundance that received a standing ovation.From the Sundance film guide: ""A Dublin busker, who ekes out a living playing guitar and repairing vacuum cleaners for his dad's shop, meets a young Czech immigrant who sells roses on the same street. She likes his song, and what's moreshe has a broken vacuum cleaner! They soon find themselves playing music together in a nearby music store (since she can't afford a piano, the owner lets her play his floor models). Over the course of a week, they form a musical rapport and, newly inspired, decide to record an album.Once may loosely be classified as a musical, but it has a refreshing vérité inflection. Conceived by director John Carney as a ""video album,"" it sports a scrappy, unembellished naturalism. Carney took a risk in choosing professional musicians over professional actors, but Glen Hansard (of the well-known Irish band the Frames) and Marketa Irglova (a Czech singer/songwriter) are not only remarkably charming together but they're equally adept with the more melancholy shades (Hansard's lonely soul, stuck on an old flame; Irglova struggling to support a mother and daughter). Burdened and brokenhearted, their musical bond is the heart of the film and of their love.Great music aside, what makes this film special is how little effort it seems to exert. If it's possible to be blindsided by simplicity--a light touch, Once does it.""  John Nein",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The moment all artists live for.,"Probably the one thing I would say about this movie that is even remotely negative, is that if you don't like the music, then you are completely out of luck. Otherwise This movie is about a Guy (no name) and a Girl (same deal) who meet on the street while Guy is busking, a side gig from his day job as a vacuum cleaner repairman. The two form a bond through music, as they jam together in a music store, then ultimately they go through a weekend recording his songs before he goes off to re-unite with his lost love. Trying to explain this movie to someone who hasn't seen it, it just seems like a movie about nothing, 'cause the plot is so spare. But everything felt true--the dialogue, the way the two musicians relate, the way it captured the feeling you get when you see something you've created become real. This movie totally won me over after the recording session, when it is early in the morning, the studio technician and the band go out to do the ""car test""--seeing if the songs still sound good on inferior speakers. It is at this point you feel this ""seizing of the sword"" moment of triumph for Guy--this is what he has worked for, this is what he has created. It is a moment that all artists live for, and this is the reason I will go see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
And so it happened once ...,"From the moment ONCE begins, it is clear that the experience about to be had is unlike any you've had before. A busker sings for his dollar in the street. The quality of the image is grainy; the steadiness of the camera is shaky at best. The day turns into night and the song goes from bright to dark. The passion with which it is sung is almost overwhelming and suddenly borders on off putting. From the manner in which the busker is framed, it isn't clear whether anyone is there to hear his song but his fervor brushes skepticism aside and declares that the song itself and the satisfaction derived from singing it, outweigh the importance of having someone hear it. But someone is listening after all. A young woman from the Czech Republic stands transfixed before our busker on this Dublin street and a spark ignites the flame that gives ONCE its warmth. Writer/Director, John Carney, removes all convention from the movie musical and creates a film that reads like a well-written love song about two musicians falling in love with each other and the music they create together.In the early 90's, Carney left his rock group, The Frames, to pursue a career in film-making. The Frames continued on without him and new lead singer, Glen Hansard, eventually took leave to search out new musical ventures, moving from Dublin to the Czech Republic. Here he met Marketa Irglova, a classically trained pianist, and they developed a project entitled The Swell Season. Though the two are not linked romantically, their meeting and the music that came out of that became Carney's inspiration for ONCE. During the week that follows their initial meeting on the street, the two artists who are never referred to by name in the film, learn to accept that they are inexplicably drawn to each other. Given the chance, a relationship between the two could become one that would help each other grow. He would make a great father figure to her young child and she would drive him to make something of himself. Though ONCE's tone is simple, these two characters' lives are not. He has a girlfriend in London he longs to be with but feels he cannot out of obligation to his father in Dublin, while she is still married to an estranged husband whom she is unsure she has a future with. The trick then becomes to remain in the moment with each other and never allow for their relationship to go where it naturally feels it should.Albeit a modern approach to a movie musical, ONCE is not so modern that it leaves the music behind. Instead the music becomes the catalyst for love. She is first drawn to him by the sound of his song. He sings it with such passion that it gives her a direct view of his soul. It is not all who are able to show such vulnerability yet when the song ends, he trips over his spoken words and nothing comes out as it should. At first, she almost seems a nuisance to him. It isn't until he hears the beautiful music she can make with her hands that the glimpse of her soul captures all his attention. Theirs is a mating ritual carried out in song. When one sings or plays, the other listens. When one cannot express the proper sentiment in words, it is music that gets the point across. When the two find themselves alone in a local musical instrument shop, they learn what it means to sing together. In order to do so, they must truly listen to the sound of the other's voice and fall into the same pace and rhythm of their notes. Their voices, as it turns out, are the perfect compliment to each other. The harmony they create leads into a song that is itself a representation of the love between them, both fragile and pure.The delicate chemistry between Hansard and Irglova is framed in such a stripped fashion that it only further serves to concretize the genuine sincerity between the two. Almost entirely hand held and lit only with natural light, ONCE seems less like intricate film-making and more like layered storytelling, or perhaps more appropriately, song writing. Put simply, ONCE is like a perfectly soft song played acoustically in a park; it seeps into your soul, soothing you as the sun beats down upon your smiling face, allowing for all cynicism to melt away while your reaffirmed belief in love is sung from your mouth.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The heart has reasons that reason knows nothing about,"I write these for friends and if you love movies you are a friend: I saw a movie last night that was so good that I have spent the last hour looking up information about it on the Internet Movie Data Base and related links. I have included the Fox Searchlight website for the movie at the bottom of this review so you can hear the music. So now I know that is was made in 17 days and at a cost of less than $150K and reflects a Dublin of 10-15 years ago when Dublin was much poorer and more working class.And, I would be much poorer in life and spirit, and my heart, like most of us, covered in scar tissue from life, would not seem so vulnerable and new, if I had not seen this movie. A simple story of a street musician in Ireland, singing covers during the day for Euros, and his own music at night for cents. A verging on middle aged man, still living with his Da, repairing vacuums in a tiny shop and writing songs to his lost love in his tinier bedroom. Approached by girl, an immigrant, who loves his songs, understands the pain that gave them life, and soon they are in a music shop with the girl playing the piano and together they prove that art isn't produced from big budgets or green lit by ten vice presidents and that seventeen days and a pittance can make me get goose bumps just trying to write a review of what I saw in a dark theater with ten other people in a complex dominated by Shrek, Pirates, and Spiderman.I knew a woman once who only read novels about unrequited love. What a wonderful phrase: unrequited love. Archaic, unrequited, love, universally known and unknown, and as a friend said about the movie and its songs: no great art came from happiness. But the movie isn't sad, it's pulsing with life and music and incident and the process of how art is made. I have always been a sucker for movies about how art is made: Shakespeare in Love, Topsy Turvey, as examples, but in both those, art that was known. In Once, on the streets of Dublin, an Irishman and a Czech girl, remind us of how, to my generation, the guitar was king, a guitar, bass, drums and piano a symphony orchestra, and there was no power like the power of rock and roll. In all generations, love sought, found, lost, and sometimes regained is the stuff that brings us to the theater, to the book, to the movie.I'm in the midst of reading a book by an Irishman, a detective novel, the hero a reader, and the author uses the book to list books he likes: from one...'the body moves on, the mind stays and circles the events of the past.' This must be true of the writer/director.You won't forget these people. I can't forget their songs. We should all meet, my movie loving friends, and talk about this movie in a bar in Chicago I know that has great music on the jukebox, cold cold beer, and is dark enough so we would all look good. Neil Young sang: only love can break your heart, Once asks 'how often do you meet the right person', and as fellow movie goers I ask how often can the right movie be made, shown in your local, and break/make you heart at seven of a beautiful summer's eve? It's the best movie of the year. Maybe of the last five years. But, I am not a dispassionate critic, I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I Don't Think I've Ever Seen a Mellower Movie,"Watching ""Once"" is like sitting in on a jam session. It's mellow and relaxed. It doesn't amount to much, but it's pleasant enough.The director has said that he set out to make a movie so simple that the story could be summarized on the back of a postage stamp, and he's succeeded. An Irish busker meets a Czech émigré, and both flit around the edges of falling for each other while recording a demo album of the busker's music. Both are struggling with the loves in their lives, he with a girlfriend in London, she with her estranged husband and father to her little girl. The resolution of their stories, what resolution there is, felt right and realistic. This isn't a fairy tale, but neither is it Shakespearean tragedy. Life simply goes on.The film's biggest asset is its music, and indeed most of the songs in the film we see performed in their entirety. The movie isn't exactly a musical in the strictest sense of the word, since characters don't spontaneously burst into choreographed musical numbers, but like the best musicals, the songs in ""Once"" illuminate the characters and play an integral role in the storytelling.A low-key little gem of a movie.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A must see film!,"I too saw this film at Sundance, and we were treated to a live performance afterwards by the two main characters, who are actual musicians and not actors.I can't say enough good things about this film. It is bittersweet and romantic, with great music (not Irish music, but the singer/songwriter type) as the two main characters collaborate on their songs and help each other become stronger and face the romantic challenges they both are suffering from. The end of the film is wonderful and Hollywood-cliché-free! I hope this film gets the distribution it deserves, because I'm going to be telling everyone to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Excellent, gorgeous story","I have to say I loved this film. I went to see it with a Japanese friend, and she loved it too.So the plot wasn't full of 'save the world' ambitions and the good guy wasn't a millionaire playboy, but who cares? It was a gorgeous straightforward film about two people meeting at a certain time in their lives.I read a quote recently about someone who'd seen the movie and came out wanting to hug everyone they met - and I totally agree. I cycled home humming the tunes and feeling like I haven't felt from a film since seeing 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I know, I know - totally different films - but the zen-like feeling after seeing them both...From a Dublin dweller, it was fun to watch the geography, as the film makers played with the locations in that certain venues were on the same street - yet it looked like the actors had to walk through town to get to them. It definitely hindered the 'who do I know in the public street' shots moments! But was interesting, as helped make Dublin be a different city to what the residents would be used to.My recommendation is to just go and see it if you're on for seeing something uncomplicated, feel-good without being too mushy, comedic moments that everyone can relate to and some singer-songwriter music thrown in.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Ad lib,"There is much to love about the quirky little film ONCE: it is honest, simple, transparent, and made with a low budget and lots of love. The leading characters are gentle people who happen to sing as well as act and the love story they create is a fragile little tale that remains in the air as a nice memory after the credits are past.A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant. Along comes a Czech girl (Markéta Irglová) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case. The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music. The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -, they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London. The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days. The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself. The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'. It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent. Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Heartfelt, no-budget musical","ONCE is a great little film about two characters who may or may not be falling in love on the streets of Dublin, and a film that deservedly won an Oscar for its music. Most of the feelings and emotions are explored through the music here, giving this film a novel and fresh feel.I don't really watch romantic films and I actively despise the romantic comedy genre, but I can confirm that this is a low-key and touching little movie that successfully avoids the pitfalls of its genre. I particularly liked the raw, naturalistic feel of the production, and the fact that the two main actors aren't actually actors (they're musicians instead) makes it even more remarkable.Really, though, ONCE is a film that's all about the music and director John Carney is happy to stand back and let the tunes take centre stage. Everything, from the storyline to the style, takes second place to the music, and while few of the songs are as good as the one that won the Oscar, the way that the subject matter is handled and celebrated with undeniable enthusiasm means that this is a film that you can really get behind and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Am I from another planet?,"Everyone seems to literally be in ecstasy over this film and it's just won the Oscar for best song. It went down a storm at Sundance receiving a standing ovation - even my best friends rate it highly. So many people can't be wrong? True, it's amazing that it was made on such a small budget, but in my opinion it is basically naff, hackneyed and tiresome. Maybe it's the Marmite syndrome, maybe it's the Emperors new clothes. I've watched it a couple of times thinking that I had missed something. But nothing - I was still bored and found the whole experience was exacerbated by the discomfort of watching poorly shot, unfocused and wobbly images. The music was just about bearable to me, nothing more. I don't believe there is a right way or a wrong way to make a film as long as it touches something inside you. I guess I'm perplexed and intrigued by the overwhelming and unanimous response that this is a brilliant and multi-layered work of film art and entertainment. It didn't move or entertain me and what critical faculties I posses were affronted by the cliché ridden self indulgence so poorly realised. The complete lack of any original technique 'verite' or otherwise and performers who lacked any ability to engage me. But the audiences bellow with praise and an almost religious fervour - I guess I will have to go watch it again or should I just trust to my instincts and leave well alone? You guys like Marmite, I just can't stomach it - it makes me wretch.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"""A Magical Film of love, music, song...and a Hoover Vacuum!""","ONCE is a film to see and cherish for the magic of song and music combined in the setting of Dublin for a young man and woman who meet and who make wonderful music together. The only issue is she's married to a bloke in another country. But that doesn't stop them for creating a wonderful piece of music which will stay with them forever.John Carney has directed and written a brilliant film which tags at your heart and makes your feet dance all at the same time. ""Guy and Girl"" are tremendous in their parts and the humor and passion they bring to their music. Dublin is such a great location for this film and it resembles London in so many of its blocks of buildings.

The best Irish film ever,"Don't listen to the comments left on this page by idiots who don't get the film Once is a beautiful film, in my opinion the best Irish film ever but a great film overall. Made with an almost documentary realism on the streets of Dublin (this film shows how DV is not just a fad) this film is a modern day musical but the kind of musical where scangers eye up the camera, where musical numbers take place in dirty old music shops and flats. To me this film says something about Dublin , about immigration, about music but not in a worthy annoying ""a Tigers tale"" way. A masterpiece with great central performances and amazing music.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A touching and honest film,"I own a movie theater on Cape Cod and recently saw this film on two occasions at the New Directors Film Festival in NYC. I met John Carney ten years ago at the Golway Film Festival where I was part of a team which was reviewing film projects. John had a five minute clip of a feature he was working on ""November Afternoon"". I stayed in touch until he finished the film. He sent me a tape it just blew me away. ""Once"" like ""November Afternoon"" is a unique film experience. The low budget feel fits the story and the music blew me away. He captures a small slice of Dublin Life, spent the summer there in 69, that seems so real and honest. Glen and Marketa bring great strength to this story and a realism that is seldom seen in American Cinema.

Sweet,"""Once"" is the story of two people brought together by music. The question is, due to circumstances, can they ever be together? This is almost an ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" type film as it is told mainly in song by well-known Irish musician Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova, a real-life couple. Due to the unaffectedness, attractiveness and chemistry of the two stars, the story emerges in a very sweet and natural way.For the generation to whom this film is geared, it's absolutely wonderful. It's pure and sincere and very poignant. I admit that for me, it's not my type of music, though I did like the Oscar- winning song and appreciated that the movie was made on a shoestring and done so successfully. I really applaud the filmmaker.This is a movie that means a lot to people and has found a niche all its own. It's great when a small film can do that. Sadly, the Hollywood studios never seem to take notice.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid reworking of the song-intensive film,"As a musical film Once does wonders to reinvigorate the genre with some much needed realism and urgency. This effect is in no small part due to the faux documentary style breathing staying power into an already well composed Damien Rice-esquire soundtrack. The two lead characters are thoroughly convincing as a pair of struggling souls, trying to make ends meet, who happen to cross paths in a most ordinary and unassuming way. Though the script certainly will not garner any praise (minimal though it may be, subtitles may be required through thick Irish accents), a bittersweet longing, albeit of the mildly shallow variety, does prevail as the overwhelming spirit of this convincing and soulful songwriting romance.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The way a musical should be, contemporary and cheese-less","As I've posted previously I don't really like musicals, never have, generally waayyy too cheesy for my tastes. But in the absence of something else that drew our attention we went to see Once. We were in the Cinema anyway so why not. We went mostly, I suppose, as we'd seen Glen Hansard and the Frames playing before and they were great so we thought the movie couldn't be too bad. At the end of the day we both really liked this movie, not too sentimental and the music which is written and performed by the two main characters is excellent. It irks me to see other Irish people in here with such negative views, it really seems like its something personal towards Glen Hansard. I don't know the guy whatsoever but this is about the film which is worth seeing.I'd seen Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova live in Christchurch cathedral in Dublin which in itself was pretty different. I'd only been inside the cathedral once before pretty much as a tourist. During the gig he gave a solo performance which stands out in my mind as the best I've ever seen, just him and an acoustic guitar. I've seen A LOT of bands big and small so that is really saying something. If you get a chance go see them.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Certainly worth seeing.,"Went in not knowing much beyond the acclaim it received at Sundance -- and left seeing that the praise was well deserved.Done for less than 200k on a 17 day shooting schedule, with musicians taking actor roles AND putting out a wonderful soundtrack, and I tell you everything about to clicked for me.The movie lacked the pretension and predictability that follows light-hearted romantic attempts, the ending was well done, and lacked the general silliness that (I think) hurts most modern attempts at musicals -- and it does so by using well placed music to tell most of the story, and letting the dialog (which is also well written) accent it.Will you leave this movie with a life-changing experience? Of course not, and the hype surrounding this movie is a pity because nothing ever lives up to the expectations once that train leaves the station -- but if you enjoy movies you will leave the theater thinking you just saw a fine example of what happens when you filter out the big budgets, the egos, and the studios, and just let a fine writer/director and his cast deliver a very enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Perfecton doesn't have to be perfect,"Once is about a young Irish busker with a torn guitar and a raft of achingly felt songs about a girlfriend he lost the year before. He works in Dublin at his dad's Hoover Repair Centre. One day as he's playing on the street a Czech woman who sells roses and cleans houses comes up and starts to talk to him. She's somewhat cool but she's also disarmingly honest. The dialogue seems understated, offhand, but the words seem to come from the heart. She plays the piano (and later reveals she's written some songs herself) and they get together to make music. Both are suffering from love affairs that went wrong. He longs for her but she keeps her distance. The simplicity of the acting makes the characters seem real, like everything else in the movie. It doesn't try too hard. It trusts its material, and it works.The recording session they wangle with a group of other buskers (two guitarists and a youthful drummer) is a metaphor for this whole film. These people know nothing about recording, but they've got good material and the initially skeptical engineer winds up acknowledging that they've made a beautiful thing.Once's transitions are a little awkward sometimes and its images aren't fancy, but the story moves you without having any sentimental payoffs. Kitchen sink film-making: it works if you believe in what you're doing. And have something to work with. The core of Once is the music. It's what they have to work with. The studio recording session has the good feel of things coming together: it's so strong and uncalculated-feeling, it makes the studio scene in Craig Brewer's Hustle and Flow look self-conscious. In Once the sound of the music speaks without special need for dialogue or close-ups. The real love story of Once is the love of musicians playing together. Few movies perhaps have captured any better that warmth and pleasure of making music with others.People have said this is a musical. If so, it redefines the musical as some American musicals have done recently, especially Spring Awakening and Passing Strange. What makes the idea fly is that it's as if the young man and the young woman can't express what they feel for each other, and the only way they can get their emotions across is to burst into song. But the songs are their songs, not some composer's. It's all perfectly organic.Perfection, it turns out, doesn't have to be perfect.Starring Glen Hansard of The Frames and Marketa Irglova.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

special in every way,"I was lucky to have caught the trailer for ""Once"" during a movie preview. This movie hasn't been advertised as much as all the Hollywood sequels coming out.

The story is simple and it's been told before, but its execution is one that sets this movie apart from others. It's not a typical musical, but more like a long music video.

It is ultimately a film about two people who meet each other, fall into a different kind of love, and then are forced to leave each other, even though the impacts they had on each other will never leave them.

The music was atrocious, and to make things even more problematic on the ear, it was played every ten seconds. Anyone ever actually listen to the lyrics? Unbelievable how far we have fallen. And, for the record, I do not 'not' like this because it is truly independent in its format and its style. That, in fact, was the only thing that saved it from being rated as 0 Stars as opposed to one (that and the fact that zero stars is not possible). I have no problem with people liking what they like, but I find it hard to believe that this film garnered the same rating as something like Clouzot's ""Le Corbeau.""

You will fall in love with this perfect movie.,"I certainly did when I watched it. Everything is perfect about this movie: the great performances, the music, the directing, the cinematography. It's one of those gift of a films that sucks you completely into its world while watching it, and even as the credits begin to roll, you don't want to get up to leave it.Even on the drive home, I was constantly replaying all the best scenes in my head, which is basically the entire movie. Every single scene that is shot seems to bring something amazing to the movie- overall it is one of the most heartfelt and sincere films I have seen. Unlike the patterns of most ""indie"" genre attempted films in Hollywood these days, the emotions are not forced upon the script and pressed on the audience, it is a simple but sweet tale in which all the beauty of is perfectly captured on film, accompanied by one of the best and most well-fit soundtracks that I have ever heard.This film stands out among all others, and is one of the best if not THE best film I have seen in all my life as a movie-lover. I recommend it to everyone10/10, without a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
How often do you find the right person?,"""Once, I loved, and I gave so much love to this love you were the world to me...""No, Tom Jobim & Vinicius de Moraes's beautiful song isn't in the soundtrack, but ""Once I Loved"" has been in my mind for the past couple of days since I watched ""Juno"", and after watching ""Once"" for the first time last night, I've been particularly romantic and listening to a lot of bossa nova. But I digress...""Once"" is a simple, but lovely film about a week in the lives of a busker (the charismatic Glen Hansard) and a Czech immigrant (Markéta Irglová, who was only 17 when the movie was made) - as they get to know each other and decide to make some music together. John Carney's movie is nothing more than a musical variation of the ""brief encounter"" sub-genre, but the great soundtrack - composed and interpreted by Hansard and Irglová themselves - and the charm of Dublin make it special. Romantic, bittersweet and beautiful, ""Once"" is a valentine to love, the art of making music, and Ireland itself. Highly recommended. 9/10.",,Anonymous,Music
When Your Mind's Made Up,"Greetings again from the darkness. Very disappointing movie offering little more than 90 minutes of music videos wrapped around a very weak story of attraction and chasing one's dreams. It has all been done much better numerous times.Glen Hansard sings his way through the film and I personally enjoy his music very much. Marketa Irglova, as his muse, is truly enchanting and a pleasure to look at and listen to. But I never bought the sparks between the two and certainly never saw any real bond other than the music.Cool music and a hand held camera make for a nice little home movie but should not be considered fine film making. A story and a script would go a long way in improving this one from musician/director John Carney.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sweet...,"The chemistry between the lead actors (two people I've never heard of) is what makes this film a treat to watch. Marketa Irglova (whoever she is and wherever she came from) has a screen presence without a doubt. The scene in the music store where she and her street musician acquaintance (Glen Hansard) first make music together is magical and worth the price of admission in and of itself.This is a sweet, poignant movie that is simple yet somehow captivating to watch. Maybe I'm just a sap for love stories, but the sound track that goes with this one is good enough to help carry the story and make us really care what happens to these people. Marketa and Glen make the music, and we are caught up in their moment.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Sweet but light on substance,"A man busks in a square in Dublin. By day he helps his father in a vacuum cleaner repair store and then spends his free time singing songs and playing guitar for tips. Most of the songs are his own compositions. Then he meets a young Czech woman who plays piano and writes her own songs. Musically, they are a perfect match. Romantically, there are impediments...I wanted to like this more than I eventually did. The plot was sweet and had heaps of potential. However, there is actually very little in the way of plot development or substance in the movie. It is short - 80 minutes or so - and then a large portion of the movie is taken up by music. Not only does this leave not much left for drama, the songs halt any momentum in the plot.In the end it felt like a short, padded with heaps of music.The music, almost entirely written by the two lead actors - Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, is okay, generally. Some pretty good songs in there, some quite weak.Good performances by Hansard and Irglova. There is a naturalness and sincerity to them, like watching a home movie, and the chemistry between them is spot-on. The rough-around-the-edges feel to the production helps too.In the end, a bit disappointing as, with a bit more work and less padding, this could have been turned into a truly wonderful relationship drama. Hard to dislike though - it is sweet and the ending is quite emotional.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Just playOnce,"Wow.That's it, one word reviewWow.This is the movie of the year for me right now, and quite possibly will stay that way until next January. With what has to be the simplest story I've seen on screen in a long time, it gets everything right. Once is a perfect little gem, both concise and powerful in a small but infinitely memorable package. Literally, a guy and a girl meet on a street corner in Dublin while he plays guitar for loose change. This chance encounter sets into motion a series of events that will bring kindred souls together with the strongest bond of love and friendship as they both try to reconcile with themselves and give their lost loves a second chance. You can't portray the unfathomable link love holds people together with better than this. These two are not lovers in the traditional sense, but neither will ever be able to forget the friendship they forged and how they helped pull each other out of their respective emotional ruts. They are lovers of the mind and soul.I'll admit that I am a huge sucker for brilliant music in film. Whether it be a musical like Moulin Rouge!, or a story that is enhanced by its soundtrack like The Royal Tenenbaums, or a visually stunning piece set to a haunting score as in The Fountain, I cannot get enough. The power that an assault on the eyes and ears simultaneously has can't be beat. This entire film is shot with hand-held camera, many times subversively, (for instance when our lead Guy and Girl go to a diner for lunch, the camera stays outside looking in, but you can tell the sound is coming from within by tape recorder as the background noise is very noticeable). The graininess and intimate quality shown by this style of film-making only makes you feel the realism that is pouring from each frame. These two actors are singers themselves and accomplished musicians. Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are truly and utterly remarkable. Their interactions are never forced or fabricated, this film feels like a behind the scenes documentary on the creation of an album.Once is definitely a musical above anything else. Half of this film takes place with songs either being sung in real time or being played over a montage sequence. Rather than use the words of the music to tell the story, writer/director John Carney uses them to set-up the emotional core and existence for our two leads. The words they sing are meaningful to their characters and how they react after uttering the lyrics can be both joyous and heartbreaking. He must be credited with having the guts to stage many musical moments in single takes, letting the performances and the music take over the scene. To go from the sheer happiness of laying down a track in the studio, to the sorrow-filled moment of Irglová unable to finish singing the song she wrote for her old love, back to the comradery of finishing their demo is a roller-coaster of emotions that sum up the whole film completely. There is not a misstep in sight. From the fateful meeting at our start to the bittersweet perfection that is the final scene, you don't get many opportunities to see original work like this in cinema anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
sing a long with the Frames,The first few minutes of the film Once tell the whole story and have humour and music and the possibility of love between Glen Hansard (Frames singer) playing the busker and the also unnamed Czech girl played by Marketa Irglov. Their possible relationship is cleverly uncertain. The relationship between Hansard and his Hoover Repairman Father is also charmingly balanced.But for me the music grates after a while. The story and the relationships are secondary to the music; if you like the singer you'll like the film; if earnest ardour is not your cuppa then the film will begin to taste like tepid tea.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Once? I could barely get past the first 30 minutes...,"Unlike the film, I won't waste anyone's time reading this if you don't agree. This movie has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I actually wanted to watch it, reading only the most recent reviews of this movie on this website. Then a friend watched it, and he said it was one of the greatest movies he has ever seen, and would watch it 100 times.I'm a big movie buff and watch a lot of independent films as well. So, I decided to rent this film to see it for myself.Big mistake...The movie seemed to ooze ""Indie Film"". Like they purposely hand-held the camera with a bit of shake, because using a tripod would be ""Hollywood"" and that wouldn't be right for an awesome Indie Film, such as this one...Also, the dialog was bad, and the constant ""F"" word was very, very taxing.Maintaining their ""Indie Theme"", they went for music which was very ""organic"". In other words, horrible.If you read the earlier, original reviews here, they are mostly negative. It's like hardcore fans found out about the negative reviews, and made a conscious effort to dispute them all.If you like this movie, that's fine. But if you are thinking about watching this, read ALL the reviews, then judge for yourself.But, if your looking for a movie with good production, then move along.

"See ""Once"" many more times than once.","Let's say you're watching a movie and you are loving it and at the end you cheer and tell yourself that ""this was an awesome movie!"" and then you realize, as the credits are rolling, that the 2 main characters are just called ""guy"" and ""girl""--their names are never mentioned the whole movie! That is the beauty of ""Once"", you are so drawn into the story and interplay between the guy and girl that you don't need names. Each character is defined by who they are to each other and those in their lives! Glen Hansard (singer of the Frames) does a great job of playing the heart-broken street busker/vacuum repair-man who pours his pain out in his music. The guy is so appealing and likable that, even when he has a momentary lapse of reason and acts like an arsehole, you forgive him because you know it is so out of character for him. Marketa Irglova plays ""the girl"" with a mix of winsome charm and worldly smarts that makes you like her from the instant that ""the guy"" (and the viewers) meet her. The girl is a czech concert pianist who is estranged from her husband and making a living in Dublin with the odd job here and there. She misses playing her piano, but cannot afford to buy one for herself, so she has to make do with playing occasionally in a club or in a music shop with a nice, understanding manager. When they meet, ""the guy"" is taking a break from his typical popular street-music set to perform his own music, a song that is both smart and soulful, but probably not popular enough to elicit any money. Their first conversation is funny and revealing, and serves to set the tone for their future interactions. There is a chemistry between them, but also a very sweet reluctance to go beyond the bounds of their relationship. ""Once"" is directed by John Carney (also of Frames fame) and shot by Tim Fleming, and the film style is mainly pseudo-documentary with a lot of hand-held shots and on-street settings that take place in the midst of the real world. I do have to say that Dublin and the seaside look great and there are more than a few great landscapes that will take your breath away. There are no big stars and only a few actors who might be recognizable by eagle-eyed Irish/UK movie buffs. ""Once"" is ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC, Glen and Marketa write their own songs and perform them in realistic settings, with nobody just breaking out into song in the middle of a scene, and without any cheesy dance scenes or spotlights. The soundtrack is catchy and soulful with some very heartfelt lyrics and easy to enjoy music. ""Once"" could almost be a documentary of how Glen (and Marketa, and Tim) hit it big; they are (were?) on tour in the US. John Carney does a masterful job of telling the story in a very appealing manner while avoiding a lot of the clichés that infest so many movies today. And yet, there are many familiar scenes where you almost know what is going to happen, but are still pleasantly surprised when it does. Especially touching for me was the scene where the guy plays his completed demo for his dad, nervously awaiting a verdict; great stuff! ""Once"" is the kind of movie that isn't widely publicized or splashed on the TV or radio at first, but then there is such acclaim from those who have seen it that pretty soon everybody is jumping on the bandwagon. 2007 is (so far) are really good year for movies, but I'd venture to day that ""Once"" is one of the best of the year. ""Once"" is worth see more than once. Tell your friends, neighbors and acquaintances to go see ""Once"", they will thank you for the tip ( and you will be able to go with them).",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A breath of fresh air,"It's hard to put into words why I loved this movie so much. Taking apart each element, there isn't much that you could say was really notable. It was a low budget movie, and it looked it. The sound was fair to middling. The camera was jerky. The acting was fair. And the music was decent.But what a movie does well, when it does it well, is to combine all these elements to make an experience that exceeds the sum of its parts. Every once in a while, a movie does that so well, that at the end, you realize that you saw something completely new - something that moved you - something that may have had elements you've seen elsewhere, but never quite in this way. That is what ""Once"" has accomplished.The story told in words is incredibly restrained. There is really not much drama to it. The drama, and the emotion is mostly in the songs. As the story fills out with this interplay of speaking and singing, we become a voyeur to a unlikely love story whose subtlety is a delight to behold. In this context the songs become beautiful and evocative and the actors become real people whose lives we care about well after we leave the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Impossibly Wonderful: 18/10.  Really!,"If this were just a movie about a gifted young musician getting his career started, with no deep feelings, no romance, it would rate 9/10 or 10/10. Every detail is nailed, nothing is clichéd, and the music is extraordinary.If this were just a romantic drama / comedy without music, it would rate 9/10. It would make a terrific double bill with _Before Sunset_, in fact. Like that film, there's not much to the story, but it's substantial nonetheless (especially emotionally) and it plays out unpredictably and true to life rather than following movie formula.It is, however, both of these things simultaneously, the two aspects not just seamlessly integrated but, in fact, one and the same.It's really pretty miraculous: a movie that moved me to tears and made me dance in my seat.

The story is very flat and contains no climax.Another problem is the thick Irish brogue, which is often indecipherable. I kept having to ask, ""What did s/he say?"". Subtitles would have been a welcome addition.And there I sat in the cinema waiting for it to finish, but I didn't walk out, because I never walked out on a movie before.

made me trip to Ireland,"Whenever I watch Once, I'm always moved by the beautiful musics, places, story, and so on. Most of all, the musics and Ireland described in Once are just incredible. I still remember the scenery and people of Once by listening to all musics in it. And this movie is the reason why i decided to go on a trip to Ireland. I visited Dublin and Killiney, and got inspired a lot. dropped by the spot where Glenn played guitar and first met Marketa. There were lots of musicians who are very passionate about musics. The street was full of joy and passion toward arts. The movie just describes the usual and real Ireland as it is. i think this is why Once got loved by a number of people from different countries.Oh and there is one thing i really want to mention. The Swell Season held a concert in Seoul around in 2009, and i was there. Before the concert starts, there was one korean independent band throwing their own small gig in front of the concert hall. It might be a kind of contribution toward the swell season, cause they played musics from Once. most people did not much care about them. Soon the concert started, and The Swell Season made their stages. After a few musics, they suddenly introduced the korean band to the audience and let them play on the real stage.. The Swell Season might have heard about them right before the concert and have been impressed, i guess. The band played its own song for a number of audiences, and the band looked so happy about it. And Last year, i found one article on a newspaper that the band made the independent film dealing with their amazing story about them having a chance to play on the real stage at The Swell Season concert, and the film was about to release.. I was stunned again with the thought that Once actually have inspired people all over the world. The Swell Season and Once probably got the band an 'once in a life time' experience. I must say that Once is truly beautiful because of that.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Best Film of the Year!,"Once:A movie that really is hard to put into words, but demonstrates that you don't need a multi- million dollar budget, A-list Hollywood actors/directors and special effects to make an incredible film. It does what any good movie should do, tells a story honestly and drops the viewer right into the action so as to feel you're there and care about what's happening.In this case it's the story of a young man and woman who wound't otherwise have anything in common other than she has a busted vacuum and he works at a vacuum repair shop, or so it seems, until you discover that these two ordinary poor people actually have the same passion for writing and playing music, neither having the capacity to do so in the way they would like. For him it's playing songs in streets and his tiny apartment for anyone who'll listen but no one who can understand. Enter a woman who hasn't been able to outlet her own musical creativity due to a young child and failing marriage and you get an explosion of musical and romantic creativity.John Carney's film is really an album on screen, and I have to mention that it is the music that drives the picture, but it's not a musical in the vain of people randomly breaking into song that drives normal people crazy (because no one ever does that in REAL LIFE) but he shows you where GREAT music really comes from and how it's created. Never once are you thinking 'Oh great there breaking into song again' because not only is the music incredible (mostly written by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) but it's given real time and they don't cut songs short but let you listen as if you were there in the store, studio, apartment, bus or wherever.The movie just has so many perfect little scenes and touches like the banker who wants to play them a song of his own when they ask for a loan, or the scene when they finally get to record and it's abundantly clear that no one knows what they're doing. Lastly I have to mention that it is the treatment of their interest/relationship that is the best part of the film. It's refreshing to see romance done right, without sex or over the top cheesy melodramatic dialog, the type of crap that only happens 'in the movies', here it doesn't need to be said because like true romance it's not spoken, it's felt. Carney avoids the horribly overwrought sexploitation of male/female relationships in modern film and actually respects these two characters enough to end the movie right, with the viewer walking away just like the two smitten musicians...wanting more of their music and of each other.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
true,"If you are interested in truth, you will love this film. Every note it strikes, is true. The characters have depth, but this depth comes from their mere existence. It is not contrived by the heaviness of a script. Watch their eyes. Watch how they move in the streets. Watch how they deal with their emotions, not as actors do, but as humans do.The music is not the genre I would normally be attracted to, but to see it created on the screen by two people in the process of getting to know one another, on a visceral level as well as a musical level, digs into your heart. The ending, where the Girl sits at her piano and looks out the window as the camera slowly pulls back, is so poignant it left me bereft.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A peaceful path to friendship and love,"The feeling that leaves the story is one of hope and love, there are characters that need help to take off, there are stories that need images to exist, and there is other music that gives them their own existence and strength, this movie we face all above, offers a beautiful story about honesty, courage and fighting spirit, but getting there takes time, time to build a story that at first the characters were lost in a strange city, struggling to survive, a city unlikely that talent is recognized, the end to see that life gives us opportunities to build solid ties with the less expected. Do not have a perfect argument, we can find several gaps that are critical to the development of the film and therefore may feel empty, but still must be seen from the perspective of true friendship, art, where it fails. It's nice to see some cool scenes with opaque colors such as life and where the development of the scene depends on how you get to her but what it can offer to the future of history, an interesting work of this totally unknown director in my country.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Perfect modernization of boy meets girl in Musical Universe,"I saw this film in a small theatre last evening (Friday Aug. 17) with 75-100 others and simply was enthralled. It is deserving of a severe rating for harsh and explicit language issues but the Restriction (""R"") is really missing the spirit of this highly commendable film made in 2006 to be targeted at a young adult audience. What the pop-rock music conveys is the skill and tunefulness and pride in one's creative juices versus the over-produced and technically questionable extreme loud general audience Pop music of recent years. The Dublin setting for ""Once"" comes across as noisy and authentic and the situations work well to link the songs in a way that other youth musicals gone to the movies (prime examples of which are ""Rent"" and ""High School Musical"") just don't ultimately succeed in persuading viewers of a certain sophistication. I am not quite keen of hearing to catch part of what happened in some of the sections of the movie where the dialect Irish accented people were given lines but the main character is easily understood and the female lead didn't always get her Czech subtitled. The Soundtrack for this film will likely sell lots and lots of copies later this year - - I am hoping that an Oscar nomination is in the realm of possibility for those music specialists in the Academy who are paying attention to small masterpieces like this 85-minute film!

Pleased that so many people liked it. But totally puzzled . . .,"I could never quite understand why Once got an Oscar for its music. But having missed it first time round, I thought it would be a nice relaxing Sunday night movie. Now although it has a certain magic if you don't find the music irritating, it's a big ""if."" As the music plays almost throughout.Bearded busker-of-no-name (incredibly talented), meets sweet little Big Issue babe-of-no-name (also incredibly talented). They bond incredibly over his incredibly mournful songs lamenting the incredible departure of his last incredible girlfriend. Can I tell you a secret? The film lies. She left to get some peace and quiet.Our opening few minutes has busker boy singing his heart out. You can predict the moment she will arrive almost to the second. The rest of the movie is fairly unpredictable (largely because nothing happens.) When you've seen the junkie try to steal his guitar case, you've seen the best bit. From there on, it's gooey painting-by-numbers that never gets properly started, much less finished.We fast-segue into urban folk-tale mode, the penniless pair putting together a band of street musicians and get a recording studio for a mere two thousand Euros. The acting is OK. But if it beat Enchanted on song, it sure loses out on fairy-tale. Script is appalling (The story is unbelievable and most dialogue is replaced with music. Or else Issue-babe staring dreamily at busker-boy, asking adoringly about his dismal past relationship.) The songs nearly put me off my tea, even if the couple are indeed quite talented. Mournful, melancholy brooding folksy is not my bag. Some short a capella and more relaxing songs in a Dublin folk club provide a more pleasurable interlude. But too short. Then there's some nice shots of the countryside near Dublin. And a believable chemistry between these upmarket bottom-of-the-heapers. If only she might snog him, I think, just to shut him up. But then his songs keep going in the background even when his mouth is occupied. Relentlessly. So such plot development seems pointless.As films of improbable musician meet-ups go, Once had me longing for the unpretentiously cheesy (and under-rated) Music and Lyrics (Hugh Grant). Which at least had the decency not to take itself so damn seriously.Busker boy is played by Glen Hansard of The Frames , so if you are fan, this is good value. If you're not, it's maybe worth downloading a track from the film before deciding. There's an awful lot of the same. The film could almost be called the cheapo album video. His voice has lots of gusto. Passing him on the subway, it would be refreshing. Stuck waiting for a bus with him in the background might be wearing.I am supposed to say it is sweet and tender and stuff like that. It's not. It's about two pathologically messed-up people who don't have the courage to move on. There's a nice bit of Irish charm that plays especially well in the States (From a budget of $150,000, it grossed almost $17 million). For me, I'm sad to say there was not enough charm for to dispel the queasiness.A brilliant low-budget effort, but the repetitive songs are not charismatic enough to warrant more than a 20 minute short. Once is cheesy love-on-the-poverty-line. Cut-price cheese, the sort with lots of milk and fat. Passing itself off as indie-made, quality pizza. As much as you can eat for 85 minutes. Please don't choke. I admit that many people must have enjoyed it, which I don't understand. Unless you like being sucked in by such mush, it doesn't seem worth leaving the pub for. You could be enjoying a nice pint of Guinness instead. Or two . . .",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Once: A Revolutionary Turn for Movie Musicals,"Campy and energetic are two words that come to mind when one thinks of musicals. ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Les Miserables"" fall into a different category. But who says a musical has to be cheesy? What if we can watch a musical and not leave the theater dancing, but thoroughly mesmerized and stunned? John Carney's 2006 Irish film ""Once"" proves that.Our two main characters are extremely natural. They don't even have names; they are labeled Guy and Girl. Guy is a street singer, banging away on his guitar and belting out ballads he composed himself. He only gets minimal attention, but then, Girl comes along and listens to his music. She is not from Ireland, but she is Czech, and Guy's music immediately grabs her. After fixing up Girl's crappy vacuum cleaner, they both wind up sitting down together and creating music. She plays piano, he plays guitar. But as they compose their songs, a love story begins to develop.Before we get to the main reason this movie is so amazing, let's look at the characters. Both Guy and Girl are leading flawed lives. Girl lives with her mother and her baby, her husband away while Guy is alone after being dumped by his girlfriend. When they sit down together, they're not just making music. They're making love. Their affection for one another simmers inside of them through their songs. Is their love admitted in words? No. But that's not really the point of the movie, or the music wouldn't have as much meaning.The soundtrack is the key to the film that all movie buffs are going to criticize after all the hype the movie has gotten over 6 years. The music is actually composed by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, our leads, and it is beautiful. None of these songs are toe-tappers, but aching, soul-touching ballads that get under the skin in the most positive way possible. The meeting of Guy and Girl results in ""Falling Slowly,"" a piano and guitar piece that is marvelous in its emotion and soothing in its sound. It perhaps may be one of the best love songs not on the radio, and that's a fact since the song got an Academy Award. The one that will really make you tear up is Irglova's heart-breaking tune ""The Hill."" The score demands to be heard.If I were to come up with one word to sum up ""Once"" overall, it would be simplicity. This entire movie is beautiful in its ways of being natural, from a story so simple to the undeniably improvised chemistry and appeal of the leading characters, played wonderfully and effortlessly by Hansard and Irglova. It has stood the test of time and is quickly starting to reach the mainstream. How: it's now a critically acclaimed Broadway musical. There's no doubting you're going to love this film. Such a classic and influential movie with such a triumphant soundtrack only gets made ""Once.""",10.0,Anonymous,Music
how can you say no to this?,"OK...i'll join the chorus - gladly.It's like this - this has happened over and over... i'm talking with a friend i haven't seen in a while and then we get to the part of the conversation - and we haven't even been talking about movies - where they ask me ""Have you seen 'Once'?"" And we both happily enter into that shared experience of talking about how 'great' it was. As if all anyone ever wants to do anymore is to agree for once that something in this world is 'great', which in the case of this movie i'm really thinking means 'pure', not infected by the cheapness or cynicism of so much out there.To accept this very sentimental movie requires a great suspension of cynicism. The only people I know who haven't liked this were unable to make this leap. But I always have the feeling they very badly wanted to.And the music is great. And the music scenes - the rehearsals, the recording session - are among the few i've seen that come close to the capturing those experiences in any true way.When the hell is this coming out on DVD? My friend Monica has gone nuts - crazy over a heartbreak and the only helpful thought I can come up with is I want her to see this movie and get out of herself for 85 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What an interesting movie.,"So, once is a movie about Glen Hansard and Marketa Irqlova characters (there kind of playing there self's)falling in love in a well done, well directed piece by John Carney, and an over all well acted film.The characters are very likable and kind of realistic people, that you really care for at the end of the movie.I wont spoil it, but the ending of the movie, I didn't like it, but I understand why they did it, and it didn't ruin the movie for me.The music really fits to the tone of the movie and you really are pushed into this movie experience.In the end, Once is a must see for Glen Hansard and/or Marketa Irqlova fans, and I would recommended to people who likes to watch musical.7/10 - a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Boy Meets Girland They Meet the Music in a Low Budget Charmer,"I doubt if I've seen a film more unabashedly romantic in the past five years, and this small-scale 2007 film is a musical to boot. Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attracts the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called ""Falling Slowly"", while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker's ""The Commitments"", but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Markéta Irglová has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglová provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Björk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock. But all in all, if you are a fan of any of the musicians mentioned and remain undemanding in cinematic story lines, chances are pretty good that you will enjoy this little film enormously.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Like the best songs,"The story of this little film, made on a budget of fifty quid, apparently, (most of the crew were doing it as a favour) is the stuff of film itself. One of the few prints made was playing at little cinemas round Ireland as a double bill with the two stars in performance, who then sold as many CDs as possible at each gig. This was 'big time'; until, at least, the film was shown at the Dublin Film Festival, and one of the Sundance Festival committee members happened to wander in while on holiday, saw it, fell for it, and took it home to Sundance, where it won a big gong. In a step further away from 'real life', the lead's band found themselves opening for Bob Dylan. I can imagine it: ""Uh, hi. This is Bob"" ""Bob who?""Glen Hansard, front man of The Frames for 17 years and 'the guitarist' in The Commitments was approached by Carney after a Frames gig in Dublin in 2005, with an idea about building a story around some songs. And in fact, the film remains true to that idea: a few times, the guy, instead of speaking to the girl, picks up his battered guitar and croons, or yells, an 'impromptu' verse. So in a way, it's as much a traditional musical as an Elvis vehicle. None of the gloss of Hollywood production in this, though, and everyone was playing a version of themselves with only the most rudimentary idea of a script, or a good deal of improvising. That can have its drawbacks: the two central characters are so natural that they sometimes seem to forget to include the camera when talking, so much of their dialogue is lost, especially in the street scenes.The Guy is working in his father's hoover repair shop and busking on the side, while nursing a broken heart after his girl ran off to London. The Girl is a Czech immigrant with a little girl, a mother to support and a fighting spirit. They are obviously wrong for each other, but their little orbits keep colliding, and they make beautiful music. Literally. Others play their parts - fellow musicians, the bank manager, but it's a tale of loving and longing which never really finishes. Just like the best songs. CLIFF HANLEY",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Trying NOT to like this movie,"I'm going to sound like a Grinch, but I'm trying NOT to like this movie, mostly because I'm worried about the people who WILL like it. I imagine a large number of these people to be either hipsters or near-hipsters, or at least people who listen to about 10 million pop songs per day and derive 85% of the meaning in their lives through these pop songs, think of life as more or less one big pop song, etc.However, I can't deny that this was a great, low-key movie. I thought it was a bit cloying in parts, as when the main female character is lugging the Hoover around by its hose. But at least such touches were few and brief. In fact, there were many artificial touches in this movie, but they were well masked.I also resent the kind of praise that thinks a movie is great because it is ""like life"" rather than like a movie, but again, I've got to admit this movie did a pretty good job of getting to that point.And, again in spite of myself, I think this movie was very good largely BECAUSE it tapped in to one of the most important things on the minds of most people in ""my"" ""generation""--pop music--sappy and infantile as it all is--in a way no other movie I have seen has managed to do.Good job, movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Utterly sweet, very low budget, honest and also very limited.","Once (2006)This has the best of cinema and worst of cinema. It's heartfelt and honest with a leading pair of actors who are as pure as snow in a world that is a blur around them. And it's also a slow tale filled with songs that start to sound the same and that's filmed without either panache or grit.I went into this intending to love it. An Irish busker in Dublin falls in love with an immigrant single mom, and these two people who really are suited for each other try to find a way to make it work. Or if not quite try, they see that they are living in a moment of magic together and want it to stick. This movie is about that magic. Brief, beautiful, idealistic, and filled with some really good singing and songwriting.That's what people love about this movie and why it has such a good following (and rating, if you pay attention to the starts). Watch it on that basis.If you are looking at the film at all as a work of art, as a piece of collaboration between writer, actor, photographer, director, and so on, you're bound to feel it coming up short and shorter. As much as you love the main guy's utter kindness--a profoundly great model of kindness--you notice that things drag a bit, and that a few clichés appear, like the moment on the beach, meant to be lyrical happiness and it reads as meaning to be more than really conveying. And that songs start to be similar, and are even repeated.On some level this is a huge music video, because most (most!) of the movie is made of songs set to various situations, and new situations are brought in so that new songs (or old ones) can be performed. It's easy to love the music but also get enough of it.Another way to weigh all this out is to compare to a movie I saw recently at a festival, an equally low budget affair about a singer-songwriter looking for love and meaning, ""I Am Not a Hipster."" Now that is a truly inspired affair: complex, beautifully envisioned, off the beaten track. None of those descriptions apply to ""Once.""But then, ""Once"" has one of the best bittersweet endings I've seen. It's the last five minutes that will mean the most. And maybe seem familiar, those things that mean so much that you don't quite keep. Except in your heart forever.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

My main drawcard for myself was the music, only to find that the story is touching, real and honest.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The best modern music film,"This independent Irish film is an extraordinary achievement. The performances, the direction and especially the musical score are amazing. One of the best things about the film was that it felt very real. It portrays reality as it is without over-dramatization. This realistic tone along with the moving performances of both lead actors make the audience relate to the characters and their own personal struggles.What I liked the most about the film was the musical score. It's very beautiful and it fits perfectly to the movie. Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová make a great duo. Their musical performances transmit what the characters are feeling in a very sincere way. It doesn't feel forced like in other similar music films. The cinematography is very far from perfect. Most shots have a home-made style. In most films I would criticize this, but in this one it fits the plot and tone perfectly. The cinematography compliments the realistic tone of the movie to the point it doesn't feel like a movie anymore and you completely get immersed in the plot.Everything in this movie (the performances, the direction, cinematography, music and plot) fits together perfectly and sets the mood for the story. There are quite a few moving moments in the film that almost everyone can identify with. And the ending is very real, relatable; in my opinion, it's perfect. It leaves you wanting for more, but at the same it leaves you satisfied.Once is a beautiful film that mirrors real life along with its ups and downs almost perfectly. I give it a 10/10 and would recommend it for everyone. Even if you don't like this type of movies you will love the musical score and performances by both the lead actors. This movie is a proof that you don't need a big budget to make an extraordinary film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Subtle, Delicate, Real","I admit that I saw the stage musical before renting the movie. They are both so touching and so human. The relationship that develops between the young street musician and the pretty Czech girl pulls us along with a velvet rope. It is cinematically stunning. I loved watching the two of them walking down the street, she pulling her ""Hoover"" which he fixes for her. It's like a puppy on a leash. The charm of their interaction and ultimate love must face the factors of her fragile marriage and her effort to maintain a life for her daughter and her ""mudder."" He is on the verge of having success with his songwriting and performing and he must weigh that against pursuing his hopes for becoming a part of his life. It's sad but positive; loving and real. The acting is superb as they tussle with the hand they've been dealt. At no time does it become maudlin or predictable. Also, the music is striking and often sad. This is a true sleeper of a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not as brilliant as the lavish praise would suggest but still natural, charming and refreshingly free of sentiment","In Dublin, a guy works in his father's vacuum-cleaner repair shop while also pursuing his musical aspirations by busking on the streets. Late one night he meets an immigrant girl selling the Big Issue who likes his songs but also has a vacuum cleaner that needs fixing. He helps her out and gets to known her, finding she has talent on the piano as well. He has an girlfriend that has recently moved to London without him, while the girl has a husband back in Czechoslovakia and a young child with her in Dublin. While she helps him musically look to achieve his dreams, something more intimate and personal may or may not be developing between them.I first heard of this film when it showed up on various ""best of the year"" lists and added it to my rental list and got it posted to me shortly after the film won the Oscar for best song. The first thing that I should say that is that it is my opinion that this film has been overly praised  this is not a criticism of the film but rather a defence, because the hype works against this film being what it is. That is to say, Once is a very low budget film that has it strength in the general charm and sweetness but it is not, to my mind, a fantastic film and certainly its inclusion on IMDb's top 250 just further serves to take away any remaining relevance I give to that list.Narratively the film is simple as it mostly trades on the songs and characters, with the love story very much unspoken and on the edges of the picture all the time. In regards specific actions there are few and the characters don't develop much beyond where they are shortly after they are introduced at the start of the film. What tends to hook the audience (and me) is the way that the film is so raw, natural and charming and, in this way, it flies in the face of many mainstream romances with their contrived stories and sickly sentimentality. This ""breath of fresh air"" quality helps it a great deal and the Irish charm does easily appeal to many audience sectors I believe, because some of their work is done beforehand with their idealised view of artists within that country! That shouldn't take anything away from Hansard and Irglová, both of whom are natural and convincing as people  although the slight downside of this is that Hansard's ""Guy"" is a bit of a jerk early on, while it can be painful to see them never say what is in the background. Carney's direction of his script is solid; OK it is all very shaky and low-budget but it fits the material while also being admirable for making the film despite the challenges.Overall then, this is a charming little modern love story that is refreshingly natural and free of sentiment. It is not perfect and it won't knock you off your feet in the way that many reviews may lead you to believe but it is certainly a lovely little film that is warm, musical and charming.",,Anonymous,Music
Good film,"I saw this at Sundance 2007, and was thrilled to see the director and the two stars of the film at our screening in Salt Lake City. What a treat! I must say 2007 has been a great year; of the 8 movies I have screened so far, 6 of them have had members of the crew or cast there to answer our questions. What a great experience this has been. Once is a movie about a street singer in Ireland. He hasn't had much success, but his luck changes when he meets a beautiful Czech who happens to have a great deal of talent as well. The two of them write songs together and this movie tells the story of their journey to make a CD. The music was not my particular favorite genre of music, but the two of them have quite a bit of talent and I enjoyed the music anyway. I recommend this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The musical for people who don't like musicals,"In 2007 a small, indie film from Ireland was able to dominate the critical world, and from a small budget made $20 Million worldwide. It was so successful in the critical world that it was in the top 10 best films of 2007 lists. It has a high rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.Once is a love story between ""Guy"" (Glen Hansard), a busker on the streets of Dublin, and ""Girl"" (Markéta Irglová), a flower seller from the Czech Republic. The two have an instead connection when ""Guy"" plays his own songs and ""Girl"" asks him about them. They make beautiful music together and ""Girl"" encourages ""Guy"" to make a professional demo and move to London to re-connect with his ex-girlfriend. The two are drawn closer when performing music, but both have complex pasts.What must have made this film a success is it's quirky spirit, having a mix of drama and wit. It attempts to be the musical for people who do not like musicals. People do not just burst into song and the music has a folk/indie sound to it. The director John Carney keeps a low-key tone throughout. The pacing is slow and the feel is natural. The music comes out naturally and sounds like something good songwriters would write. Carney keeps characters down to a minimum, with the focus being on ""Guy"" and ""Girl"". He wanted to make it as a character pieces and the characters are fully drawn out. This is a down to earth film. Carney even makes Dublin a character in his film, showing that Dublin is a lovely historical city with a charming character to match many European cities. The song too are very memorable and people who like good singer-songwriters will enjoy them.The acting from the main two actors is very good. They are believable and both offer a low-key, organic performances. This is even more impressive because there are not professional actors, and Carney does get a lot out of them. They are professional singers and their ability shines through.Despites the positives involving the direction and the acting, the film itself was a hollow and felt like it was lacking a spark. They was not much of a drive in its story and made a film a little disengaging at times.But overall a worthy film with a charming character, but not everyone will like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Love that it is shot in a way that looks low budget, it actually feeds into what is simple and beautiful about the film.. genius to not try to compete with the more polished high budgeted films, as it is the music and the rawness that makes this film stand out.

Once is Two Much,"The Guy (Glen Hansard, lead singer of The Frames) is a street musician who lives with his father and sings on a mostly empty Grafton Street in Dublin after working his day job repairing vacuum cleaners. Outwardly cheerful, underneath he still pines for the girlfriend (Marcella Plunkett) who left him and moved to London and his plaintive songs speak about lost love and regret. His performance attracts a street punk who makes off with his collection but also beckons a young Czech immigrant known only as The Girl (Marketa Irglova) who works as a flower seller and they slowly develop a friendship that deepens when he discovers that she is also an accomplished musician.John Carney's ""Once"" has charm written all over it and has received many accolades from critics who have called it ""simple and unpretentious"", ""a perfect film"" and ""enchanting"". Unfortunately, it did not win me over completely. To be fair, part of the problem may have been the shrill sound system in the old theater in which I saw the film. However, in a film that is presumably about the struggles of young musicians, the songs are so perfectly realized and so professionally performed that the entire premise felt very contrived.Since he repairs Hoover vacuum cleaners, of course, she just happens to have one in need of repair which she drags down the street as an excuse to meet up again with the singer. When they take the bus to have it repaired, he sings to her that he is a ""broken-hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy"" and she learns a bit about his troubles in the past. In their budding relationship, she is the pursuer and he the pursued but when he asks her to stay the night, she backs off and we soon learn that she also has a back story. Recently separated from her husband who is in the Czech Republic, she lives with her mother and has a young daughter, clinging to the hope that her marriage can be revived.The songs, mainly written by Irglova and Hansard and taken from Hansard's solo album ""The Swell Season"", are the centerpiece of the film and they are sung with passion. One of the nicest scenes in the film takes place at Walton's music store where they join together in a sweet song called ""Falling Slowly"", realizing for the first time that they could make beautiful music together. Astonishingly, they qualify for a bank loan to finance a studio recording of their music because the Credit Manager is a would-be singer and because rejection is not part of the script. With their newfound cash, they rent an expensive studio for the weekend, pick up some additional musicians who just happen to be playing on the same street and throw together a professionally accomplished CD.It all goes very smoothly, no trial and error, ups and downs, or rejection slips. While the relationship does have its moments of charm, what could have been a story that had something new to say about the immigrant experience or the difficulties of the creative process ends up being little more than an extended music video (Carney calls it a ""video album""), almost a promo for the sincere but banal soundtrack. And with her barely discernible Czech accent and his thick Irish brogue, much of the film left me wishing for English subtitles. As much as I was geared to love at first sight, I'm afraid that once is enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

How can Glen Hansard get to be 40 odd and think that these songs are acceptable output from an adult.Actually was the film written by an adult?I honestly thought that somebody was having laugh at my expense.

This ain't no love story,"I had heard the song ""Falling Slowly"" after it won the Oscar for Original Song, and my mind was blown, but I didn't put much faith into the movie based on music. I waited until last week, March 2011, to see it, but I have now fallen madly in love with everything about it, right down to the musicians who aren't expected to act as well as these two did.The movie is about an Irish busker who meets a girl from the Czech Rep. and they discover each other's talent for music, as they begin to write songs together. As they write these songs, we discover a wider understanding of how their relationship differs from so many other clichéd movies.You look at the cover, and the first thing you think is a couple who meet and bond over music, and eventually strike up a sexual relationship. If you thought the first thing, you're spot on. If you agree with the statement after that then, my friend, you're at a major loss. This ain't no love story, this a story about music, which made it so much deeper than it should have been. We delve into the despair of both characters, and the life they reignite in themselves with every song they write together. In countless movies such as the likes of the recent ""Country Strong"", the movies use the musical part of it to waltz their way into the twisted love of so many of the characters, making the music become very secondary.I'll tell you this much, if you're a Jason Mraz, Joshua Radin, Mumford & Sons kind of person, then this is the film for you, for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Heartwarming and Honest,"Authentic characters that I directly fell in love with, right with the opening sequence: It's so fresh and pleasing to see an Irish guy and a Czech girl sparkle up in their unexited but at the same time very deep chemistry.

I've never had more sympathies for musicians then for these modest drummers and guitarists from the street. This peaks in the scene when they do the »car-test« of their own songs after their recording session.
Production Design and lighting is so to say non existent which at some rare moments let's it look like a cheesy documentary, but mostly this style helps the film to achieve it's high level of honesty, authenticity and modesty which I really enjoyed, especially after having watched so many standard musicals.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Yes, it's vaguely heart-warming. However, there are far better films out there and this film provides little insight into love or the human condition and commits one of the worst crimes of all  it's dull.Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova produce two adept performances, whilst their songs are of a high quality and the film itself clearly has its heart in the right place. But it just doesn't work. The pace is glacial, with much of the romantic suspense being done away with in the opening half-hour. In the end it feels like an extended music video and is hardly cinematic.Pleasant as far as it goes, but there really are better things to do with your time and far greater films that deal with the subject of unrequited love.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

The pleasures were modest, and yet one misses the chance of further moments with such ordinary people instantly. Initially, as I watched, I was selecting places the conflict would come from and casting new faces as the villain... but this movie dispenses with villains, explosions, chases, false conflicts, false endings; underscoring what tired contrivances they are. It also dismisses iPods, style, attitude, bitchiness, conspicuous consumption... All of this crap proves to be extraneous. Reality sells itself. Human beings are back, front and center. How is it that Lars von Triers reductivist ""Dogme 95"" rules, which should result in simple, direct movies like this, instead yield his last 5 pieces of phony, over-mannered, art-schlock.As soon as I was done I wanted to review certain scenes. The standard sincere contemporary Irish emo ballad (caterwauling) and the Irish tendency for rooms full of drunken people to break into awful songs, are not my cup of tea but it barely matters. The movie is very small and honest. Try pitching that to Hollywood.You: ""I'd like to make a nice, small, honest movie""Hollywood: ""That's not what we do""The supportive Irish family (There IS such a thing?), supportive friends, & strangers seem atypical to this Irish American. Where are the miserable, envious relatives undercutting your every move with crippling, defeatist remarks and guilt? (yuck yuck) I would love to see this movie win a boatload of Oscars to show Hollywood another, less grotesque, way to proceed. Unfortunately with the writers strike, the Oscars are likely to be canceled.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Heart poured out all over,"I was given a recommendation by a friend to watch this movie. It was playing at the local Angelika, which I always like going to. I have seen quite a few foreign movies in that theatre and love it for the quality of movies they show almost always and undoubtedly this stands out for its impact it had on me. Its the level at which the movie is able to connect to you. Very deep, intense, thoughtful piece of art and spiritual at the same time and thats what makes it so different. I read it in one of the fact-o-files about the movie that the songs in the movie were intended to replace the need for lengthy dialogues. The feeling and the spirit and the positioning of the songs is able to do not just right, it takes it to a sublime level. Actually the movie lets you loose and at a certain time you feel convinced that for whatever reasons this movie is at a different plane and the set rules can very politely be ignored for making a comparison. I believe this is about the heart poured out and if you see this angle you will be able to leave aside all the critical nuances which one is quite often obliged to weigh a movie on. The songs are like meditation, raising the soul and you seem to get lost in them and I have listened to them every now and then and the impact keeps on growing. Definitely enjoyable and not just an ordinary musical. Not to be misunderstood as a chick flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Watch this on DVD not in a cinema,"I saw this movie at the Ghent film festival, from the second row on a huge screen and it was a pretty nauseating experience. The dogma-style hand-held-camera filming meant that the shot was NEVER steady and the lighting was very poor. Several times I had to close my eyes not to become sick. On a TV-screen you won't have this problem of course. Only the very last scene was shot differently and almost felt like out of place.As such the film was entertaining and Mirketa Irglova is charming but that's about it. I don't understand the high ratings.After the film the main actors performed three songs life in the cinema. It was a welcome relief to see them steady - not shaking, but I was surprised how shy they were. Not once did Miss Irglova look at the audience, even not when she was performed solo and the brought the cinema to its feet.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Story so Charming, You'll Want to Show it to your Grandma","Films don't have to be huge budget to be entertaining, in fact sometimes the creativity required to make a film with a limited budget leads to some great script writing, great acting and ultimately great story telling.'Once' is one such example; shot on about £150,000 and in only 17 days it is the wonderful music of Glen Hansard, Markéta Irglová and the other musicians involved. Their beautiful melodies and lyrical magic create a charming and warm atmosphere which adds to an enchanting story.The music and reality of the subject will leave you feeling a part of the story, a story so simple and charming that you want to take it home and show it to your Grandma.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Its strength is also its weakness,"This low-budget film about a Dublin street musician who connects with a young Czech woman has much to recommend it. The guy and girl (they are never given names) share an appreciation for music; the guy is much more attuned to pop music whereas the girl has a broader appreciation. All things being equal she tends toward playing classical piano, but she bonds with the guy to the extent of working jointly with him on pop compositions and performances.The two protagonists are of meager means, so I guess it is fitting that the filming is lacking in high-end production values. Indeed much of the film has the effect of home video footage. This is all well and good, but the poor lighting and hand-held camera work ultimately wore on me. There are some sparks of creativity, particularly in the scenes where the guy flashes back on memories of a previous girlfriend and in the very final scene, but overall the filming is pedestrian.The tentative and delicate nature of the relationship that develops between the guy and girl is touching. The vagaries of human interactions are illustrated well and the ending seemed real to me.I admired the sincerity and determination of the performers - their devotion to their craft came across strongly. Most of this movie consists of performances. And that was the most difficult obstacle to my truly bonding with this movie - I didn't like the music. It struck me as amateurish and something I would not seek out. If you like the music, then this movie will most likely have a stronger appeal to you than it did for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Simple Film, better as a short.","I went to the theater on a recommendation from a friend with my musician boyfriend. As we were waiting in line to get, the people exiting were smiling and laughing, an indication of a good movie.The storyline was sweet and simple and the hoover stuff was great, but all in all I wasn't that interested. Could be because I live the life that is was representing. Could be because of all the hype. Could be because I am conditioned to want more than one idea presented in a feature length film.My boyfriend wanted to leave in the middle, but I wanted to get to the part the made the audience smile and laugh as they were leaving and I knew I could not sit through the first half again to get to the end. After sitting through the movie, it would have been no loss to leave in the middle. This is a nice movie, but should have been capped at 30 minutes.The only explanation that I can come up with for the success of Once is that people are hungry. They are sick of Ocean's 20 and Spiderman 10 and want something from the heart, even if it is a little drony with OK music.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is about 2 young people who have a romantic relationship through music.,"I just finished watching this movie with my mom. I loved it, but she didn't. I recommend you watch this movie alone or with your girlfriend or boyfriend. If you do so I guarantee you will enjoy it. This heartwarming musical is spectacular, with beautiful songs. I'm a 14, and I watch comedies and if I enjoyed a romantic, yet sad movie, you will definitely enjoy it.I rate this a definite 10 out of 10 due to it's music and filming. Some of the music in this movie is exciting and all of them were filled with just the right amount of emotion.

Simple like the best things in life,"I loved this movie. I have read a critic in a local newspaper that got me curious to see it. The main characters are really good and the actress who plays ""girl"" is adorable. She has this way of talking and just being her that is very charismatic. The music is great and I am buying the soundtrack...It is impressive to see sort of a musical on these days that is not cliché or cheesy. I like the simplicity of the movie and how the story flows. The acting is very captivating and the screenplay keeps your attention to what is going to happen next. Interesting to see how two people can be ""perfect"" for each other at a particular moment in their lives but not pursue anything. It's a love story of some how platonic love yet beautiful.

Maybe it was the first time I watched this movie, or maybe it was because of all the life I've lived since seeing this for the first time. I honestly couldn't tell you.It reminded me of the time in my life where my heart and soul felt free of constraints. Sharing experiences with someone who made me feel as if nothing else mattered in the world.

"A highly natural, honest and charming romantic drama","Director/writer John Carney has crafted an exceptional film with ""Once"". Simply put: ""Once"" feels real.Photographed in and around Dublin, Ireland, on a low budget, using hand held cameras, the film has a private documentary look and feel to it. ""Once"" is loaded with naturalness, sincerity, spontaneity, honesty and charm. It's one of the best films of the decade, outperforming most big budget Hollywood films with famous actors. This film is evidence that an inspired director and writer, are far more important to the success of a film, than the traditional Hollywood formula of big budgets and famous actors. By success, my meaning is, the film tells it's story very convincingly.The story concerns a chance encounter between two musicians and follows them on their eventful weekend that follows. The two main character, identified only as guy and girl, are portrayed by two real life musicians. ""Once"" contains some genuinely beautiful original music and songs.For me, there are really three key scenes, that help lift this film from lesser efforts of the genre. One, is the performance of the beautiful song ""Falling Slowly"" in the music store. Second, has the girl walking home at night with fresh batteries, listening to and singing to one of the guy's songs on the portable CD player he gave her. Third, would be the guy creating a new guitar song, while watching home movies of his ex- love, for inspiration. The ending of the film is brave for this genre and fits perfectly with the story telling style of the film.Though deserving of more than one Academy Award nomination, ""Once"" is the not the usual choice of Academy voters (big budget, famous actors, epic story) for Best Picture.About the R rating for the film. The f-word is used throughout the film., however, it's never used in a vulgar, aggressive or insulting manner. It's obviously the common language style of the common people portrayed in the film. Considering the context of the story and characters, I believe an R rating is unjustified. That's unfortunate for a low budget film like this, which needs to play in as many theaters as possible. R rated films earn less than PG or PG-13 films.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
not touching,"Several interesting comments on this film have already remarked many of the good things you can get from this film. Something to do with the mood of the suggested love story, the power of its simplicity, indeed of the simplicity of the whole production, from acting to sets. The story moves you, because you can relate to it and there are not sophisticated apparent devices nor worn out conventions that these guys use to get to us. So this is ultimately a direct honest film. It's not real, and while in Linklater's similar experiments one might wonder whether the film is sprinkling out of real life, here the musical insertions don't allow you to think so. But this is incredibly direct and honest storytelling, and that's rare and rewarding.There are a few things worth noticing beyond that. One has to do with the love relation we see on screen. We know it to be implicit, and never assumed all the way. Different languages. The closest we get to an effective conventional date relation is when the girl assumes her love in Czech, a language the boy doesn't understand, and which the filmmakers assume the majority of the spectators won't either. That's the sublimation of the story, more than any musical number, it's that moment. On the other end of the stick, we have the boy's attempt at a one night stand. The good thing is how the two different personalities, cultural differences, and postures, are mirrored in their musical backgrounds, and how that merges on screen. The love is in the music, is in what they come up with, how they work around their artistic differences towards a common end. This is truly a beautiful concept. That's why it was so important that the facts of the story didn't stop you to appreciate the beauty of the underlying concept. So powerful that these actors (who actually created the songs!) became lovers off screen, in real life. This is a very good case of an on screen relation: it hasn't happened yet, we see it coming, we are witnesses to it.Dublin is a witness as well, it's a great place to film, one where suitably music is an important wheel in its spiritual routine. The sense of place is strong and well achieved here, despite relatively average production values.The best films, indeed the best art is that connected to powerful ideas, the kind that runs underneath your skin. This is such a film, if the music was truly powerful instead of merely engaging, this might have proved an explosive experience.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Music
"Not exactly my taste, so maybe an unfair score.","A picture that received some rave reviews from the critics and well loved by so many. Set in Dublin and concerns a busker who falls for an Eastern European Immigrant.

The music was sound and enjoyable though.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Unique Musical Expression of Relationship with deep meaning,"Usually I don't write reviews, I often feel that my expression in words won't demonstrate my real emotional expression from the movie.But this time I feel more brave to do that. SPOILERS!People talk of ""Once"" as film, that without it's music is nothing special. For them the story is so unimportant that they just enjoyed the music and moved on with their lives (as we often do with films).But I feel that those are totally missing the point. Sure, the music in this film is 99% of it's charm, appeal and enjoyment. But I found the background story of music much more meaningful and touching than just ""background"".The writer and director John Carney chose to not name the main characters and they are called The Guy and The Girl. I think it's a brilliant and meaningful choice. ""Once"" is about specific period in life. It's a period when something happened in past and now you're just waiting, but you are so passive. You curse the past, you act bitterly and don't think about the future. Maybe because you're afraid, maybe because you're ignoring the life and maybe you just wait for someone to save you.The Guy and The Girl are exactly those persons. Their meeting is touching because of the change they both can make, one thanks to other.The music in this film is symbolizes their wish and will, their possibility of finding the right person for them but it turns out that they found much more than love. Love in this film is some kind of a miss, that what brings us to tears in this movie. But it's a miss that gives birth to become active, to change, to do something. The Guy decides to go to London, for his music, for his girl, for the hope. The Girl gives chance for her family life, for her husband, for stability.The fact that Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are not professional actors is a great gift and bonus for the film. They are just like every one of us, guys and girls who know what it's like to experience love as a miss, but finding a person who right on time for ""this kind of a period"".This film stayed with me for long, not just because of the power of music in this film, but because it's really touching every one of us when we can relate to a certain period of life, when we need someone to make a change and believe. Even if it's love that we may sacrify..Brilliant. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Raw,"If you are the type of a person to watch movie to judge beautiful cinematography or look for masterful direction, don't look here. Thats not the only problem with the movie, editing is choppy, the camera setup is boring, blocking is very simple, and it is clear that the stars of the movie Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are not professional actors. So why does this film work so well? Perhaps it's because of the soundtrack recorded by the two stars. Their voices compliment each other perfectly in their tunes and it fits the story. The rough edginess of Hansard's voice blends with the soothing nature of Irglova's. However; if only the songs are what makes ""Once"" what it is, it would've not have gotten the accolades, awards, and nominations from variety of sources which made me be interested in the movie. So once again, why does this film work? Because of it's mistakes. Once is a romance, and usually movie industry does a poor job in conveying what romance really is. In movies love is too perfect, and beauty is above the truth. In here love is not beautiful, it's awkward, choppy, and unprofessional, that's why it works. The movie does not lose anything because of it's lacklustre qualities, in fact it gains something which many Hollywood movie can't even create, rawness. I heard that the director's next movie ""Begin Again"" with a similar premise but a bigger budget did not fare as well. While I haven't seen the movie yet (and would love to compare those movies) I assume that the bigger budget got rid of the rawness prominent in ""Once.""As a film, it lacks a lot. If you show this to your film professor, they will undoubtedly discredit the movie. However; we should not focus on it's lack of cinema techniques and look at what the movie revealed to us.

great movie...not a typical musical,"I really enjoyed this film. I'm generally not that big a fan of musicals, but to me this was less of a musical and more a film where the soundtrack was turned way up. It really helped progress the movie; the music was good, not corny like typical musical music. It was interesting to see the writing process and the musicians jam out with each other. I think it really portrayed the raw emotions of loneliness and how amazing it is to just find a kindred spirit. Though the leads really had no acting experience, I thought they were great. They had great chemistry; their voices blended so well together in the music. I like the realism in the story. I think the music combined with a simple yet relateable story really makes this film special and definitely worth watching.

Sure the movie was made on a very low budget but i would still rather watch a well made movie that cost more than this one. Every scene in the movie ended up in the actors playing and/or singing worthless dull music. Maybe it's just not my kind of music since i couldn't enjoy it at all. Maybe if you're a fanatic of dull romantic music this movie would be great but i can't possibly believe almost all of the people making reviews here are such fanatics so i must have missed something very important that would have made the movie better but the impression i got is bad music, low brightness and overall a lame cliché story.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"A modern-day musical, and so much more!","John Carney has amazed the entire world with this low budget but high quality indie film. Set in Dublin, tells the story of a ""guy"" (Irish singer Glen Hansard) stuck in everyday routine in his family business who escapes from it by playing by nights in the streets of Dublin, and a ""girl"" (Czech musician Markéta Irglová) who struggles with everyday life like an immigrant in Ireland, yet has a talented gift for Piano music. Together, they'll be connected through their art, and realize how music changes the way they see each other, their own lives and the dreams -big or small- they want to accomplish.Once is an honest, simple, but amazing film. Shot with two digital cameras and with a budget lower than 100000 euros, the direction is powerful yet soft, and goes perfect with the story: close-up shots combined with other general views of the city, with a shivered touch that makes it more interesting, familiar and intimate, as well as in the scenes where the family life of the girl is shown.A movie full of music, rhythm and romance, that yet has that powerful and calmed silence that makes it more interesting. Such a wonderful surprise, the fact that the movie's songs were written by the two leads, and the main theme ""Faillins slowly"" was awarded by the American Academy with an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow,"I came across ""Once"" at Blockbuster while browsing through the selections, and vaguely remembered reading some positive reviews on it. So, ""28 Weeks Later"" went back on the shelf, and ""Once"" replaced it in my hand. I'd just seen ""Halloween"" (the 2007 version), and wasn't really in the mood for another gorefest immediately afterward anyway (not that there's anything wrong with a good gorefest). When I got home, I checked out the reviews for ""Once"" on IMDb, and though pleased to see the high rating, was also prepared for a bit of disappointment, as it is extremely rare that a well-rated movie meets my expectations. As the ending credits for ""Once"" rolled, I sat mesmerized. It was absolutely fantastic. The characters seemed so real that you almost felt like you were watching a documentary. This movie is not a musical in the usual sense, as the characters do not sing dialog to one another, but it is certainly full of music. The story is not a unique one, but it is well-told and very believable. While most out here obviously enjoyed the film, I do think those who do not like the music may not, so there will definitely be an audience of detractors. Most of us, apparently, are not among them, and I urge you to find out where you stand for yourself. If you hate the song in the music store (which happens early-on), then you may not want to sit through the rest of ""Once,"" but if that song leaves you wanting to hear more, you're in for a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

After watching this film, I can't get these songs out of my head. These lyrics are wonderful, appeal very strong feeling and express heartrending sorrow about love. Not only songs but also singers' voices are so nice. They have painfully sad singing voice but they also have strong and attractive voice. This story is not full of happiness, it always has something feel sad. However, after watching this film, I feel warm-heart feeling. I really recommend you watch this film from the bottom of my heart. I wonder why this film is not popular in Japan.

Plague! Famine! Cholera! Santa Tortured On screen! 666!,"If you've heard of ""Once,"" you know it got great reviews. I'm here to tell you that those reviewers were on the payroll of a multinational corporation with a devious plan for separating you from your money.What is ""Once,"" really? Plague! Famine! Cholera! Santa Tortured On screen! 666! Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating, but, I've got to tell you, given that I just watched ""Once,"" I wish I had watched Santa Claus tortured on screen, and I *love* Santa Claus, and am firmly opposed to torture, in most instances. I'd make an exception for the makers of this film.""Once"" is the story of a middle-aged, potato-faced Irishman with transparent eyebrows and buggy eyes who lives with his father, can't sustain a relationship, and whines/shouts  in lieu of a singing voice -- embarrassingly sophomoric, self-absorbed, simply bad singer-songwriter confessionals on Dublin sidewalks. Every lyric in this movie could have been copied, without editing, from the diary of that androgynous kid you knew in high school who had skin like a girl and who cried, but who was actually a guy. Lonely girls would think he was the most sensitive, special boy on the planet, because he stood on the sidelines during gym class, but he was actually a jerk.The male man character  he has no name  giving characters names is so Hollywood! -- picks up a Czech girl who looks about 12. The actress was 17. The Irish guy was 36. If that's attractive to you, chances are you are an aging singer-songwriter looking for a teen girl who can really understand you and your deep, sensitive heart. Think that they might make a film about a 36 year old MALE potato-faced Irish singer-songwriter with transparent eyebrows who picks up a 36 year old FEMALE potato-faced Irish singer-songwriter? Naïve you.The Czech girl mutters and slurs  she's trying to do a Czech accent. The actress, who was born in the Czech Republic, actually grew up in Ireland, and cannot imitate a genuine Czech accent  that's why she mutters and slurs. One would think that an ability to produce a Czech accent would be the entry level skill for the part of a Czech girl with a Czech accent. The director said that many viewers told him that they didn't care that they could not understand the dialogue. He thought that they were complimenting him.Given the pointless, dreary, poorly lit, shaky images, the director was a toddler to whose diaper a camera had been strapped. Let us hope that this innovation is not picked up by other filmmakers.Nothing else happens. The guy with the transparent eyebrows shouts out self-absorbed singer songwriter songs about how hard and painful his life is and how sensitive his heart is. The teenage girl slurs her words and is the on-camera teenage girl desired by a man twenty years her senior. The characters use the ""F"" word repeatedly. AND THAT IS ALL THAT HAPPENS.

I liked the relationship between father and son and with mother and daughter, I thought those parallels were good writing. The scene with the vacuum was so funny and cute. I think this is one of the best films of the year. Everyone should go see it. It's not flashy it's just real and it leaves you feeling great it's definitely worth seeing!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I flippin' love this film!,"Just goes to show that you don't need a huge budget to make a good film. A couple people said they'd seen it an enjoyed it. Now this film is classed as a musical and as a rule I hate most musicals as most people don't break into song at any given chance! However, this film is not like that as every song is incidental and perfect for what is going on. This film is quite simply one of the best films I've seen in a while and I watch a lot of films. It's just so nice. The music, the story, the acting, the atmosphere, the warmth, just everything. I wish those people were my friends and it seems like they are not acting it's so natural. It is simply a great film. If you love films, watch this, you will not regret it. Unless you have no heart or taste.",,Anonymous,Music
"Love is never easy, but a great soundtrack helps.","This self-described modern musical is a gritty, sweet and realistic look at two people falling in love because of – and through – their shared love of music. Set in Dublin, the guy is a passionate, moody busker – a street musician – and vacuum cleaner repairman dragging around a large, matching set of emotional baggage related to his ex. He meets and falls for a charming Czech (she has a seriously disarming smile) flower girl who has her own problems including a tough relationship, a mother whom she caretakes, and a young child. They make beautiful music together and spiral ever closer to ""making beautiful music together."" Along the way, they cut some demo tracks together, growing ever closer as life and circumstances conspire to push them apart. The music they perform together, and apart, drives the movie and it's a quiet joy to listen to them perform their own love story and to watch them grow to appreciate each other ever more deeply with each song together. It's a low budget gem, like a movie-length music video that uses songs and mellow performances to tell a memorable story. And best of all, the ending is touching and true to the characters.--www.cowboyandvampire.com--",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Yes, it is the musical of the year","I'm the kind of person who thinks Pirates of the Caribbean 3, and 300 were two of the best films of 2007. So yes, I'm shallow. I like action movies. And I like movies that do not surprise me too much.But ""Once"" surprised me, and I think it's an excellent movie. One of my saving graces, from my shallow film sensibility, is that I love music. And while August Rush was nice and Hairspray was also good... ""Once"" was simply fantastic. It was a wonderful musical experience but also, with its documentary type of footage it was extremely realistic. The acting was great... it was the kind that makes you think that the actors weren't acting.There are only a few bits, here and there, where the pace dips a bit... but that's pretty rare. Once you get into the relationship of the two main actors, Once is Always engaging.Anyway even if this movie doesn't make it to the top of 2007, still I would certainly put it high on the 2007 best list; certainly top 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty good ROMDRAM!  7 Stars from me!,"Minor spoiler: I thought the beginning was a bit difficult to understand because of the Irish accents, but as the movie went along, I was able to pick up what they were saying. There were sporadic times when I couldn't understand what they said, but I got the main point and gist of the plot. The girl (Marketa) is really from the Czech Republic, she's an immigrant in this movie and speaks both her native language and English, but there's a conversation between her and her mother that is in their native language. In this movie, they do not subtitle that conversation. However, I don't think it was all that relative to the main plot. So if you are from another country and you understand English, then you'll like this movie. I truly wasn't expecting the way it ended, but it was good. The main characters shared a very sweet, enduring friendship that ended up with a nice surprise for the girl (Marketa) and an accepting ex-girlfriend/love. Making friends like that would be so cool. I wish! This movie was just simple and the music was great as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie for songwriters,"If you're a young musician, doing your best to become a songwriter and spending money and time at the local recording studio, then you would understand what this movie is all about. If you're looking for a great love story, then maybe this movie is not for you, because, more than anything, it is a film about friendship between lonely young people.The movie is filled with songs, most of them are very cool and heartbreaking, all of them are telling a story of love lost and hope regained. I found myself wishing for more text than songs, but all in all it didn't ruin my pleasure.The actors are good. Not great, just good. Maybe it's because they were not given too much chance to act. The plot is simple, but in a way it's surprising, mainly because you think you're watching a love story, until you're faced with some twists.All in all, it's a small production for a small story, but if you're into moody, warm cinema, then you would find this movie uplifting.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Tedium should be its title,"This is music story of singers not one of whom can sing well. It will take stamina on the part of the viewer to make it through this movie. One keeps thinking that the plot and the music will improve. I outlasted my wife in viewing this. She gave it approximately an hour. It didn't improve while I was watching. These people are probably good actors, but their acting was overshadowed by the fact that it was tedious to try to watch this movie to the end. It makes me feel badly to have to rate a film in this manner, but I felt it necessary to perhaps save someone else from having to invest time and money in this movie. Please do save yourself some grief and by-pass this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A musical for people who can't afford musicals,"This is a pleasant if slightly poignant love story about two people whose bond is music rather than lust. It's also one of the cheapest musicals ever made. Guy (Glen Hansard from the band Frame) is Irish, a repairer of Hoovers (vacuum cleaners) who busks with his guitar and voice in Dublin shopping streets in his spare time, nursing the hurt caused by his ex-girlfriend who has left him and gone to London. Girl (Marketa Irglova) is a young mother who has left her husband and her country, the Czech Republic, to seek a better life in Ireland (the film is set a few years back before Ireland became top of the GDP per head pops). Both are writers as much as performers and it is not long before they are recording their own stuff. She clearly likes him, but she rebuffs his advances. No matter, because they make beautiful music together.For a movie without a great deal of dramatic tension (it is almost documentary-like at time) it is remarkably absorbing. The music is what you'd expect  sentimental pop, but not pap, and generally easy listening. There's not a nasty person in the film, save perhaps for a heroin addict who tries to rip off Guy in the opening frames. The hand-held camera gives immediacy  you might almost be walking down a crowded Grafton St, where this correspondent's grandfather used to ply his trade as a high class Ladies' Draper (Newell's of Dublin, a site now occupied by the more downmarket Dunne's). Glen Hansard is not an actor by profession (though he had a small part in ""The Commitments"" 15 years ago) but he's fine here, with the right amount of anguish for Guy. Marketa Irglova is just brilliant as the Girl. Casting often means young actors have to appear younger than they actually are, but here Irglova at 17 manages to convince us she is in her mid-twenties, as well as writing and playing a good deal of the music.This movie was shot in 17 days in and around Dublin and cost about $US 150,000. Much of the music is original and the performers are mostly musicians, not actors. It's a slight piece but it holds together well despite the lack of dramatic tension. You come out of the theatre in a cheerful frame of mind. Perhaps it does help if you like folk-pop music but this is pleasant, accessible stuff. I'd like to think that Granddad wouldn't have rung the Garda to have them moved on.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, but...","Like many of those who have posted before me I thought the story and plot of the film were magical. It's got strong performances from both lead actors and some darn good music, too. I'd agree to the Lost in Translation comparison. The film is a love story, but not a romantic love story. It's a tale of two souls, both incomplete and lost, and how their time together changes each of them.As much as I loved everything else about the film, the cinematography was horrible. I don't know why they got the guy who shot The Blair Witch Project to do this... Seriously though, this small independent film is shot with a hand-held camera, and it shows. There's the constant shaking of the camera, the awkward zooms in and out at random intervals, the odd framing of many scenes, and some problems with perspective and keeping characters in focus. It looks like it was filmed by somebody's dad who just got his first camcorder. Even with this issue I'm still giving it an 8 for its beautiful characters, relationships, and memorable moments, so you can imagine how good the film could have been if it had been shot by someone who was competent.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Gorgeous & Subtle - A Real Gem,"I had read great things about this little independent Irish film and so was thrilled when I came across it to rent, though perhaps also aware of the hype surrounding it. Was this hype justified? It certainly was....The movie was real and natural. Nothing felt forced or cheesy (as romantic movies often do.) It was funny and yet moving. Sweet but not sickly. I thought the leads were terrific and wow what voices. Though I am Irish, I've never taken much notice of the Frames, simply thinking they were standard singer-songwriter fare. But Hansard has a gorgeous voice and a real way with words. Irglová too had such a quiet yet beautiful sound and the two together was magic.If you like independent film (or just like music)but can't remember the last time you were truly engaged with an indie flick, well take a look at 'Once'.Simple, quiet and real, it features a cracking Irish soundtrack and wonderfully natural acting and direction. Just Gorgeous.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Breathlessly intimate,"Once was made for just over 100 thousand euros, which in the movie world is basically next to nothing, and this is part of why it is so great. With only 100 grand, the plot had to be kept simple, and this made it a breathlessly intimate film with a realistic edge to it sorely lacking in other films. This film is much like brief encounter(1945), or The Umbrellas of Cherbourg(1964) or even La La Land(2017)- where circumstances forbids a couple to be together out of pragmatism. Unlike the aforementioned films however, a gritty realism is present which grounds the film- for example, their apartments were simple, homely and realistic, quite unlike the sets in other films, where we see either polished, pretty apartments, where everything is set out nicely. This was because the film was shot in friends' houses to save money.Why then is this a 7 star film to me? Well I have to say firstly, the music in the film takes up maybe a bit too long of screen time, and secondly, the genre of music is really not to my taste. I can see people who appreciate the music in this film liking the film even more.Therefore, The simple plot and intimate feeling in this film is bound to charm everyone, so much so that I, until the end, hadn't realised that our main characters are not given names in this film. The dialogue is just so natural and easy that I completely forgot about this fact. Overall, Once is a marvellous achievement in Low budget film making, though your enjoyment may vary depending on your music tastes.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Classic! Bloody brilliant Irish film-making.,"Had James Joyce written and directed a musical, it could have been Once. Not only because this film is Irish and that the two lovers are both Dubliners, but this cinematic gem is definitely the most believable musical made in film. The actors do not break into song and dance numbers; there are no artificial and spectacular props in the background and grand historically accurate costumes that steal our attentions; and there are no special effects whatsoever. Everything in Once is stripped to its quintessence. The characters are real, very human--the cinematography gives a realistic tone with its hushed and raw images of authentic Dublin and its citizens. The performances are amazing--passionate and moving. And most importantly, the story zaps us back to reality without sacrificing important thrusts on the realm of human relationships.The characters are nameless. The Guy is a gifted singer and composer who earns part-time singing in the streets. He sings about his failed relationship. One night, the Girl finds him belting out his emotions with his guitar while nobody pays attention to his song; she is very much impressed. She happens to be a daughter of someone who used to play in an orchestra. She knows good music when she sees--rather--hears it. The following day, they meet again, and she plays the piano for him. Then, they sing a song together, ""Falling Slowly."" The Girl inspires the Guy to get his groove back. The Guy falls slowly for her. And the Girl does for him, too, though not obviously. But then, they are both tied to their past--and when they sing, they sing of their past relationships.The tagline of the movie probably sets us in the mood: How often do you find the right person? Does the film's title answer this?According to IMDb.com Trivia section, ""the title refers to the many very talented artists that John Carney (the director) knew who put off their career by saying 'once' they get this and that sorted out, but never succeed because they've put it off too long. This describes the lead character, The Guy.""The Girl gives him his inspiration. This is the 'Once' which the Guy has been waiting for in a long time. Then, they made music. Brilliant music.Classic musicals have three aspects that made them classics: an immediate LSS inducing- repertoire, an addictive vibe that makes you want to watch the movie more than three times in a week, and memorable songs which you will memorize eventually. Once has all of these qualities... which is paradoxical if you consider the title of the movie and all of these habit- engendering aspects.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Just right for a true romance.,"Once in a while a musical is fresh and new: Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You was attention-getting when his ordinary actors broke into song as if they were off the streets of a 1930's musical. Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge! took the genre to expressionistic flights. And now back to earth in John Carney's Once, a realist drama/musical set in contemporary Dublin; here a street singer seems to fall in love with a passing by young woman with Hoover vacuum repair needs, which he can do in his day job.And that's about ittwo lonely people, one separated from his unfaithful love and the other from her Czech husband. This 2007 Sundance Audience Award winner never strays from the documentary style while, as in Woody's film, songs break out but with much more natural flow. The truthfulness comes from Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Frames, and Marketa Irglova, a Czech musician he has known and worked with before. Their love and respect for each other make their performances two of the best this year.Neither lead has a name, so it's easy to universalize their experience: the uncertainty of love, emphasized by her unsubtitled Czech response to his question about whether she still loves her husband or not, and the unglamorous ties each person has to a mate, albeit estranged as in this case. The love that has grown for these two impoverished artists is expressed in the songs, first about lost love and then about present love. Hansard has charisma that demands you listen to the lyrics while you enjoy his melody; Irglova's accompanying piano and voice reveal the heart of a poet and the pluck of a heroine.Director John Carney was a member of the Frames, so his understanding of their Gaelic themes and Hansard's talent makes an engaging musical romance. The additional touch of documentary style (some hand held, jittery camera; some blurry close-ups) gives cred to the everyman aura of two talented people finding love without making love and finding song to express that maddening occurrence of being beholden to someone else and determined to do the right thing, not a recipe for lyrical music but a sweet, melancholy score just right for a true romance.",,Anonymous,Music
"For lovers, good music lovers and good film lovers","A very simple, but roughly elegant and charismatic story of a poor busker in Dublin striving to make it in the UK folk/rock music biz, and of his short but very sweet interlude with a musically talented eastern European immigrant girl who helps him with his music but also has her own musical vision. His vision is different and much more ambitious, whereas hers is more familial, personal and introspective. Even though they differed greatly in their need for and of artistic expression, sensitive and unselfish gratitude was shown on both sides for the help they gave each other on the way.Great Frames music throughout, as the soulfulness and pain of love is expressed so tenderly and sensitively, but with great power, by the impressive lead singer of The Frames, Glen Hansard. In real life, The Frames fly well under the huge radar of that ""other"" Irish group U2, but it also has its own charisma working well here in Hansard's music. Just excellent songwriting and singing in a perfect blending of Hansard's talents. I was very impressed with him and enjoyed the story and his music immensely(bought the soundtrack).From our typical expectations at film's end, it just proves so well how much Hollywood has influenced us about romantic movie endings as we all wanted the two leads to get together at the end. Life is not Hollywood, and thank heaven for that. As a result, it was a much more realistic story.My best 3 films of the year so far in this order....Waitress, Ratatoille, and Once. All 9's and 10's, and far above anything else; see all of them for a real treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Singing in the gray,"This is one of the oldest film concepts and it will live forever. Poor guy meets poor girl and they start as friends, but something develops. Tracy/Hepburn did that, if someone has forgotten.But this is made in a charming way and Glen Hansard makes much more of his character than you expect from a movie like this.The lines are often sung and there are also long cuts. This is on the limit of being a musical, but the people are real. But the plot is too traditional and it's like the script doesn't have the guts to tell something important. It doesn't even try and therefore this film will be forgotten. Which is somewhat a pity.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazingly raw and truthful,"This movie just reaffirms my faith in the film-making experience. It was incredible and I had to run out and buy it.

I was drawn in initially by a friend and the fact that this won an Original Song award at the Oscars.I didn't even realize until the end that the characters didn't even have names. The DVDs have great commentary tracks providing further information that just makes this picture all the better.A plot summary doesn't even suffice. It's two people who are both lonely in their own way and need each other so much but were just meant to be friends and came together in a great way at the right time.

Everything in it felt very, very real and genuine. Throughout the entire movie I had this sense of deep sadness though there was nothing specific in the film I could point at and say ""thats what's causing all this emotion"", quite an achievement really.

A Musical it is not. A film it is not.An audition tape is what it is.,"Don't let anyone fool you. As sweet as Once is it is certainly not a Musical. What it is, is one long and boring audition video with a weak story thrown in. Granted, the male lead has great moments of both acting and singing, but to call this film a great love story is pushing it. Slow does not come close to describing this semi noble try. As a TV docudrama it might work on a small screen, but the quality of the film making here does not warrant a big screen. For all the hype and fuss I certainly expected much more.There is even a scene where the male lead shows up with a huge hickie on his neck. This during a love story where the two supposed lovers have not yet been intimate.So, who was asucking on his neck????Maybe the film was meant to be a mystery.LOLI had always thought of a musical to be a story in which the musical pieces advance the telling of the story. Here we have a guy writing songs totally independent of the actual story within the film.Critics love making fools of the public. This is a perfect example.",,Anonymous,Music
Well worth a watch,"The movie follows a 'reality' style of narrative and filming that gives it almost the feel of a documentary. The filming is unsteady as if captured on a hand camera of some kind. The audio quality seems very high indeed. There is focus on the music and the making thereof rather than on a storyline. Unusually, the songs are sung in their entirety, each last several minutes. Insofar as there is a plot, it's just 'that's life' without any twists, miracles or implausible endings. In that sense, it's probably as close to reality in a movie that you can achieve. It's certainly a fresh approach and the more entertaining for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Memories & Dreams -- Memorable Movie Night Part 2: The Musical,"This simple film won audience awards at both Sundance and Dublin Film Festival where the action of the film takes place. Action is a big word--besides a hilarious chase at the beginning of the movie, there is not much action--, yet this movie is sure to captivate engaged audience everywhere. The music is dominant and I did not adore or hate it. I found it good and to shine on occasion. The story is pretty straightforward, but this movie is all about the details, about finding beauty and truth in the ordinary. A bit like Americain Beauty (1999), but much more subtle, never overt.John Carney writes and directs, and finds pleasure in the realism and flaws of his characters and story. A story that looks at the past and future with equal restrained, yet nostalgic gaze. A musical mixture of past memories, fantasies and desire for new memories. An acceptance of the world, an assured happiness in relatively uncomfortable social conditions. A human bond. A share experience.The music has nothing earth-shattering, but the directing & editing do. The camera-work is shaky and disturbing at parts, but the whole approach to filming is welcomed and has some novelties in film. A song where the girl sings at night in the street brought me right there with her and her music. The clever montage of the guy's past lover was the best I've seen in any film yet. You did not feel you were watching some flashback-type plot device, but actually getting a glimpse at an intimate couple's life.Above all, this film remains simple, but when I say simple, I also mean true to its vision, true to its characters & story, and true to the essential. This movie's main takeaway in my opinion is to remind ourselves of what is really essential in our lives. It encourages us to appreciate and cherish. Well John, I appreciate. Thank you.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
100 stars if I could,"I often watch movies, good, bad, I just want to kill time after supper or after sports before. But I haven't met a lot of good movies yet, in fact, zero, in my mind. To me the worst book I've ever read is better than the best movie I've watched. When I browse the Amazon bestseller list, I skip the movie category no matter what is hot in it. I was totally disappointed with these Hollywood potboilers. I hate wasting time in selecting-watching-being-disappointed format. I love music, I spend a lot of time on Amazon music section. As far as I can tell, since last summer, Once has been always in top 100, maybe top 50. But I didn't even try the sample, because I've never heard of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.Yesterday, when I'm doing my routine browse on Amazon, the CD finally caught my eye. I clicked the link then found it was the music from the movie Once. I listened to the samples, then decided to watch the indie(though only 4.5 stars on Amazon, but the samples from OST added another .5). It's only 86 minutes, It won't take a long time.I didn't budge an inch on my chair during the movie, even the credits began to roll. I couldn't even believe when It ended. How can it end so fast, what's next? The movie is just incredibly beautiful, I know that foreign movies are much better than Hollywood's(Whale Rider, Pan's Labyrinth, the Sea Inside), this one is another find in 2007, I just don't know how to simplify my feelings.The story is simple, the friendship and chemistry between two main characters are convincing and touching, the performance was down-to-earth, no exaggeration, no special-effect of course, but full of warmness and sincerity.

A great love story with great music.,"This movie captivated and impressed me in the greatest possible way. Why, you ask? Let me explain.I have seen a lot of so-called ""romance"" movies and every time, especially with the movies that are coming out of Hollywood, I am completely underwhelmed: tidy, but generic plot lines, corny and ridiculous set-ups and obvious ""acting"" that, whether good or bad, seem artificial and ""put-on"".What makes ""Once"" so endearing and appealing is the fact that the main leads seem so genuine and believable: their affection for each other is delivered so naturally and with such coy innocence that I was completely won over. It is as if though we are made privy to their lives in a moment in time in their lives, and we as an audience are emotionally enriched for it.The main leads are obviously accomplished and talented musicians. To be sure, there are great songs on display in this movie. If you are not moved by some of the ""musical"" scenes in this movie, you are either pulse-dead or completely lack humanity. I hope to see these actors, hopefully together again, in the future.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

This movie isn't Hollywood at all; it is raw and very real, and heart wrenchingly beautiful.However much the movie is about creating music (the music here is not for the majority, but I enjoyed it immensely), it's also very much about finding a soul mate. There's a certain magic and intensity about those aspects and they're done incredibly well.Sometimes, I'm often put off by ""indie"" movies, as this one is. The pretentiousness, mainly. But Once is not even close to that. There is nothing self conscious about this movie in the least.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
see it more than once,"There are very few films that will make you want to watch it again straight after the credits roll. Thats the difference between a good film and a great film. And Once is certainly a great film. Great music, great, simple story and wonderful performances.What makes this film even more extraordinary is that it stars musicians, not actors. But looking at the film, you would think Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard had been acting for years. Such was the chemistry between the two in the film, they are now actually a couple.Once is set in Dublin and tells the story of a busker who meets a young immigrant. They quickly become drawn together through music and personal problems which sets the stage for a moving, funny, and endlessly watchable film which I cant recommend highly enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
James Blunt and Norah Jones in an 85 minute music video for the Starbucks generation.,"I was unfortunate enough to see this at the Sarajevo film festival, and it was easily the worst film of the selection shown, and one the worst films I have ever sat through. The story is horribly clichéd, and I found the characters completely dull and predictable. Perhaps the most grating aspect of the film was the music, which was cringe worthy. Basically, John Carney has filmed an 85 minute James Blunt video, a crime that should be punishable by law. I was expecting the film to take a u-turn at some point and reveal some deeper commentary on the music industry or perhaps present a refreshing twist on a love story, but instead it plods along with a level of sincerity that is both naive and superficial.Once is wholly conventional and unrelentingly smug; perpetuating stereotypes of the music industry that any intelligent film maker would challenge or subvert. The film's soundtrack (apparently written by the two stars) is repetitive and shockingly bad, doing nothing to flesh out the characters or tell the audience anything we don't already know. Another film I saw at the festival, Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park, would be a prime example of masterful utilization of soundtrack and score, whereas this was merely offensive and self-indulgent. If anyone wants to see this kind of film done right then I suggest you see the popular Lost In Translation, or the stunning work of art that is Hiroshima Mon Amour.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The only escape is music,"Firstly, the movie is all about music. How the two different lives crash into each other. Their taste of music, make the first good impression between the main characters.However, their similar loads and despairs strengthen the emotionally connection and this reflects to music to art. This is very well shown in the movie, I would say that I got the emotion. Additionally, I liked the Irish motifs (streets and street performers, houses, vacuum fixer store) as well, it decorates the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Singular,"A lot of songwriters don't like to talk about their music. They prefer to play it. This movie understands and depicts that. Sometimes the camera work is a bit shaky (handheld) I guess to suggest a documentary quality.The script understands that characters and the cast definitely does. The characters speak best through their music. The Guy could write and sing lyrics that make you feel as if the fate of the whole world weighed in the balance of how well he sang on each and every song, but sometimes can only say a simple, plain ""Cool"" in conversation. Then their are parts that musicians will get a laugh out of that others will miss entirely. I'm thinking of a particular ""uh, I can see that"" said by The Girl about the key of a particular song. Also, I liked how intently the characters watch each other when one performs a song for them for the first time. Sure, they hear the music but they also are interested in how it is played.The supporting characters do their job with dexterity. The movie tells a story very well and believably.Note: That acoustic guitar that The Guy plays is his in real-life. It's not some prop to show he's poor. The guitar is so beat up, but also tells you how indispensable it is to the musician. In a beat up guitar competition, Willie Nelson's guitar may have a challenger.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Uplifting singer/songwriter musical, unlike any other musical","I watched this at a friend's house last night and we were all amazed with the film. The music is very poignant and uplifting, in a moody, melancholy way. It is the kind of film that, if you are an aging musician, will remind you of your best days hanging out with strangers, creating great spontaneous music and meeting interesting people while you wander and travel. My friends who are not musicians said it made them appreciate music more as an extension of a persons character. Also, I will second what someone else said here that it has a great non-Hollywood non-cliché ending as well. Kudos to all involved in the film for a job well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Very Good Film with One HUGE Flaw,"This is clearly a great movie. The story and music left me in tears, and I can't remember the last time I could say that. The acting didn't look like acting. It was all quite real. The direction was sharp and tight. The cinematography was excellent. It is a great film except for one big problem the sound mix was horrible.For a musical, it is unconscionable to have flat, high-tone sound. Marketa Irglova, the female lead, has an extremely thick Czech accent mixed with hints of Irish brogue. This makes a clear sound mix vital to understanding her important dialog. I have top notch hearing. If you have anything less, this may make listening to the film a very real problem. You may want to wait for the TV release so you can view it with closed captioning.The music was excellent, and Glen Hansgard sounds incredibly like Cat Stevens. Close your eyes and listen. Wow!Other than the sound problem, this is one of those beautiful, small, independent films that will grab your heart and make you smile through your tears.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I loved feeling like I wasn't really supposed to be there, that I was witnessing something so private and pure. I am a fan of Richard Linklater's Sunrise/Sunset as well as Julie Delphy's (obviously Linklater inspired) 2 Days in Paris and, of course, Lars Von Trier. But there was something so pure in Once that separates it from the others. Maybe it was because even though their relationship was complicated it played out so smoothly and without force. They loved one another enough to realize that no matter their pasts or their individual futures they had that week and even a tangible memory of it. Both actors were honestly believable. Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good story, good music and isn't afraid to let their emotions go.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Lovely,"This was one of the best films shown at the 2007 Edinburgh Film Festival, and it was definitely encouraging to see something of this calibre produced from such minimal funding. Just goes to show if you have a strong script and lead actors then everything else becomes superfluous.The songs are of a very high quality and really carry the film which would probably collapse without them. It's not really a musical though, as the songs played generally don't have anything to do with the plot, it's a film featuring a lot of musical performances which isn't the same thing.It's a great project and leaves you thoroughly heart-warmed, and I hope it goes on to find the success it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Tiny Movie With Enormous Results.,"There is a scene in the Irish musical 'Once' in which our nameless characters--our Guy and Girl--play a song in a music store. Guy sings lead and plays guitar while girl plays piano and sings backup. Clocking in at just over four minutes, this song is so emotional and enchanting that we feel the effects of that one tune long after it ends. Sometimes one scene can define a film. To me it was our two stars singing the song entitled ""Falling Slowly"".'Once' could have been made with a big budget, but the director chose to make it micro budget and left the script skeletal. This allows more authenticity and takes us closer to the leads. The home video camera look makes this feel like a documentary, plus the immersiveness into the characters' lives make the viewer feel like they are watching old home movies of their best friends.'Once' is a love letter to music. Music is a universal art that is so personal and speaks to the soul. With music, so many people feel that their lives make sense. Director John Carney shows on film exactly how this can be. Each song in this movie is very emotional, but getting to know the characters on screen increases our affections. And the characters are developed pretty well in a short amount of time. Guy is a busker who also works at his father's vacuum shop. He recently broke up with his girlfriend, but he still loves her. Girl is a single mother in a townhouse who is separated from her husband. She wants her daughter to grow up with her father. Are Guy and Girl the perfect couple? In a romantic sense, no. It crossed their minds to get with each other, but their relationship is platonic and purely musical. She helps him with his music career (which includes getting a professional demo) and motivates him to get back with his girlfriend. Their intimate relationship does not need to be romantic.Listen to each song. Pay attention to the lyrics and the heart that Guy and Girl are pouring into them. The songs reflect their lives in such fascinating scenes. The simplicity of a guitar and a piano can go long ways.See this passion project and download all of the songs. The characters are charming and the songs are enchanting.4/4",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Touching, well acted film, with great songs and performances","Set in Dublin, this film is about a street busker and a chance meeting with a young Czech girl who shares his passion for music. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irgolva as the two leads play their parts very well, despite, apparently, being musicians first and not actors in real life. Their love story plays out with the backdrop of Dublin and is almost documentary in its portrayal.The songs are memorable, making me but the CD afterwards, for my son.The will they/wont they plot plays out to the end with a touching finale and I wont spoil that ending for other readers.Well worth an evenings viewing.

Breath of fresh air,Although I was just happy to go see a movie where no one dies I was expecting something wishy washy and contrived. I am even happier to say this is a gem of a movie and a great advert for Ireland. The two main characters are musicians from very different walks of life. Music brings them together and through it they give each other the strength to face their demons. The characters are very real and endearing and the dialog is equally so and very far removed from the contrived half-witted witticisms of the Hollywood variety. Just as surprisingly everyone they interact with is a person I would happily share a few beers with. The whole movie industry these days seems to be about hate and death. I think this movie was made by people who loved the story and the characters and wanted others to feel the same. It is not often I walk out of the cinema wishing that the movie I just saw was longer.

A Low-Budget Movie that Captures Hearts,"I am writing this review now while listening to the award winning song ""Falling Slowly"". ONCE is the best musical-in my opinion. It is the simplest story I've ever seen on screen. Its simplicity is shown through everything surrounds it from the camera to the budget to the 17 days in which it was wholly made. Sometimes you needn't a high budget to be captured your audience.About the performances. you will never feel the actors are acting. They are very real. Actually everything is very real, I think due to the camera work. I doubt it is a home camera or something ;)I don't have much words to describe it. Simply, it is a feel-good movie with a straightforward story about immigrants in Ireland, and sweet melodies that after watching it you'll feel loving everyone and want to hug everyone.

I don't even think I am able to. Well I decided to watch this movie because I had heard so many wonderful things about it: like, ""this is the best film of 2007"" etc. And after about 15 minutes I started to realize how boring this movie was. I thought it would become more interesting towards the end of the film so I watched the whole movie, and it had to be the most boring hour and a half of my life. Would I recommend this movie?

"Hollywood executives wouldn't like it, but viewers will!","""Once"" is worth seeing, perhaps even worth owning, if only for the music. (Note: Take Dramamine before viewing if you easily contract motion sickness, as the camera is hand-held for most of the film). Markéta Irglová's character (the Girl) is friendly, open-tempered and penetrating - a good contrast to Glen Hansard's portrayal of the melancholic, brooding, jilted lover (the Boy). This not a Hollywood formulaic film - from the hand-held camera, to using musicians rather than actors, to the realistic way the characters relate to each other - all these things are why I love this film. And I believe that viewers will find it a refreshing change from most Hollywood tripe. Must see this film...more than once!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Once you watch this vibrant, melodious film, you'll probably want to see it twice or even more times","An Irish busker (Glen Handsard) has had his heart broken. The lady in question moved to London and now he sings on the street corner, belting out songs of love gone wrong. Its not his only job, as he works part time repairing ""hoovers"" at his dad's Dublin shop, which is also their abode. One day, on a Dublin street, a beautiful young lady stops and is so captivated by his performance. She gives him ten cents, which he laughs about, but the truth is, she is not wealthy. A Czech immigrant, this girl (Marketa Inglova) sells flowers on the street while her mother takes care of her young daughter. Yet, she also plays the piano and sings, which is why she is enchanted by the busker. Soon, when she learns he fixes vacuum cleaners, she brings her's to his shop and, later, the two stop in at a musical instruments store, where the owner knows her. Together, these two begin to make beautiful music together. But, there are problems. When the guy makes a pass at her, she tells him about her estranged husband, back in the Czech Republic, and her daughter. Meanwhile, the guy tells her about his former flame. Continuing to see each other and, finally, making a recording as a duo, is a platonic relationship really all there is to be? This lovely, very melodious movie is a gem. You may want to see it more than once! Hansard is already an established Irish singer, whose soulful ballads are a modern update of Irish folksongs. Inglova, too, is very talented and, together, they are dynamite. No matter that neither one is an actor, their work here is touching and true. Then, too, the scenes around Dublin are most beautiful while the photography is great as well. A good deal of the tunes are played while either the guy or the gal is walking, shopping, or otherwise engaged, making it different from other traditional musicals. Costumes, script and direction are all wonderful as well. So, here's the advice. Get Once at once!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not good,"Very slow and too much music. Certainly not worth 8.0. The story is developing incredibly slow and isn't really going anywhere. After a while I started skipping through the movie just to speed things up a bit. What an incredible slow movie. And I didn't particularly liked the music as well. It seems to take ages before the next scene comes. You are constantly waiting for a song to end so the next scene can start. The beginning is quite nice but after a while it simply gets really boring. You start to wonder if anything will happen at all, but disappointingly nothing really happens. I gave one star just to take the average rating down. 8.0 is way too high, if you ask me.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Once viewed twice,"Once is a raw, witty, infectious film. On second viewing, I found it to rise in my favour. This is in no part down to the composition of songs that are so beautifully constructed and sung that they could be hits in current popular culture.The two leads Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova (only seventeen at time of film) are named merely Him and Her. We don't notice this. It's not to show off a stylistic choice. What do we get from their names?The film doesn't spend time on particulars. It alludes to the character's respective past, and the predicaments of their situation, predominantly from their music. Nonetheless, the conversational narrative is charming. From the get go neither character pulls any punches in what they think about the other. In a Dublin town centre Her questions Him why he doesn't play the song he's performed at daytime. Him tells her that people want to hear familiar music and the ten cents she gave him evidences his point.People may question Marketa Irglova's accent as she is a Czech immigrant living in Ireland. Although at times the Irish accent came through a little forcefully, it truly appeared indicative of someone who had moved to an alien country and was learning from imitation.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Big time good - and not just because musics AMAZING grace.,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this delightful, unassuming film. Awesome music, especially with surround sound, sitting in the dark, thankfully, cause when they nail the song first time i am just balling (bloody 'ell mate) and it is just crazy beautiful. Tons of drifting emotion, funny too, living life and hey I just loved this film all round. Glad how they ended it too. Big ass piano drift and lot of goodness to spare. I actually noticed the hand-held aspect of the camera but did not mind. Dragging the hoover through the market like a pet dog was nice touch. Great scenes all round.

Empty,"Empty music, empty movie, empty Euro-livesThere's something precious and decadent about hiring real professional musicians to portray aspiring street musicians. OF COURSE they are going to succeed. No lip synching required.It's not a bad movie, just petty and irritating. And the music, though heartfelt and technically proficient, is very bad. If you like this music, first check to see if you have a pulse; second, check to see if you really want to go on living. It is distilled essence of depression and futility. Blues is sad, but it celebrates life, perseverance. This stuff just curls up and whines.I love small intimate movies, and really wanted to like this one. But the director didn't allow his characters to be real people -- they don't even have names. They are types, ethnic abstractions with musical talent. It should be a big hit in the retro tribal world of identity politics. Bah humbug.One element I did like: The young folks don't rebel against the old folks.

Guy & Girl fall into a love friendship and make beautiful bittersweet music together!,"This is an awesome movie that is filmed as though it were a documentary. Love doesn't always involve sex. The movie is about the true and deep connection between two people who evolve into musical friends, as well as detached soul mates as they pine away for the ones that they love from afar. The soundtrack is incredibly soulful and the lyrics will blow you away with their laments of love lost. One of the songs that isn't on the soundtrack is the opening song where Glen is singing in the street for money and he sings the song ""And The Healing Has Begun"" (Written by Van Morrison). You can hear the desperation in his voice as he painfully sings out the lyrics as if he is begging for love's mercy. Does anyone know where I can get a recording of Glen's rendition? I will beg mercifully for it!!! The other songs not on the soundtrack include ""Song Without Words"" performed by Marketa Irglova, ""The Fair City Waltz"" written by Hugh Drumm & Adam Lynch and ""Whiskey In The Jar"" which is listed as a traditional arrangement.

Every detail is perfect.Just because IMBD needs min characters to make a review. Here's a poem by me.In a futile attempt to make sense of the chaos
Drowned in the overlays of distorted sounds
I think back and remember my first sin
Committed as a child
That I had snuffed a pure and innocent life in naive yet tainted and defiled rage.I have death when I should have given love for an innocent mistake.Love, something I lack now.And I'm still paying my penance.20 years later.To deprive a light.My light was deprived as a consequence.And so my sin was of a putrid kind acted out in a putrid form of love.Should blame my parents for teaching me that love is wrath and pain.Or was I forsaken.But my sins are my own.I'll forever be in hell
On this earth and after my death
I loved you, I should have taken care of you
I failed you and snuffed your innocent light
You were a good boy, I loved how one of your ears was floppy and how you'd bark a hot meals given to you after burning your nose by being impatient.I wish I could hold you again.I wonder if you'll forgive me.I wonder if you're soul is still around.I know you must hate me.And I wouldn't blame you for it. - CThanks.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A wonderful quiet love story,"I've just watched this again yesterday after a few years since I first saw it, and then watched it again tonight because I was so completely captivated by it. This is exactly what happened when I first saw it too, and now I know I'll be listening to the soundtrack on hard rotation for a few days at least.For me, this film doesn't put a foot wrong. It's perfectly paced, to match the pace of the developing love story. The music is mesmerising at times, heartbreaking at others. The acting is subtle, but spot on. The filming is beautiful, even with the jerky camera work, it matches the rough edges of the lives of the characters. All the things that I've seen people criticise this film for, I would argue are things that work perfectly for this film, this story, the love affair and the struggles.There is something about this that puts me in mind of Brief Encounter - I don't hold it in such high esteem, but it is a wonderfully pitched story, that asks you to look deep into it to understand what the characters aren't saying, what they aren't doing, and to be able to reach an understanding of their choices while feeling the turmoil their own brief encounter puts them through.Life rarely gives us the Hollywood plot line. The twists and turns of our daily encounters mean that choices aren't always clear cut, but are so often compromises. Guy and Girl here face those compromised outcomes - what might have been, have they got all they could or could have hoped for. All of this is clear when you look at them through the film, and the music supports that understanding, sometimes driving the point home like a knife. This is genuinely one of the most beautiful and gut wrenching films I have seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

citizen kane,"This is a typical example of a movie which made such a hype all around that anyone who did not like it would be considered an arrogant narrow minded person. It is one of these boring so-called musicals about love. Although there is some kind of connection between this not very appealing and rude (see the Oscars) man and his 18 years younger ""love"" interest I would not call it a love story. And musical? Can somebody please sing one song from that movie? The songs from Grease for example or recently Chicago will stay in your head for a while when you leave the theater. This one? Try if you can. And for those who think they are missing something, you are not, it is one very average boring indie cheap movie, which will be forgotten in a couple of months.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful but sad melody,"On a street, one man sings favorite songs in the daytime, but at night he sings his original songs. At one night one girl gets interested in him. She can't afford to buy a piano even she is also a musician. It's because she came from Czech and brings up her child without her husband. They become friends and begin to compose songs together. He asks her to make their demo tapes. Gradually they falls in love. The camera work like home video and the sad melody match the atmosphere of Dublin. Audiences feel sad and painful from their songs.

I hear she was only 20 when the film was made but her performance is beautifully judged and deeply moving and real.

All the coolness of the noughties in 85 min,"This film is amazing. It manages to capture everything that was cool about the noughties in one coherent story. The pretentiousness and naivety of western consumer culture is lovingly juxtaposed with the love story of the struggling musician and immigrant girl trying to make their living in a big city like Dublin. Themes like ""friends are the new family"" are lovingly portrayed with house parties where everyone drinks foster beers and the deep struggle of these modern day heroes to stay in touch with their true selves as human beings and nature is again nicely contrasted by trying to make it in the coolest business of all: The music business. The main character even uses one of those laptop machines to write his songs (of course he also uses traditional pen and paper) and he's awe inspired when he enters the music studio with the big mixing console that has produced so many stars and such amazing music.

"""Take this sinking boat and point it home...""","""At first they are flirting, and by the end they're f***ing like animals"", says writer/director John Carney of the scene in ""Once"" where the guy (Glen Hansard) and the girl (Marketa Irglova) sing ""Falling Slowly"" for the first time. It's a beautiful song, understated like the whole movie; and it's not only a beautiful scene, but also one of the most truly moving cinematographic scenes I've ever seen.I know the feeling; I've sung with people I didn't know whether they could do it well and been amazed beyond words; I've fallen in love playing music. It's not the romantic relationship kind of love; it's something from a completely different universe. Anyone who says ""Once"" is a bad film has to be either a music hater ora music hater.Once in a lifetime you'll watch a movie like ""Once"", because from now if you experience something similar it's going to come from here. Carney and his team, the emotional photography of the digital camera and the austere use of light; Hansard, his earnest voice and uncompromising songs; Irglova, her unique smile and the mystique that surround her; they might have created a completely new film genre I wouldn't dare to give a name to.I regret some unnecessary moments where Carney takes the viewer for granted by showing characters smiling when they listen to the music this guy and this girl play. We don't need to see the typical shot of the 'approving face'; we like it and we approve it and that should be enough.You want to laugh? You will, watching five musicians getting into a studio and not knowing what to do. You want to rejoice? You can close you eyes and listen to the music that, even when it shares some similarities with my beloved Damien Rice, comes from a parallel world that (I'm starting to think) only exists in Ireland. You might cry too, but that's depending on how sensitive you are.One last thing: this is not a romantic comedy and it doesn't even come close to one. But if it were, I would hand an immense compliment to the story because it is, yes, very romantic and unlike anything you've seen. Free of clichés, formulas and (predictable or not) convenient endings.

Like a musical Before Sunrise,"The Hollywood musical machine is back in full form with colorful designs, elaborate sets, and big name stars here to take Broadway to the big screen. Yet as combination of jukebox musicals and movies turned musicals turned movies yet again barrage the big screen, it's a simple little tale called ""Once"" that takes an entirely different approach.""Once"" is probably more minimalist than the Hollywood musical format. It has an interesting approach, in that the music in the film are mostly performance pieces. Yet they forward the story along more than most of the current crop of musicals.The story is quite simple. A Czech immigrant and poor Irishman meet and realize they share a fondness of music and start writing music together. Like any partnership, we see how their music progresses as well as their personal relationship.But this isn't some cheap love story or rags to riches story. Rather, the characters share their stories, their desires, and their feelings in the ever so brief but affective spoken dialogue, and flesh them out in their songs. It doesn't have any sugar coated artificial sentiment either. There's a sincerity that flows in the characters throughout the film.The characters in this film seem very real. Perhaps its their struggling nature and that they aren't larger than life characters. One of my favorite scenes in the movie summarizes both the normalcy of the characters and their sincere passion towards art. There is a scene where the girl is listening to music and trying to think of words to write for it and is so caught up in it that she gets frustrated when the batteries run out on the CD player and scrambles trying to find them. It's a simple yet beautiful scene that captures the spirit of the film.What makes the film such a fantastic feel good film is the friendship between the two main characters and the special bond they have. The chance encounter and how they accomplish much in such a little time reminded me very much of Before Sunrise. I have a feeling if that were a musical, it might look something like Once, an excellent, simple feel good musical.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of my Favorite Films Released in 2007,"You can say a lot about 2007 not being a great year. On the political side, the economy crumbled a bit, oil prices skyrocketed, New Orleans is still in a wreck, and the Democrats in office were unable to make progress because of President Bush's stubborn ways. With all this chaos in today's world, one turns to entertainment. However, scripted TV shows halted due to the writer's strike, and the music industry in spite of sagging CD sales had not been churning out particularly good new music. Fortunately, after a creative slump, movies are the one medium that are bouncing back. ""Once"" is no exception.I went to see this film on a whim earlier last year when it was playing at an nearby independent theater. It had gotten a pretty good review from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine, so I admittedly went in with expectation that the movie would be good.Fortunately, it was good, but in a different way than I could have imagined. I didn't expect a musical of sorts, and I got an unconventional one filled with original and awe-inspiring songs. It sounds very hackneyed when I write this, but the music was truly moving, especially the song ""Falling Slowly"" which has fortunately been recently nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song.The storyline was also intriguing, and the dialogue was pretty good considering most of it was improvised. The ending, which I won't give away, was just the right touch for this film, and the replay of the song ""Falling Slowly"" could not have fit better into the end sequence.It's a fault of the MPAA that this film was rated R. It really shouldn't have been. There was absolutely no violence, no nudity, and most importantly, a heart-warming story that people of all ages should be exposed to. If anything, the film should have been rated PG-13. It's just another example of the MPAA's flawed and inefficient rating system. Don't let the few F-word's in this movie fool you. If you have kids, and they want to see this movie, let them! Period.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Musical without being a Musical, moving without being overly dramatic - in other words: fantastic!","I really didn't know what to expect when I started watching ""Once"". All that I had heard was that this was supposedly one of the best movies of the year. It starts out with a busker singing in the streets. A guy with a thick Irish accent appears and I thought, wow, I'm going to be lost. Thankfully, the main characters were speaking more comprehensibly as the movie progressed. The singing part remained, though. To my surprise that didn't bother me at all, but the songs actually turned out to be so beautiful and interwoven with the movie so naturally that they became the heart and soul of ""Once"".Leading actors Glen Hansard (frontman of The Frames) and Markéta Irglová not only played their roles to perfection, they also wrote and performed the soundtrack, which should win them all sorts of prizes and get them worldwide recognition. Their performances are really quite an achievement.The story itself is unagitated and realistic up until the very end, which is what makes it so moving. ""Once"" isn't a fairy tale, but a snap shot of a romance that breaks through all sorts of bleak circumstances and sheds some light on the hard lives of these lovely people. It's a movie that genuinely deserves to be called ""romantic"" unlike so much nonsense that's listed under ""Romance"" on IMDb. This one is the real deal.

"Charming and honest ""Once"" is a soundtrack with a movie instead of the other way around","""Once"" touts itself as a ""contemporary musical,"" but that term doesn't quite do it justice. It is a film that is centered around and supported by its music all at the same time. The songs don't help tell the story so much as enhance it much like a soundtrack would. In that sense, ""Once"" is more like a brilliant pop/acoustic soundtrack with a story mixed in.The film is about a guy who lives with his dad who when he's not helping his dad fix vacuums, is out on the street playing music and at night he plays his own songs. When a girl stops by and listens their different lives become uncontrollably intermingled by their love of music, which they begin to create together.Perhaps the truly great thing about the film is that it doesn't give in to the romance story that the viewers mind is undoubtedly wrapped around. Their relationship and attraction is central to the story, yet creator John Carney finds a way to make it enjoyable while not indulging in the simple pleasures of Hollywood romance cliché. It makes the film very honest, respectable and perhaps praiseworthy while retaining a lot of charm.When it comes down to it though, the film is about the music and it is truly beautiful music for anyone that has an appreciation for acoustic pop. It does have a mildly indie sound, but it's definitely capable of being mainstream. The songs aren't only good, but they make the movie interesting - you can see the inner-monologue and the emotions when the footage is simply just of the two of them playing. What's even better is when Carney keeps the audio of the song rolling and continues the film visually. It creates some seamless transitions and shows just how much the music really acts as an appropriate soundtrack too - something that brings out the undertones in the story.""Once"" is a triumph of independent film and a unique venture into experimental genre. It does leave a little left to be desired and dances around some potentially dramatic moments, but we're not talking about a major studio picture, so considering the limitations I'm awfully impressed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Anything ""Greatest"" only happens once, and it has happened via ""Once""","After reading all the articles, I'd totally agree with the greatness of the film, but I'd also like to encourage the audience to acknowledge the very essence of this film and its eternal meaning. I am quite a movie observer myself. I watch each and every movie that I do, with a great deal of attention and for any scope of lump. I have to admit that ""Once"" is one of kind movie. Unlike any other piece of motion picture which I have ever witnessed while I respire. It's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship on reel. I think though the music got the recognition it deserved, there are only a few who are acknowledging the acting performances given by our Guy and Girl especially against the fact that they took no formal training of any sort for their respective roles. I mean I have my own list of great movies, which I keep recommending to people around me ( Nd sometimes force them to see ) but Once had some superb acting performances which totally gel with the movie's theme. Since the movie was shot with handy-cams and essentially was depicting life in reality on the streets of Dublin, this is where the actors did their job to perfection. I mean a girl 17 years in age who never acted in her life, was playing a single mother, who doesn't have enough money to take hold of her difficult life. How often do we see such naturalism in the acting done nowadays. Even glen's part was good, he made it natural, and easy on the roll; this is where the movie was one of a kind, there's just not anything bad about it ?I am sorry, but I never intended to write this much, but as I said, I love this movie so much, I have gone morbidly obsessed with it.

A Bittersweet Romance with Some Really Great Songs...,"I remember this film winning the Oscar in 2008 for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song. The song was called 'Falling Slowly' and I recall seeing a clip from the film of the song being played live on guitar and piano in a music shop. It didn't have a wide release here in the UK, but thanks to digital TV, I have finally got round to seeing it. I wasn't disappointed; it's a really good film with some truly great songs, so great in fact that I bought the soundtrack! Set in Dublin it tells the story of a busker and the immigrant Czech girl he meets.One evening the Guy, the busker, is playing one of his own compositions when he meets the Girl, we never know their names. She says she's seen him before, but not playing his own songs. He says that during the day people won't pay to hear his own songs so he plays well known songs instead. The get talking and she meets him the following day when she takes him to a music store where she's allowed to play piano for an hour a day. She persuades him to play one of his songs, 'Falling Slowly', and she accompanies him on piano. The story goes on to tell how the relationship between the two is affected by events in the past. I really don't want to give too much away because it's so much better to watch when you don't know too much about it.Tremendous musical performances from both Glen Hansard as the Guy and Markéta Irglová as the Girl, although I don't think speaking dialogue really came naturally to either of them. Honourable mentions go to Hugh Walsh as Timmy Drummer, Gerard Hendrick as Lead Guitarist, Alaistair Foley as Bassist, Geoff Minogue as Eamon, Bill Hodnett as Guy's Dad and Danuse Ktrestova as Girl's Mother.Over all, a really engaging film with some really great music. If you love ballads, then I can guarantee you a most enjoyable watch. Most of the music is either played live or is integrated really well into the narrative. In fact this bittersweet tale is mostly told through the songs which are interspersed with short pieces of dialogue. If you're not a romantic or a lover of music, then this is probably not for you. However, it's definitely recommend for music lovers and romantics alike.My score: 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Once"" is very pure.","""Once"" is simplicity at its very best. It's a movie made with limited resources and with a small cast & crew, consisting mostly out of inexperienced persons within the business.It's perhaps a movie that sounds like a very amateur like movie but yet its a movie with some real class. It has a good and simple story, likable main characters and it's all being build up and handled nicely. It's story progresses steadily and often without the use of needlessly many words. The characters and the main plot line tell all of the story. The movie is great in its simplicity really.It's foremost also really a movie about music and choosing between living the life you want to or living the life the simply have to. Both main characters sort of struggle with this and they have their dreams but also their obligations toward other people close to them. None of them thought about actually chasing their dreams and do what they like most until they happen to meet up on the street.It's a movie that works through it's simplicity, music and likable characters. But fair is fair, it needs to be said, to me it seems ridicules that Markéta Irglová is being praised so much for her acting performance. Do people somehow confuse amateur and weak acting for a natural performance? It's crazy, I just couldn't get over the fact how horrible her acting was at times, even though she has been praised basically everywhere for it. It's fresh that the movie uses some non-actors in it but really there is a reason for them not being actors. Also simply no way that these people are going to cast in anything else really but somehow I think that they also wouldn't mind this though, since there are more into music really anyway.Still it's of course amazing for a movie of this size to receive as much recognition and praise as it did. A true accomplishment I bet no one involved ever expected. But it's not hard to see why it has reached such popularity, fore ""Once"" is an unexpectedly well made and put together movie, that is good looking, benefits from its simplicity with its story, atmosphere and characters and has some nice music in it as well. it's a movie that with its themes should appeal to everybody and it's just hard not to like this movie really.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Meant for each other,"""Once"" (2006) was written and directed by John Carney. The film, set in Dublin, is a love story. However, we know that ""the course of true love never did run smooth.""Glen Hansard plays a street musician. (His day job is repairing vacuum cleaners.) Markéta Irglová plays a Czech immigrant who sells magazines and flowers on the street. (Her day job is cleaning houses.) Naturally enough, they meet, and there's a definite chemistry between them. There's a definite chemistry between their music as well. It turns out that the young woman is an accomplished pianist and singer. Together, they really do make beautiful music.Naturally, problems arise. Both people have previous attachments. The plot of the movie is concerned with the way they work out their lives in view of their circumstances and their commitments.Director Carney does a solid job of introducing us to the realities of earning a living as a street busker. The entire film has an authentic, realistic feel to it. Markéta Irglová is a fine musician, and turns out to be an excellent actor as well. (This is her first film.) Carney picked bravely and well when he chose Irglová. She's attractive, but not in the supermodel style of Paulina Porizkova. Irglová looks like the character she portrays--someone who may be selling flowers on the street, but who is a talented and sensitive musician at heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Bad music + bad acting + bad film-making = bad movie,"Another entry in the ""indie chic"" category of bad film making. This movie was really too hip for its own good. It was all shot on digital camera and it's usually shaky and oftentimes badly lit. It's cloying, fuzzy, vapid crap for middle-aged hippies who sit around in their sweaters smoking weed and drinking red wine. The music was also awful and quite repetitive. Want to watch a good movie with the same themes -- try ""Almost Famous"". Maybe the reason it works -- the lead characters are teenagers. It might have worked had that been done here. Seriously, what's with middle-aged guys who wear scarves who sing about how bad their life is and are still trying to become famous? The music was too much. It was like Coldplay but worse (I'm not kidding).

First 'Across the Universe' had me with my mouth open, and now 'Once' comes along, and I'm questioning my upbringing. The moments it captures seem so delicate, but they can't be or John Carney would never be able to make this film. And it's not really a musical as much as a movie deeply entwined in music. In a way music is its real topic. Music weaves a bond between first two people, and then a small group. And it's as if the music is completely guileless and unpretentious, like the people who are attracted to it, who like the people in 'Across the Universe' are really children of the Sixties though they're far too young to have been directly influenced by them. This is probably the most pleasurable movie I've ever seen, and I don't mind that I won't forget it anytime soon. It was good to have the captions on as the accents can be thick at times, but why aren't I surprised this film wasn't made in America?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wonderful Soundtrack.....Oh, and a great movie....","I stumbled upon this movie on Movies On Demand.....How did I miss seeing this movie when it came out?

"Natural, believable romance augmented by terrific music","I was actually surprised at how much I loved it. I think it's because it's not a gushy, corny, over-romanticized love story; it's very low-key and subtle and thus feels more genuine. There's no big Hollywood productions - everything is more natural. This extends to the songs, also - they're not too synthetic or over-produced, and thus fit the realistic setting very well. And they're also terrific. They advance the narrative, express the character's thoughts, evoke emotions from the audience, and sound fantastic to boot. And that's all I really want from a musical/romance: something natural, something believable, with some great music. And I got it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very romantic and brilliant,"I saw many horror films this year. Then I turned to see some love films. This is the first one. It touched me a lot. They are lucky ones, and I think life is just changeable if we want to. Once you found your life boring and no success for each day, it's time to change.""If you want me, then satisfy me."" This is one of the lyrics the girl wrote. It best reflects the truth of love: if you love someone, then do your best to satisfy her/him. I think that's true for everyone of us.So I gave it 10 points. This is the best love movie I saw this year. I will remember it for my life. And besides, the actress in the leading role is beautiful; I will see more films by her.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"making music with the Irish, both traditional and new","Breath-taking. Life affirming. Are there any superlatives left unwritten for this film? A Dublin busker comes across a Czech woman selling flowers and The Big Issue. She has a broken Hoover; his Dad knows how to fix such appliances. He writes his own songs; she has access to the pianos in a musical instrument shop. And a flair for making canny business deals. His heart has been broken, her dreams have been severely corrupted by life's realities. We never know their names. But more importantly we get to know their music.Like Before Sunrise, this film takes two wanderers and anchors them for a short, magical time in each other, before setting them apart once more. Like Hedwig, it weaves a simple story around some great songs. But Once is a stand-alone film, an absorbing, moving tale, full of great music, interesting characters, and acutely observed moments. At one point the busker plays his demo tape to his Dad as a prelude to leaving home. Dad loves the music, and practically shoves him out the door. His heart is breaking with love and pride, but it is all left unsaid. The girl makes one declaration in Czech that says it all (you'll look it up - everyone does). That the busker has no idea what she said is symbolic of what makes this film so delicious.If there is a God, all films will be like this from now on.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Beautiful Scoring of a Subtle Romance,"I had to give this a second viewing, after my newly discovered respect for Carney (""Begin Again"", ""Sing Street""). I am glad that I did. I guess my taste in films has refined over the years, for I do not remember liking it this much.Carney has a talent for painting the picture of love in a subtle way that is that much more effective. Love, for him, does not always mean grand gestures or even two individuals with the fairytale ending. He realizes that, often, love is in the small things. That some loves are unfortunately not meant to be. That people are in our lives for a season, reason, or lifetime, and one is not necessarily better than the others.Add to that the amazing music that accompanies all Carney's work, and you have another great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Awful, awful, awful!","A ""1"" is too high for this amateurish home movie.First, the music, if a wailing busker with neither a singing voice nor talent howling out some incomprehensible dreary melody that wouldn't even qualify as bad folk songs can be considered music.The director seems to think so, for we are forced to endure each ""song"" from beginning to end (mostly you will wonder if it will ever end each time) with a meaningless story subservient to the singing and kept in the background. In every movie with even a great soundtrack of music, the music is always secondary to the plot and story - not so here, as we must listen to music that strives to be mediocre at best (or worst).As if the music isn't unendurable enough, the story is incomprehensible. I would have appreciated sub-titles, this movie needed it - unless you've grown up in the back streets of Dublin - the Irish brogue might as well have been spoken in ancient Sanskrit and no one would have known the difference.Bad enough so far, and we have no idea why each of their two (former) partners are no longer with them (well, I wouldn't want them either, frankly) and for what reason they will be together again - and, of course, who cares anyway?Add to this the cinematography was no better than an old 8mm home movie - generally either too soft a focus, or sometimes out of focus, camera shaking, poor lighting - I am aware of what a competent cinematographer can accomplish with a needed mood scene, but this movie probably didn't even have competence on the technical level.If you enjoy talentless losers busking their way thru life, by all means enjoy it.Not my cup of tea.Our local newspaper gave this 4 stars, their top rating. Even such gems as Babel and After The Wedding didn't get that. Must be something wrong with me.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

"Great music, well written, and two great stars.","We were lucky enough to see ""Once"" at a free screening, at Bristol's Watershed Media Centre. It was actually a bit like going to a premiere, because the stars Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová were there. It's actually hard to believe that neither of them is an actor - the interplay between them on-screen was a joy to watch. There's also a lot of very natural humour, so a good laugh is guaranteed.After the film, they answered questions from the audience as well as from the Watershed's Programme Director, Mark Cosgrove. During this, it transpired that the director originally intended to cast a woman of around 35 for the 'female immigrant' part, but wasn't able to find anyone. So it was Glen Hansard who suggested Markéta Irglová, whom he had met a few years earlier.They then performed some of the songs from the film, using Glen's rather well-used guitar and just a microphone each. Even playing as live and un-produced as you can get (no mixing desk or anything), they sounded as brilliant as they did in the film, Markéta's voice sounding especially haunting when she sang a solo.All in all, this was a film I would been happy to pay to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Once - my new favourite film,"I think I just watched my favourite film, ever.ONCE tells the story of a talented singer/songwriter, and his journey to releasing his creative potential. The character is played by Glen Hansard of The Frames who are, incidentally, one of my favourite bands ever. He fixes vacuum cleaners by day, and busks on the streets of Dublin in his spare time; fending off local drunks who try to steal his takings, and only singing the songs he has written when he is sure no-one is listening.He is spotted by a young Czech girl (Marketa Irglova) who stands alone one evening applauding his song, and proceeds to fire off a long list of pertinent questions about who he wrote it for, is she dead? and if she's not dead why he is no longer with her. He is initially taken aback by her direct line of questioning, but she is not deterred. Delighted to discover that her new friend fixes vacuum cleaners for a living, she returns the next day to the same spot with her broken hoover in tow; cue me falling in love with the film.One of the most moving scenes takes place in her local music shop, home to ""the perfect piano."" They sit together - broken hoover abandoned behind them - and run through the chords of a song he has written. He asks tentatively if she can accompany him, and after a nervous slightly shaky start, the song Falling Slowly takes on a life of its own.I watched this bit three times.Falling Slowly scooped an Oscar this year for Best Original Song. As she was about to make her acceptance speech to Hollywood, Marketa Irglova was abruptly cut off by the orchestra, but returned to the stage moments later with a poignant speech applauding those who dare to dream; cue me falling in love with the film for a second time.ONCE was made in three weeks, with two digital cameras.

Once wasn't enough,"Independent films have the potential to be entertaining, wise, interesting and thought-provoking. They can also be a waste of $7 and a couple of hours out of one's life. Picking up the movie, ""Once"", was a risk worth taking. Starring Glenn Hansard and Marketa Irglova of ""The Frames"", the movie shows the intensity of drive when one is compelled by ones art. Glenn Hansard, in the opening scene, is busking in his home town of Ireland in between other jobs. His first love, music, drives him to this street corner to sing; it is also where he meets ""the girl"". She is both gifted and mysterious: with her persuasive demeanor, he discovers healing from a devastating romantic loss as well as the magic of recording his own music. In their relationship, he discovers the self he seems to have lost.The transcendent nature of this movie is found in both the relationship between the two lead characters as well as the music he writes. The song, ""Falling Slowly"", is sung with such melancholy at the beginning of the movie. Finding his voice  both musically and personally  he sings this song with passion and joy as he leaves for a season to go to London. The opening words of the song speak to longing for that which most people seek: ""I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that"". The seeking that these characters are doing model a spiritual journey that most of us find ourselves on when faced with loneliness, despair, brokenness. It's worth the exploration of discovering faith in the midst of darkness and music in the midst of silence: it's usually where God shows up.This is a small film with a beautiful story and worthy of the 86 minutes of viewing time  at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Brief Encounter - the Musical,"In many ways, Joe Carnahan's ONCE is a musical version of David Lean's BRIEF ENCOUNTER. The simple story of an aspiring musician and a Czechoslovakian cleaning woman who meet on the streets of Dublin and literally make beautiful music together is both conventional and original. ONCE is original in the way that it addresses the awkwardness of characters breaking into song. For the most part, the music we hear is being performed. It isn't something that only the characters hear. This prevents the tunes from clashing with the naturalistic setting, the gritty locales, the hand-held camera work. It's also just disarming enough to help us overlook that the story being told both apart from and through the music is essentially a romantic fairy tale. The title should clue us in to that.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Possibly the best ""music movie""","Describing this movie by using a genre is problematic, because if you use the phrase ""musical"" or ""music video"" there are a substantial number of people whose eyes will glaze over as they back away from you. But that is essentially what is being done here, in terms of technique: It takes the too-cramped promise of the self-contained ""story"" music video and unfolds it to a series of effortlessly connected segments that, on paper, would be called a ""musical."" The unfortunate baggage that accompanies both of those genres is why my favorite way to recommend this movie is ""See it! See it! SEE IT!!!!""""Once"" avoids both Hollywood and Broadway while managing to capture something elemental and deeply moving about the art of creating real music, the understandable dangers that can erode the dreams of creative people and the sacrifices that may be required to keep yourself on the path you believe is right.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Film I Love To Recommend,"Easily one of the most inventive and original films in decades, ""Once"" is a small film with huge likability. It is the story of an English busker who repairs vacuum cleaners and a Czech mother who does odd jobs to survive in Dublin.Without prologue, the film jumps straight into the action on the street, where the young couple meets. Though there are not sparks between them, we immediately sense that her open and inquisitive nature will break through his pragmatic street-wise façade. The rest of the story is just magic unfolding, complete with an organic musical soundtrack that becomes the focus of their lives and a symbol of hope.Two non-actors, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, portray the leads. Their talent for music is what makes this film so impressive, combined with director John Carney's bravery. It's a heady mix, and the viewer falls in love with the couple, the music, and the bohemian spirit of the film all at once.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are magical together, and the music they created here launched a worldwide tour where they performed these songs and more. ""Falling Slowly"" won the Oscar for Best Song, and the music store scene in which it is performed is movie gold.

A musical I actually enjoyed,"I'm not particularly fond of musicals. In fact, I think its safe to say I hate musicals. Once proves that there are always exceptions. It is an Irish film about two struggling musicians that cross paths. They find a common interest in music, which allows them to help each other out with their personal difficulties. I could have easily imagined this film going a little too far and losing its meaning, but it shows incredible composure and consistency in its themes.The acting is excellent from both significant and minor roles. The two main characters are acted by real-life musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. They are simply known as ""Guy"" and ""Girl"" rather than having actual names, which I think was a great decision. You can feel a relationship form between them, but at the same time that relationship is a practical impossibility. Their performances are extremely believable.The key part of any musical is a good music selection. Once certainly satisfies in this category; ""Falling Slowly"" deserves its Oscar and most of the other songs are nearly as beautiful. The film avoided cheesy or silly editing for the music segments, which I felt made it multitudes easier to watch than most other musicals.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Once. I came in skeptical, but at some point (not exactly sure when) it won me over. I must add that the ending sequence is flawless, especially the last camera pan. I genuinely cared for the characters.

A guy meets a girl and they make some songs, some really great songs, and eventually record them. It is a simple enough premise but Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova bring an enormous amount of power to the film - not with their acting ability (neither of them have ever acted before) but with their musicianship.

"A feast for music lovers, this award winning movie is a must see.","Wow. If I say that I am beating myself up for not getting tickets to the special screening with live performance and cast Q&A, followed up by hours of searching online for tickets to the next Frames gig, will that tell you what I think about this movie?Documentary style love story between a young Irish busker, a ""Hoover-fixer, sucker guy"" and 19 year old Czech immigrant will leave you longing for the unrequited love in your life. He plays guitar and writes songs trying to earn a few extra Euros in his father's Hoover fixing shop. Playing people's favourite during the day he delivers an emotional performance at night performing the songs written with his lost love in mind. This attracts the sympathetic ear of a lonely Czech girl who works in Dublin trying to make a living for herself and her daughter, after her own marriage broke up. The story revolves around their respective search for healing of their broken hearts and when they pair up in a powerful and soulful duet for the recording of his demo CD we see them find hope and rekindle their prior relationships. The music is beautiful and the great performances from Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are truly wonderful  the actors are actually the band members the story is about.

If I want to hear music, I'll ask for it. The whole business is just sappy. Maybe it's OK for free, but that I paid for it (well, used my hard-earned Amazon video credits) angers me.

Less like a H'wood or B'way musical; more like a low-key concert film with a story line,"I saw ""Once"" a few days ago, and I loved it.

I hope that my description of the film helps her quest to take her to the local art-house cinema to check it out. Here goes:It's an Irish indie film that centers around a couple of musicians working crummy jobs in Dublin and trying to mend their respective broken hearts. I recommend it highly, especially to those who enjoy raw, engaging musical performances.What if the film ""Woodstock"" were re-imagined as a conversation between Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell? One scene might show two cats frolicking in their yard as she gathers flowers. That evening, he lights a fire, and she places in a vase that he had purchased earlier that day.

She belongs at Woodstock, too, but she has to forgo the concert altogether as she's been booked on ""The Dick Cavett Show"".

There are a little bit bad characters, but the great music equals it. The idea of this movie is good and i think that it's amazing how this film with budget 150,000 earns many times more. Unknown people have turned into stars during night. There, in the Czech Republic they are unknown, because the premiere of movie is now, but I think that few weeks later they will be well-known in the Czech Republic too. Critique of this movie are different, but nobody can say that soundtrack is bad. Falling Slowly is excellent, but other songs are good too. That's all.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A complete original,"I was skeptical of a movie that was based on the repertoire of established musicians. That it seamlessly provided their wonderful music into an engaging fictional landscape is commendable. However, ""Once"" is not simply a film about music. It is an engaging film about the promise of a chance encounter, the recognition of talent, and the faith that talent can engender success. It also makes us care profoundly about the characters that inhabit it. Never before has a film incorporated music in the manner that ""Once"" has, and it resonates. That it was made on a $150 thousand budget is incomprehensible. That it has maintained a place in art house theaters for months since its release proves its power on its audiences. Hopefully, critics and awards voters will remember its importance at year's end.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Once in a blue moon movie,"Once in a blue moon comes a movie which sweeps you away with the honesty of filmmaking. This was available on Amazon Prime and I've heard good things about its soundtrack so checked it out. Boy was I glad.It is not the story narrative which appealed to me but filming of the slice of life unraveling complex human behavior of people struggling to make a living in Dublin. It's a musical which doesn't throw too much attention to music but the people. It's not fast paced - there is not forced ambition - just the experience of being human with sensitivity and compassion.The music matched songs - stood out with sensitive soothe and would definitely have you listening to them post watching the movie too.Small nuances like - the strings hanging from guitar / the girl dragging the vacuum cleaner on the streets and how pestering she was on the first meeting - cutely annoying (never thought I will use that phrase) / she not having batteries to play the CDs and getting them in the middle of the night singing lyrics was golden.The lead characters - never felt like they were acting. Nothing over the top and in the end you fall in love with the main characters. I will say, these are kind of movies which make movie lovers like me feel alive. Hope and wish we see more such movies at least once in a blue moon.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A film to watch over and over,"Once, is a brilliantly written musical/movie. Set in Dublin, it is the perfect backdrop for the central, working-class hero characters of the story:""Guy""(Glenn Hansard) and ""Girl""(Marketa Irglova). Once follows the characters from their initial meeting, through their whirlwind week together. Both struggling in their personal, as well as their musical lives, Irglova pulls off her inherent optimism of something better being out there, and it seems to rub off on the older, and more cynical Hansard. From the first time they hear each other play their music, a bond begins to slowly form, and the more they collaborate, the easier it is for them to tell their stories through their music. Unlike most of the bed-hopping two minutes after they meet material that has become the norm in modern film, Once uses a solid story line and the believability of its two main characters to make a story that, outside of a few curses, remains pure and enjoyable. Even the most cynical of sorts will be rooting for ""Guy"" and ""Girl"" to live out their dreams, and maybe even fall for each other. If you like good, folk-minded music, with some catchy beats, and excellent story telling, Once is film for you to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Loved the movie, loved the music","Well, to all of those who didn't ""get"" the movie, or ""get"" the music, I can only chuckle after watching it winning an Oscar last night for best original music.

And this single, little song was up against four others, including three from just one movie, so the odds were against them winning at every turn in the road.Oh, to see authentic joy instead of some weepy ""actress"" getting up and saying, ""Oh, boo hoo, I just can't believe this"" - I'm sure these two never did believe it, but accepted with grace and wonder and humility. Yea for them and every one actor out there who pursues their dreams.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
ONCE is too much.,"Often unintelligible Irish brogue (and Czech accent from the girl), a street beggar playing a busted guitar and howling incomprehensible lyrics, and a movie that went nowhere after one whole hour.

Once (8/10): A beautiful love letter for music aficionados,"""What's the Czech for ""Do you love him""?""It's going to be very difficult to find another romantic musical feel as natural as John Carney's Once. In most musicals when you hear the characters singing out their lines there is something that doesn't feel authentic about it and you're reminded that it's just a movie, but in Once every moment unfolds in such a natural way that at times it feels as if you're watching an intimate documentary of two passionate musicians. The relationship between the two leads also develops in a rather refreshingly authentic way and the story avoids all the worn out clichés found in most romantic films. The dialogue, the song writing, the performances, and the chemistry between the two leads makes Once a beautiful love letter for aspiring musicians everywhere. Made with an extremely low budget and interpreted by two non-professional actors (Glen Hansard is actually the band leader of The Frames in which Carney was once a member of), it still manages to be emotionally engaging. The performances are incredibly natural and intimate, but the cinematography does suffer a bit from the low budget because the camera work is pretty amateurish. The scenes that take place at night and the lightning aren't that great, but the story more than makes up for it. I'd say that it even helps make the experience all that more natural. There are even several spontaneous moments in the film that work to its advantage, such as the unscripted scene in which Hansard's character sings a song in the bus about how his heart was broken. It's a small film, but it hit all the right emotional chords in such a powerful way.The film begins in a rather funny note as the unnamed main character (Glen Hansard) is playing his guitar and singing for money in the streets of Dublin when all of a sudden a junkie takes his money and he chases him down through a couple of stores. One night as he is playing, an immigrant girl (Marketa Irglova) congratulates him for his music. The two begin talking about music and pretty soon they establish a nice friendship. He is living with his widowed dad (Bill Hodnett) and helps him fixing vacuum cleaners in his repair shop, and she sells flowers in the streets while trying to care for her mother (Danuse Ktrestova) and young daughter. He goes on to explain that his ex-girlfriend cheated on him and she's living in London now. The unnamed girl also tells him her story and explains that she is married but that her husband is living in the Czech Republic. The two married when she got pregnant but he had to return home. Despite being very fond of each other the two decide to remain friends. They collaborate together to make a music demo so that he can take with him to London to see if he can sign a music contract, and the film focuses on their time together during these days as they each share their stories and sing revealing songs to each other.It's refreshing to see a romantic film like this that feels so authentic and natural. It is more about two people who are very fond of each other and develop feelings for one another in a very honest way. Similar in style to Carney's Begin Again, the film focuses on a different kind of love and we see it in an early scene where the guy asks the girl to spend the night at his place and she immediately is offended and leaves. It's a simple story, but it tells it in a heartfelt way that is hard to ignore. At the same time the music also becomes part of the story and it builds it even more. Irglova and Hansard are delightful together and you really believe what they are feeling through their songs. They carry this lovely film in such a way that it makes most other romantic films seem completely fake. Add Once to the list of must see films for music aficionados because it is truly a wonderful experience and a well written love letter from Carney.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Realistic love story,"Brilliant - a movie that finally emotionally connects. It screams feeling and conveys a realistic love story that isn't saccharin or insincere. Photography is intimate and the lighting is entirely motivational providing a naturalistic look to the film that at times is very dark, but works really well. Soundtrack fits and enhances the passionate undertones. A must see film and reminds me why I fell in love with Dublin the first time!Once is a movie that you can see more than once and not lose interest. Great musical score that helped propel story.

The music is incredible, and actually properly manages to further the emotional aspects of the characters while making you bawl your eyes out(especially Falling Slowly). To summarize, the music feels real, the romance feels real, and, while some may not enjoy it for it's cheapness, it's definitely worth watching either way.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Excellent film about music,"For those who are wary of this film because it has been marketed as a 'musical', fear not. This is not a musical by any means. I understand that not everyone is keen on the style of movie where scenes are told through song and dance, but this is not that type of film.Yes, there is a lot of music in it, but only because the main characters are musicians and they share their music with each other just as real musicians might do in real life. There is nothing silly about this film and no one spontaneously breaks out into song and dance.It tells a simple, realistic, and thoroughly enjoyable story of a few days in the life of a busker (street musician) in Ireland and a young immigrant woman he befriends. This one is from the heart and it really strikes deep. It is exactly the kind of film that everyone needs in their life. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Return of 'The Blair Witch Project',"At Gitmo, one of the things the interrogators do to 'break' prisoners is to subject them to prolonged exposure to songs from TV's Sesame Street. It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture. Also at Gitmo, if a 'detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this. By the time I had sat through 'Once,' it seemed like I could vividly imagine just what those experiences must be like.'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.The musical performances in 'Once' are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness. They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset. Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a naïve, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback.This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this. In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot.This is 'The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house. It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 17. The pair are reported to 'dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not 'platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming.In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have a street musician move in with you, I strongly recommend this movie. It makes 85 minutes seem like a month.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Just pass by you, spend the most difficult time, go their own way.","There is a kind of temptation, called not to be together, but to keep a distance. The small-budget music movie ""once"", the song is very good, warm and natural. They like you and I have laughed, sang, and tacit understanding of the parting, everything is so romantic and pure. The life scene looks simple and daily, singing artist, unshaven, but not decadent, street flower girl, single mother, likes music but no one understands. They met as if something was supposed to happen, especially when one of them was playing the guitar, the other was playing the piano and singing ""Falling Slowly"" in chorus, but in the end they only met for once. ""once"" has several popular and sincere songs, they are the same as the temperament of the film, romantic and beautiful, no big ups and downs, but can really stay in people's hearts. There are many beautiful encounters in life, sometimes we meet bosom friends, sometimes we meet lovers, no matter which one, it is worth us to cherish.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

21st Century Take on Music and Love,"Loaded with so much interesting and original music, this film qualifies as a musical in a unique contemporary style. When Girl (played and sung by Markéta Irglová) strolls down a dimly lit street singing aloud to the music flowing into her earplugs, her song moves the plot along in ways new and sweet to 21st-century musical films. When Girl meets Guy (played by Glen Hansard), the no-name couple come together over his music in the streets of Dublin and discover each other's longings and disappointments. Eventually Girl, who happens to be an extraordinary piano player, helps Guy make a demo disc in the hope of landing a music contract. During the same short period in their complicated lives, more songs reveal the ways in which Guy and Girl are working through their past loves and their feelings for one another. What's even more impressive is that most of the songs in the film were written by Irglová and Hansard and ""Falling Slowly"" garnered the duo an Oscar for Best Original Song in 2007.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Charming,"Thinking about the title for the review I cannot think of anything else to say than ""charming"", yet this simple word perfectly and completely encompases my feelings towards the movie. It this point, I have seen the movie multiple times. I suspect, I will see it multiple more. It is one of the few ""Romantic"" movies I can stomach. The characters are 3 dimensional, each with their own baggage, and their relationship and chemistry is realistic and believable. This movie made me realise that I don´t have a problem with romance in movies per se, but with the unrealistic depictions of it in every other rom-com, where the characters have absolutely no reason to be attracted to each other, yet they are because plot. The story is a simple one of a street musician meeting a struggling immigrant girl, and they bond trough their love for music. There is no grand falling out, no real happyend. I guess there is an added level of enjoyment for me, since I speak fluent czech.The soundtrack is excellent. Their songs keep making it onto my ""current playlist"" again and again. Not only the songs themselves, but the depiction of musicianship, songwriting, recording and struggling get by seem realistic and as an (ex)musician myself I can appreciate and look at with nostalgia.I guess for a normal viewer, this movie sits rith about its current rating of about 7+/10, but with me the movie resonates on a level that I cannot give anything but full rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One,"... as in one Oscar nom and one Oscar (Academy Award if you will) win! Not so bad for a small (budgeted) movie like this one. But it's not always about the money. It's also about the actors, the (simple yet affecting) story and the heart of the movie. And this movie does have those things.Technically you could call it a musical, although it's not really (many songs, one of which won the Oscar). But it should still be a warning to those of you, who can't handle too many songs being played and/or a story moving forward through songs. Of course moving forward is a bit of a stretch. This is clearly a character developing movie, than a story developing one. If you think you can handle that and can watch a (love) story that feels real, than this movie is for you",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A delightful and gentle piece,Smooth and easy to watch would be my description of this one. You don't need to prepare yourself to embrace it. You just need to sit down and relax then let the screen brings you the delight.The peace and docile serenity grew into audience's emotion. I don't think audience wanted to see the happy ending. I didn't at all. It's the contemplation and muse we wanted for them not the startling and sensational. Both leading roles were played by non-professional actors may be the strongest suit for this movie. There is enough chemistry between them to create a melodrama but not full Romeo & Julia. It's refreshing and original. Unfinished romance is always close to the reality.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
...ONCE was a true love of mine!,"This is frequently compared with Before Sunrise, and I'm pretty sure Careny viewed Linklater's first installment in his Before trilogy as an inspiration making this little indie gem. Never have I ever thought I would be once again overwhelmed by the same emotions while watching Before Sunrise for the first time, let alone from watching another film. But whilst the conversations and what they offer of random insights of life form the true essence of Linklater's masterpiece, as well as the bulk of his body of work; Carney's propensity to infuse the spirit of music in his movies and his knack for making it find its way across them has never been so palpable, and so prominent, as it is here. Not only is ""Guy"" and ""Girl""'s mutual passion for music the force that draw them together, but it's also their way of communicating their feelings with each other; a language that's more expressive and revealing than either English or Czech. It's one of these movies that have music as an integral part of them so much so they can nearly be classified as Musical films. Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born is a case in point. Correspondingly, the movie channels empathy in all of us, something that's further bolstered by the impactful and raw soundtrack that seems to capture the heart and soul of busking, and the hand-held camera and grainy images that lended a sense of realism to this sensational experience. What held Once back from a higher score is that it seemed that the two leads' consequences of their past loves that hinder their relationship suddenly popped into their minds, as if they've been quite oblivious to them except at some exact point. That's why the denouement feels abrupt to me. Still, Once is quite possibly my new favourite Carney.(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It may work or may not work on you - but you should definitely try,"This is the first movie ever to receive a 9/10 from me - and it is with some hesitation that I decided not to rate it a perfect 10.It appears to me that there are two kinds of people in the world: Those that are captivated by the magic, the sheer beauty of both the pictures and, above all, the music - and those who aren't, who feel rather indifferent and basically remember this film only as a waste of 85 minutes of their time. You won't know whether you are part of the latter, or - like me - of the first group of viewers before you actually go and see it. But even the slightest chance that you might belong to those who do connect largely justifies the effort of the above mentioned 85 minutes and a few bucks.

"Touching, heartfelt, and raw. Sweet little film.","What is life but a series of moments and memories where we experience joy, hope, pain, sorrow, happiness, and sadness with one another? Those people we see and interact with in our lives, they become our friends and maybe lovers. They end up etching special places in our hearts. It is the place where raw feelings, emotions and memories coincide, that evoke emotions that are so raw and heartfelt when conveyed through music.Music has the power to convey the deep raw feelings and emotions that are stored in a person's heart openly. Through music, we the listeners can attune and resonate with the singer at a deep emotional level like a bond.This film is about an older, struggling musician who one day meets a girl. This isn't your typical rom-com movie. It is more like a slice of life, a glimpse into a life of a person as he moves through moments in his life. From the first encounter, a relationship develops. It grows and deepens until one day you miss them, their company and presence.It is in these little moments, these small interactions with one another, e.g. Getting to know someone, hanging out with them, singing songs together, sharing life together, where bonds form and relationships grow. They can be friendships or they can be something more.This movie is a refreshing take of guy meets girl set in the backdrop of modern Ireland with two struggling, working class characters who share something in common.

What the struggling music scene is like in Ireland,"(2007) Once
MUSICAL DRAMAAlready aware that this film was an Oscar winner for Best song at the Oscars for Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova and already made some assumptions about what their relationship is really like and by the time the film was over- the film was not exactly what I expected to be since its best described as a semi- documentary style convenvenient to the two leading stars of Glen and Martika. Like ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Paranormal Activity"", and ""Cloverfield"" the overall film is somewhat improvised in which the film showcases how two mature adults get together because of their passion for music! The film starts off with Glen playing his guitar on a sidewalk for change until a stranger (Martika) comes up to him and starts commenting about his playing- as soon as they coincide is when more revelations about who and what they re while living on the poor streets of Dublin, Ireland! Whats really fascinating is the backdrops as well as the possibilities of what life is like living as a low class musician in Dublin, Ireland which can be a similar lifestyle somewhere else for instance playing for a meal! When the film was over I ended up with more questions than answers such as how much is this relationship is true and how much of this is improvised in terms of the percent of the overall film. And although the DVD offers interviews by its two leading actors as well as the director of the film- I didn't really care since the overall film has a beginning, a middle and an end.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Charming (!) little film,"I didn't really know what to expect from Once, a film that my girlfriend and I quickly picked out as lighter viewing from the slightly Hollywood rom-com esque DVD case. I went into the film with basically no conception of what it was going to be about, and didn't really know it was a 'musical'. Perhaps if I had I wouldn't have gone for it which would have been a real shame.I don't know whether it's because Hansard and Irglova are effectively playing themselves (and within their own musical comfort zone) but the grittiness alongside the musical chemistry (chemistry that all happens rather quickly!) makes the film.I hesitate to use the word charming, as I'm sure it has been written in about 99% of all the critic and user reviews, but it really is a lovely little film that feels like it (and did) cost almost nothing to make.

"I Eleven was Blind, but Now I See","If you are anything like me, and you should thank your personal God that you are not, you sometimes ""save"" a movie to watch when the time is right. For example, as a 14-year-old in March 1992 since I missed seeing Boyz N the Hood in the theater I eagerly rented the VHS from the nearby Stars and Stripes Video Store the first day the tape came out. Our family had company at the house that afternoon, and they really wanted to see the movie. Sorry Rich and Ted, but this one had to be screened alone in a dark room without any interruptions such as your hypothetical reactions or the slightest human breathing. Fast forward 30 years.I don't know exactly when I became aware that this movie was something I would probably like. It was just always there, waiting for me like a half-remembered Twinkie from 2007. Finally in January 2022 I decided the time was right to eat that Twinkie. Some things are worth waiting for, and other things are Die Hard 5. You may see this on a standardized test someday: Once is to Die Hard 5 as Die Hard is to (blank). The answer is Rocky V.Once I saw Once, once I saw Once for the second time the next day, once I saw Once for the third time the day after that, once I did all of those things the scales fell from my eyes and I could finally see. I could see why the makers of an Irish film titled it Once, the Spanish word for eleven. I could see why I related so much to these two unnamed main characters. I could even see, finally and for once, the purpose and meaning of human existence as we understand (or do not understand) it. For the first two I will explain below. For the third you will just have to hope you can someday acquire a copy of my as now unfinished book (spoiler: it doesn't have anything to do with the plot of this movie, it was just a coincidence that I was watching it at the time, but still that has to mean something).Perhaps no film better delivers on the promise of its opening line in so many ways as this one does, with the Guy (Glen Hansbard) beautifully foreshadowing (captured mid-song) ""the healing has begun."" And it has, for him, for the Girl (Marketa Irglova), for anyone watching who is hurting in some way. By the time the two play their first song together, in a mostly-empty music shop, you either buy in completely to this thing or else you hate it. If it is the latter then I don't know what to tell ya man, kick rocks. Actually no, leave those rocks unkicked. If you think the music is awful then you can enjoy the film in an entirely different way, the story of two terrible musicians who delude themselves into thinking they have something to share with the world and you can let your imagination run wild thinking of all the crushing disappointments they will suffer (after the events depicted in the film) before finally being spit out the bottom of the theme park singing character industry.If you have read some of my other re-views (or even just this one) you might be thinking ""this guy is a few strings short of a fully functioning guitar upstairs."" Well, what if you were in the Dublin commercial district and saw a young woman walking her vacuum cleaner down the street by its hose like a bulldog on a leash? What if not long after that you were outside a convenience store in the same area late night and saw the same young lady in pajamas and fuzzy slippers walking the streets singing to her Discman. What if the guy that fixed your vacuum cleaner sat in his bedroom at Dad's house writing countless melancholy songs about the ex-girlfriend who broke his heart and then played them on an empty street with the volume on his imaginary amp turned up to an eleven? It all makes sense in context, just as every word of every re-view I have written on this site is as normal and sane as the words Moses once heard coming from that burning bush.Now about that title, the main reasons to believe this film's name was intended to mean Eleven (in English) are:1. If you feel these songs you will listen to them for at least 11 straight days after you first hear them.2. 11 is the number for ""will they or won't they"" couples. For clarification the number for actual couples is 2, swinger couples 21, and the number for participants in an unattached menage is not 3 but rather 111.3. If 10 is the number of ultimate perfection (10/10 as a rating scale for example) then 11 is post-perfection (you can't spew cliches like ""giving 110%"" or ""I give it an 11/10"" without an 11 in there somewhere). This film therefore might just receive the coveted Doce de Once Estrellas.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
It's just so... genuine,"So I really didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. Like, is it a tacky musical? Can anything good come out of a budget that low? What's the reason behind all of this commotion?And well, I got some pretty good answers.First off; no, it's not a tacky musical. It's a beautiful movie about two hopeless musicians who fins each other and make some darn good music. Yes, there are quite a few songs in this movie, but they're more like ''a scene where they happen to sing a song'' and not so much ''this is a really weird dialogue that could've never happened in real life''. So if there's anyone with the same stupidity as me out there, it's a music film, not a musical.Second up; yes, good things can come from a budget like this. It is, of course, at times obvious that they had a limited budget making this movie, but the latest techniques and tricks shouldn't be your reason to watch and enjoy this movie. As a matter of fact I think that the low budget helped this movie become what it is and to achieve those qualities that I so love about it; that it's genuine and down to earth. It just wouldn't have been the same with a lot of fancy extras and some fancy cameras. This way, they've had to focus on the main things that they want to communicate which I think is that life moves quickly you just gotta hop on, see where it takes you and be alright with the fact that you can't have it all.Lastly; I now get the commotion. 'Once' is a beautiful movie tackling some big questions that we all have in life. It has an authenticity that comes both from the actors, environments and that low budget feel that sometimes sneaks up on you.Great movie, do watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you like the songs, you'll have fun","I just watched Once and, to be honest, I was disappointed. It's not that I think the songs were too shallow or that I was expecting something along the lines of musicals like Dreamgirls - I just felt like the story was going nowhere, and although I quite liked the ending, I didn't fall in love with the film. I think that in this case you have to love the music to love the film, and these just aren't the kind of songs I go for. Also, I like watching actors in films. I'm not saying that they should've cast Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, just that maybe I would've liked it better if they had cast actors that could sing (like in Across the Universe) instead of musicians that try to act. I've seen far worse, and I can totally see why people like the two leads, but then they've just got different taste in what they value most in a film. As to the simplicity of the story, I agree that it's fitting and works most of the time, but that one scene at the bank seemed very out of place to me. Once really plays like a feature-length music video, so if you would like to watch these two musicians performing a few songs with a nice little story around that, go for it, I'm sure you'll have fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Forgettable songs, no story to speak of","I know a lot of people love this little indie musical, and that it even has come to Broadway, but I found this terribly dull. In fact, I would have stopped watching early on if I hadn't been watching with my girlfriend, who had seen it before and inexplicably wanted to see it again.To me, there is very little to recommend this. There is little story, since most of the movie is made up of people singing, sometimes while sitting and sometimes while standing. The songs themselves are not especially interesting; the only one I liked at all was the first one sung together by the two leads, and even though it was nice enough, it's not like I would actually pursue listening to it again.Basically, people meet, write songs, sing songs, talk about writing songs, and that's about it. Yes, there's the occasional talk about something other than songs, like relationships, and there is some stuff unspoken that might appeal to people who like things that are unspoken, but you have to really want to see a movie where people sit around and sing bland songs to fully enjoy this.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

not even worth seeing once,"I found this movie to be utterly boring and shallow. It's void of any plot depth and is basically a boy meets girl story.The music is decent but the music video aspect of the movie gets old after the first song, and by the forth song where it's just overly dramatic closeups of the main characters face, you wonder ""why am I watching this?"" ""Spielberg level"" emotional manipulation is apparent throughout the movie, though without the cute face of E.T. staring at you it is through the form of bleak landscapes and boring conversations.If you want a better movie, see almost anything else.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't believe the hype,"I don't want to sound like a begrudger but I thought this movie was terrible. Terrible acting, terrible script and it looked so terrible it made my head hurt. If you like the music great (i didn't), but beyond that what is there?I admit that there were some great moments of humor, especially the pre-title sequence, but that only served to whet the appetite. when the entreé arrived it tasted of ash.The buzz around Once reminds me of moving statues i.e a load of nonsense that vast numbers of the gullible Irish population buys into.Pardon my negativity, I may have made the mistake of seeing 'This is England' in the same week. now there's a film.Complete rubbish in my opinion. Lets hope that this is not the future of Irish cinema (on that note can't wait to see 'Garage')",1.0,Anonymous,Music
once is more than enough,"OK, I am ASTOUNDED by the attention and praise this movie got. They didn't have enough story content written so decided to fill up the time with full length songs, some repeated several times. (Subliminal message: buy the soundtrack, buy the soundtrack...) Oh, the girl and the guy are cute together; great chemistry. And frankly we should have explored that more...but no. Lets swear and cut to yet another song, that sounds very much like the last one. The editing was bad, the pace was flat, but like I said, you need more story to work with. There's no climax at all. So, the film is about songwriting and musicians? OK, lets compare this film with...""The Commitments."" ""Hard Days Night."" ""Shine."" ""Amadeus."" Or even the more trite ""You Light Up my Life"". It pales in comparison. I guess you can film in Ireland, say 'foock' a lot and get a high rating on this site. (See quotes page). Oscar for best original song...sure. I'm OK with that. But the film script suffered from poor character development and plot progression.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Quite Awful,"I was not amused, entranced or inspired by this amateurish presentation of whiny people singing whining songs; songs that all seem to include bar after bar of wordless screeching. The photography is distractingly bad, the sound (for a so-called musical) is mushy and lacks dynamic range, and the performances are somnolent. If you want an ""Irish musical"" with fire and characters about whom you can care, rent ""The Commitments"".I don't know John Carney or Glen Hansard or any of the back-story to their relationship, and it shouldn't matter -- the film stands or falls on its own merits and in my opinion, it falls, with a whimper, not a bang. The characters don't grow or change, or come to mean any more to each other than they do to us.Faint praise: I hope the image of a girl wandering the streets dragging her Hoover about by its hose was intended sexual humor.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Most overrated by critics - Warning Spoilers,"I was really excited to see this film. It has already been making top lists of the year and no one seemed to have anything critical to say. I enjoy independent film and love foreign cinema, and I love romantic films. But I'm really getting tired of all the kudos this film is getting as I found it to be extremely disappointing.The film is boring, first of all. I have no problems seeing slow films, especially if the cinematography is beautiful and interesting. However, this film had no storyline and the mise-en-scene was pretty non-existent. At times it felt like watching a music video, a really boring music video. Without a solid plot line, no character development, and coincidental situations, there was only one thing holding this movie together: the music.I found the music to be just as redundant as the lack of dialogue. The same chorus lines are repeated, there's emotion for a lack of reason, and it sounded one step above any mainstream band or artist currently being played on the radio.The one attribute I am especially tired of hearing about is the realism in the story. I found it to be extremely unreal. Everything seems to work out for the characters - she has a piano she can just play on for free, he jumps in with his music, they sound so great together, they get a loan to rent a studio, studio technician loves what they do, they manage to record their first song practically perfect, the characters fall in love despite him getting over a broken heart and her still being married to a horrible husband, and then it doesn't work out.I'd like to know why? It seems like the love of his life stomped on his heart and her husband, who is in another country, doesn't appreciate her. After spending only one magical weekend recording their perfect demo, her husband suddenly comes back the next day. That seems as coincidental as them meeting on the street. And he decides to go to London, armed with his demo, to win back his ex-girlfriend. How is any of this realistic?! I am not unfeeling, I just have better taste in movies. I feel like many critics viewed this film at a festival and swooned over the energy that sometimes exists at these types of events. If someone wants to see an independent film, go see ""Paris, je t'aime."" It's more worth the money.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Fantastic Music and Weak Acting,"Once follows two people: a busker/songwriter and a young woman with a broken vacuum cleaner.As expected of John Carney, the music is great. And similar to his latest film, Sing Street, he is very aware of that and spends at least a solid 1/3 of this movie in song. Most of the music is heard all the way through, and thankfully the music is good so it makes it just that much easier to sit through. While I didn't like the music as much as Sing Street and I think that it did get redundant after a while, thus reducing its rewatchability, it was still good and it's a soundtrack that I plan on revisiting.As for the writing and directing, both were kind of off and on. While the hand-held camera use was suited to making the movie somewhat more lifelike (like a documentary), it could be somewhat nauseating and difficult to keep up with. The directing also seemed like a cop-out for the often faulty writing that proved to be rather unconvincing and awkward at times. But at the same time the music is well-written and some of the dialogue is really good too.My biggest problem with the movie, however, was Markéta Irglová. Her acting ranged from fine to just plain stale. There were so many points where I audibly remarked on how bad her acting was, despite being completely alone on my couch. The rest of the acting is mostly fine, but she was just so wooden. Her lines were delivered with no emotion or tone or anything whatsoever most of the time. It was as if she was just reading her lines off a nearby sheet of paper. Her best acting seemed to come from when she forgot her lines and stumbled over them, which at the least added some naturalism to them.Overall Once is good, but it's ultimately weighed down by inconsistent writing and directing and some poor acting. Sure the music is great, but as a movie it's okay. It's like John Carney didn't know how to get his music out into the world without performing it, so he made a movie about it and didn't hold back. In the end I would really only recommend the movie to select people, specifically ones who would like the musical aspect.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Czech Cinderella meets broken-hearted hoover fixer guy,"Markéta Irglová is super cute with her garbled accent and fingerless gloves, walking a broken vacuum cleaner like a sick dog with blue fur and no legs. When she sneaks into a a music store to practice the piano while they're closed for lunch, the hoover fixer (Glen Hansard) asks her: ""Did you write that?"", and she replies: ""No, Mendelssohn did"". It's straight out of ""The man who wasn't there"" of course, only hoover fixer and his date have traded places with Billy Bob Thornton and Scarlett Johansson. But ""Once"" is the kind of movie you can't possibly stay angry with for very long. The script doesn't do much explaining, which I think is a good thing. I also liked the fact that it doesn't have a proper ending. Like a true story, it's just sort of fades away. Unfortunately, the sound is terrible, especially for a film that is all about music, and what the Irish seem to think of as English will leave most audiences dumbfounded. In short, ""Once"" is screaming for a Hollywood remake. I'm thinking Liam Gallagher and Milla Jovovich.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
This Movie Is a Joke,"It's hard for me to not like a music-related movie, but this guy's songwriting and singing/playing ability was so lacking that it was hard to watch. I cringed every time he opened his mouth or took the guitar out of his git-bag.
There is no way that a woman who plays as well as she did would ever become interested in such talentless music. After the scene at the music instrument shop, when he stood there wide-eyed while she played, I was hoping that when she finished, he would beg her to make him a better musician.
Then, they walk into a record company with a cassette in a portable desktop unit and actually have the nerve to play it for the guy. Absolute rubbish.
There is no real chemistry between the two, no real romance or showings of affection. He did want to boink her, and I'll give him a half point for that, but he shot and missed.
The potential for so many good scenes were missed in this movie. As it is, the dialogue and screenplay are abysmal. I don't know who is a more talentless hack, the singer/guitarist or the producer of this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"A warm, music-filled love story, but overrated by critics.","The action of this film takes place in Dublin, Ireland, and shows the story of a young man, willing to be a musician, who plays in the streets. There, he meets a beautiful immigrant girl who is also attracted to the world of music. Both are young, and the romantic attraction between them gradually becomes more obvious, despite the fact that she has a husband in her country (the Czech Republic) and he has a girlfriend who recently moved to London without him.It is a relatively simple story, where two young people cultivate common interests and a friendship that may, or may not, lead to something more. For me, and although the film manages to avoid cheap sentimentality and empty and worn out romantic clichés, it is a very scarce script for a feature film, and on several occasions I felt that the film did not have a story to tell, just a succession of melodies and songs that were appearing one after the other, and that I felt were there to fill space and time. The film is very sweet, romantic and light, but it is not incredible, and I feel that it was also overestimated by the critics, especially since it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Song (which, by the way, it came to collect).The cast's work is heavily penalized by the absence of material to work with and by a set of characters that were only slightly outlined and underdeveloped. The two co-protagonists, Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová, nevertheless, did a job that can be considered decent: they look quite natural and their chemistry is good, although neutral and drowned out by their gifts as singers.Technically, the film has ups and downs, but the very low production budget does not allow for great flights. The sound and the soundtrack clearly stand out, with some very high quality songs (the highlight goes, of course, to the song ""Falling Slowly"") and others that seem somewhat improvised. What I hated the most ended up, therefore, being the use of hand-held cameras and a shaky and tiring cinematography.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
My mistake was in seeing the Broadway show first,"What I liked best about the Broadway show - the ensemble actors as musicians and singers as well as actual characters - is not in the film at all. ""Gold"" is absolutely magical onstage but pretty boring in the film, and the songs - just not good enough to carry a film where there are basically only two performers, two characters.

A well-told little tale.,"""Once"" demonstrates that entertainment can be made for what was likely less than 3 weeks craft services budget on ""Avatar."" It recounts a week in the life of a busker and an immigrant hustler who find inspiration to take a leap of faith to move forward rather than continuing to rely on excuse that start with ""once..."". Despite being unnamed the lead character quickly become important to the audience in a way CGI-driven leads in ""Avatar"" and the film that beat it for the Best Film Oscar ""The Hurt Locker"" never did. The music feels authentic as does the dialog and plot again in contrast to most of the implausible story lines fostered on today's audience. However, all this simplicity comes at a price. This is a short story with a plot that feels more like a transitional chapter than a complete tale of any sort. While Hansard and Irglova produce touching music together, there really isn't much of it and the third time around the same duet tends to lose some of its charm. In short it worth watching unless you haven't seen the somewhat similar (also about musicians at the career crossroads in Dublin) ""The Commitments"" in which case see that instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Hear my song,"Once is a nice twee film that by and large avoids the 'Oirish' stereotypes and tries to be true to its feelings even though it is bittersweet.The main characters are nameless. He is a busker trying to make a living when someone is not stealing his takings and also repairs vacuum cleaners in his father's repair shop. She is a Czech immigrant who asks him to repair her vacuum cleaner and she also plays piano.Together they meet and decide to produce and record music together, he writes a song to win his ex-girlfriend back who is in London. She has a toddler living with her and her mother as well as a husband back in the Czech republic.The film has been compared to 'Brief Encounter', I see it as an urban, streetwise romantic drama which certainly dangles a sweet love story but also hints that they have other factors that threaten to keep them apart.

Heart-warming but not that special,"Films do not come much 'smaller than this 2006 offering, written and directed by the Irish John Carney and shot in Dublin with a skeleton crew in a mere 17 days on a couple of shaky camcorders. It looks dark and fuzzy and amateurish, but it has a soul, thanks largely to the warmth of the two central characters, played by the Irish Glen Hansard and the Czech Markéta Irglová, both chosen for their musical skills and not for any acting ability.The story is very slight but life-affirming: Hansard's Guy (he is not named) getting round to recording an album one weekend - instead of delaying the project, as so many musicians do, to 'once' something or other has been done - with the support of the much younger Girl (who is also not named), in the process finding a powerful bond. Hansard and Irglová wrote and performed all the new songs.I did not catch the film until seven years after its release by which time it had become something of a phenomenon, winning an Academy Award for Best Song and forming the basis of an award-winning musical. I'm not sure it's really that special, but it is is always good to see a poorly-funded movie make a breakthrough and it is a heart- warming little treat.",,Anonymous,Music
Watching Something Real,"Very rarely do I watch a film these days without looking for the joins or finding myself bored with what's going on the screen. I even switch off mentally and come back into a film later as they've failed to keep my interest. This film had me searching out for information about the musicians involved as it captured my interest and it didn't let go. Yes, I saw the sound boom in the studio reflection and yes I saw the street kids following the camera but you know what I couldn't care less because I though I was 'watching something real'. The way they look at each other and listen to each others words and playing tells you this is something real. They are either the worlds greatest actors or we were watching something real? You decide for yourself. The problem with IMDb is it attracts comments from people who haver nothing to say and no doubt they'll try and throw that back at me but you know what I couldn't care less. I loved this film and it's music and want to be young again so I can learn to play the guitar, busk in the streets of Dublin and have someone come up to me with words telling me they love my music. If a movie can do that for you I would suggest its worth watching.",,Anonymous,Music
