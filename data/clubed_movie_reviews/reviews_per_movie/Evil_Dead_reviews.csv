"I wasn't expecting much, rather surprised.","We seem to be in a time where the remakes of remakes will be remade, even films like Cabin Fever aren't remaining sacred, the obligatory remake follows.Evil Dead now is a remake with a bit of bite, of course it has every possible cliche under the sun ticked off. We have the obligatory character coming out of the ground with long stringy hair, we have the trapdoor, the book of death, and of course the vomiting. Despite all the blatant lack of any sort of imagination Evil Dead somehow manages to capture the imagination, and provide ninety minutes of quite thrilling entertainment.The scares are plentiful, and the acting is such that you believe in the pain, physical and mental, it really is quite well made. Effective use of special effects and music.Not a film I'd look to watch on a regular basis, but it's somehow rather refreshing. 7/10Please enough with the remakes though.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy,"So I've read here and there that this remake lacks the camp of the original. And I look back over 20 years ago, watching The Evil Dead on a crummy rental VHS, in the dark of my teenage bedroom one night. The camp? The original Evil Dead was a terrifying experience, even with Bruce Campbell's over the top performance, the film was a scare-fest, a terrifying trip even nearly ten years after its release. The camp was in Evil Dead 2, an horror comedy remaking the original already, technically.This remake finds many way to bow to the original, aside the obligatory visual quotes. The use of practical effects, notably, in an era of CGI- filled movies, is extremely refreshing. The gore feels painful, makes you cringe, churned my stomach. It successfully palliates a somewhat shallow characterization that makes it difficult to root for the characters (with the exception of Mia, who owes a lot to a really visceral performance by Jane Levy.)And this is where Evil Dead 2013 took me by surprise. After roughly a first half of the movie taking Evil Dead fans by the hand towards hashed and rehashed territories, making them doubt that this was a good idea at all, the movie lets go of your hand and you're alone, in the middle of the woods, and it's dark and there's strange noises all about... and then limbs start flying.I won't get into conjectures that the highly conventional and overly familiar first half was made that way with the sole purpose of placing the audience in their comfort zone, only to give more impact to the second half... but I would surely ask Fede Alvarez if I was to interview him.Evil Dead 2013 is a treat for the fans of gore and horror, in any case. Another reminder that out of ten awful remakes, sometimes one rises to the top and delivers. Not for the faint of heart, for sure, but if you're a true horror fan, and even more, if you miss your old school, gruesome gore rides, this one is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Powerful practical effects, a surprise final act and a straight-horror vibe differentiate this from the original.","A straight horror vibe, some extreme cringe-inducing gore and a surprise final act do enough to differentiate this from the original, but it can't top the raw charm of the cult classic. 'Evil Dead (2013)' is a commendable effort, though. It's certainly one of the better remakes I've seen. The film captures what it is that Raimi and company would have gone for if they had the budget and experience to do so back in 1981, achieving that over-the-top but seemingly 'realistic' gore-fest feel that makes it not for the squeamish. It's probably one of the goriest films I've seen, with powerful practical effects grounding everything in reality and capturing the spirit of the original. Having rewatched 'The Evil Dead (1981)' fairy recently, I think it's safe to say that it isn't just nostalgia that drives me when I say I much prefer the zaniness of the original to the more refined approach of this one. Though I would rather watch Raimi's picture, Alvarez's outing does more than enough to set itself apart from its source material and, as such, isn't actually competing for your attention. It's its own thing and all the better for it. It's a really solid effort, actually, despite some clunky dialogue and a cast of mostly generic characters. That's really impressive considering the lasting, palpable yet intangible allure of the original 'video-nasty' that everyone loved to hate and now just loves to love. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love it,"One of my favourite horror movies. It satisfies my need for horror from the beginning till the end . Watched it several times 😄
Was surprised the first time I saw it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good for a remake,"I have to say, starting out, that Sam Raimi's original EVIL DEAD trilogy has been a favourite of mine ever since I saw it as a teenager. While EVIL DEAD 2 was the best of the three films, for me, a pitch-perfect comedy/horror, and ARMY OF DARKNESS was a funny, cheesy comedy, the first film was a gruelling terror flick made on a teensy budget...and it worked. Everything about it gelled, and it remains effective to this day, despite the cheesiness of the low-budget effects work.This remake thankfully changes things around a bit story-wise, so that even the many fans of the original movie will find themselves guessing as to what's about to happen next. It's a film made very much in the spirit of the first film, and that makes it pretty good for a remake. The same suspense is there, the pulse-pounding question of who's going to be affected next by the curse, while at the same time it's given some Hollywood slickness to offset the original's grubby, zero-budget charm.And, perhaps most surprisingly of all, the gore quota has been ramped up considerably. This is one of the most extremely vicious and nasty films I've seen in a long time, in which the various set-pieces of gore are difficult to watch; let's just say that the chainsaw stuff hinted at back in the 1980s is shown in full force here. Production values are more than adequate and the cast are pretty good, too. Is this as good as the original? No, it lacks the genuine fright-factor even if the ickiness is there...but at the same time it won't disappoint modern horror fans with its blend of demonic possession and outrageous violence.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you like bloody movies, this one is made for you!","Evil Dead is a remake of the 1981 original ""the Evil Dead"". I didn't have the chance to watch the original yet, so I'm going to review this without comparing it with the original.The movie actually starts out pretty slow, for the first 40 minutes there isn't any creepy parts and it actually bores me. Usually, movies start off slow to develop they're characters or stories, however, I find the first 30 minutes unnecessary. However, Evil Dead deserves its wait. Evil Dead has some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes I've seen in movies. There's blood EVERYWHERE and the movie make them look real good! The movie mostly uses makeups and proves that a bloody movie can stand by its own without CGI.Another thing I like about Evil Dead is the directing. There are many beautifully-shot scenes which makes the movie very enjoyable. For example, the director sets the cameras in different angles, such as the floor or close to the wall, which makes it extraordinary from other films.On the other hand, Evil Dead lacks character developments, but for its own sake, bloody horror doesn't really need character developments. Characters make stupid decisions and eventually will die out one by one, so it's not really a big deal.There isn't really a plot or twists in Evil Dead. Everything is presented directly. If you haven't watch this without watching the trailers, the movie is what you thought it will be.Evil Dead is enjoyable for a movie night if you do not care too much on the details. Just sit back and enjoy the gore, it's real fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
From Classic Horror to Ultimate Terror,"I have to start by saying that Sam Raimi's original EVIL DEAD trilogy has been a personal favorite since my teenage years. EVIL DEAD 2 stands out as the best of the three for me, striking the perfect balance between horror and comedy, while ARMY OF DARKNESS leans more into its goofy, cheesy charm. But it's the first EVIL DEAD that delivers a relentless, low-budget terror that still packs a punch today, even with its undeniably campy effects.This remake, thankfully, shakes things up just enough in the story to keep even hardcore fans of the original on their toes. It manages to stay true to the spirit of the original film while adding a modern touch. The same suspense lingers throughout, that heart-pounding question of who's next to fall victim to the curse. However, it's all slicked up with a Hollywood polish that contrasts with the scrappy, zero-budget feel of the original.What really took me by surprise was just how much the gore has been cranked up. This is one of the most brutal, visceral horror films I've seen in years, with several scenes so intense they're hard to watch. The chainsaw scenes teased back in the '80s? They're here in full, bloody force. The production values are solid, and the cast does a decent job with what they're given.Is it as good as the original? No, it doesn't quite capture that raw, terrifying edge, but it sure does deliver on the gross-out factor. For modern horror fans, it's a blood-soaked thrill ride, mixing demonic possession with over-the-top violence in a way that won't disappoint.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another throw-it-in-the-pile generic modern horror remake with no identity of its own,"There was a time that I gave horror remakes the benefit of the doubt. The Dawn of the Dead remake wasn't so bad for what it was. The Fright Night remake actually did a decent amount of justice for its source material. But then, you stop and realize how short Hollywood has come up in terms of original ideas and cool scares. Nowadays it seems to be a) remakes b) torture porn c) possession movies(these have got to go) d) more remakes. Heck, the last original and clever horror movie I saw was Cabin in the Woods, which was actually a horror themed comedy rather than a true horror film.Sadly, the Evil Dead remake turned out to be just as disappointing and toothless as I expected it to be. No, this film does not improve on the original. No, it does not become a good horror film in its own right. Yes, you have seen pretty much everything in this film before. Yes, you're better off watching anything from the original trilogy.I read an interview with director Fede Alvarez which had him say something along the lines of ""When I saw the 80's Fly, I didn't care about the original 50's version. That was the Fly to me"" OK Fede.....point taken. But the 80's Fly was directed by David Cronenberg, who at that point was already a seasoned director who had over 10 years of experience under his belt and who is known for innovative styles and concepts. Alvarez has none of that. As I understand it his background is mainly short films. Perhaps I should familiarize myself with his previous work, but let me just say he does nothing to make Evil Dead his own movie. All I saw were some nifty lighting choices and camera angles.But then again, there's nothing about this Evil Dead that makes it it's own movie. You have impossibly hot actresses who still look hot even when they're shivering and drenched in gore. You have the same hyperactive MTV-style editing that any supernatural or slasher film these days has. You have poor attempts at making this a ""serious"" film. Seriously, the original was about rapist trees and crazed demons! How ""serious"" does it have to be? You have any number of tropes and clichés which make this an ultimately forgettable affair. And on top of that you have no actors or characters who grab the eye. Imagine that Ash's sister Linda was an irritating coke addict instead of a weird psychic girl. Then subtract Ash. There's your Evil Dead.One thing that made the original have such charm is that it wasn't just a low budget film, it was practically a student film! I know....it's a big fanboy gripe, but I found myself longing for the original whilst sitting through this Bruce Campbell-less bore fest.The hype machine and rent-a-critic tactics will likely make this a relative box office success. I hope it is a last gasp.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Masterpiece.,"The Good: The common criticism of 2013's Evil Dead is that it lacks the humor and heart of the original films (this is a bit of revisionist history, since Sam Raimi's original was not really a horror comedy, as people tend to remember). There is no Ash, there is no absurdist humor, there are no crazy camera angles...I get it. This is an almost joyless, intense, brutal film.And yet, every time I watch this with people, they're amazed by this movie. It's a movie that elicits laughs not through comedy but through discomfort and fear. It's a movie so absurd because of the situation; the buckets of blood, the shocking violence. It's a genuinely terrifying movie at times.Evil Dead is what the film needed to be in 2013. Fede Alvarez doesn't seem like he hates the originals and wants to replace them. He wants them updated. Because let's be honest, the sort of campy, light hearted horror fare of the 80s just can't work today. And besides, why try and emulate Sam Raimi when the man is still alive and making movies? For that, I think Alvarez actually did the right thing in making his own version.This Evil Dead excels where it really counts; it's scary as hell, one of the goriest films I've ever seen, hits all the right notes, and ends well. It reminds you how terrifying this scenario would really be. The practical effects are incredible and there's such a noticeable difference when people are interacting with real (fake) blood and guts as opposed to CG nonsense. The cinematography is gorgeous as well; as terrifying and ugly as what is happening on screen is, this movie just looks fantastic. There's so much texture and depth to each image.Even though the characters may be meh, the performances are really good. Jane Levy is PERFECT in this role and plays both Mia and ""Mia"" really well. Shiloh Fernandez might not be winning any Oscars, but there's nothing wrong with him that would prevent audiences from getting behind him. Even Eric, played by Lou Taylor Pucci (amazing name), provides brief comic relief and although he causes everything, is so brutalized that you can't help but feel bad for the guy.I don't know man this movie gets better every time I watch it.The Bad: The one knock against this movie are the characters. Mia's demonic self might be the most interesting character in the movie; the rest of them are bland and essentially just there to die. I don't know what they could've done; we get enough time with these people in the beginning, but it's just not time used to flesh them out. Perhaps it's because the violence starts too early? But then, the intensity the film relies on might be compromised.It's really not a big deal; we get the characters' motivations and why they wouldn't leave. We get they care a lot about Mia. And, as bland as these people are, the situation is so messed up, you can't help but root for them.The Ugly: Evil Dead came out at a time when ""Elevated Horror"" was just starting to become a thing, and at a time when remakes were still viewed as cheap knock offs of original masterpieces. Perhaps that's why we never saw an Alvarez franchise, and instead got the (very fun and enjoyable) Ash vs. The Evil Dead. (Instead of remaking a classic, just reboot it.)I can't say I hate that decision, because that show is a ton of fun and ultimately, it feels with it the fans got what they wanted. No one was asking for an Alvarez led sequel.But as time has gone on, I think this film is being appreciated for what it is. Maybe we don't need a sequel, but I for one am waiting to return to the Evil Dead universe again one day. A man can hope. As for now, I end my 2022 Halloween marathon with what I consider an underappreciated gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fairly Good Remake - Necessarily Different from the Original,"I approached the Fede Alvares remake of Evil Dead with both trepidation and curiosity. My concerns were simple - Who could possibly improve on a Sam Raimi film? How can you call it Evil Dead without Bruce Campbell?My concerns began to evaporate when I noticed Raimi's involvement in the opening credits and were completely dispelled when I realized that the new film shared only the most fundamental plot structure with the original. Both films are about friends in a cabin in the woods fighting a mysterious, purely evil, and incomprehensible force triggered by a mysterious ancient book. Otherwise, the films are only vaguely connected.So this answered my first question - about remaking a Raimi film. You don't, you simply do something new on the same foundation.The new Evil Dead is much more of a straightforward horror film and the differences go way beyond the disturbing addition of a crack addict as a central character. Most of the central characters aren't even likable, let alone funny. So much for my question about replacing Bruce Campbell. Again - you don't.In 1981, Sam Raimi, his brother, an aspiring actor (Campbell) and a group of non-actors and amateur film makers made a horror classic with almost no budget and a great deal of debt. It took more than a decade for them to recoup the costs of this near-instant cult classic though the film was viewed as a ""break-through"". More recently, as one of Hollywood's most respected directors and producers, Raimi gave young Uruguayan writer / director Fede Alvares a shot at creatively re- imagining the film that made Raimi a contender.The acting is better than that of the original (which should be no surprise since there were really only two actors in the Raimi film), the effects are more sophisticated, but cleverly reminiscent of the Raimi tradition of clever simplicity, and the film, like the original delivers a few good scares despite its ridiculous premise.Shot for about $17,000,000 (which is not much these days), the Alvares re-do netted a 300% profit before it left theaters. Profitability has very little to do with quality these days, but I say good for them!The new Evil Dead is worthy and a credit to the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
When gore becomes boring- Exhibit A,"""One of the goriest experiences of all time""! ""The whole audience fainted!"" ""I threw up"". I'm not sure which movie people were talking about, but sign me up because that sure as hell wasn't ""Evil Dead"". Before I get written off or torn by my limbs, the Evil Dead trilogy was and still is my favorite trilogy of any film. I have watched each movie at least three times and own a copy of the Book of the Dead edition of the first ""Evil Dead"" and have forced each and one of my friends to watch the first ""Evil Dead"", and even they loved it.Where does it all go wrong? The first ""Evil Dead""'s notoriety was garnered for pushing the envelope with its grotesque portrayal of violence, yes, but it also had a charismatic lead. I don't care about gender, I don't care that we don't have ""Ash"" anymore, Mia just isn't a great lead. Yes she's gone through a lot, yes her backstory pretty much spells her character, but a sob story shouldn't be the main reason why we should put our fists in the air.Now what every person came to watch ""Evil Dead"" for. GORE. GORE. GORE. GORE. GORE. Maybe the fact I spotted cuts every so often, or maybe I'm just desensitized, but aside from the blood- bath, this is pretty much your average horror flick. If any thing, it might be one of the bloodiest films of the year, but not the GORIEST. While TED was essentially ""Unrated"" (baring it all), I'm still sure the NC-17 version of this re-boot can't touch the continuous break-neck pacing and violence of that movie.I'll give the movie points for TRYING to establish character development and bringing some new insight, but it's so underdeveloped that if anything, it takes the movie out of place. We're supposed to ""care"" about these characters when in fact we don't. They're not bad actors, actually, some surprised me, but at the end of the day, we just want to see some flying limbs. And with that being said, it cuts into 1/3 of the movie.The most-raved about opening sequence is nothing more than a disappointment. Cue the foul language. Cue every cliché in filmmaking history. And of course cue the blood card. It's laid out all on here. Well at least the tree rape was a solid homage, but I still prefer the original's.All in all, ""Evil Dead"" can't be described as ""awful"", ""insulting"", or a bad remake. It can be described as ""not scary"", ""average"", or really both of those things. With so much hype, and Raimi/Campbell behind this, AND with all the rave reviews from screenings, this is not the movie the fans got. Maybe an unrated version down the road will bump up a few points but for now, a 5 is satisfactory.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's evil and it's dead,"I do understand that some people are angry with this movie for various reasons. People are eager for the Evil Dead series to continue, so while there was always talk of that happening (right now there is an entry for Army of Darkness 2 for a 2016 release), a remake came first. A remake that the director didn't want Bruce Campbell to be associated with, so he could do his own thing. Something some fans surely didn't appreciate either of course.But cutting ties does make sense in this case. And while I'm a big fan of Bruce Campbell and would have loved to see him in here somewhere, I do respect the directors choice of not wanting that to happen. There is also the fact, that the movie tries to be as serious as possible. So it's more like the first Evil Dead than the movies that came after it. And it sort of works too, if you let yourself into it. Is there one particular character that is more than annoying and does things you could/should kill him for? Yes, but judging the whole movie just on that premise would be unfair to it and wouldn't help your viewing experience. Whatever the case, the movie has good effects, it's nicely told and acted too. Try to be open minded (not literally)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good remake, but the original is better","The story is basically the same with a couple of differences. I like how the movie does a good job building up the atmosphere that is still effective. The movie contains brutal attack scenes that are both disturbing and painful to watch. Also the movie is still suspenseful throughout and I really like the climax too. Just like the original, the effects are really well made. The makeup effects on the demons looks really good, but I didn't like the eyes on them because it makes them less creepy. The practical and gore effects are still great in the movie. And the death scenes are both brutal and great.Unfortunately this movie is kind of predictable and the opening feels unnecessary. The side plot about Mia drug problems doesn't go anywhere interesting. And I didn't like the dialogue that the demons said in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent re-imagining of a classic,"I have to say I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews I've been reading. I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).I think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie. I have seen the original and I loved it. Especially when I first saw it as a kid, it scared the crap out of me. But we have to remember that we are in a new age with different technologies and expectations. I bet that if the original was released for the first time right now, it would have been shot down even more than this ""remake."" Although I love the original, the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It wasn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.People are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable? Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A+ and the score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.This movie is not meant to be a remake of the first, rather a reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You will hate it, because they are not the same movies. Both were brilliant, but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the old one. Acting by Levy was perfect, gore was fantastic, scares were good, and the movie had my attention all the way through.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not good, not terrible. Fails to impress.","This is not the most terrifying film you will ever experience.Now the original Evil Dead was an experience. You were scared, disgusted, and exhausted by the time the film ended. It was a low budget gore-fest. The remake is packed with gore, but almost to the point of exaggeration, and that's about the only positive I can give the film. It wasn't scary, it wasn't brutal, it wasn't ""Evil"".The remake features pretty looking hipsters going to the cabin as part of a drug intervention. Of course, possessions and killings ensue. Good acting isn't expected in this kinds of films, but the fact that the ""heroine"" is one of the worst actresses I've seen in a while (her delivery of a one-liner towards the end of the film had me almost throwing up in my mouth in disgust), doesn't help matters. The remake is very predictable. One character pops up out of frame to save another character at least 3 times. It becomes expected and comedic. For some reason the ""demon voices"" all sound really stupid. Hakf the audience was laughing when someone possessed would start talking in demon voice.""Evil Dead '13"" is like the countless other remakes that have come before it, it has no soul. But this remake does, however, have the blood and guts. The film tries to redeem itself in the last 15 minutes but it just feels like you're watching a completely different movie at that point.Overall, it's a bloody deja vu. If feels like you've seen it all before...and not in a good way. Evil Dead '13 is not going to be a classic and if a sequel comes out, count me out. Unless that sequel is Army Of Darkness 2 with The Chin.",,Anonymous,Horror
A satisfying and brutally bloody mess of a remake,"When I initially heard about a remake to Evil Dead, I was a little disappointed. I was never a huge fan of the original film, but the sequels remain two of the most wildly entertaining films I have ever seen. With my doubts in mind, everything changed the moment I saw the first red-band trailer. And now after catching a screening of the film last week, I wonder why I doubted Fede Alvarez's re-imagining in the first place.Five friends venture to a cabin to help Mia (Jane Levy) kick her drug habit. Things are not as they seem from the very start, but it only gets worse after Mia's claims she was attacked by a demon in the forest. Her friends just think she is adjusting badly to going cold turkey, but strange occurrences start to take place within the cabin, and it quickly becomes obvious that Mia is not quite herself.I went in with low expectations, but Alvarez does a great job bringing the film to life. It hints at and replays certain key moments from the original series, but for the most part, Evil Dead is very much its own individual thing: a re-imagining that exists all on its own. The story is not all too important here, but it does more than enough to move the film along from beginning to end; something the horror remake genre has botched all too often. Better yet, Evil Dead never feels like it is struggling to live up to lofty comparisons, and seems very content at having fun mercilessly torturing these five young people. Fans will love seeing how Alvarez reinterprets some of the franchise's most popular scenes, but non-fans will still get a hint of glee seeing just how depraved the film quickly becomes. It may take a while to get there, but it never lets up afterwards.The trailers and marketing elements suggest that the film is terrifying. Indeed the trailer was absolutely horrifying. But I found myself not so much scared as why I was mortified by some of the kills and ludicrous ideas inflicted on the cast. I say ideas mainly because some things that happen should result in a criminal diagnosis on everyone involved. The film is definitely not for the squeamish, and revels in the amount of blood and gore it spills at every turn. It uses the original franchise as a barometer, and then throws it out the window in favour of being more ""inventive"" and eclectic with its choices. The trailers may have prepared you for some of the brutality, but it only hints at the lingering after-effects. Expect to hear a lot about the vivid and fully realized makeup effects – they are so much better than you could have ever imagined, and are light-years ahead of the minuscule CGI effects employed during the film.For how enjoyable and loving a tribute this re-imagining is to Raimi's work, there is still plenty wrong with it. Roque Baños' score, although tense throughout, is way too serious and overbearing for the film. It helps create plenty of frightening moments sprinkled generously throughout the film, but I feel like it belonged in a much different film. It never gels quite properly with the tone of the film, and feels off even in the minute sections where it does work. Much the same goes for the prologue that opens the film – a totally new invention of Alvarez and crew. It tries to set the tone for what is coming, and tries its very best to totally set itself apart from the original films (even going so far as to introduce an actual ""identity"" to the demons possessing the precocious young adults), but ends up feeling totally out of place. About halfway through the film, I forgot it even happened because of how little it affects what comes after. Why bother adding it in the first place?While I take issue with a number of idiosyncrasies involving a bizarre third act twist I should have seen coming, my bigger concern is with the characterization of everyone except Mia. Their driving force is to help her get better and rid her of her drug dependency, but they seem to have no other motivations outside of that. Lou Taylor Pucci's character Eric unleashes the demons in the first place, but he never really gives any hint of why he commits this act of malice or even how he can read it so well. Elizabeth Blackmore's Natalie is a glorified stage prop, frequently disappearing for whole scenes at a time, only to reappear when the film suddenly needed her to be on hand for reaction shots. The only reason I had any idea of who this character is supposed to be was because she shows up with Fernandez at the beginning of the film. Should she have already been hanging out at the cabin, I do not think we would have been afforded that luxury.But I digress. For what it is, and for what I can only assume most people expected, Evil Dead is a satisfying, albeit bloody mess of a movie. It does enough right, and does an admirable job being its own film – as opposed to coasting along on the tail of the original film. With a little bit more work, this could have been a significantly greater film. But whether you look at it as pieces or in the sum of its parts, it is more than worthwhile to see.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch.,"'EVIL DEAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)The first five star movie of 2013 is this long awaited reboot to writer/director Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic original 'THE EVIL DEAD'. It's a loose sequel that finds a new group of young adults stumbling across the 'book of the dead', from the original trilogy, in the same cabin that iconic hero Ash and his friends did in the original two films. Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell (who played Ash) have returned as producers of the film (along with their buddy Robert G. Tapert, who produced the original three films). Raimi picked Fede Alvarez to make his feature film debut directing and co-writing the film (along with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody). It stars Jane Levy (from TV's 'SUBURGATORY'), Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. Levy plays Mia and she's supposed to reprise the role for two more films, the last of which is supposed to link this new film series to the adventures of Ash and the original films (following a 'ARMY OF DARKNESS 2' movie). I grew up on these films and am extremely excited to see Raimi and Campbell picking the series up again and think they're off to a great start.The story picks up 30 years after the original 'THE EVIL DEAD' film ended with a new group of kids going to the same cabin so Mia (Levy) can try to detox and get over her opiate addiction. Her friends Eric (Pucci), Olivia (Lucas), Natalie (Blackmore) and brother David (Fernandez) are there as well to help her get through it. They come across the 'book of the dead' (the Naturom Demonto) from the original films, in the cellar and Eric foolishly reads from it (despite several warnings not to). He of course awakens the dead and Mia is possessed. The others originally think she's just going through withdrawals but they soon find themselves being taken over and killed off one by one as they fight the deadites for their survival.The film was made on a budget of just $17 million (which is a lot higher than the original film obviously but a pretty small budget by Hollywood standards). The filmmakers decided not to use CGI (except for touch ups) and filmed for 70 days. The results are definitely rewarding. The film really has that 'old school' classic slasher film feel to it and it's surprisingly loyal to the original films (in style). It's lacking the power of a performance like Bruce Campbell's but it is really funny and satirical (more so than the first film I think but not it's sequels). The violence and gore is out of control (It was first rated NC-17, like the original) and it really is a true hardcore horror film; it's truly exhilarating and relentless. I think the filmmakers did about as good a job as they possibly could rebooting this classic series and being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch. I have no real complaints; it's a masterpiece just like the original film and it's sequels!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0mEP_zzoQ",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the worst remake ever but...,"Out of all the remakes of classic 80's horror in recent times, this was the one that I was most looking forward to and was literally shaking in my seat in the cinema when the film started. Being a massive fan of the original Evil Dead trilogy and having seen the '81 version more than 100 times (yeah, really) the trailer for this one sucked me in right away and seemed to be the one remake that they were going to get right. How then did they get it so wrong? As you can see in the trailer and read in the other reviews, the effects are spot on, the productions values are high and all-in-all it is a good looking movie.Enough good things said about ED2013. The acting was terrible, there was no character development (the characters were woeful anyway), etc, etc. But worst of all, it just wasn't scary! Where's the horror guys? I would imagine that the bulk of people seeing this film are fans of the original and therefore would be, like myself, in their 40's. We expect more than high-tech blood n guts in a horror film these days, where's the fright-factor? And the possessed were all-so-lame! The voices and character animation in the original rocked and set the standard for hardcore demonic possession in modern horror. You would not be stealing if you had copied this trait, it would have been appreciated, even expected!The negatives far outweigh the positives and make this just another junk teeny horror. It's a crime that such great films like Texas Chainsaw, The Omen, NIghtmare on Elm Street, Halloween and now Evil Dead have been allowed to be slapped together in these pathetic re- hashes. There is so much great horror fiction out there, how about reading some books and getting some fresh ideas if you have none of your own? Yet another sad day for horror...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Everything the originals were, with a modern spin, and no humor at all, only gore and horror","This may be one of the goriest, and scariest movies of recent history. The original Evil Dead series was gory beyond belief, but it had an odd sort of morbid charisma about it. It was so campy, you could hold marshmallows on skewers up to the screen while it played, and they would be roasted. This remake however, is far from campy. It's dark, intense, violent, shocking, just a horrifying tale of brooding doom.What makes it partly so scary, is that the main characters are good people just trying to help out Mia, and are completely oblivious (at first) to what evils surround them.It goes places. The sounds, the visuals, the acting even, is a solid contribution to proof that modern horror is not dead at all, and that audiences can still be shocked and scared.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
awash in blood and graphic violence,"Let be The Evil Dead (1981) be in my top 5 list of best horrors ever. So I was waiting until the evil came out to finally see another failing remake I thought. But have heard only positive things about the remake I had my doubts. At last, after a lot of stupid remakes this one kicks you straight in the face. In fact, it's based on the original one. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved in making this flick and Fede Alvarez (the director) did a great job for his first full feature.Let me first of all say this. If you can't stand extreme gory horrors than stay away from this flick. It contains shock gore just for the gore. If you thought this was going to be a supernatural ride then forget it. This is really one for the gorehounds.Does it look like the original Evil Dead. Of course not. Back then a few effects were done with stop motion. Here we luckily have the real effects and okay, here and there some CGI which I didn't mind at all. But to go back on the original. Yes, it do has the chainsaw, yes it do has the slapping door, yes it do has the evil faces from back then and yes we do have the woods attacking a girl, but not raping her like in the original.Was it scary? It never was scary at one moment but still, you will watch it with your mouth open. From the opening sequence you are immediately into the Evil Dead ride. Why I do give kudos to the director is that he made the movie he wanted to make but to please the old school fans he added references to the original.The acting of course had to be good too and luckily it was. But did they do jokes like in the original. Not really, that was left out here, admit it, we are 30 years later!Finally, I'm happy to see that they didn't give a sh*t towards the ratings. They made Evil Dead as they wanted to make it, it's full of red stuff. Not done like the new horrors with digital animation. This is old school, this is great, for me a must see for the buffs walking this earth.

To say this is a bad film is just plain wrong,"To say this is a bad film is just plain wrong. It's not bad at all. Not a classic, but not as bad as everybody is making out.Where this movie falls down, and where it always was going to fall down, is too many people regard the original as a classic. It doesn't take a genius to work out, if you're going to make a remake/reboot/re-imagining of a movie, don't chose a cult classic. No matter how good your remake, it will always be slated. I don't hold the original in such high regard. Yeah, it was a new take on an old genera, and it had some, then, good effects, and the cinematography was pretty clever, as were all of Sam Raimi's early films. But classic. I think not. I feel the 2nd Evil Dead film was loads better. And as for people slagging this remake off for bad acting do you remember the original?OK. This movie. Yeah it is pretty gory. But wasn't as bad as I was expecting. The general feel to the movie is unpleasant. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, especially for a horror movie. But there wasn't the underlying humour of the original, and moreover its sequel. I think that's where this version fell down a little. Played it a little too straight faced, and therefore was nothing new. In fact that was my biggest problem with the movie. It was nothing new. It had some well- paced set pieces but lacked any real tension and peril. You didn't really care about the characters, so didn't really care much to what happened to them.On the plus side, I felt the cinematography was pretty good, and added to the underlying ""unpleasant"" feel of the movie. The effects were good. And yeah, I'd say the acting was OK too. Don't believe all the bad reviews.All in all, a perfectly watchable horror movie, with some pretty good moments. But a word to the wise. In future don't remake a cult classic. IE. Don't remake the second Evil Dead movie, The Exorcist, The Shining . Yeah I know they remade it as a TV series, but you get the idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Only Evil Here Is That I Just Wasted $15,"""The Evil Dead"" suffers from the same malaise as many of the modern remakes of grindhouse/B Horror classics(""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""Black Christmas"" etc.). Rather than use the extra budget to fully realize the ideas and quirks that made the originals awesome......those buckets of cash are dumped into bloated, overlong run times and buckets of CGI blood sloshed about with a few surround sound sheer volume ""jump"" moments.Unfortunately a lot of makes B horror classics special is the inventiveness forced by their sheer lack of budget.Concise runtimes born of necessity often kept things moving at a brisk pace, with out fluff or an excess of pointless padding.Think about ""The Beyond"" and its glorious dime store surrealism, ""Dead & Buried""'s layers of moody atmosphere, the weird quirk that managed to make people root for ""The Human Centipede"" to escape its scenery chewing creator....or in the case of ""The Evil Dead"" the fact that it was a horror film, but had a very good balance of black comedy, and Bruce Campbell had an excellent knack for knowing when to toss in a bit of a wink and a nudge.Granted, the original ""Evil Dead"" isn't nearly as camp/slapstick as its sequels...but it did have a sense of spiteful fun amongst all of the gore.The remake plays dead straight for so long, when it finally attempts a few brief moments of the original's laughs, they fall as flat as the actors' bland performances.It plods through the original plot pretty faithfully, and completely ignores the fact that the plot wasn't what made the original great. Demonic possession, the haunted cabin in the woods.....those were genre clichés in 1981, and they are more so 30 years later.Without the spirited ability to make fun of itself.......""The Evil Dead"" becomes a shadow of its former self, and the few spots where the remake changes essential plot elements only serve to make this ever more of a wad of ABC gum, with about as much flavor.The protagonists die in the exact order you'd expect them to, and it all comes across as oddly perfunctory, with buckets of bile and a demon with a voice stolen straight from ""The Exorcist"" part of just another day at the office.Additionally, for a $14,000,000 film, it's appallingly sloppy in a way that could easily been avoided with that much production budget. I can forgive a $1.50 and a shoestring film for plot holes, continuity errors and characters that are lifeless long before their on screen deaths. When it's a glossy Hollywood production the fact that all of the above happen often isn't homage.....it's just careless and lazy.The few traditional special effects are ridiculously cheap and poorly done, and were clearly afterthoughts tossed in after the CGI budget line item ran out. Objects are broken, tossed aside or set on fire....only to necromance back to their original state a few frames later.The modern ""Evil Dead"" committed the cardinal sin of a horror film. It was utterly boring.No one at my screening squealed, laughed or got grossed out by the added ultra violence.....we all just munched on our popcorn and let out a collective ""meh"" as the end credits rolled.",,Anonymous,Horror
generally good,"""Evil Dead"" was a good movie that I enjoyed from start to finish, but it was falsely advertised by saying ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"". That would be ""The Conjuring"" in my opinion. The movie did not focus on much of a story, but rather blood, gore and strong use of language, which I enjoyed as I am a fan of slasher films and sadistic violence, but if you are going to look at the movie, expect suspense, but it's not a movie to have you blocking your ears, closing your eyes etc.. I give it a 7. I haven't seen the old one, but I would recommend looking at it as I know my parents and some family members who saw it said that it was one of the scariest movies they have seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Aside from that, I really enjoyed the movie. The plot was pretty good, the characters were great, most of it was alright. Not too much of a scare but there are kind of a few jump scares here and there so that made me jump a little, but not too scary of a movie, more bloody and just disgusting overall to be honest.

Well that was bludgeoning my mind,Okay first things first. All sour fanboys who say that this does not pay homage to the original. What movie did you see? Everything in it was a homage to Evil dead. Didn't you guys see the car or the chainsaw did you not hear the old text when Mia breaks the window. You shouldn't smoke or drink as much before seeing a movie.It takes a lot for me to cringe while watching a movie and this one did that several times. Really anyone who gives this less than an 8 can not appreciate something made with great commitment. When i was young like 15 years old i saw the original which i loved instantly. This is in my top ten instantly too if only for the great practical FX. Something special was made here and anyone who says different is WRONG.I must admit there are some stupid things like the self made defibrillator and other but that ending just was a perfect 'abomination'.........See itOn the big silver screen.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fear what you will become,"The original Evil Dead trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell are entertaining horror movies that are fun to watch, and the movies could be funny; the 2013 remake of the first movie, now directed by Fede Alvarez, does have Sam Raimi as one of the writers and Bruce Campbell as a producer with the movie taking a dark turn. The remake Evil Dead (2013) was a cool movie that was creepy and entertaining to watch; the movie does feel like the original at times with the cinematography and the camera movements, but also that this movie uses practical effects and makeup effects like the original, instead of using CGI for everything like when the dead come back to life or for any blood effects.The characters are not anything special, but there is a reason they are at this cabin in the woods, and it is because this girl named Mia is an opiate addict, and the group is trying to get her to quit this addiction and be rehabilitated; I thought this was an interesting way to keep them at the cabin, and why they are still at the cabin instead of leaving immediately. Though the characters are not something to write home about, the acting performances were good, and I could believe these people were going crazy, along with the weird things happening to them, and that they are very scared about what is happening to them depending on what the book of the dead says will happen or if they are possessed.The practical effects and makeup on the living dead people was cool and creepy, and the blood effects were well done; this movie is extremely bloody, so if you cannot handle that, I would not watch this movie, but if you like this kind of stuff, then go ahead and watch this. The violence is brutal and bloody along with there being cool cinematography and camera movements like the original; I thought the book of the dead was creepier looking in this movie than the original, because it looked like a book made of flesh making it look cooler and creepier on how it looks and how each drawing in the book is disturbing to look at.If you are fans of the Evil Dead films, then you will like this remake, and notice certain things that will be compared to the original; I liked the original trilogy of Evil Dead films, but for a modern remake, this was well done, and you can tell how hard they worked on it when watching it. The people who cannot handle too much gore and can be squeamish about any harm to oneself or any dismemberment, then you might not get through this film if that kind of stuff bothers you. This is a horror remake I recommend watching if you are a fan of the Evil Dead films, or if you are someone who has not seen them before; you will have a creepy and entertaining time with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore fest,"Great remake, predictable but the old one was also. a bit jumpy for the first 45mins then utter gore fest, the special effects and the amounts of blood spilled make it worth a watch. If you were a fan of the first films then you should watch this. I would watch this again some bits are a bit vile but it follows on from the original films, as it does nothing more than you would expect. A lot of critics have moaned about this film but what do you expect??? the old film with more effects and gore?. i would give this an 8 out of 10! and will be buying this when it comes out on DVD. love the fact the first name of all the characters spells out the word Demon",,Anonymous,Horror
A Bloody Spectacle,"As with any remake, I had a lot of hesitation towards this film. I enjoyed the initial trilogy of films, and didn't think a reboot was the right way to go about it.While the film itself is still hit or miss, there is no doubt that the film achieved its goal - you're not going to forget it.The amount of blood and gore in this film is shocking at times; you wonder in moments how they're pulling a specific part off. While the acting performances themselves are nothing special, they did an excellent job of playing into their wounds and injuries. There are some truly cringe-inducing moments.The story itself is another aspect that I couldn't care much about. They try and change around the backstory of the cabin, etc., which I get, but it was all means to an end. The film is to showcase the impressive practical and visual effects. Let me go on record however in saying that I wasn't a huge fan of the deadite design. Some looked a little bit too cartoonish.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror movie of the last decade,"I write this review, after watching Evil Dead Rise today in 2023. I don't know what other reviewers watched, but this film is almost perfect! From the opening scene that IMMEDIATELY subverts expectations. (love the Ted Raimi cameo) This film tells you right off the bat, that they aren't playing around and this isn't your campy, typical Evil Dead film. You know in the first 6 minutes that this is gonna be brutal, and if you can't handle that, just watch something else. I say I write this after seeing Evil Dead Rise for a reason. I love this Evil Dead film! No offense to Bruce or Sam but I not only enjoy this film more than the original trilogy, it's in my top 10 favorite horror films of all time! Rise definitely took more aspects from this than the original trilogy, and even though I enjoyed it immensely, I still like this one more. There are seriously frightening moments in this that Rise just doesn't provide. And to have Rise at what will probably end up a 7.1 or so and have this at 6.5 is a disservice to this film. I've been a hard-core horror fan for over 43 years and as one, I've been desensitized to scare factor in film. This film has it in spades! And 10 years and a requel later and I still think this is the greatest horror film made in the last decade! And I will die on this hill defending it!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good remake!,"I liked this remake. Better than many other recent remakes. Just like in the original film, this one takes place in a cabin in the woods. The story was good, and the young people had a good reason why they went into the forest, to get Mia drug-free. This also makes it difficult for the other characters to believe her when she says she sees things in the forest, etc. They think it's just withdrawl, until all hell breaks loose.The film has many similarities to the original, but still does its own thing, which I liked. The acting was okay. Not bad, but nothing special either. The characters were also okey.The special effects were well done, and the movie is actually pretty creepy. The possessions were well done. If you like gore, you will like this film. There's a lot of blood involved. There is not much humor in the film. It's more of a brutal horror movie. I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy addition to the Evil Dead legacy,"This has been out some time now, and after my fifth or sixth viewing, I feel it necessary to add my input to raise the score on this remake, unappreciated by some as it may be. All of the elements are here to bring this full circle to what makes the Evil Dead special. Is it perfect? No, but it's pretty darn close. A remake of this caliber could never be done to satisfy all Evil Dead fans, but you cannot deny the huge amount of effort that went into it to try. I'm sure most fans were disappointed that Bruce Campbell didn't return to be in this, but that's fine. Bruce himself has said that it's time for it to go in another direction, and they went out of their way to add all kinds of homages to the other films. I'm glad that they decided to do something different instead of repeating the same thing. There are a few small things that I would have liked to seen changed or omitted, but they are few and far between. Anyone claiming that this is nothing but a gore fest should probably go back and watch the original films again. I just hope that the next film lives up to this one, because they are going to have their work cut out for them.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
When remakes fail,"Well I've just finished watching this, and I have to say that I am very disappointed. If the intention was to do a remake of the original, then it failed on many levels. If you like excess of blood and gore and a weakened diluted back story you might enjoy this though.Evil Dead 2 did a better job at attempting to remake the original (with a higher budget) and that was over twenty five years ago!Character development was rushed and lazy, the character ""Mia"" was about the only likable one, but only towards the end of the film. Makeup wasn't too bad, but I'm left wondering why they needed to ""update"" another classic. At least we've still got the original Evil Dead films to fall back on. I expected more but was left wanting. Hopefully nobody gets any funny ideas about remaking Army of Darkness. 3/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror Genre Perfection - and a damn good reboot of a great trilogy.,Horror Genre perfection.Much like Evil Dead 2 - this takes the original idea and reworks it in an original way. A completely solid and well written horror movie that gets under your skin like horror should. Real horror fans will not be disappointed. Fans of the original have no reason to dislike this film if they truly enjoy good solid horror.Critics should be educated on the difference between the Horror Genre and the Thriller Genre. A horror movie not scaring you isn't a valid criticism. Neither are complaints about gore. Horror movies aren't supposed to scare you. They are supposed to horrify you. They play on your primal fears and cause negative emotions to arise as a result. Being scared has nothing to do with how good a horror movie is.Incidentally I think that is why horror movies get such terrible reviews from critics. A fundamental misunderstanding of the genre. The belief that they are supposed to feel frightened - so when instead they feel revolted by the gore or implications of a scene they react negatively to it.This was genuinely the best pure horror movie to be released in mainstream cinemas in the last decade.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The gore in it was good and there were a few cool things in it but the movie as a whole was really bad. SFX doesn't make a good movie. A film from beginning to end, with a good idea and director, make a good film. This being titled Evil Dead is an insult. I can go on and on. I'm so upset with this bland crap.

Redefines the Horror Genre Period!,"AyeLewisTheRoadWarrior I am calling you out by name. 1) I question whether you truly watched this movie or you're just upset that this movie was re- visioned. 2) You're just lambasting the film because it is not ""The Evil Dead 4""? 3)You're just a troll.....That being said.For main stream I can say I do not know how this got an MPAA R-rating as this when it comes to horror should have been an NC-17. While this is not in the realm of ""A Serbian Film"", ""cannibal Holocaust"" or films along those likes this stands its ground. I personally think that the characters were almost written to be bland so that when all hell is breaking loose they can convince when needed. Jane Levy is just amazing when it comes to portraying what absurdities that she has to go to. I will not say much more than that of the 1200 who attended the premier last night, a couple hundred left because they could not stomach the gore or intensity of the film. That is as matter of fact that I will get, with one thing. The tree scene in the original was taken to a whole new level in this movie.While it is not the original film I am glad it did not try to remake it 100% but pays homage the way it needed and when the pace picked up it never let off the pedal.

A good adaptation of a classic franchise,I love that this adaptation of the Evil Dead is way more horrific than the original and the two sequels that followed it. I mean the gore was crazy intense. The dialogue was a bit grotesque and kind of kills the mood at certain points though but at least the horror was on point. It might even be the best remake/adaptation of a horror movie I've watched.There were a lot of familiar scenes that I loved in this adaptation.

Ignore the butt-hurt fan-boy reviews,"If these reviewers had their ways anybody who even considered remaking a movie from the Evil Dead series would be publicly executed. Though I understand how die-hard fans of the original could feel that way, I don't think this remake deserves 1 star. The original was, and still remains, a genre defining classic, but to blatantly trash this movie simply because it didn't quite live up to the original is a little ridiculous.For the most part the story is generally the same as the original, the main difference being the protagonist is female.I think that Fede Alvarez was a great choice to direct. The fact that he is a huge fan of the original shines through in many scenes of the film. He has carefully placed many nods to the original throughout.The cast is admirable with Jane Levy being the only recognizable face to me in the lead. Having only seen her Suburgatory, I was shocked and blown away by her performance here.The gore is through the roof compared to the original. There are some cringe worthy moments here and there but they aren't so over the top that they come off as cheesy or laughable.The cinematography was pretty impressive as well. There are plenty beautiful yet creepy shots of the misty woods surrounding the cabin that, along with the films score, do a great job of setting an uneasy tone.I would recommend this movie to anyone who even loosely considers them self a fan of horror. Is it going to change your life or the way you look at cinema? No. It's simply an entertaining modernized reworking of a genre classic, and if you keep that in mind I don't think you'll walk away from this movie regretting you saw it.

Not for stuck up fan boys or the weak-hearted,"I went to watch this movie with some friends on the opening night. I was impressed that some people had to walk out of the movie after certain scenes. By the end , I was so satisfied with the movie and everyone in my group enjoyed it that we agreed it was the best horror movie in years.If there is something that really annoys me, is the fan boys, and a reason i decided to make a quick review on this movie is because of them. It was clearly stated that it was going to be completely different from the original trilogy and therefore all ties with them had to be broken if they wanted to make a GOOD movie. Don't get me wrong, but the original three should not be considered horror movies at all, they are so cheesy as watching any of the scary movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Anomalously Worthwhile Remake,"This remake was warranted.God, something about that phrase feels so blasphemous. It's definitely not something I'd ever expected to say after a film, but in this case it somehow feels appropriate. The original Evil Dead is obviously a seminal, classic horror film that can never be truly replicated. But it becomes apparent from the outset that this movie isn't attempting to reproduce what came before. It comes off more as an homage than anything else – a celebration of the first film in all of its ridiculousness and glorious excess. And although this remake doesn't manage to successfully capture the unique, fun-loving tone of the original, it certainly captures all of the ridiculousness and the excess.Oh the excess. As I mentioned before, I feel that this is one of those rare remakes that doesn't feel like a useless rehash with no purpose for existing other than to fill some wallets while emptying others. As great as the original film is, it's undeniably dated visually. And since so much of the entertainment of the movie hinges on the absurd levels of gore and all-around-nastiness, the dated visuals definitely hinder the film from being as effective today as it was when it was released. The remake fully rectifies this and then some. This has got to be one of the most visually impressive horror films ever made, especially considering there's barely a shred of CGI to be found. If this movie proves anything, it's that there's no real substitute for great make-up and prosthetics in horror. CGI can be a very tricky thing to pull off in this genre and it often ends up making things that were meant to look scary actually look goofy and artificial. I can wholeheartedly say that everything that is intended to appear scary in this movie definitely looks the part. As far as I'm concerned, this is the absolute best that possessed people have ever looked on screen. They'd be downright gorgeous if they weren't so repulsive.Sadly though, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the stunning visuals. Although the lead actress gives a very strong performance, none of the other actors (or their characters) are nearly as compelling. Also, something about the pacing of the film felt a bit off to me. The divisions between the scenes where you knew something scary was about to happen and the ""safe"" scenes where there was a lull in the action were a little too transparent. It was essentially always obvious when you should get ready for the next scare and when you could take a breather, which made the suspense of the film feel disjointed. Instead of slowly and relentlessly ratcheting up the tension like the original, the remake feels more like a string of self-contained gruesome scenes parceled up and divided by packing material. The tone of the film also feels a little conflicted. It definitely tries to take a more serious, straight-horror approach for much of its duration but additionally sprinkles in comedic elements reminiscent of the original. These two approaches don't complement each other that well and feel slightly at odds.Despite its shortcomings, Evil Dead is definitely an anomaly- it's a remake that's actually worth watching for fans of the original film. The inconsistent tone, limp characters and disjointed pacing hold it back from being an excellent film, but none of these pitfalls prevent the film from being a ton of fun and the make-up/effects are second to none. I had a great time watching it and I'd expect most fans of the original would as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Believe the Poster - This film IS Terrifying,"So many reviews compare this to the original and as someone who has not seen the original or it's sequels I have an unbiased option.BELIEVE THE POSTER, This movie WAS terrifying, it has a rather slow build but the dread and suspense is enough to sustain you through this part, as I had no idea what was coming, the basement scene near the beginning was a surprise and it does not let up from there.I thought the actors did a great job, you really feel like one of their friends going through it with them, I think Shiloh Fernandez and Jane Levy do an exceptional job, you believe the horror they are going through.I saw this with a full cinema who really got into it, there were laughs, screams and the inevitable hands over the eyes. It was a lot of fun.I would highly recommend this to Horror fans, I hope the rather passionate fans of the original give this movie a break, I for one thought it was excellent and judging by the loud applause which followed the screening I saw, I was not alone.Go and see this, buy it and have fun, I would recommend with a group.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent reboot and a fun tribute to a classic horror movie.,"I put off watching this for a long time because most recent movie reboots/remakes are utterly pointless or just flat out suck. Red Dawn, Robocop, Total Recall, Fright Night, Terminator Dark Fate....they all sucked.The Evil Dead remake was made with the full blessing of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and it shows. This is a completely insane and gross gorefest with some touches of dark humor thrown in as well.
It really felt like they were pushing it as hard as they could because there's gushing fountains of gore, squishy severed limbs and bodily fluids of all kinds spraying everywhere.
It's a laugh riot,The main girl played by Jane Levy was excellent, i was really impressed at how she went all in on her performance. A more well known or diva-like actress might have hesitated to go as far as Levy did in this, she rocks. There's some neat references to the old movies too which i really liked.Not as good as the original movies especially Evil Dead 2 but still a blast for horror and gore fans, it's a fun time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Outstanding,"I previously saw the Extended Cut and this time I finished the Theatrical Version in its full glory.A soft reboot/continuation ""requel"" of the original film series. This is how you reboot a classic horror franchise. Nice little throwbacks and homage to the first Evil Dead film, a variation of the original film but not completely copying the entire film. A perfect reinvention of the Evil Dead lore in a good and gruesome way. Fede Álvarez actually delivered in his feature directorial debut.The whole tone of the film was aesthetically pleasant and the cinematography perfectly captured the true essence of supernatural horror. A visual feast of blood and gore in vibrant colors. There's some gruesome and gnarly scenes with peak body horror that I actually enjoyed it a lot.An outstanding frightening experience with carefully placed dialogues accompanied by terrifying music followed by the best scare of a lifetime. The music was so epic and outstanding and it nearly shatter my ear drums.Now I can't wait for Evil Dead Rise by Lee Cronin.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Acceptable sequel with terrifying scenes , scary frames and loads of blood","Fast pace , creepy , dark and well developed remake film by Fede Alvarez . Five friends (Jane Levy , Shiloh Fernandez , Lou Taylor Pucci , Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore) head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods. The evil presence possesses them until only one is left to fight for survival . The young people get drawn into a web of evil and is beset by horrible demons.This frightening , strikingly designed horror movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror ; and it deals about a group of five friends go into at mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begin a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie transformation at night and going on a murderous rampage . This enough budget film contains tension , terror , shocks and lots of blood , slime and guts . The movie is blending from ¨Night of the living dead¨ with a creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession has transformed into flesh eating , being influenced by ¨Suspiria¨ spectres , and of course, the ¨Exorcist¨ , besides the death of possessed bears absolutely resemblance to the original version by Sam Raimi . Highly adequate make up Roger Murray and Jane O'Kane along with excellent special effect with effective monstrous creatures . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the last years . A passable retelling providing chills and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror film . Magnificent visual effects filled of incredible transformations by George Ritchie . The film primarily used practical special effects ; however, CGI was used to remove wires and equipment used for the effects . According to reports in the press, the film used 70,000 gallons of fake blood. In an interview, Fede Alvarez said they used 50,000 gallons for the final scene alone . This is compared to the 200-300 gallons used in the original.Original Musical score by Roque Baños plenty of eerie and screeching sounds . Adequate and dark Cinematography by Aaron Morton . The motion picture was professionally directed by Fede Alvarez , though with no originality . The first rendition was ¨Evil Dead¨ (1981) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, it has became a cult favorite thanks to its relentless horror . Followed by two inferior sequels : ¨¨Evil dead ¨2 ,¨Army of darkness ¨ with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and well directed by Sam Raimi . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Freakin Awesome!,"One of the best horror films I've ever seen. It didn't shy away from  the elements of horror like so many mainstream horror films do these  days. It was unafraid to pack as much blood, guts, scares, suspense and  action as was possible within a couple hours. I don't think any of the  actors are going to be receiving and Oscar but they did a damn good job  considering what type of film this is! Their performances really help  maintain the atmosphere, especially Jane Levy as Mia. Not to mention  she is fine as french wine! If you're a horror fan and haven't seen  this movie get on it. I saw it 3 times in theatres and it got better  every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actually surprised by how well this captures the spirit of the original,"...i have to admit i fell in love with Sam Raimi with the first film of his I saw, ""Army of Darkness"" (saw it at a 2nd run theatre in Warren, Michigan way back in the day!) When i found out this was actually the 3rd in a trilogy, i immediately set out finding the first 2 parts to watch them. Boy was i surprised to discover that the original EVIL DEAD would be one of the most sadistic roller-coaster rides of horror that I would ever experience...Now i was someone who, upon hearing about a remake, had the immediate reaction of ""SACRILEGE!"" It seemed like such an insanely bad idea. The original is one of those iconic flicks in horror history. Why remake it?I put off seeing it for the first 4 weekends of it's release, but when I needed an excuse to get out to the movies this weekend, it was the only one on the docket i was remotely interested in, so in I went.And gosh-darnit if i didn't have a darned similar experience to the one i had the first time i watched EVIL DEAD. The violence on screen was deliciously stomach-churning at times, exactly as the original film had made me feel.It was lacking in the kinetic, comicbook style of Raimi's original, instead opting for the darker, grainier look of the modern horror film, but the violence was unrelenting. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse in a scene, it always managed to. That's how the original finale of Raimi's classic made me feel. It was like ""Gore upon gore upon gore"".This won't replace Raimi's classic, but it did a much better job of capturing the feel of the original then I ever thought it would or could.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"For a certain set of fans, this is heaven","I hate to do this but I guess in the interest of fairness and objectivity I should begin by saying that the IMDb rating is probably more accurate than my own. That's because for most people, you will either love it or hate it. It's pure indulgence, all gore and very little in the way of character development (especially the character Natalie, I kept forgetting she was even there for the first half of the film). But it rises above others in this genre by foregoing the usual fake looking CG effects in favor of classic f/x makeup and camera tricks. This adds greatly to the drama by making the feel of the film more edgy and while there are very few ""scary"" moments the overall effect is 90min of unnerving action. This is a must see film for any horror fan, which almost sounds like blasphemy considering its a remake! But it never tries to copy the original, it simply pays humble homage to it. It even expands upon the mythology. My suggestion is to see this before it leaves theaters. There's nothing quite like seeing a great horror film with a crowd of people. Hearing all the laughs, the screams, and the gasps of disgust as everyone collectively refrains from vomiting is an experience worth the hefty ticket price.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An Excellent,Scary And Gory Remake.","Evil Dead is an excellent,scary and gory remake of the Horror classic The Evil Dead. Filled with great direction,wonderful special effects and a good cast,Evil Dead is one of the best remakes in recent years.Evil Dead tells the story of five friends including siblings Mia(Jane Levy)and David(Shiloh Fernandez)who are staying at a remote cabin in the woods. While there the group unintentionally unleash dead demons who want to posses and kill the group one by one. Now,the group has to figure out how to stay alive and survive...The Evil Dead.Over the past ten years the word ""Remake"" has left a bad taste in Horror fans mouths seeing Horror classics being remade left and right and it seemed like no Horror film was excluded from being remade. One of those Horror classics that was remade was Sam Raimi's brilliant The Evil Dead one of my all-time favorite Horror films. I love the original Evil Dead and the Evil Dead trilogy as a whole and when I heard it was being remade I thought no one can replace Bruce Campbell as Ash or Sam Raimi as the director. But when I finally saw the remake I thought while it doesn't replace the original Evil Dead is one of the best remakes I have seen in years. Right from the opening credits ED grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the very end and gives viewers a frightening and scary experience. What is scary and creepy about this new ED is that you never know what to expect and that you are on the edge of your seat the entire time and that you do not know who's going to live or die. We as the audience go through the same dread and torture the characters go through in and it can be very painful and hard to sit through but I think that's what adds to the suspense. What I also like about this film is that while it is a remake of the original film,it decides to go it's own way by giving viewers the same story,but with new characters and a couple of twists and additions to the film. It's a remake of the original while it is it's own film. The only thing I don't like about the film is the lack of Humor the original film and the other ED films had although at times I did laugh at the film. I appreciate the serious this movie had,but I would have liked to see some more humor in the movie. The Demons in this film are scary and creepy but are different from the Demons in the original ED trilogy because in the original trilogy the evil Demons possessed humans and made the possessed humans do horrible things the Demons in the new ED still make humans do horrible things but curse like sailors and say vulgar things almost to the point whether you don't know whether to laugh or be horrified. The Demons in this film have more in common with The Devil in The Exorcist than the Demons in the original ED Trilogy. ED is probably one of the bloodiest,goriest Horror films that I have seen in recent years and it's no surprise that the film originally got an NC-17 by the MPAA(changed to an R-Rating). When the blood and gore starts to come out it keeps coming and never stops and even the most seasoned Horror fan who has probably seen it all will get grossed out by the gore and violence. The film is so bloody and gory you will feel like the blood come off the screen and into your face. The ending of the film is great and the bloodiest 15 minutes you will see in a recent Horror film. Also,look after the end credits and you will see one of the great surprises in movie history.The cast does a great job in their roles. Jane Levy is excellent as Mia,with Levy bringing emotion and lots of depth to the role. Shiloh Fernandez is wonderful as David,Mia's brother with Fernandez having great chemistry with Levy. Lou Taylor Pucci gives a great performance as Eric,the one who knows what's going on. Jessica Lucas(Olivia)and Elizabeth Blackmore(Natalie)give good performances as well.Fede Alverez(in his directorial debut)does an amazing job with the direction of the film,with Alverez bring a great visual style and atmosphere to the film while also doing well with the scary scenes. Although Alverez's direction is not as kinetic or as strong as Raimi's,it's still great direction from Alverez.The score by Roque Banos is effective and memorable and fits with the tone of the film. Great score.The special make-up effects in the film excellent,gory,realistic,messy and bloody and definitely work for the film. Excellent effects.In final word,if you love the original Evil Dead or the whole Evil Dead Trilogy,you will love the new Evil Dead,a scary,gory and effective Horror film that stands alongside the original,one of the best Horror remakes in recent years and is worth the price of admission. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is it great? No. Is it better than everything in the past 5 years? Yes.,"You need to know one important thing when you go in to see this movie. This is a re imagining. It's not meant to be campy or quirky. It's meant to be scary.Because this is a re imagining, NOT EVERYTHING is going to be faithful to the original Evil Dead movie. You will however, get a lot of nice call backs to the original. Those who have seen the original Evil Dead will be able to point out clear distinctions to lines or scenes that were very similar.However, the plot has gone through a total transformation. Is this a bad thing? Well, for open minded people, no. And if all of us of original fans remember, the first movie didn't have much plot to it either did it? Bunch of kids going to a cabin, and finding an evil power. That hasn't changed. But the reasoning for the people there is much more sympathetic, it's not ""Oh us crazy kids going out to a cabin to have sex and drink beer."" Granted, the reason they are there is kinda stupid, but you don't grow to hate any of the characters. They don't make stupid decisions, they don't contradict themselves, and while sometimes the discourage got a chuckle out of me, their responses to each other is very real. Only once did I find myself saying ""Don't do that, it's going to get you killed."" And luckily I was wrong. These characters have a firm grip on how people would deal with a situation like this (according to each of their characters and back story.) I also never found myself WANTING a character to die, like in most horror movies. And in my book, that's a huge plus. There are a couple Hostel moments that might make you squirm in your seat, but it's not stupid pointless torture. My only complaint would be that sometimes the voice of a possessed would sound silly, reminding me of the scene in the original ""I'll swallow your soul!"" However one of the best things of this movie is that they don't CGI the heck out of it.However, in the end I was satisfied with my ticket purchase.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where's the dark humor?,"I am a true fan of the original Evil Dead flicks and was super stoked when the remake came out..went to see it alone (im not a freak)and sat watching and never really got too darn excited about what I was watching...granted the opening scene is good and the last minutes were entertaining! But the rest just lacked anything real special. I especially missed the campy type of dark humor that was in the 1981 original, there was only 1 or 2 lame attempts at anything like this in the remake, granted there is enough blood and gore to satisfy most horror fans. But as a true EVIL DEAD a fan I was somewhat disappointed. I hope they stop at this one for remakes and leave the classics alone...this generation is getting screwed with remakes.",,Anonymous,Horror
So...So..Groovy,"Over thirty years ago, several young film students named Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell had an idea for a movie with a premise of five college students away for the weekend in a remote Cabin in Tennessee who become possessed by Demons and try to kill each other off. Now it's 2013 and can you guess who the producers are? The Storyline is thisMia, a drug addict, asks her brother and three friends to come with her to a cabin to help her go cold turkey. While she's going through withdraw, her friend Eric finds a book bound with human flesh and wrapped up in a garbage bag. Don't forget barb wire also! Eric translates some passages in this book and the demon procession begins! Fede Alvarez makes his film directing debut here and he attacks us with gut-wrenching moments throughout the movie. Instead of having Raimi mentor this virgin director, Alvarez came out swinging with his own version of this film. The $17,000,000 budget drenches us with blood, guts and gore! The special effects are extremely well done. Every single character is inflicted with severe pain and pretty much, if there was a theme to this film, I think it would be pain! And I mean that in the best way possible! I totally understand the disappointment in this film and sometimes even hatred by the so called die-hard fans. Even when I first saw the spoiler trailer on you-tube, I was skeptical but still interested. After watching this film, I realize Alvarez, Raimi, and Campbell wanted a fresh, new direction in these chain of movies. In my opinion they hit the mark on the spot. Even though Evil Dead 2013 is a remake, I consider it as Evil Dead 4 after Army of Darkness. By telling myself this and my readers hopefully, it makes this movie more understandable. The only main issue I have with this film is the lack of the character ""Ash"", which was played by Bruce Campbell in the original. I might be in a minority with my die-hard friends but I give this film 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fan of the original- not happy with this version.,"First I must post a disclaimer- this is not a poorly made film. It was shot very well, edited well, the effects are awesome, the sound and music is appropriate. Technically, this is a well made film.And I'll admit, it has a good ending.And yet...The original had none of that- and somehow is much better.I will put it this way- the original had heart, and this movie does not. This movie has an ""agenda."" It coldly moves down the checklist of ""cool things from Evil Dead"" and connects the dots without any fresh ideas or uniqueness.My biggest complaint is about the characters. This movie could have been good if the characters were better. There is only one character I liked in this movie (the sister), and even then she wasn't directed very well in every scene. Every other character in this movie I disliked. The girlfriend is pointless and we don't get to know her, the men are fairly stereotypical and don't have any endearing qualities, and the other woman has personality, but she's bossy and aggravating. Even with the awkward acting of the original, each character there was like a real person, and nobody was defined by their role in the movie (Ash wasn't even the ""hero,"" he was just a guy!).The other problem is the writing. In addition to some painful exposition scenes, the writing is uninspired. It just takes the ""Evil Dead top 10"" tropes and inserts them in wherever it can. Sometimes this even results in scenes that repeat themselves. Other times it results in drastic shifts in tone- a movie that is mostly serious that suddenly has over-the-top dialogue and violence (for no other reason than ""the original did this"").Finally, the tone is a mess. It was marketed as a serious scary movie, and having seen it, I honestly can't say if it's supposed to be ""so bad it's good"" camp, or a ""serious scary movie"" that just fails to be scary. Now, the original had the same problem, but the original failed so badly at being scary it's quite entertaining. This movie doesn't fail bad enough. It either tried to be scary earnestly and ended up having a few scenes that just feel out of place or forced, or fails to be ""so bad it's good"" because it's so damned heavy-handed in the beginning.So the result is a polished, stylized version of a story that was too silly to be taken seriously 30 years ago, that continues to take itself too seriously now. But lacking the charm, the camp, the endearing characters that made the story tolerable (if not enjoyable).So to end on a higher note, I do have to give the film credit for a strong visual style, ""fan service"" (I suppose), and a good ending. The ending was great- it almost made up for the entire movie. It was the only part of the movie that felt fun, and *inspired* by the original rather than *stolen* from the original.Bottom line, if you're a fan of the original, you're likely to be disappointed, but many fans of the original also like this one, so maybe I'm the exception.And if you've never seen the original films, then this will probably strike you as a well-made gore-fest of a horror-flick by today's standards.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perfectly acceptable horror, but it's no future classic","(53%) A remake of a horror comedy classic, only with almost all the comedy removed, and most of the fun, and the low budget charm, the crazy trippy scenes of madness, Bruce Campbell, the black humour, all with the added fact that this will be largely forgotten about an hour or a so after watching while the original can be played vividly in my mind scene by scene from beginning to end. So as a remake I'd stick with hugely fun Evil Dead 2, but with all that's been said this is still an okay watch. It doesn't add anything to it by saying this is the highest quality of all the Evil Dead movies, mainly because here they had a budget of over $100 to spend, but this is well shot with good production values and some very graphic blood and gore. And by the end that's the only thing you'll be able to slightly remember from this throwaway rehash of low budget horror perfection.",,Anonymous,Horror
Do Not Judge This Movie Based on the Original and You Might Have a Good Time,"I don't understand what all the negative reviews are for. They're all whining about why this was not the original. I'm curious to know what all the whiners would've thought of this movie if the original movie didn't exist and this was a movie in its own right. Let's just forget the past and judge this movie in its own right, shall we?Before I begin my review, I would like to point out the fact that if you get scared or expect to get scared by watching a horror movie these days, you are not even a horror movie fan, because if you were one, you would've seen so many horror movies that you'd know that there are no more original ideas left for the horror genre. You would've seen it all before and wouldn't even have such unrealistic expectations.True horror movie fans would not be scared of horror movies because they've seen it all before. I can count all the scare tactics and even the camera angles used in this movie and tell you which horror movies it has borrowed them from. Not surprisingly, it shared a lot of those techniques with ""Drag Me to Hell"", which is by far the best horror movie I've seen.I have no idea what you've been watching, but what I saw was a very well-made atmospheric and highly professional horror movie , which not surprisingly, failed to scare me, like all the horror movies made these days. Like I said, as a true horror movie fan it's not something I can complain about. The shots were beautifully taken and some I would even describe as artistic, like the shots you get during the time they're traveling to the decrepit cottage.The acting was not Oscar-worthy, but then again a mediocre acting is what you get in most horror movies. I'm going to subtract one point because of that. As for the back story, you don't need to know everything about every single character to enjoy a horror movie. The least you would expect is to know why the characters are in that situation (here, in the cottage). The movie gives you just as much information as you need. After all, this is not a romance novel. This movie employed every scare tactic in the book. There is no single scene depicting unnecessary profanity here, which is sadly being employed a lot in horror movies these days, so I have a difficult time understanding why some reviewers are calling this a ""torture porn"" movie. Perhaps, they need to look into the dictionary and check the meaning of the word ""porn"".As for the dialogs, this movie was weak, but there was not much the characters could talk about other than the obvious. A good dialog would've requires a rich back story, which like I said is not really necessary in a horror movie. One point taken because of that. I wouldn't really describe the final fight scenes as having a good combination of colors. An all red scenes (the raining of blood) is not exactly what I find appealing. It's irritating and redundant.I'm going to give this movie a 7, and I believe it is worth watching. There are too many stupid low-budget horror movies out there. I can tell you with absolute confidence that this is not one of them. Do not judge this movie based on the original and you might have a good time",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not worth a matinée or a second viewing,"I always thought it was a little risqué voting movies on either sides of a scale as far as being way too negative (1/10) or way too positive (10/10) but I honestly believe this movie is deservedly a 1/10.I really don't want to spend most of this review talking about the details, it's pretty much the same thing from the original Dead, but each transition in the story is sloppy and careless.Bad things happen yet the movie fails to make me care about any of it.The transition from one event to the other gives little to no momentum for the overall narrative. Everything that transpires amongst the characters and the story as a whole is haphazardly thrown together if not just for the sake of adhering to the original Evil Dead movie and reminding you that you're watching the same movie.There is some macabre humor put in here and there but the execution of the story is so serious it would go over your head or get a delayed reaction.The violence in this movie is also radically over the top, and seems to be as jolted in as the rest of the plot points in the movie are. After seeing ""Drag Me to Hell"" it would've been interesting to see Raimi take the helm but I'll be willing to wait for his next installment to his Army of Darkness (which I loved).

The Dumb and Dumber,"As a huge horror fan I had to give ""Evil Dead"" , a try. Read some really good comments, many spoke about better the remake is from the original one. I guess I expected too much from this movie.If you want to see tons of endless blood for 90 minutes, actors and actresses having a solid 4 out of 10 performance , characters that make the stupidest decisions ever untl the next one comes and makes an even bigger mistake, then this movie is what you need.Not at all scary, too many effect that killed the horror vibe they tried to build. Too much blood , no characted development thourgout the movie, it was just plain dumb.Conclusion, if you are into gore and just want to see blood, give it a try. If you are searching for a true horror movie that will make you hard to sleep from your fear then no. My 14 y/old self may have been scared, my 27y/old ass no.It also sabotages (for me) the 2023 reboot.

Very Good Remake,"I just saw Evil Dead in Finland in late night movie theater. It was Very Disturbing and it had Very Disgusting scenes so of course I Loved It.It is Very Good Remake. :)Shiloh Fernandez and Jane Levy were great at their roles and the story moves on very fluently without making you tired. I even got scared so I wonder how director or actors gets sleep? Dialogue has minor problems in few scenes with Eric. This movie will be on my best top-5 film list. If you are familiar with SAW-series and you like those then you will be comfortable with Evil Dead 2013 too.And for the last people, remember to Watch End Credits. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest horrors this year,"This is one of the few times that i was so happy not to see the original version first. This is much better and i believe that by the time the difference in voters number disappear, the rating will be a bit over the version from 1981. Both movies are great, just the new one is better. Better effects off course. I have expected a bit better actor play or cast, but there is never a full happiness as they say! Otherwise the movie gives its turnarounds, most of them actually unexpected or almost expected. You keep asking yourself questions during the movie and yet just some of them seems you are answering right. It is a must see movie for horror fans and you should miss it only if you cant stand this genre. The director have a very interesting ideas of presenting the action especially in the most valuable moments where you expect to see the difference with the decent Hollywood horrors. The only thing i didn't like as a huge fan of this genre is that some of the effects are way to cheap than they should be. It happens 2-or 3 times but it still there. Hope you will enjoy it as i did!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid remake that's worth the watch.,I enjoyed this remake. I was honestly surprised as I love the original films. The reason this remake works for me is because it never seems to look down upon the originals. It also never felt the need to do exactly the same thing as the originals. I enjoyed the gore and the way the story was still there but in a different way. I really enjoyed the performance from Jane Levy. The other performances didn't blow me away but eh. Biggest issues were the overuse of stock sound effects and music; this is not the case for every scene but when it comes up it was annoying and really disappointing. This film also lacks that charismatic lead aka 'Bruce Campbell.' Visuals were really interesting at times aswell. And of course this film lacks the significance that the original has but honestly that's not really this films fault it just shows how great the originals are.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead for the Xbox generation,"I never thought I would become a grumpy old man, but it seems this state has now reached me in my mid thirties.To put it bluntly, this film is the cinematic version of edible gloop, served in a jar, then fed to dribbling teenagers with unrefined tastes. It lacked the spine and balance to be called a good horror film. It lack the originality and imagination to be called a cult classic. It has too much senseless meat, bone, sinew and cartilage to be considered a mainstream frightener. Basically, this seems to have been made for blood-hungry gamers, who are happiest when seeing the human body blown, ripped or torn asunder.The story is a vacuous imitation of the Raimi classic. A few similar plot devices, but without the charm, thrills, personalities and originality. What it had more of was blood. Barrels of it. No tension or fear. Just thick, meaty blood. Those gamers will be extremely well fed.Please stop doing this to us, Hollywood. Please stop exhuming original classic films from their rightful place of rest, giving them a cheap modern makeover, then foisting them upon us like they are a new dish, created by the world's finest chefs. They aren't. They are tasteless, nauseating mush and only willingly consumed by tasteless, nauseating drones.1/5",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Time,"I think everyone is forgetting that Sam Raimi was the producer of this film! As in HE was the BOSS of the film! As in he was a part of the film making.Now that I said that. This film was a great re-make. I admit that at first the acting was kind of bugging me, but once the film started It got very enjoyable. By the end of the film I was smiling and loving everything I was seeing, and with little CGI made it 10 times better.Looking back on the film I now see that the acting was very strong, and an again a great re-telling. It was a bloody good time one of the best horror films to come out this year so far. You just need to sit back and really have a fun time with this film! A lot of great things happen in this film and it left me with wanting to see it again and again.I would also like to point out there was some very, very strong film making happening here, the people behind the camera really knew what they were doing.I think a lot of people well have fun with this film. Horror fans are going to love it. Fan boys need to stop being so up-tight and realize that Sam Raimi had his hand in this film and he told us what he was going to be doing with the film, and he didn't hold back on us! There was a lot of parts where Sam Raimi's style popped out at us.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than some people claim,"Before I first saw this film, I had read numerous negative reviews by self-proclaimed die hard fans of the franchise as well as many great reviews by professional film critics and I really had no idea what to think of it. The most I had experienced of the franchise prior to this was the first half of the first film and a musical version of it I saw in Las Vegas last summer, so I was essentially going in blind.I was honestly expecting this film to be nothing other than a stupid gore fest that would get boring after the first half hour, thus causing me to leave the theater and attempt to get my money back or at least see something else. All of that was quickly forgotten once the film began to escalate and take hold of me in a vice-like grip, refusing to let me go. I was very surprised and pleased at how they were able to have everything interesting and keep the adrenaline pumping.A film like this that can grip your bones with fear and incite an almost animalistic terror in your guts while managing to stay fresh is a film that horror fans such as myself find to be a real breath of fresh air from the ""horror movies"" of the past ten years.I would only recommend you watch this movie if you are open-minded about having a new and different light cast upon the Evil Dead franchise. But if you aren't and want to stick to what's comfortable for you, then that's fine, too. But if you watch it anyway, then I promise that you will hate it and complain about it and discourage other people from seeing it, which would be unfortunate because it really deserves much more credit than it's being given right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As good a scare fest as you'll see today.,"""Am I sure? Of course not! It's not a science book!"" Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci)If first-rate gore is your desire, look no further than the remake of Evil Dead. If you are a purist about this horror genre, having waited through the many satires since Romero's Night of the Living Dead, including Sam Raimi's campy 1981 Evil Dead and the more recent Cabin in the Woods, then stop right here. Director Fede Alvarez does it right and straight.Why not! Even to remake Evil Dead as Raimi fashioned it is foolishly to court comparison with a cult classic, a successful story of teens imprudently hanging out in a haunted cabin. In Alvarez's iteration, the zombies are lifelike and the dismemberments realistic, each with its own rationale, just as the reason this time for staying in the cabin makes some sense.Having found an ancient Book of the Dead, Eric gives the above statement, a free pass to gross us out even if the gore makes no sense or the strategies to thwart a resident evil are weak or too random to be effective. But make no mistake about the presence of shotgun and chainsaw, tropes from earlier scare fests, they are featured and used, along with very effective nail gun and ubiquitous gasoline. The special effects to make you cringe are well done, and the psychological-thematic underpinnings pretty impressive.After all, brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) did abandon sister Mia (Jane Levy) and their mother long ago, so it seems some kind of retribution is in order. Additionally, because the women in the film make more mayhem than the men, as in the current American Idol contest, misanthropy trumps misogyny perhaps to comment on the current state of feminism.""No! You don't understand. There was something in the woods... and I think it's in here with us... now."" Mia",,Anonymous,Horror
Gripping horror,"I watched this movie not long after it came out. And I've just watched it again for a second time today. I still think it's an excellent movie!I never watched the original, it came out way before I was born and any references I've seen to it, always looked ""cheesey"". So I always avoided it. I guess this is where the generational divide comes in.There's a lot of ""negative"" reviews for this on here. But it's from the die hard fans, who clearly were expecting a remake of the original.It is not really a remake, but a new take on the original. And it's made really well. Basically an entirely different movie. So why don't you treat it as that.The acting is good from all the cast, they have some level of IQ, (where a lot of characters in horrors these days don't!), strong/creepy atmosphere, which gets you further than cheap jump scares and a decent storyline.Overall, I really liked this movie, as it has the perfect ingredients for a great horror. The suspense and atmosphere and acting is just what really makes this movie.A couple of things didn't age well. Such as the scene where the girl gets possessed and some vines go up between her legs. I'm glad to see in 10 years, society has evolved to find these things more tasteless in movies. But other than that, it's a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic production,"Well Ive seen this movie before, when it came out and remember I didnt like it atall, I though it was such a disaster of a remake it was insaneBut gave it a second chance like 10 years later and now it worked much better, but it dont sparkle,,, I like remakes that are different from the originals , like susperia, the remake is so much better cause they change the story, why reinvent the wheel all over again, dare to do something different, but with evil dead I would have prefered a copy, cause the original is so good, but its a low budget movie and so outdated now, so I wanted a remake with more money and better effectsSo I guess thats why it didnt worked out for me the first time, and I must say the story in the remake is stupid, and this strange motley crew that hanging out in the cabin, hard to like anyone of them and they seem not to like eachother eitherBut, its good horror, its very good production and its well done.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much Better than You'd Expect,"Considering I haven't seen the original Evil Dead, and I saw Evil Dead 2 so long ago that I barely remember it, I didn't know what to expect from this. The trailer made it look decent so my expectations weren't low, although, they weren't super high. And honestly, I enjoyed this quite a bit!I actually liked the story a lot. I know vague bits of the story from what I remember of Evil Dead 2, and just common knowledge of the movies at this point because of how popular they are, so I *kind of* knew what to expect, at least for the first half. I liked how everything was set up. Having the protagonist be a drug addict was smart because it adds an explanation on why they don't leave the forest earlier in the movie, but it doesn't feel nonsensical. The plot slightly starts to vanish halfway through the movie as things just start to happen (with reason of course) but nothing gets added to the story during the second act. But I don't think that's a bad thing, because the second half is legitimately scary. Almost no movies even get me slightly freaked out anymore, but this made me real tense. Few movies can pull off creepy female villain, and make them scary, but this pulls it off for sure. Mia, or technically the demon's design, is amazing. The acting is amazing too, but we aren't at that point of the review just yet. The third act, slightly drags, which is weird considering the movie is only 90 minutes, but I think they could've ended it earlier, or just removed a certain section of the movie, but nothing too extreme. Ok, I'll talk about the acting now. (Even if it's kind of brief)The acting is damn great! Everyone seemed to care about their role and put their all into it. I don't know who played possessed Mia, but whoever it is, did a great job. Every character felt real and logical (enough) and I didn't dislike any of the characters. David was a good protagonist who had struggles to overcome and get through, Eric was kind of just a plot device, but he was an entertaining plot device! Olivia and Natalie were fine. They weren't anything special, but I didn't dislike them or anything, they were just kind of ""there.""Another thing that is super good is the cinematography. It nails the creepy atmosphere and the feel of being in a desolate and unsafe place, especially in the scenes in the more swampy parts of the forest. The drab and lifeless colors help add to this atmosphere, and solidify the hopelessness feeling of the movie. Aside from the colors, the actual camera movements are also great. I love the amount of times the camera zooms in on something, or just the fact that the movie actually has some beautiful shots, which is not something I expected from this kind of movie.The gore is excellent too. I don't know if it practical or CGI, but as I say every time, it must be practical because no way CGI would look this good. It isn't as violent as the trailer makes it look, but it still has some DISGUSTING scenes. At least most of the violence is done onto the villain. I also love the soundtrack. The air raid like siren sounds are so good. I love when they used and they create an amazing feeling of intensity, especially when they're used at the climax. The overall soundtrack is just really intense and really creepy. I think my only complaints with the movie is that it could've been better paced at the end, and that some characters could've used more development. I'm also overall mixed on the ending as a whole. Of course, I can't say anything as I want to keep this review spoiler free, but I wish they did things differently.So, this was a nice surprise. It was a LOT better than I expected, and it was overall a good time. The acting was great, it was actually scary, the gore was disgusting, which is always a good thing, the direction was phenomenal, and the soundtrack is haunting. If you have the time, which if you made it this far into this review, I hope you do, I recommend you check this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite a good horror.,"Before I decided to go watch I checked IMDb.com.Had to browse through 5 f****** pages to find a positive review. So many down voters, unbelievable. Scary movie, decent acting, unpredictable story. It got me just fine and I hated the original Evil Deal 1980 Bruce Campbell movie. I mean who the heck goes to see a horror comedy? Horror is supposed to be that, scaring one out of ones wits. It convinced me. What was the most interesting aspect was seeing the deviation between the 1/10-4/10 voters and the average grade (6.8, proving the vast majority enjoyed it tremendously). As scary as Insidious 1, and was really gory.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The greatest remake you will ever experience.,"When I first heard that a remake to the classic 'The Evil Dead' was in production, I was heart broken. If there's one thing I hate more than remakes, it's remakes of classic horrors I watch as a kid, and after Rob Zombies god awful attempt at 'Halloween' I had almost given up hope with modern remakes. I started to hear many good things about 'Evil Dead' but wouldn't let myself be dragged into the hype, but as a hardcore fan of the Evil Dead trilogy I had to go see it. I kept my expectations low but, wow!Not only is this film a great remake, it's a great film in its own right full stop. Jane Levy's performance as Mia is fantastic both as human & deadite. It takes a lot to make me jump but this film is full of them & I can't say enough about the effects, and without cgi it's incredibly impressive. Yes there's no Ash, but does there need to be? Did you really want another man filling in the shoes of the almighty Bruce Campbell? Do we really need another 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' remake situation? Mia stand on her own feet as a new horror icon for a new generation.A horror film can never be truly judged until it's 20 years old and being watched way before you should be watching it. The question is, will 'Evil Dead' still be shocking us in 20 year's? I think it will. Bring on the sequel & bring on 'Army Of Darkness 2' as an Evil Dead or a horror fan, or even just a fan of truly fantastic films, you need to watch this film. Right now.As a side note, I love this film so much that I had to get the main character Mia tattooed on me, right next to the man himself, Ash. Hail to the King & Queen. Groovy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A nostalgic take on the original Evil Dead that's known for Jane Levy's act.,"When teasers and trailers were just releasing for Evil Dead, I can't imagine how entertaining and gruesome this remake will be when I get to see it in theaters, and by the time I did, I am sort of impressed by it.Fede Alvarez directed an all-knowing iconic film with the decent selection of actors/actresses who acted surprisingly well with the authenticity they maintain to keep my attention clinging onto the aspects of the movie. The plot is simple: Five people go into a cabin with a dash of evil screwing them up from a book. It's a total horror movie cliché but it was still worth watching. People always complain about the ingenuity that this remake lacks, and I agree with that but in my personal opinion, isn't that what logic and morality comes in to make it real? (aside from some scenes) .-.The scenes were cunning to an average viewer's sight and I can admit that I lost myself; the screams and jumps that occur during a suspenseful scene just, keeps me cringing on the edge of my seat, it's that scary! The gore was one of the key aspects to make this real and daunting, yet it doesn't do much to increase the ratings from viewers, I mean you can take the hint from watching the trailers and 50 gallons of fake blood, well that was an 'overkill'. :PLet's not forget Jane Levy's portrayal was what made the movie enjoying, yet cringe worthy to see: The tree vine scene and Demon Mia scene was what let us admire about Jane Levy and her superb acting. Shiloh's acting was yet exceptional to appreciate from some people's perspective, including mine.Although the marketing on this was mildly misleading: scariest movie ever made, I doubt that, Human Centipede disagrees with that too. It was entertaining, definitely worth the watch, just not worth over $10 to see it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead 2013 - When Your Cabin Becomes an Airbnb for Pissed-Off Demons,"Let's be real: you're in a busted-up cabin, there's a book bound in human skin with sketchy inscriptions, and your first instinct is to read it out loud? Congrats, Eric, you just opened a hotline straight to hell. Even Harry Potter knew better than to mess with certain books. Now, demons are treating everyone like prime cuts at a butcher's shop. Great job, champ.Fede Alvarez doesn't pull any punches. This movie is pure old-school gore: blood-drenched walls, dismemberments, and enough carnage to make your neighbor regret their popcorn. Every scene is a gruesome spectacle. An arm hacked off here, a possession over there, and you're clutching your seat like you're in a real-life Dark Souls boss fight.Jane Levy as Mia is next-level. She goes from fragile junkie to possessed badass, like Buffy took lessons from Linda Blair. When she picks up that chainsaw, you know heads are about to roll-literally. The final showdown? A perfect cocktail of suspense, horror, and Tarantino-esque carnage. Well played, Fede, well played.That cabin? It's the kind of place even your GPS would refuse to navigate to. With its satanic altars, creepy basement, and murderous trees, it's basically the ultimate ""why am I still here?"" combo. But our brilliant protagonists? They think it's all fine. Blame Netflix's normalization of questionable life choices.Fede Alvarez took the soul of Evil Dead (shoutout to Sam Raimi), cranked up the gore, injected it with modern horror, and boom-this movie does not mess around. No slapstick humor here; just buckets of blood and an oppressive atmosphere that'll have you holding your breath. It's brutal, relentless, and unapologetically terrifying.Evil Dead 2013 is an infernal rollercoaster that leaves you queasy and frozen with fear in equal measure. If you're down for a movie that goes all-in-with guts (literal and figurative) and a chainsaw anthem-this is your ride. But do your stomach a favor: prepare for a baptism in blood, because here, gore is a sacred art form.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Viscerally Violent!,"'Evil Dead' is pumped full of hardcore violence. This is not my particularly favourite type of film, but I had already enjoyed the sequel. I did not like this film as much, although there are some commendable parts.The violence in this is viscerally excruciating. You feel every cut, stab or other piece of bloody violence on screen. This film is quite effective at making viewers wince in pain. I will say the effects are very good in this film. There were also a few examples of creative cinematography and editing.Many characters make silly decisions in this film, which makes it quite hard to suspend your disbelief. There are some wider thematic elements that could explain certain decisions, but it just seems too far-fetched for me. Additionally, I cannot say any of the actors gave a consistently great performance.If you like extreme body horror and violence, you will enjoy this.

IMDb Hijacked by Fanboys Once Again,"Going through and reading the top reviews for this movie on IMDb is an absolute joke. It is ridiculous how people are acting and just completely smearing this movie. It is like they want the movie to be identical to the original and that's not what a remake should be. They are ragging the actors as if the acting was so great in the original. The story is a little bit different here, but it works still. What is up with the crazy hate. For once, we get a decent remake and people are coming in here and acting like absolute mindless trolls.This is a fun, well shot, creepy and over the top gore fest that is entertaining. Give it a chance. I think it is really well done and just as fun as the original in its own way. Nothing in the original made me wince and there were some serious moments in this movie that had me cringing.Bottom line: See this movie and give it fair chance!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The good outweighs the bad in a rare case.,"Revisiting this in 2020 was pretty interesting and satisfying. I needed that much time to let my thoughts on this film marinate. First let me cut to the chase the main cast, you could tell they put all their effort and trust in to this crew. The dedication from most of the cast and the make ups and gross-out initial story progressions were part of the extreme highlights.I think it's cool that they filmed majority of the film in order, in order to benefit from the cast's understanding of the escalation in the story. All of the pieces were there to fit in the spots. Jane Levy was committed, exhausted, and beautiful. Jessica Lucas was her usual excellent and persuasive self, I love her subtlety and realism, and always thought she was an underutilized actress. The other main actors all looked and acted their parts well both alive and especially dead. The practical make ups and unique body horror/ contagion / almost sci fi parasitical nature of the plot's re-tweaking all worked surprisingly well for a one-off.But that brings me to the weaker aspects. The story doesn't make much sense, and it's glaringly obvious especially towards the end. Even for Evil Dead standards. They couldn't really tell what vibe they wanted to go for in some parts. Gore was the top priority, and although that plays out well, especially with the deadite's, the sense of it wears thin by the end. Some of it works awesome, some of it seems a little lazy and contrived. It's a mixed bag.The writing and script suffered the most I think, and a lot more than is fair for the actors and their dedication to the roles. Had the writing and script been stronger, the good visuals could've benefitted a lot more from it. The end was a scattered wtf moment. But the initial production was not bad.I see this as an enjoyable horror film for the most part but the flaws are very evident. Some of it could've even just been fixed in editing, how they didn't notice or retweak some of the flaws in post-production is a bit of a mystery after all that work and effort of the cast.I really think Bruce Campbell should've been the truck driver at the end. If they were going to turn on the campy faucets to that degree, might as well take it all the way home with more than an after credits one-liner. Overall not the worst it could've been. The potential and glimpses of talent still shine through. But some of the contrivances, nonsense, rushed editing, and unintentional campiness was a little all over the place I can admit.I think most of the cast did great and I still think with that said, I like this film more each time I watch it. The good outweighs the bad in a rare case. It took me a while to accept this film as a part of the main series. But I think I've finally wrapped my head around it as a sequel more than a remake.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bloody Deja Vu,"This remake is like watching a bloody Deja vu, for better and for worse. It does work around the originals premise where a group of friends go to the cabin just for a weekend getaway. Instead we have a group of friends heading to one in the hopes of trying to help their friend Mia get over a heroin addiction. It's a pretty excellent idea cuz when she gets possessed they assume it's just her relapsing. Jane Levy I don't think gets enough credit for her performance. She has to act sick, angry, scared, & of course evil 💀 that can't be no easy task. When mia defeats the demon at the end you really feel like it was an allegory for getting over her addiction, at least that's what I got out of it. The other big star of the film is the buckets of blood & gore flying across the screen, every time I think of this movie I just think of the color red. Not to mention some hard to watch dismemberments that still get to me every time.And that's probably where all my positives end. The biggest problem with this remake is compared to the original which felt like an experience, this just feels like well.....a remake to an experience. It struggles to find its own identity without having to rely on recreating the good stuff about the 1981 film. It does it well & adds some new things especially towards the end but it just doesn't stick with me the same way the original does. Besides Mia the other characters dont do much for me. Sure the characters in the original werent anything special either but their were atleast funny and genuine moments with them & you do feel bad when they become possessed & die horribly. Here there just wasn't enough for me to care who got their arm chopped off or who got set on fire. And couldn't they have thought of a better way for the demon to come back instead of some idiot reading the book that has it's scribbled in there to NOT READ IT 🤦I have to also say I hate the beginning of the movie cause it spoils what's going to happen, no tension or dread built at all. Also using audio from the original movie in certain scenes was distracting.It may sound like I dont like this movie but no I do, i like it fine. It did its job in giving a very gory good time & turned out better than it couldve been. It got people talking and hopefully got more people to check out the original trilogy cuz let's face it, it's not evil dead without that camp factor & of course that chainsaw Welding Boomstick pointing chin wonder known as Ash Williams.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The new Evil Dead surprises, distancing itself from the original and giving new ideas to the series, which are coherent with the whole and sufficiently interesting","The film's premise is the crisis of Mia (Jane Levy), a drug-addicted girl. She is taken to a cabin in the woods by friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). The friends' interest is the girl's detox. To help with the process, David (Shiloh Fernandéz) decides to go there, along with his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). Mia and David haven't spoken for a few years, estranged by family problems.Later they discover that in the forest hut there are dead animals in the attic, as well as other grotesque items, among them a mysterious book. Eric, the most curious, takes the book to the center of the cabin and begins to read its passages aloud. With that, it awakens evil forces that will decimate, one by one, through violent takes and with liters of blood that surpass all the episodes of the Nightmare Hour, Halloween, Panic and Friday 13 franchises. There is an almost disposable opening scene. , used as the establishment of the macabre in the film, removed from the premise of Mia and her friends, but concatenated with the film in general.The film has an interesting starting point, in a well-constructed opening scene involving a father and his daughter. It is, however, a promise that is not fulfilled throughout production. Perhaps it's no exaggeration to say that this first sequence generates more chills and emotion than the rest of the film. Since then, Evil Dead embraces without any shyness practically all clichés of the genre - including those that were recently destroyed in the great The Secret of the Cabin (Cabin in the Woods, 2010), which shows how worn they are already. The group of characters, for example, is typical: the weird nerd, the hot blonde and the black woman are all there making their presence felt. Likewise, there is the obligatory scare scene involving a mirror, the characters who will investigate the occurrences on their own and, of course, the protagonist who at first is not taken seriously when she tells what is happening - even though, here, there is an attempt to circumvent this last question by inserting the possibility of being hallucination by abstinence.What makes The Evil Dead most interesting is the underused allegory between abstinence from drugs and demonic possession. Can what we see on stage be interpreted as a character's hallucinations? Yes. According to the assumptions of reception aesthetics, contextual and extra diegetic analysis is something coherent in the interpretive process, as it reflects the film beyond its internal structures. ""What happened to her eyes?"" This is one of the references to the text of the film that serves as a starting point. Even without the technological resources available today, the first film is much more impactful in the first scene demonstrating the condition possessed of the protagonist.This version of Evil Dead could be considered as another sequel, taking away the trilogy status of the franchise. This time, forget all humor or any comic relief. The only play in the script is with the initials of the characters' names. Note that David, Eric, Mia, Olivia and Natalia can form a game with the word DEMON. Ready. This is the only joke in the film that stands firm in a tone of seriousness and chooses only the gore and the macabre as ornaments for the narrative. The script brings some interesting insights, even if some are poorly developed. Unlike the book in the original movie, here the book gives details about demonic possessions, with pictures and a prophecy that heralds the apocalypse and the arrival of the beast after a shower of blood.As much as, in essence, the new Evil Dead is very far from the original, it is worth noting that Fede Alvarez and his screenwriters have several delights for fans of Raimi's film. The production features a series of tributes to the cult classic, such as the necklace, the watch, the basement scenes and, of course, the electric saw - an object presented by Alvarez with the awareness of its importance for fans. In addition, the filmmaker also uses more than once the feature that became a trademark of the original production: the scenes with Raimi's camera traveling through the forest, representing the evil entity approaching the cabin and the characters. Besides the look, it's impossible not to notice the influences of the classic The Exorcist, which range from the makeup of the possessed, to the blasphemies, with lines like: ""Your Mother is being raped in hell"". If you want to compare, I prefer the possessed of the original, jumping on top of the victims while saying ""Join Us"", but it is impossible not to point out that the possessed of this film also have outstanding characteristics, such as self-mutilation, yielding good scenes like the one in the bathroom in that one of the characters tears its mouth with a piece of broken glass. Throughout the movie, there are some pretty impactful scenes, like the sinister lick on the sharp stiletto (you saw it in the trailer, right?). However, despite the scares, the liters of blood, the updated vision, the narrative and aesthetic cleaning made of what was weak and also the stoning of what was always good in The Evil Dead, the new film is not absurdly terrifying as it promised. .Even with easter-eggs reminiscent of the 1981 trash classic popping up here and there, Alvarez and Raimi know that the tape cannot alienate the huge portion of the general public. With this, Ash, the protagonist of the classic trilogy immortalized by Bruce Campbell, gets a deserved rest and even the fan service moments (those that are only there for the already initiated), although existing, are isolated as much as possible from the story that is being told. The characters (at least some of them) have more defined personalities, rather than the near-caricatures Raimi created 30 years ago. The big problem with the script, however, is that it doesn't offer the viewer something to care about the characters. Not only is each individual in the group a stereotype, but by the end of the film they remain as alien to the audience as they were at the beginning. There is even an attempt to establish a past for the siblings - involving a trauma from the mother's death - but this is done so quickly and sloppily that there is no resonance with the viewer. Thus, the characters never look like real people, without any identification with the audience, which makes the dangers they go through without tension or interest. When one of the characters cuts her own arm, for example, there is no compassion for her, simply repulsion and disgust at the scene, shown in its entirety by Alvarez' camera.In addition to skidding in commonplaces, the script (written by Alvarez, Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody) is still built in a lazy way, with several inconsistencies and lack of meaning. Unlike the original film, where the plot was the least important thing, here you try to build a story, but it's so shallow and meaningless that it only weakens the final result. There is no real understanding of what is going on, of the ""rules"" involved in possessions: why are some possessed and others not, for example? As if that wasn't enough, there are also questions that are presented, but, soon after, completely ignored: at one point, one of the character's claims that the evil entity that haunts the group needs five souls for an abomination to get out of the ground; however, this happens even without this number being reached.This lack of care for the script only proves that the filmmakers were much more concerned with the technical issues of the production than actually with the story they were telling. At least, in this respect, Evil Dead is not lacking. The new version puts aside the technical precariousness of Raimi's films and delivers a film to the young audience of the 21st century, better finished and executed. With (apparently) less CGI than expected, Evil Dead bets on first-level makeup and effects, allowing Alvarez to abuse scenes with overt violence and a lot of gore. For the most part, that's just what the film has to offer, although the filmmaker manages to construct the occasional amusing scene, like the production's climax, involving - literally - a shower of red liquid. However, there is no tension, there is no nervousness; it is purely and simply viscera shown open wide.The Evil Dead has elements that will satisfy all tastes: gore and violence in dismemberments and mutilations (one involving an electric knife is impressive), demons and possession, witchcraft, apparitions, filth... there's a little bit of everything! Here there is no Ash or absolute hero, having in the figure of David the closest to these characteristics, although the final act has surprises - some absurd, by the way.... With a post-credits surprise that will make you laugh of fans of the original, Evil Dead 2013 will never reach the status of an absolute classic, game-changer or ultimate experience, or even live up to the promotional tagline: ""The scariest movie you'll ever see in this lifetime"". Even so, he should be seen in cinemas with the satisfaction of knowing that his classic was, in a way, honored in a bold and creative feature, capable of allowing new and curious treatments for the original, proving its fantastic qualities that should always be extolled and revisited.The new Evil Dead surprises even in its third act, distancing itself from the original and giving new ideas to the series, which are coherent with the whole and sufficiently interesting. And if the trailers were selling something that looked like a restart for the Evil Dead, just keep an eye out for the cabin to realize that it's actually a sequel (stay until the end of the credits, too). The curious thing now is to see how Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and co. Will continue the demonic saga with such different protagonists (and tones).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Eat this, mother******!""","After a 21 year hiatus (well, if you ignore the TV series), Evil Dead is back with this 4th entry. Serving as a sort of remake / sort of reboot to the franchise, the film follows five friends as they visit a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere. When one of them finds the book of the dead and reads aloud passages from it, an ancient demon is awoken and ends up posessing one of them. Cue murders. And gore. Lots and LOTS of gore...The original Evil Dead, despite being creepy and full of ott gore maintained a somewhat tongue in cheek vibe and didn't take itself too seriously. This does. With a genuinely unsettling atmosphere, plenty of actually frightening scenes and tonnes of pretty grim kills and gore effects, there is not a gag in sight. There is no light relief here. Combined with an actual decent plot (the friends are trying to help Mia overcome her drug addiction, so won't let her leave no matter how crazy she gets) that actually gives a legitimate reason for them staying, and great performances by the cast, this is actually pretty great. Oh, and the final act not only throws in a bit of a curveball that I challenge anyone to correctly predict, but the final battle is awesome. Just needed a bit of Slayer to top it off, haha.All in all this is a pretty solid entry into the series. It's well made, has decent performances and some cringeworthy scenes. If you are in the market for some extreme violence and gore, then look no further. For me personally though, I do like my Evil Dead films to have a bit of humour...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Works well enough for a silly, bloody demon flick","Did we really need a remake of Sam Raimi's iconic horror flick The Evil Dead? Probably not. But you won't hear me complaining. To be honest, I kinda like what I saw. The only thing I truly dislike is the the fact that the main characters are teenagers in the woods. Again. I know that the original also followed this trope, but come on, try something new once in a while! How boring is that? And I didn't need so much backstory for the two main characters Mia and Dave. It felt underdeveloped and overly dramatic at the same time. The script was trying way too hard to be deep. Give me a break. This is a silly demon romp after all. All that being said, if you get past the sappy stuff and take The Evil Dead 2013 for what it wants to be, you'll have a lot of fun.The characters aren't too annoying, pretty likeable actually. There's plenty of gore, some effective jump scares (a bit too many probably) and passable acting. I'm not a big fan of the special effects, they don't always look convincing. Some scenes were downright silly, I wasn't even sure if intentionally or not. By the way, why does every demon look and even sound like Regan from The Exorcist? That threw me off. The ending is a jaw-dropping, epic bloodfest. Very, very cool. Director Fede Alvarez goes crazy with the camera angles in true Raimi style. I felt the whole thing could have been even crazier, but oh well, for a modern ramake this one isn't bad at all. Give it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh...my....gosh,"I literally couldn't be more disappointed with this film than I am. Within 10 minutes of all ""hell"" breaking loose in the film, I wish I had saved my money and caught this on RedBox with my friends one weekend. The tag line of every movie poster I saw for this film said ""One of the scariest movies you'll experience."" It really should've said ""One of the bloodiest/goriest movies you'll ever see. Ever."" That's all the film was: Violence and Gore. If you are hesitant to see this film due to the ""scare"" tactics it promises, trust me; you'll be fine. It was eerie to see some silhouettes of possessed bodies, but that's it. Trust me. The rest is one character after the other fighting an incredibly violent fight against the ""villian"". I thought some more intelligent, scary elements would be in this movie.Simply said: There really isn't a good horror film anymore. Along with this film, we see another classic remake: Carrie. I felt bad for the original after seeing that preview.Avoid this one unless you love seeing gallons upon gallons of blood and constant violence. That's all you're paying for.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Solid Horror Remake that is V.I.O.L.E.N.T.,"Though Evil Dead has plenty of faults (the sounds the demons make are super lame), it is still one of the better remake/reboots out there (not sure if it's a reboot, considering that means it's becoming a series or spawning more sequels). The practical effects are fantastic and very brutal, they save the film from being another dismissive horror, gore- porn. But the movie doesn't feature any strong characters (like Ash from the original), it does its best to try and make Mia a formidable heroine (still doesn't work, however). That might be a problem with the movie right there, all the characters are quite bland.But perhaps its biggest downfall is that the movie goes for a more strictly horror approach instead of balancing the tone of the film between horror and comedy. The approach was clearly meant to be a more serious tone, but even that serious tone felt of quilter, maybe the movie would have benefited from a joke or two? So if you are looking for a horror movie with gore and lots of blood, this will definitely do, but if you want a horror movie with an actual storyline and atmosphere.....steer clear of this. Evil Dead is another unnecessary Hollywood remake of a beloved cult classic which only tarnishes the original's reputation!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore is its only calling card.,"You've already seen this movie. It was the remake of Black Christmas, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's every horror remake you've seen in the past ten years, only separated from the pack by lots of blood and pulp. Because the only thing this new version of Evil Dead has to offer is copious amounts of the red stuff.The film starts out with a prologue in which one man says ""Baby"" to his daughter, whom is he about to sacrifice, one too many times. This is just the beginning of the awful dialogue to come in the next twenty minutes as we move to the present day and get introduced to a group of friends through awfully stilted dialogue that only exists in movie world. I'm sure there are better ways to introduce your characters and their relationship to one another than having them openly remind the others of their relationship to them, their profession, and their back story. This is conversation that only exists in movie land, because real people don't need to be told you're their big brother or their best friend or that they're a high school teacher.After the clunky exposition, the film moves to the ""scares"" once a strange book is found in the basement of a cabin the friends are staying at to help one of them go through a cold turkey drug withdrawal. The quotes around ""scares"" was intentional, as there is not one genuine moment of suspense in this lifeless thing. The movie's sole calling card is the over-the-top gore, which, as an entertainment device, quickly loses steam the moment you realize that none of these effects are going to be preceded by any kind of suspense whatsoever. I saw the film with a theater that was 3/4 full and not a single person jumped, screamed, or showed any outward sign of emotion throughout.Once the unleashed demon begins taking over human bodies, the dialogue again takes another turn for the worse, with the possessed humans spouting dialogue that's straight out of more disturbing films like The Exorcist and come off like a kid trying too hard to impress his friends by saying the most extreme things he can think of without realizing how ridiculous he sounds.The last half of the film plays out like an effects workshop class, moving from one gross-out effect to another with slight pauses in between. Once the filmmakers intentions are made clear, the boredom quickly sets in. There is nothing remotely entertaining or suspenseful to fill the time. You can only sit there and wait for the next ""genius"" gross-out effect which is meant to carry the film in the absence of any good characterization or scares. For a horror movie to be slow is one thing, but when something is happening every five minutes and you're STILL bored, something is clearly wrong. And that's precisely what Evil Dead is--a boring film.The mood of the audience leaving the theater with me was underwhelming. For a movie that touted itself as ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"", something obviously got lost along the way. This is every Platinum Dunes effort you've seen, only touched up with some more gore to make up for the complete lack of anything else. Unfortunately this is 2013 and this trick is played out.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad for a remake for a classic hour movie,"This movie was a pretty solid remake. The story is pretty good but, I feel there are things it does good on it own but also has a few things that doesn't work as well it could have. It has very impressive practical effects. The violence in the movie is brutal and visceral. It's definitely more serious than the previous movies. Not really going into the campiness side of things. The main character I liked, her character brings a new hero for this franchise who's both well written and different. Some of the characters aren't as good they're not bad but just not as memorable. Overall a lot better than other horror movies but, not the great remake ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Remake Done Right?,"Is this film perfect? No. Is this film better than the original? I think the question is unfair. To a younger generation, I can see how they'll prefer this over the original. To my generation, I can see how we'll prefer the original. It's just the way it is.The film contains lots of gross-out, bloody scenes (much like the original). The film contains some over-the-top scenes and acting (much like the original). Once the carnage begins, the film is basically about the carnage (much like the original). The film contains some wonderful dark humor (much like the original).The setup of the addict trying to kick her habit (and not for the first time) logically keeps the kids at the cabin when the audience sees things starting to get a bit strange. The new ending was cool and freaky. Overall, they did a great job creating the atmosphere of an Evil Dead film.However, I'm reading most of the negativity surrounding this film is due to a lack of story, bad acting, under-developed characters, and lack of scares. Again, these same criticisms are what make the original so great. Bruce Campbell had three films as Ash. His personality really started to take shape in Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and was further enhanced in Army of Darkness. It seems as though most people are comparing this latest remake to the trilogy, as opposed to the original.There are some aspects of the film I could've done without (like some of the random jump scares that were inserted). Overall, I felt as though there was a bit of tension in the crowd, which is what makes a good horror film.Finally, the musical score was great.As to the devoted followers of Sam Raimi who are happy that he ""had nothing to do with this film."" He was a producer on the film and kept tabs on things as they went, wanting to give the new filmmakers space to make their own film but not allowing what he thought was a piece of crap to share the Evil Dead name. Yes. Sam Raimi endorses this film, and he was involved.For me, growing up with the original, I will always cherish that one. When the two DVDs are sitting side-by-side, I will reach for the original more often than the remake, but I think the remake disc will get plenty of wear. Go into this film with an open mind, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A solid remake of the original 1981 Sam Raimi classic.,"I love the new Evil Dead and I like it a lot more than the original. I just watched this with my mom and I ended up becoming satisfied with it and then when I watched it again by myself this time while my parents watched the new Star Trek sequel Star Trek Into Darkness I still haven't changed my mind and in fact I ended up enjoying it a lot and wished that I could watch it over and over again. To be honest I love this movie and I have no problems with this movie at all and the whole film is fun, super scary, nasty and extremely gory and hardcore on the brutality. The plot of this film is the same as the original where Five teens go to a cabin and spend a summer vacation there where they are soon haunted by the demons that lurks in the woods where one of them are one by one possessed by the demons as they stay in the cabin for the whole day. Seriously there are no problems with the film at all. I don't get all of the hate of the people in IMDb about the film it has a 7.0 rating but seriously the reviews are negative. I don't accept that and I just love this movie a lot and I admit it for real. I've watched the original and the original was a classic and scary Horror movie this movie is just like the original and it keeps the spirit of the original a lot plus the movie is full of violence that is nasty and super gory at the exact same time. Plus the other good things about Evil Dead is the haunting settings of the film. The soundtrack of the movie and last but not least the special and practical effects are so wonderful and there is no CGI used in the movie at all which I liked a lot and there are gallons of effects that are well used and effective plus the gore is super cool and awesome at the same time and the blood is so nasty and extreme at the same time. Kudos also to the haunting atmosphere and the performances of the casts and Jane Levy did a good job with her role as Mia the main character of the film and she's so gorgeous for one reason. This is overall one of the best remakes ever made and I totally admit that.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead (2013) The most brutal terror ever,"In Army of Darkness humor took over and they left aside the horror part. However, the remake of Evil Dead did the exact opposite and made a horror much more brutal and frightening than any other film in the franchise. The death scenes are very violent and the makeup is impressive, making you feel disgusted with every scene that appears. The new approach is by no means negative and delivers everything you'd expect from an R horror movie. The new characters are very interesting and manage to occupy the space that Ash left in the franchise very well.

The remake lacks the sense of dread and hopelessness of the original. The characters are thin and forgettable. This version was actually boring...This film is nothing like the original.

As a horror movie, it was on par with pretty much everything else being released today: boring and without substance. Don't waste your money.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Evil Dead"" (2013)","For this horror film fan, the original 1982 Sam Raimi-directed ""The Evil Dead"" remains one of the most purely terrifying motion pictures experiences of my lifetime. Its superior 1987 sequel/remake ""Evil Dead II"" (also directed by Raimi) was the series high point - and my personal favorite of the original ""Evil Dead"" trilogy - and was also a perfect marriage of horror and slapstick comedy. 1992's ""Army of Darkness"" was more fantasy than horror, but it was nonetheless a worthy closer to the original series.Now it's 2013, and it appears that reboots/remakes of classic horror films are everywhere. It was inevitable that ""The Evil Dead"" would get the remake/reboot treatment at some point. I was firmly against the idea of a remake/reboot of ""The Evil Dead"" since the beginning. I could not imagine Sam Raimi - who ascended to the ranks of Hollywood blockbuster-dom with his work on the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy from 2002-2007 - wanting to hop on the Hollywood bandwagon to remake his first hit movie.Alas, 2013's ""Evil Dead,"" which marks the debut of Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez, was not the disaster it could have so easily been. Raimi, Rob Tapert, and the almighty Bruce Campbell himself all return as producers on this latest outing Into The Woods. And believe you me, it's not that bad. While the movie starts and stops early on and has an irritating tendency in the earliest proceedings to sometimes elicit unintended snickers out of the audience, ""Evil Dead"" almost always plays it straight - much like the 1982 original, even though there may be one or two moments of gallows humor to liven the otherwise relentlessly grim mood.Things begin with an adventure to an isolated cabin in the woods: Mia (Jane Levy) is a recovering junkie who has been hauled out here by her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), and their mutual friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and David's girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) as part of her treatment after all other attempts to get clean & sober have failed - so now Mia has to go the detox route cold turkey. While exploring the cabin, they somehow or another wind up in the cellar, where someone slaughtered a bunch of poor felines as part of some kind of abandoned ritualistic sacrifice, and discover the so-called ""Book of the Dead."" Eric unwisely reads aloud the incantations within it, thus awakening the malevolent supernatural forces that had been lying dormant in the woods outside the cabin. One by one, the friends are slowly possessed by these demonic forces, leaving only one lone survivor to fend them off until morning.""Evil Dead"" does not play around. Much of what made ""The Evil Dead"" so purely horrifying has remained intact here: gore, self-mutilation, power tools, demonic possession, bodily dismemberment, and more gore. In fact, there's so much going on here in terms of gory special effects that at one point it's literally raining down blood. (Where's Slayer when you need them to provide some background noise for the slaughter?) Believe me, once the terror starts, ""Evil Dead"" becomes an almost relentless shock- and gore-fest - though obviously because we've seen it all before it lacks the intensity of Raimi's original classic.Alvarez and his co-scriptwriter Rodo Sayagues pay plenty of homage to ""The Evil Dead"" (it should be noted that this reboot combines elements of both ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead II"" - which was done, I would guess, to please die-hard fans of the original film series). Alvarez is also good in keeping up the tension throughout the picture, again in remaining in touch with the spirit of the original film and its sequels (even though it ultimately lacks the ferocious intensity of those films).It should again be noted that ""Evil Dead"" is drenched in blood. This is perhaps the most relentlessly blood-soaked ""R""-rated horror picture to be released by a major American film studio (TriStar Pictures) so far this millennium - unless you maybe count Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"" (2005), despite the fact that film was originally a British production released by Lionsgate Films here in the United States. How this movie managed to secure an ""R"" rating with so much blood is beyond me.""Evil Dead"" - It'll swallow your soul, maybe, if you let it.7/10P.S.: Watch after the credits - ""Groovy.""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The more the ""demon"" appeared, and the more she/it talked, the less scary it became... The acting was just so terrible, the writing sucked, the plot sucked, the direction sucked. The characters did things and made choices so idiotic that I just could not stand it (the 'hero' was so irritating throughout everything he did!) and suppressing laughter became quite hard.Yes, it had gore. Plenty of gore. Most of it was unremarkable - cheap shots of random body parts covered in buckets and buckets of flowing watery fake blood. It got quite boring.

Evil Dead,"A group of friends fight throughout the night to stay alive in 'Evil Dead', a 2013 retelling of the classic 1981 original starring Bruce Campbell.The movie begins in the cellar of the cabin where a possessed girl is tied up while an old woman reads incantations from an old book. Eventually, her father is forced to shoot her dead. Fast forward to sometime later, we meet David and his girlfriend Natalie who arrive at the same cabin we see before. We also are introduced to Eric and Olivia, and Mia who is David's younger heroin addicted sister. They plan on staying there together to help Mia overcome her addiction. While Mia deals with withdrawal, David discovers the cellar where lies a shot gun and the book which is called Naturom Demonto.Eric ends up reading an incantation from the book, unknowingly awakening an evil force. After that, Mia starts seeing a demonic look alike of herself lurking in the woods. No one believes her until other strange things start occurring and eventually when Mia becomes clearly possessed. After Mia vomits a ton of blood on Olivia, it turns her possessed as well leading to a fight from the group to try and stay alive and escape the terror of the Evil Dead.This remake definitely set a more serious and tense tone compared to the more comedic original film and trilogy as a whole. I like the fact that they didn't do a frame for frame type of remake, and bring back the characters from the original. This one, while set at a cabin in the woods, is an entirely new take on the ""Evil Dead"". The gore was amped up in this one as well, tons of blood very well done. The characters were developed pretty well overall. Mia's withdrawal scenes were very well done, led by the acting of Jane Levy. Really smart writing move to tie in her manic episodes with demonic possession, it worked. Jessica Lucas was a standout as Olivia, the nurse friend of the group.Overall, 'Evil Dead' is a fun gory ride from start to finish. It's a more traditional horror movie than the original series which had some humour, but a great entry to the series nonetheless.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pays Homage to the Original and Then Some,"This reanimated remake of the classic Evil Dead starts out a view askew from the original, but heads off into the general known storyline before things get completely out of hand. The characters get just enough back story washed over them to make the premise make sense without relying on flashbacks or any other tired story telling technique.Once the action begins there isn't a drawn out waiting period between actions points but it's not all jammed down your throat like a chainsaw right at once either. It maintains a fairly good pace throughout and doesn't deviate from the story for any meaningless asides.Fans of the original will be well pleased so long as they are aren't too obsessed and afraid of a little change. Newcomers completely oblivious to what they are getting themselves into will either be turned away by the blood and gore or find themselves entertained by a well spun modern retelling of Sam Raimi's cult film from 1981.There were times I laughed, times I cringed, and at one point I flinched just a little bit. Granted I'm an avid horror fan so I don't jump so easily, but they got me once. If you're looking for a genuine scare, this might be the movie to do it for you. If you love gore and have been waiting on a movie that doesn't rely solely on it for 90 minutes, this might be for you.

Beside the point that such a thing has already been done - it's called Evil Dead 2 - the original movie is such a cult classic and so perfect in its own flawed way that I don't really see any way to improve upon it.And truth be told, the only area where this remake fares better than the original, is in the special effects department. Yet, unlike so many other needless remakes, this one comes amazingly close to the original in both atmosphere and quality. It feels like Evil Dead, or what it would have been like had the original been done today for the first time.What do I mean by that? It simply plays the tropes just as well and just as straight as the original. Sure, at times it feels a little bit like paint-by-numbers, and there isn't a lot of originality here, but it's still different enough, yet similar enough, that fans of the original can love its vision and passion for the source material.And as an standalone horror movie, it's heads above its peers, which doesn't say much nowadays, but there you have it. It's absolutely, delightfully gory, it doesn't shy away from the no-no's or taboos, the characters work in their satirically stereotypical way and as a whole you feel the chills.Though I must admit that the final fight/boss/horror/aberration was a bit of a disappointment after all the buildup.If you liked the original trilogy, I urge you to give this one a watch. It's not as good, but it's a close thing. It's Evil Dead for the new century.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a Comedy-Horror,"Being a fan of the original Evil Dead movies, I was expecting a comedy-horror film but unfortunately found this to be more of slasher-horror film (the slashers being the protagonists possessed by demons). While there are nods to some of the more memorable scenes from the original, they are much more gory and dark. Also the main protagonist lacks any sort of appeal as the Ash character, which is one of the main reasons why the original movies were so fun (Bruce Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth watching). It ended up being an ok horror film, but does not hold a candle to the originals.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grotesque excellent reimagining of a classic,A morbidly wild ride from start to finish! Fun fact: Over 50K blood of fake was used. Fede Alvarez did something special with such a beloved film that I absolutely love! The sounds and grossness are delightful madness. Pure horror with a great supernatural story that elevates the mind.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What do you want from this film?,"If you want the original Evil Dead, there are some connections to the older film here and some new additions.
The set feels nostalgic and remiscent.
The brutality is certainly here, lots of cringy gore.
No censorship, some sexually disturbing shots (a bit like the older one).The story and characters are somewhat deviant, however. I thought that the script and the acting were weak at the start, but I think that Mia really got into her role once things picked up. The rest of performances were sub-par and the characters themselves were boring and had no depth/interrelationships that were notable.
 
BUT, as far as horror movies go, I still think this was a good movie. I watched it alone in the dark, so that may have added to the thrill a bit, but it certainly has the potential to keep you biting your nails and jumping off your seat every once in awhile. I think that the opening scene, by the way, was PHENOMENAL. So well done in my opinion, one of the best openers for a horror.If you watch horrors with the same mindset that you have for all other films, I'd say it's a 5/10.
If you watch horrors with the mindset that you're going to be watching a horror (as I do), I'd give it a 7/10.That being said, to name a few horror movies that I hold in high regard:
Conjuring films, The Thing (old one), The Mist, The Ritual, It Follows, The Others, The Village, The Witch.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It's a different film from the original,but this is an incredible Horror  7.9/10","I can't understand the Fanboys and the Fanboy wannabe's giving this excellent Horror any sort of a chance, because they have this infantile manner where they simply give a film 1/10 which is a pathetic attempt at proving themselves right. I know for a fact they have been hanging about the reviews to give a bad score for every review that says anything positive about this film. I watched the reviews myself one afternoon and there is a review which is one of the last reviews thanks to the Fanboys and when the header was changed to show admiration for the film it went from 98/277 to 91/277 over the course of a few hours. That is ""proof positive"" that this is going on. Pretty pathetic if you ask me.This film should not be compared with 'The Evil Dead' because they may have the same/similar characters 'and' has been approved by Bruce and Raime but one is a comedy and this is clearly not. It's a hard core gross out Horror and has perhaps the most graphic scenes ever to grace the silver screen. This follows the story faithfully but lacks any humour at all. I have mixed feelings about Comedy/Horror because most of the time the Comedy is used to allow the filmmaker (I mean the ""not very good"" film makers) to use it like when they know they can't pull off any real scares so they dumb it down and have the actors doing the same take, more or less but get them to do it in a silly way. This movie is all scares and hacking bits off etc. If you're looking for atrocious acting and loads of blood then this film is definitely you.Brilliant scary movie. I strongly advise you to go see this but make sure you have company with you for both moral and physical support.Highly RecommendedYou have been reading Buster Gonad and his unfeasibly large testicles.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as original but could be worse!,"The original was creepy, full of gore, had bad acting, a shoe-string budget but was a hell of a lot of fun. You got an eerie feeling from the moment it starts and it does not leave you until it's over. In short, The Evil Dead (1981) is a masterpiece in horror.Now, take that story, add a budget, some good acting, gore, but take away the eerie feeling and the fun, and you have Evil Dead the remake (reboot?).Nowhere near as good as the original in my opinion, but for a horror or gore fan, it's definitely worth a watch for the gross out scenes alone.I will admit there are a couple of funny moments, and I did enjoy the familiar elements from the first 2 films creeping into this new movie in various forms, but it's no original.By today's standards a very good horror movie by far. Nothing in the last 10+ years comes close to this movie in my opinion.But, alas, it's no Sam Raimi Evil Dead.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Effects? Check.  Required elements? Check.  Characters? ...,"Evil Dead is just one of those movies that can't be reproduced. Playing it with the same tone as the original is only possible with an artificially low budget, and audiences would simply guffaw at the attempts to reproduce a delightfully twisted B-movie. Playing it as a true horror movie is the only apparent option, and that leaves you with droves of viewers complaining about a film that has 'none of the charm that made the original film memorable.'So when tasked with directing Evil Dead, what do you do? Well, you're probably going to play it pretty straight and gritty as a horror movie. But what do you need to do to make it work? I'd say there are three things you need: (1) practical visual effects, (2) opaque homage, and (3) refreshed characters.(1) was a success. We've got a single scene with some CGI-looking splash as a car crosses a creek, but beyond that the visual effects are spot on. There are the gory and over-the-top moments, but there are also little things that are creepy or cringe-worthy, but it all looks like it was actually captured on film. For a film with so much shock value, I was actually surprised at how well tension was maintained throughout the film, and how the threat of pending violence was just as important as the bloodbath that had already occurred.(2) was done pretty well, too. We know the premise for Evil Dead: twenty-somethings spend the night in a cabin, find a book that wakes a demon, and are gradually possessed and dismembered. Someone will lose a hand, the way home will disappear, there's a chainsaw, a fruit cellar, and a creeping forest. Evil Dead keeps those elements intact, but it keeps the plot from being transparent to anyone who's seen the original. It stops and starts, it moves elements around, it plays with the audience's expectations .(3) is were this movie struggles. Casting a Bruce Campbell-like lead doesn't fit here, so we've got five average-Joe characters instead. Unfortunately, none of them are particularly interesting, and all but one of them are played hammily. I thought the drug addiction was a nice idea, and I appreciated how it played into the first third of the film. Unfortunately, it took a backseat to demonic possession, and we never got to see Mia struggling with both addiction and hellspawn. I suppose having 5 uninteresting characters does have one benefit. Rather than getting attached to a single protagonist, we start wishing for everyone to be possessed so they can wreak new and interesting havoc on the others. It's a slight positive, but it still doesn't make up for the lack of any solid performances.I really enjoyed this movie, but I enjoyed it on a pretty base level. The production and tone were enough to make it good, the ideas incorporated were enough to plant seeds of potential greatness, but the lack of any worthwhile characters keeps this in the B-movie range for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Cast & Crew Embarrass Themselves and Sam Rami,"We all can remember the reaction we had to Sam Rami's Evil Dead trilogy back in the late '80s. It involved a collected range from great delight due to the comedic undertone set by Rami, the ""Ewwwww"" sounds we made in our head as blood splattered all over the camera lens, and the moments that scared us enough to take a few bathroom breaks. The first two films were the two most memorable horror films of the 1980s and should be celebrated. Though Army of Darkness didn't hold the stature of the original two, it supplied the viewer a different path of the story and brought the story to a close suitably.Optimistically, I'll start with the qualities I found credible. From the prologue of, the Evil Dead remake has an eerie look to it that stirs up the suspense in your eyes. The film score in a horror film is so vital, and that's one thing this movie does get right, I really loved the score. The house in which the film is shot in, is styled in a morose manner that makes for a good setting for a ghost story such as this. The make-up design for Evil Dead is overwhelming, the jury is still out whether that means it works for the film or against it. I began to wonder if they just tacked on unnecessary gore-cenrtic tags to scenes to literally stop the story from ascending to anything at all and just please blood craving suckers.I think if any horror film were to be remade (I still don't understand why we're remaking highly successful, quality horror movies to begin with), The Evil Dead would be a great choice as long as it was tackled without an approach of comedy. The film takes that chance, it's nice to see the contrast in storytelling, but it isn't that successful. Sam Rami's film was cut off from reality, but they knew it and embraced it with their method of injecting comedy to the scares. With this approach, they have to at least pretend this could actually happen to people somewhere in the world, but I never got that feeling of reality once. It retained the tacky qualities of the original, but didn't inherit the quality.It isn't scary! A few times, it begins to build to something frightening, but it never surmounts that peak. Evil Dead's quick pan-in shots that cut to preposterous demon snaps don't get my fear levels rumbling. The demon shots themselves play like a early development versions of The Exorcist that just took an enthusiastic dose of acid. It's not even well made enough to constitute as a throwaway, entertainment fodder. With little sense of structure, recycled dialogue, characters who purposely go against the way rational human beings problem solve, Evil Dead retains no class and should have ""Tasteless"" written over the DVD cover in fire- engine, red-blood splatter.One thing Evil Dead attempts to do is create some humanity with a topic about the overconsumption of drug and family issues. Too bad, it collapses in the attempts. At least it tries. Forcing myself to sit through the duration of the last twenty minutes, I stared with a foul look poisoning the screen thinking about the future of this genre. Creativity needs be revived and filmmakers need to grow the story realistically and stop trying to stylize every singly shot of movie. The result of that over-pizazz in horror films is all horror films feel the same nowadays. There's nothing to define The Evil Dead from the movie of the week except its ancestors reputation. We need to take the characters seriously to open up to a movie, we have to take the characters seriously to take the story seriously; and we have to take the story seriously to take the movie seriously.Poor special effects are a inconsistent aspect of Evil Dead, but the dreadful acting can be found any minute of the movie. The film has the impudence to try to end with symbolism; eject the film from your DVD player before you even have the misfortune of seeing that. Evil Dead should have been retitled ""How Many Times Can a Body Be Mutilated Without Croaking"", that way Sam Rami's films wouldn't have had to undergo such awful representation to the new era of horror junkies.Rating: 2.5/10Grade: D",,Anonymous,Horror
An interesting twist to the demonic theme.,"Compared to the original Evil Dead film made in 1981, this remake has much more twists and turns, making it a film full of high-tension. As well as the characters having actual back stories, causing the audience to feel a large connection to the saddened characters. Though being very different from the original, the change in characters and script is done in not a disappointing way; though in a way that leaves you not knowing what to expect.In my personal opinion, the remake is better than the original. I found that the original was a little too unrealistic and frankly the characters died because of their own stupid actions (like wondering off into a forest in the middle of the night). However in this new addition to the Evil Dead franchise, the characters are put in situations that they didn't put themselves in, making you feel large amounts of sorrow and leaves you wishing you could have helped them in some way.Now, I feel like I should leave a warning here... If you don't like gore, stay away from this film. I personally love gore, but only when it's done in a clever way. This is why I liked Evil Dead (2013). And lets not forget the fantastic acting from Jane Levy. If it weren't for her, a majority of the scenes would have been far less intense. She brought total terror to the film.Overall, I give this film a 7/10. Not the best horror film ever made, but still done in a genius way. I say give this film a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just watch the movie as if there was no original and watch it as its own original. You should have more fun with it.

remake starts well,"Friends Mia (Jane Levy), David (Shiloh Fernandez), Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) go to an isolated cabin. Mia is an addict trying to quit cold turkey. They find the Book of the Dead and all hell breaks loose.Fede Alvarez wrote/directed this remake of Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). The movie starts off well. I wish he developed the addiction story a lot more. There is some allusion to a bigger commentary on drug rehabilitation. The action is good fun classic horror moments. It's got great classic camera movements. Everything is going well.About midway, Jane Levy's character is sidelined. Shiloh Fernandez takes more center stage. Sadly, he's just a functional Latino hunk. He can't hold the screen as well as Bruce Campbell. The more interesting character is the nerdy sidekick played by Lou Taylor Pucci. Then the 3rd act gets going, and it devolves more and more into a slasher-porn movie. It's all screams, darkness, blood splashing. Even the return of Jane Levy can't save it. It ends as an exercise to see how much red paint they can splatter. This started with so much promise, but satisfied very little of it. We get none of the humor. We do get the return of the chainsaw. But Bruce Campbell saying ""Groovy"" after the credits really doesn't do it for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Fun,"I really enjoyed this movie and could not help but feel like it is one of the best horror films I have seen in quite some time. So I was a bit shocked and sad to see it getting a lot of bad reviews and comparisons to the older version that this film is loosely based on. I am 21 years old I was not alive in the 80's when the first Evil Dead came out and yes I have seen it and I can see why it would have been amazing and good at the time but it really had no effect on me. This movie is made for my generation, for those that have seen it all and need new scares and shock tactics. Perhaps in 40 odd years time they will remake this again and I ll be the one to slate it and give it bad reviews and say it really did not compare to the 2013 version! What I loved about this movie was the fact it was just never ending, one thing after another it was tense, gritty and at times very jumpy and cringe worthy. A real roller coaster ride of horror. I could not help but feel like there was lot of references to other great horror films, the bathroom scene (Physco), the car driving to the cabin (The Shining) and there was also quite a few Sam Rami style camera angles which were great. At the same time they also managed to bring some new and fresh things to the table for example at times the music was quite different (sirens/warning alarm) and at some points it was very classical and what you would expect from a horror film. It was very gory but I was so caught up in the terror and thrill of it I did not mind it or even think about it till after wards when I was like that was actually really gross. Unlike other films such as Saw where your just sitting there thinking this is just violence for the sake of violence. To me they struck a really good balance here of being necessary and shocking with out being too over the top or fake. The story plot also was quite strong I am sure if I were to watch it a second time I could pick out some flaws and holes but on first viewing everything seemed justified and reasonable. Compared to other films where your left thinking why would you do that, why would you go back or who would do that in real life? It was also such a great experience to see it in a cinema, every body was screaming, jumping, cringing or hiding behind some one which only made it all the more fun for me. The only bad thing I can say is that the characters/acting were at times a bit flat especially at the start but if they had tried to develop the characters and their own stories any more it would have made it very cliché and fake. I also did enjoy the opening scene and did not feel like it was a good way to start the movie as there was no suspense or tension build up just boom, blood and violence. Perhaps if they had worked it in as flash backs when they find the cellar it would have worked better, but thats just my opinion. Don't hate this movie just because you think its cool too or because it did not compare to the time you saw the original in the theater. You have to take into account, the times and the industry have all changed and moved on. Just go grab your most nervous and jumpiest friend, a big box of popcorn and let the fun begin!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Naturom Demonto,"*Spoiler Alert!*WARNING! - Evil Dead is not for the squeamish (like me).But, if you're an enthusiastic fan of really/truly hardcore horror & gore - And, if lots & lots of splattering blood, and severed limbs, and burning flesh, and abominations from hell and, yes, even a horrifying and nicely staged scene involving a chainsaw (Yep. That's right, folks, a chainsaw), gleefully thrown in for good measure, is what gets you all wet & wild & wanting more and more, then, yes, this Evil Dead reboot (coming 30 years later) will most certainly satisfy you to its very last drop.And, if Evil Dead doesn't get those insatiable, horror-hungry juices of yours flowing at full force, then I don't know what the hell would. I really don't.Without wasting any time at all with the usual fluff & stuff, Evil Dead dove right in and certainly delivered a real monster-of-a-wallop with its relentless depiction of gut-churning, scream-at-the-top-of-your-lungs horror.Well, hey, what the heck did you expect?Not being much of a fan of the horror & gore genre, I honestly couldn't say that I liked this Evil Dead remake a whole lot, but, then again, I wouldn't say that I hated it, either.This film's terror-ifically graphic visual effects literally stunned me silly and came pretty close to putting me into a really dangerous state of heart-stopping shock.Yes. Evil Dead's ""cabin-in-the-woods"" scenario was painfully predictable (Well, what did I expect?) - And, yes, its characters were just there to be annihilated in the most hideous fashion imaginable (Well, what did I expect?) - And, yes, the dialog was just plain dumb to the 10th power (Well, what did I expect?)....But, with all of that s-h-i-t aside, I think that this slightly above-average remake was something of a triumph in its re-telling of horror-run-amok in terms of keeping in pace with today's standards of in-your-face, down-your-throat, and up-your-ass terror.What more can I say?*""Cute"" trivia note* -There are 5 principal characters in the story. Their names are David, Eric, Mia, Olivia, & Natalie. If you take the initial of each of these names, in the order that I've listed them, they spell out the word (Are you ready for this?) ""DEMON"". (My-oh-my, now, ain't that cute?)*""Serious"" trivia note* -The original, 1981 version of Evil Dead had a very modest budget of about $375,000.This remake's budget was a whopping $17 million.

Useless,"The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience? Uh, no, that would be ""The Shining!"" Not this ""Evil Dead"" remake!Creating the atmosphere of horror is what made ""The Shining"" great.

Although, the original films still very much exist, so we can always see them again. I would recommend that a thousand times over wasting your time or money on this!The few good parts were the pre-title sequence, punctuated by the title card thundering onto the screen, and a special appearance after the End Credits!

Don't compare to the original and you'll enjoy it more!,"We know the story - teens in a remote cabin albeit for a different reason to the usual (sex & booze) who then open the gates of hell and are forced to fight evil and try not to get bumped off in a variety of gruesome ways. All fairly routine so far and, in truth, this is little different to a number of similar films in the past. Cabin In The Woods tried to change the formula but this reverts to type and for all the negative comments, I actually enjoyed it as popcorn-put-brain-in-neutral fodder.I think the key to 'liking' this is not comparing it to the 80s classic - the story is similar but it's really not a like-for-like remake at all.I wouldn't call it scary, more an excuse for some gross-out effects - including one with a Stanley knife which is borderline unwatchable - and a couple of scenes which made me squirm (and I've been watching horrors since the late 70s). Equally I did jump on a couple of occasions and actually laughed once (the ""my head hurts!"" bit!).People will see it for the same reason as me - I enjoyed the original so I wanted to compare - but try and forget it's a remake and that the title is the same and treat it as a separate film and you'll probably enjoy it more.

Could have been worse but should of been better,"Evil Dead made a big mistake by having a bold statement printed in large letters across its poster, saying THE MOST TERRIFYING FILM YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE. Unfortunately for the more experienced horror fans this film is not that terrifying, with not much true scares delivered, to me it failed in that department.When I first saw the original The Evil Dead I was in 6th grade and I remember really being spooked by it and could never get that pencil in the ankle part out of my head. I think The Evil Dead was the first really gory movie I've ever seen at the time and made me love horror films even more and really check out the classics. The acting in the original was laughably bad, but in an entertaining and charming sort of way, with a charismatic protagonist Bruce Campbell as the iconic Ash. Of all the old horror films I've seen in the past The Evil Dead wasn't a true favorite of mine, Poltergeist is still number 1 on that list, which is also being remade to my dismay. The original also hasn't aged too well either and watching it now is more for laughs than anything else, but I always admired its atmosphere and DIY gory and brilliant practical effects. You can't deny that The Evil Dead much like Halloween before it, paved a way for horror films and unknown horror filmmakers trying to make a breakthrough, it made a lasting impact for sure.The new Evil Dead isn't a horrible remake and in fact it's the most loyal and not watered down ones out there and amps the violence and gore up to the brilliant extreme! It gives several nods to the original but makes it its own, some scenes though happen too fast and there wasn't enough suspense and I never thought I would say this but the pace was way too fast making the experience all too predictable. I absolutely loved the look of the new Evil Dead atmosphere; it stays true to the original's atmosphere but polishes it to perfection. The remake doesn't surpass or improve and fix the originals problems but didn't quite fall below it either; it can proudly stand side by side. This isn't groundbreaking again or will help the horror genre move forward but it could of been way worse. Also the last 10 minutes of the film was insane and much better than the first half.The acting for the most part was uneven but an improvement over the original. This is Jane Levy's movie though, she delivers a memorably creepy and to me breakthrough performance as Mia, who is fighting a heroin addiction and agrees to go to a remote cabin in the woods with her brother and friends to finally kick this shameful habit to the curb for good. Right away strange things start to happen, which leads to the discovery of the book of the dead and the controversial and still uncomfortable tree rape scene, which isn't as prolonged this time around but just as sadistic. The evil dead soon takes over Mia's body and all hell breaks loose and blood covers the screen. Jane Levy is really put through the ringer in this film and has such a challenging and layered role to take on and she succeeds in flying colors. Jane stole every scene she was in and her character is the only one worth rooting for, as the other characters seem like cardboard cutouts of unsuspecting horror film victims. A new scream queen is born and that's Jane Levy! Shiloh Fernandez who plays Mia's brother David, Lou Taylor Pucci who plays Eric, Jessica Lucas who plays Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore who plays David's girlfriend Natalie all do their best, but their characters fell flat to me and underdeveloped to give a damn and their characters made some pretty idiotic moves and common horror movie mistakes. None of them where annoyingly distracting though and their demises were very brutal, I just wish their characters had more to do than to just serve the plot especially Jessica Lucas, who they totally underused here.It's pretty amazing that this is director's Fede Alvarez first major and full-length film as it's expertly and confidently crafted, his future as horror filmmaker looks promising as it's permanently planted and can't wait to see it grow. You can see his love and inspiration for the original film and with guiding hands like the original director Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell who are the producers, they couldn't do that much damage from the get-go. The writing is a different story as it all came up flat to me. Fede collaborated with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody who she wrote the sleeper hit Juno and made a semi comeback with Young Adult. Diablo Cody seems to be delivering hits and misses, Juno was great, Jennifer's Body was OK but fell flat, Young Adult was again great but once another horror movie comes along her signature sharp, witty and meaty dialogue disappears. Of all horror movies Evil Dead deserved to have that kind of dialogue, it was all just too damn serious and if you are not going to back up the bold statement in your poster at least bring on the twisted laughs and sharpness.Overall, Evil Dead's downfall is that it was much too over hyped and overrated much like The Cabin in the Woods.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

True and wonderful tribute to B movie  slashers,"Evil Dead remake, by same producer Bruce Campbell as the 1981 original, succeeds in capturing the feel from old horror B movies!

It's really up to the viewers to decide if they like this kind of movie: completely unreal and sometimes laughable, but THAT is the true essence of it! Applause for almost no CGI usage, just as in the original flick, and the old school techniques for special effects (make-up, etc). Highly entertaining, if you are willing to accept this genre, this is a true and wonderful tribute to the B movie slashers that were so popular back in the 70's and 80's, and should be enjoyed accordingly to that feel. Evil Dead is not to be taken seriously and is laughingly entertaining. Very good!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It seems as though no one is taking Evil Dead for what it truly is and what it is truly about.,"Evil Dead is not a masterpiece, that is for sure. It is not perfect, nor is it cinema gold, but it is beautiful in its own right. I have read through many of previous reviews and upon me is a sea of one star votes; solid negativity with no light amidst the darkness. Many people have mistaken this movie for horror. It is not. This movie is grind-house in its purest form. Grind-house, for those who don't know, is the genre of film that embraces massive pools of blood and gruesome special effects. This is what the new Evil Dead is. It plays tribute to Evil Dead and all those in the related genre, but at the same time, modernizes its predecessors with new technological advances. The movie was well done; dialogue was limited, but believable, and effects never distracted the audience from the goal of the film, but rather embellished it. From a personal standpoint, myself being an original Evil Dead fan, I don't think the movie could have done much of a better job. Evil Dead was the heart of what every movie should be: entertaining. I smiled the whole way through. By the time the end came, I was completely satisfied. It's not often that a remake or sequel meets par with an original, but this is definitely an exception. Watch this movie for the gore, watch it for the one-liners, watch it for the tributes, just go ahead and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror movies in a long time,"I attended a premiere tonight here in Austin, TX for a film I've been anticipating for a long time. Normally I despise remakes (excpetion: 2011's The Thing,) but Evil Dead, this 2013 version directed and co-written by Fede Alvarez and with Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell as two of the film's producers, blew my mind. Now it not on a par with the original, and it is definitely not ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience,"" but damn... still, it was, with out a doubt, the scariest movie I have seen in a long time. And I watch a LOT of horror movies. Pop-up after pop-up and twist after twist, it is absolutely relentless.Despite its brilliance, as with any film there are flaws. The opening scene doesn't do the rest of the movie justice, I don't know to me it didn't seem to fit in too well. And some of the dialogue is slightly cheesy. However, those bits of cheesiness are made up for with surprising performances from all of the cast. But overall, it is fantastic. Once it gets going, it doesn't slow down. On the contrary, it only seems to pick up. As a film buff, one thing that I found awesome was the absence of CGI. In fact, all the effects are man-done, going old school with it. I had never heard of Fede Alvarez until today, but he is an impressive director and I have high expectations for him. Evil Dead does not disappoint, and has plenty of homage to the original trilogy (Evil Dead fans prepare to get ready!. A must-see film; just remember, it's NOT the original. ""It's not a remake; it's a rebirth."" He couldn't be more right.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I Expected,"I went in to the movie with low expectations because of hearing many bad reviews. However I was quite pleased with the film.The story line picked up and got exciting pretty quickly. Once the movie got going, you really couldn't relax until the very end. It was very intense, although I will say it was not as scary as anticipated. It was more suspense and gore, opposed to fear.The special effects in the movie were pretty good, besides the demon voice - which made myself and the audience laugh most of the time. There was some great violence and gore; you will have yourself a good cringe.I liked this movie because it kept my attention the entire time and made me laugh, cringe, and also tense up with suspense. The movie was better than I expected but still not incredible.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely amazing,"I have been waiting to watch this since January, and I missed it in theatres (and was really disappointed!), but here I am reviewing it on the day it is out on DVD. I waited 8 months for it, and it was totally worth it. This movie has your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish. Jane Levy was stellar, and Fede Alvarez did an incredible job as the director. I read about what a hard time the cast had filming it, and I can't believe that they are willing to do other projects. This is not an average horror movie, and has an actual plot, compared to some other horrors this year. And the Special effects were fantastic, and limiting the usage of CGI definitely works in horror movies. It will remind you of the horrors from the 70's and 80's. Overall, the best horror I have seen this year, and Jane Levy definitely has big things coming her way.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enough Gore and Atmosphere For Any Horror Fan,"Evil Dead (2013)*** (out of 4)Remake of the 1981 classic has five friends going to a creepy cabin in the woods so that one can kick a drug habit. Soon after arriving the group find a weird basement containing a book, which one ends up reading and releasing a deadly curse. For the past twenty years there's been buzz on whether we'd get a fourth film in the original series or if someone would dare take the challenge and start something new. While I don't think this is quite as good as the original there's no question that the filmmakers put a lot of time and effort into the film and they've managed to make something that will probably be seen as the top of its genre in its own time. EVIL DEAD really packs quite a punch on a number of levels. I'm one who feels that gore is never scary and I think that's true here but it's somewhat different. Director Fede Alvarez builds up a rather creepy atmosphere, which certainly helps the impact of the film but he also manages to make the violence quite gruesome. I wouldn't call the violence scary but it's certainly got an intense shock level to it that makes it quite effective. The entire look and feel of the movie is terrific as you really do get something that soaks up the low-budget and manages to use it as a positive. I thought the director really did a great job at building up the loneliness of the woods and I thought this here added to the atmosphere. I also didn't hurt that the five actors gave such good performances. There's nothing Oscar-worthy here but all give cast members really turned in strong work and best of all is that the screenplay gave them something to do and managed to make us like each and everyone of them so that by the time the violence starts we can feel something for them. This here is something missing from a lot of horror films today. To say EVIL DEAD is a great throwback would probably be an understatement but I think the film proves what can be done when you get a director, a cast, writers and producers who want to do something right. EVIL DEAD is a gory, creepy, violent, over-the-top thrill ride that isn't flawless but it's certainly at the top of its game.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Oh, the moronic fanboys on this site...","Though the movie wasn't perfect, it deserves no where near the 1/ 10 rating that most people I saw giving it recently. When I see 1/10 ratings, I either think of fanboys or people who really know nothing about rating movies (if you really want to see a movie worthy of a 1/10 rating, please rent Ax Em). I have chosen to give this movie a 7 (really a 6.7 out of 10 but I rounded up). The positives were that a lot of the kills were different from the original movie so it wasn't as similar, a different and more solid story on why they are there instead of the original, the characters have a little more depth than the original, the acting wasn't too bad, some of the gore scenes were slightly newish and not as overly cliché in most horror movies, the occurrence of the demons seem to come in play earlier than the original, and it seems the cabin's didn't change too much. Now the negatives: the blonde girl's acting wasn't really that great, the weird prophecy thing with the 5 souls really was kind of dumb, but it does kind of give more of a goal for the demons than the original's to where they only wanted to kill so it is more of a so-so criticism, not enough chainsaw, not enough effectiveness when the actors were to change to demon transformations, ending wasn't really sufficient, there was a point or two when i thought they had more of enough reasons to leave, and I felt the actors took too long for them to interfere with a demon when someone would get attack (example being the nail gun scene). Other than that, this movie deserves its rating. Please either rent or buy. It is pretty good. Not perfect or the best, but better than most people will recognize it for.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfect mix of gore and horror!,"I have never watched the original movies, so i can not compare anything in this movie with that, however as a remake, it seems better than most remakez!

This movie however also has great horror, interesting characters, a straight forward plot, some incredible practical effects, and tension! The movie is not very complex which makes it an easy and fun watch!It takes some time before things go down in rhis movie, but once they do.. it is almost nonestop gor fest and tension!I was surprised how much i liked this movie, and you dont have to watch the original first to enjoy it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Its not the original, but so what.","Now, if you have seen the original 'The Evil Dead' and expect this film to follow in its foot steps like the classic sequels, then you are going to be disappointed. That's because this film is a far cry from the original and should be treated as such when watching and reviewing the film yourself.This film in my honest horror film lover's opinion is certainly better than the modern horror films being churned out in the 21st century. Though not an original concept the film certainly should not be branded as simply another trashy horror film filled with drugs, blood and sex. Which is unfortunately what most horror films have gradually become. This film however contains no sex, no drug use and an unbelievable 'Tarantino Worthy' amount of blood. Though to some this may appear to be a way of creating cheap scares to put the audience at unease, i find this to however not be the case. The amount of the blood, though ridiculously over the top is reminiscent if i remember correctly, to the original films with the ridiculous amount of blood used to make the audience burst out with laughter. This film though trys to take a more serious and 'frightening' approach to the Evil Dead franchise.Though the film does not scare, as im sure those who've watched it know, the film certainly puts its strengths more into the gory effects, 'make you jump' moments and attempt at creating more of a back story involving the brother and sister Mia and David. The back story itself i think fits very well with the films concept of there being no escape from the cabin and the evil unleashed from them being there. The visual effects themselves i thought were fantastic, and the fact that they aimed to create these effects with as minimal cgi as possible is the best way for films to be nowadays. The effects themselves aiming to create the scares and jumpy moments were very effective in my opinion. The visual effects of skin decay, dismemberment and demonic possession etc are certainly more horrifying for a modern audience and more realistic. But this was what makes classic horror so beautiful, as the effects are far more cruder in design but far more creative and require more imagination than your average teenager with a 3D modelling program on their household computer.When watching this film, if the classic film sits happily in the back of your mind, then this film may disappoint you depending on what you're expecting. But if the original has not sat in your disc tray then shame on you, but that also means that you're not expecting the film to surpass the original film so loved by many. This film is merely a re imagining of a cult classic and merely aims to create a new story from the Evil Dead concept of a group of teenagers unwittingly releasing a deadly evil upon themselves through reading passages of the Necronomicon.As a classic horror film lover, i'm ashamed to say i saw the trailer for this film before i had even seen the original and for some reason was procrastinating when it came to see the original. And when watching it was simply blown away, which is what modern horror films just simply don't do anymore when the best horror films weren't even released in this century. So i knew that this film was not going to live up to the original and didn't enter the cinema with false hopes. But nonetheless i have to say i wasn't let down by this film as other people claim to have been. Yes its a remake and therefore another unoriginal concept but i was simply drawn to the fact that the attempt to reboot had been made, as with Dawn of the Dead (2004) remake and The Thing (2011) prequel. Which in both cases the originals far surpass them in every way as classic horror masterpieces, but that still didn't stop me from watching them, and enjoying them.So if you are going to see this film don't expect perfection in story telling, dialogue or acting (Shiloh Fernandez for me was far too wooden) as this film is not. When watching this film just embrace the valiant effort made to reboot the classic Evil Dead series and i have to say i cant wait to see the Evil Dead sequels to follow. The fact is remakes/reboots and unwanted sequels are always going to be made and there are going to be those who either love them or hate them. Which one are you?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Groovy.,I'd prefer Sam Raimi's original Evil Dead trilogy to this copy. Raimi made The Evil Dead in such a horrifically funny way that it became a pop-culture iconic film that its story can't ever be rebooted.This version is just having a different directorial style and ideas that its just shaming itself.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Give me a break!,"I don't understand all the negativity toward this one. It's all Sam Raimi this, Bruce Campbell that, come the heck on...Plain and simple: If you want to see the Evil Dead from 1981, rent that one again. If you want to see a modern offshoot that re-imagines the film (This does NOT mean that it does it as good or better than the original!!!!) then this is worth seeing. So what if it has cliché moments here and there? ALL new horror films seem to draw from the same bag of tricks (The Conjuring being the most successful so far) so the techniques here should come as no surprise. Gore, check. A few jump-scares, check. Depth in writing, not really. But, hey, it is what it is. I expected much less when I rented this and quite honestly, it could have been much, much worse. THERE IS NO ASH AND NO BRUCE CAMPBELL. SO FREAKIN' WHAT?!? Take it for what it is or stop your whining people. It's not an award-winner. It's good old gory horror fun. Take it or leave it. And by the way...if the only negatives you have are based off the original, get over it. This didn't claim to be a scene-by-scene remake, and I'm sure that even if it was and even if the almighty Bruce Campbell was the lead actor you would still have some sort of bone to pick. Enjoy the original and the new Evil Dead as two separate entries in the same catalog and you will be much better off. Cheers.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fine homage,"For a remake of a classic horror film, the ""Evil Dead"" of 2013 does many things right. It has its missteps, yes, but through the vast catalog of recently produced, generic horror remakes, this one is indeed handled with care.The franchise creators, Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, all step in to create a ""fresh"" take on the series. They brought along Fede Alvarez and put him in the directors chair. Wise choice? I'd say so. Fede is easily a talented director, but where he somewhat lacks in character development, he gains in style and finesse.The film looks great. I can't imagine anyone disowning the movie for its poor photography, production design, or practical effects. On many levels, it excels upon the original... but these are different times. Whereas the original ""Evil Dead"" directed by Sam Raimi had a strong cast of likable characters, the remake becomes slightly hit or miss. All there is to say is that Jane Levy shines. Once the narrative of Mia comes into play, the film truly starts.Granted it doesn't live up to the cult status of the original, it still carves its own path by attempting to pull off a completely different experience, which it is. You can compare them, but they are really completely different films, and I love it for that alone. Consider every horror remake you've seen that had no originality... complete copy and paste of the original. This does not fit that criteria. This hopes to bring a new ""Evil Dead"" to the table.And on one last note... the musical score in this movie is brilliant. Without it, I wouldn't find it as intense or thrilling as it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
pointless,"OK time for my summary of this thing.well, the one thing it had going for it was the near absence of comedy/parody, which has absolutely no place in the horror genre. it also had some decent production value (photography, lighting, and editing)more importantly though, this is a movie for an immature audience who'se only pay off comes in which way the chainsaw will be used to dismember a body on screen.this film has no heart, non existent characters and stupid dialogue.they could had greatly improved this film by dropping the whole failed notion that gore = fun, and focusing itself on the addiction of the lead character. by taking the proper steps to flesh out the paranoia and discomfort of the drug addiction maybe we could actually care about the brother/sister relationship, alas, the characters exist only to fuel childish desires to see them cut limb from torso. this movie needed to be MUCH darker, mature, and impart the seriousness of violence and how disgusting and horrific it really is, however, since the characters do not follow any arc in any sensical manner all that was left in this shell of a movie is its blood and guts, and without a heart or a point, why should we care?all in all. a pointless endeavour.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Love Letter to Evil Dead Fans,"The best horror remake since The Ring. I wouldn't call it a remake though. It's more of a re-imagining of a classic horror story. It takes the perfect amount of goodness from the horror classic to make it nostalgic without the ""been there, done that"" feeling and adds many new elements to it that make it its' own.While this may not hit cult classic status like EDII did, this is still an amazing horror film. The effects are admirable. You can tell they didn't use computer generated effects by the quality. I'm not a gore fan in horror films because they usually substitute the story for the gore, but this wasn't the case here. While I didn't laugh as much as I did with the original Evil Dead films, this was still one of the funnest theater experiences I've had in a while.You already know if this film is up your alley or not by the trailers, so critics are irrelevant in this case. A lot of love was put into this re-imagining by Raimi and the promising director Alvarez. The female lead was also wonderful and, as far as lead females in horror go, could potentially become iconic. She absolutely steals the show with some very memorable scenes and a face made to show fear. By the end of the film, with the perfect conclusion and the sound blasting into my ears, I couldn't help but think I was watching something special.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good ... for a gore-feast style horror movie,"It should not really come as a surprise to anyone that this movie is a bit of a gore-feast. I have to admit that I have not seen the original movie from 1981 so I cannot comment as to whether this one is better or worse. Personally, I thought it was quite okay and a step above the classical B-movies that these kind of horror movies frequently turns out to be.The story is not really very original. Not that it had any chance of being that since it is a remake after all but the ""group of young people get stuck in cabin in the woods while evil things make bad things happen"" was not really the most original one already when the first movie came out. It is a straightforward enough horror movie story and it is quite well implemented.The special effects (read gore) is well done and not too ridiculous and over the top as in some movies. Some may of course consider that the gore levels that we talk about here are always over the top but then this is obviously not a movie for you so do not watch it. Of course there are some ridiculous moments in the movie though. For some reason they never seem to be able to make a horror movie without them. There is the always present dumb guy that stops and feels sorry when the demon starts to whine in the voice of his girlfriend or sister even though he knows it is a demon for example. The amount of punishment these people take and still walk around is also a bit ludicrous. Warning, slight spoiler ahead! I especially think the scene where Mia pulls her arm so hard that she separates it from her hand is just silly. There is no way she would have the strength to do that and there is even less way that she would be able to walk around afterwards. She would have passed out from shock at the very best.Anyway, as I said, no one seems to be able to make a horror movie without some silliness in it so I cannot say that I was very surprised. In general it was a good movie though. Well implemented with a fitting scary mood in a lot of the scenes. I have to say that I liked the fact that there was no hysterical teenage beauty queen and actor wannabee running around screaming her head off all the time. Actually, that is another thing that elevates this movie to a slightly higher state than the traditional B-movie state of most horror movies. The acting in general was quite acceptable.In general it made for an enjoyable movie eveningif you like gory horror movies that is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than a 5 but nowhere near a 7,"This edition of the Evil Deads can be analysed through 3 of it's main attributes/deficiencies. They being the cast, the atmospherics and the script.Ok, so there are 5 characters that each have quite different worthiness in their contribution to the overall effects of the story. Mia, the recovering drug addict is very believable and reachable. Her struggles with everyday living are not histrionic or sugar-coated. She battles with a lot of crap and this is something many can relate with. Her brother David however, is poorly portrayed, as the ignorant, family-deserting scumbag. Without giving anything away, his protagonism is a misfire and doesn't hit the mark. Olivia, the nurse, who apparently wants to help Mia through sedative injections and reassuring vocabulary, is a more interesting character. It almost seems like she's already possessed by demonic influences at the start of the movie. Indeed, her over-confidence and control of Mia's livelihood allows the possibility of her not being as well-intentioned as she wants everybody to believe. So there is a sense of intrigue surrounding her and this kicks things off nicely. Then we have Eric, whom like his only male counterpart, is as bland and uninteresting as a blank canvas. But he's even less a contributor than David, as far as helping the story move forward and provides a forgettable character, who has no background to speak of, other than being a long lost acquaintance of David in a past life. His character is badly utilised by both casting crew and Lou Taylor Pucci himself. David's girlfriend Natalie is the obligatory dumb blonde, which is an unfortunate thing to say, but is unavoidably evident. She really has no purpose other than being the one to deliver the 80s horror chick-clueless dialogue, to assumingly enable the others to look far superior and more intelligent and subsequently bring her down further. So, out of the 5 main characters, only 2 stand out as contributing value to the story.Of worthy mention in its entirety, is how well this film is shot. The lighting, make-up, spooky surroundings are all successfully created, which for me is the real highlight of Evil Dead. There is a thick and overwhelming sense of dread and the sinister forest works excellently as a character of it's own. So as far as atmospherics goes this movie contains an abundance of impressive imagery and successfully effective spookiness.The script in Evil Dead is diabolically simple and it's almost as if, if they'd completely had no dialogue whatsoever, other than the necessary and effective screams of pain and terror, this movie would have worked just as well or even better. Which I find very interesting, because it really stands out to me where the crew wanted to concentrate their efforts into making it. Imagery and atmospherics were of the most importance, which as I say they did a great job with, but they had little interest in character development or storytelling, which is a glaring deficiency and not particularly well looked upon by yours truly.As a horror instalment, Evil Dead is gory but not particularly scary, apart from a few jumps. Where it excels is in the clever use of make-up and realistic imagery concerning dismemberments and skin slashes. Artistically it is a success, but as a storytelling venture it very much is not.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertainment at its finest.,"This movie was perhaps the most entertaining I've seen in over a year. What really did it, for me, was the fact that it was deliciously creepy without taking itself too seriously. I'm not sure if it was the particular audience I watched the movie with (College students at Michigan State, appropriately enough), or just the movie itself, but the crowd was more audible than any other I've been in, and that's including some opening night showings for comic book flicks. There was a lot of screaming, and just as much laughing for the many, I believe intentionally, corny moments throughout the film. If you like horror movies, this will definitely be a sight for sore eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Travesty of Unforgivable Proportions,"When I first heard that a remake of the ""Evil Dead"" was being made, I reacted in the way I always react about horror remakes. I hates the idea and cursed the idiots in Hollywood who would die if they had an original thought.I started to come around to the idea after a while, however. I assumed, wrongly, that with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell as producers that maybe it would be unlike the other horrid remakes out there. Then came the commercial with the girl in the cellar sing songing that little creepy rhyme.I liked the rhyme because that is what horror is. Horror is not monsters making you jump or excess blood all over the place. True horror is subtlety. True horror takes something that by all means should not be scary and makes it scary. True horror lies in the rhymes and the stories we tell each other as kids.So when the credits ran and this scene did not even appear in the movie, I was ready to explode. This movie was not clever. It was not scary. It was not creepy. It was nothing but excessive gore for gore's sake.""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"" are two of the truly most brilliant and scary movies ever made. To this day I am still will not go into a fruit cellar after seeing Henrietta burst out of the fruit cellar floor. But what these original movies had were low budget film makers who made excellent films out of love and desire of the material.You cannot take a movie that takes place in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, add huge production values and blood and expect it to come anywhere near the ""Evil Dead.""

Bold Art on a Boring Canvas (spoiler-free review),"I had modest expectations going into this movie. I was ready to be disappointed, and I was hopeful to be impressed. Both happened. But unlike many critics, I found the film has more identity than meets the eye.The remake stays on the basic path forged by the original - a simple, disturbing, darkly funny gorefest. The production values are much higher however, and there's more of an attempt to develop a story amongst the bloody chaos. And here lies the good and bad/Evil of the modern 'Dead.This is not an amateur work anymore. The lighting and cinematography are done professionally and there is meaning behind the look and feel of the film. It's far removed from the raw look of the original, so I feel the pain of purists. But this high level of production not only gives the film a unique look, but also a texture.Many details work in concert to create such an effect - color-saturation and high contrast, the peeling garbage back over the Necronomicon, and the incorporation of water and its accompanying sloshing sounds to name a few. There's also a highly memorable siren that howls during intense moments to ratchet-up the intensity.Unfortunately, a ridiculously trite backstory, lack of character development, and the inability to build-up momentum make it hard to appreciate the wonderful depths of the details. Any sense of dread is extinguished by premature reveal, and there are few effective moments of foreboding. This all leaves the terror predictable, hardly startling, and rather boring. It wants to be its own movie, but can't break free of the original's grasp, leaving it in a disappointing in-between.For Evil Dead, the devil is in the structure and writing, not the details. The script isn't so much charming as it is weak, and this reduces the effectiveness of any scares. The film leaves it up to the gory details and texture to carry audience interest, painting a wonderfully tangible film on a boring canvas, leaving it devoid of much excitement.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a waste of a potentially good movie,"It's challenging to find words to describe this disaster called Evil Dead. It was evil to endure the movie and the storyline was dead within about 10 minutes of the movie. I suppose that's how the name ""Evil Dead"" materialized. It was not remotely close to the original cult classic. The director obviously struggled with connecting the Book of the Dead with the rest of the movie so he pulled out a red Papermate ink pen and provided the audience with English-written inscriptions of what was about to happen. How clever? I would have preferred instructions to leave the theater. So many concepts of horror and mystery were quickly destroyed by the director's use of in-your-face predictable scenes. Plots would begin to take form, but then almost instantly removed leaving the audience asking themselves, ""WTF?"" If poor acting, poorly executed script, overdone corn syrup gore, and predictable climaxes is your thing, this movie is for you.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I liked it, but did expect more.","EVIL DEADI was looking forward to this film so much... I hate the way everything is being remade at the moment... but seeing as Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were both involved in this, I thought it was going to amazing! It was very good... but I was still disappointed.The movie is about a group of people that go into a cabin in the woods to help their friend get off of drugs... she is going cold turkey. They discover in the cellar a load of dead animals and a book that is wrapped up in barb wire. One of them opens the book and starts to read it, which then lets in the demons that take over their bodies and goes on a massive killing spree.I really liked the idea of them going there to help their friend... it makes a change. In most horror films, they always end up in the cabin in the woods just for a holiday or a trip out etc... finally a different excuse to be shacked up in the middle of nowhere.There was so much gore in this film... and I loved it. The ways that the murders happened were really well done and some where very inventive... but unfortunately, most of the ways they happen have been seen before. It seems the guys making it wanted to scare the audience with shock value other than being actually scary. You saw everything (almost). There was no mystery or moment that had me on the edge of my seat wondering if they will get out alive. It was pure violence.The other way this film might have scared some people was the jump scares... there seemed to be a lot of them. So many times in the film, there were things jumping out or loud noises right in the middle of a quiet period of the movie... they were put there to make everyone jump. It's a shame, because this is a cheap way of scaring someone and I am not a huge fan of it in horror films. I like it to happen once in a movie... but when it happens so many times it loses the effect. This film did not make me jump once. I was expecting most of them to come.The acting was actually quite good... I have never heard of any of the actors in this film, which is a very good thing for a horror. I always find it to be more believable when you don't have a familiar face on the screen. That way you have no idea if they will survive or not. We all know that if there was a horror film starring Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp, the likely hood of either of them dying is very slim. Although it is possible as we found out from Scream... poor Drew Barrymore.The whole cast was great... not one bad actor among them. I hope their careers take off now from this.The make up and special effects were very good. I can't fault it at all... everyone looked really freaky and scary. I really liked they way they looked when they were possessed.All in all this film was really good... But I guess I was just expecting it to be a bit more mystery and was hoping I would have to use my imagination more. Sometimes that can be more scary than seeing everything.I will give this film 7 out of 10. But I was expecting to give it a higher mark before I went to see it.Maybe it would have been slightly better if Sam Raimi directed it.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"turgid, dull, bor..... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","Oh dear, I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and was unable to find even 1 redeeming feature.This is a 'horror' movie for people who don't want to be scared, every part of the film is a tired rehash of many other horror movies (think exorcist, numerous teenagers lost in the woods flicks etc) but done much, much worse and, save for a few scenes, not much of a nod to the evil dead original. All the characters are unlikeable to the point where you hope they are going to be killed, the story (what there is of it) is dull and the horror/gore is boring, predictable and unoriginal. Although it carries an 18 rating it is without doubt the least scary horror film I have ever seen - it is so predictable it's embarrassing and it makes for a long 90 minutes.I went into this movie genuinely excited to see how they were going to take it but but left incredibly frustrated as a reprise of the evil dead should have been a surefire hit - sadly it feels like it was made solely to put cash in the bank.To summarise this film is a waste of time - save your money and spend it on something better like a tooth extraction or your 1st instalment on that lobotomy you never wanted.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
We're (not) gonna get you.,"A group of youngster visit a cabin to help their friend detox, however, they so find them themselves pawns in a prophesy to raise an abomination.Evil Dead 're-imagining' was overseen by Sam Raimi himself, there's a few tweaks and a couple of beloved things are missing (mostly comedy setups), it follows Evil Dead's highs and lows story blueprint wisely hitting all the right notes, loss, sacrifice, possession, supernatural high-jinks, the book of the dead, a cellar, cabin and so on.However, gone is the mix of wackiness with horror and what we're left with is just horror. Packed with jump scares there's blood - more blood than you can possibly imagine coupled with gratuitous and graphic violence, a nail gun, chainsaw and claw hammer action.It's dark, ominous, gritty and wonderfully shot by Fede Alvarez. The special effect and music score a worthy of note. The opening is reminiscent of a million torture-porn films and adds little to the proceedings, although the series is known for irregular continuities, if anything the setup robs Evil Dead of being a sequel to the original. In addition, there's a odd homage after the credits that takes Evil Dead 2013 stand alone stature. It's as if Raimi and Co. couldn't cut the umbilical cord to the original video nasty, or avoid backlash from fans.The cast are a group of good looking kids and on the whole the acting is pretty good, lead Jane Levy is exceptional. But the group of twenty something Americans has been done to death and steals any novelty away from Dead by default. Nevertheless, there's a welcomed gender change and duel role that allows Levy to really excel.All in all as someone who avoids horror-comedy I thought a serious remake would be a good idea, that said, The Evil Dead 1981 was a basic concept and it was its style that made it. It goes to show that you should be careful what you wish for.To Alvarez's credit as horror film it is skilfully made, and if you've not seen its 1981 counterpart it excels. Nevertheless, if you're familiar with the Evil Dead, its novelty, choppy charm, resourcefulness and it's mix of scares humour, you may feel that this in some peculiar uncanny way falls short. There's a reason archetypal books don't get rewritten - the same could possibly be applied to cult films.Ultimately, even with it's 'Evil Dead' shortcomings it's an entertaining piece of horror and still a must for horror fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hold on to your intestines; something very bad is about to happen.,"It's been a while since I saw a genuine horror film (I'm glossing over American Mary, which was horrific for all the wrong reasons), the previous one being last year's superb Sinister, a film that really got under the skin and made my drive home through the dark country lanes a great deal more unnerving then usual. The arrival of Evil Dead, a re-imagining of Sam Rami's 1981 classic, ensured I could put off the first fright of the year no longer. Shattered from a day of chopping wood, I wondered if it would engage or terrify sufficiently to prevent me from dropping off in the Cineworld darkness.No worries there!There's more reason to the plot of Fede Alvarez' update, with David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend, Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) arriving at a woodland cabin to offer moral support to his sister, Mia (Jane Levy), as she goes cold turkey under the supervision of her friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). They discover evidence of some very dark dealings in the basement and, while Mia is busy fighting her own demons, Eric discovers a book secured with barbed wire and bound in human skin, and unwittingly unleashes something very, very demonic indeed.Evil Dead isn't a film you watch in the hope of mind-blowing performances but, bar the occasional wooden moment, all five principals romp along perfectly convincingly and it doesn't seem right to single out one above the others. Compare the performances here with those in last year's teen blood-flick, Piranha 3DD, and you'll forgive the odd slip from this quintet. When the odd wince moment arrives (David doesn't know where his heart is, for instance), the splatter and gore more than make up for it.Alvarez, making a spectacular leap into Hollywood as both writer and director in his feature debut AND his first film foray in English, knows how to make bodily fluids spray horrifically. By the time the final credit rolls, we've seen just about every leakage the human body can produce and most at terrific velocity. Put it this way, it's gonna take one heck of a cleaner to sort this mess out!I'm ashamed to admit that I only got around to watching Raimi's original The Evil Dead a couple of months ago. The friend I watched it with informed me it was the first film to give him nightmares. Thirty-two years later and instead of frights it causes mild hysteria with the prosthetics and effects as rubbery as Bruce Campbell's acting. Alvarez, however, while keeping an eye on the original, has ramped up the horror and gore all the way to 11 and there are more occasions than I care to remember when I found myself pushing back in my seat to escape or half covering my face involuntarily.People talk flippantly about hairs standing up on the back of the neck, but Evil Dead manages to do just that. It isn't pant-wettingly terrifying but is far more than just 'scary'. Alvarez avoids the cheap shots of building the music and knocking over a vase only for it to be a cute kitten wandering innocently into the house. Here, when the tension builds, hold on to your intestines because something very bad is about to happen. Every time!The prosthetics and make-up are stunning and matched only by the physical effects. It's a tragedy in the making because, come March 2014, the Oscar for best makeup will probably be won by another 'serious' drama (Les Misérables in 2013, The Iron Lady in 2012 etc.) instead of by Patrick Baxter and his team for Evil Dead. Regardless, I don't think we'll see better amputations and disfigurements on the big screen this year.The biggest issue with Evil Dead is that it has too many endings and, until we reach the grand finale when the fat lady stops singing and disembowels herself instead, we know that each one is a false conclusion. It's an annoyance but it doesn't detract too much from the overall impact. Two warnings, though: Don't use this as a first date and empty yourself at both ends before you sit down to watch it.Perhaps the best summary of Evil Dead comes from my companion for the evening, Ben Mears (author of the Tyler May novels) who invented a new word for the occasion: ""What the hell did you make me sit through that for? It was s***ifying!""I don't know about you, but I'm going to sleep with my axe tonight!For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best gore horror in a long time,"I wish more movies like this were made. Blood, guts, gore and lots of shock factor horror elements. My fave 😈 love that it uses mostly special effects and makeup rather than the corny CGI in every scary movie nowadays. I own it and watch it probably 1x per year. Better than the original in my opinion!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good remake, or clever pseudo-sequel?","Review by Matt:I'm not one for April Fool's pranks. I find them annoying, stupid, and most of the time, ridiculous. But there are times when one happens, and its wonderful. It's even better when you are going to see one of the most classic horror films of all time, 1981's ""The Evil Dead"" with Bruce Campbell in the audience introducing the film and conducting a Q&A after it's conclusion. It's even better when the film starts, gets about a minute in, and the film breaks, revealing the trick, which I had a sneaking suspicion was coming. April Fool's, you're not here to watch ""The Evil Dead"" '81, you're here to watch ""Evil Dead"" 2013. Truly, truly awesome, and now I'm lucky enough to bring you kids a review of the as-of-yet- unreleased ""Evil Dead"" remake, which is an ode to everything wonderful and right with horror remakes.Everything you've heard about ""Evil Dead"" is warranted; it's a brutal, bloody, gory, sick, twisted, squirm-inducing nightmare; in the best way possible. While, as a rule, horror remakes are usually unnecessary, I really thought ""The Evil Dead"" was in need of a tune-up. Coming out three years after ""Halloween"" and merely a year after the genre game- changer ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Dead"" made it's mark as The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror. It was low-budget, gritty, and a new take on the slasher genre. It had the demonic spirit of ""The Exorcist"" but the wink-wink-nod-nod of ""Friday the 13th"" and even some old Herschel Gordon Lewis films. However, if you look at ""Dead"" now, it seems dated. You can tell that it only took them about $300,000.00 to make the film. Still, I believe in keeping a classic, a classic, and not messing with a good thing. Come some 30 years and two sequels later, a new vision of ""Evil Dead"" is about to be unleashed nationwide, and with the blessing of Sam Raimi and Mr. Bruce Campbell, I can honestly say we got a winner.While keeping with the spirit of the original film, we follow five teens who have decided to head out to the middle of nowhere to a cabin in the woods. The added twist this time around is that they are there for an intervention for Mia, played by Jane Levy, who could be America's newest Scream Queen, a heroin-addict who just suffered an overdose. I liked the fact that the teens are in the woods for a reason, because in films like these you always get a lot of red herrings, namely the Necronomicon, which is unnamed in this version, but you should know what the Necronomicon is at this point, where you have to suspend disbelief nearly the entire film, and don't worry, you'll have to do it anyway for most of this movie, in a good way.While the story is reasonably strong for the genre, the violence and gore is ramped up to 11, and it's wonderful. The gore effects are great, and I was surprised to see that WETA was behind some of the work, and it makes sense, because some of the effects are right out of ""Dead/Alive,"" before Peter Jackson got all Hollywood on us genre fans.As a horror film, ""Evil Dead"" is fine, a bloody-romp in the vein of what most people are used to out of the horror genre these days. As a remake, one of the best ones made. And while I use the term ""remake,"" ""Dead"" is more like a re-imagining of the original. There are various odes to Raimi's masterwork, including our heroine wearing a Michigan State sweater, to the old car that she is also sitting on. We even get some chainsaw, yes, a chainsaw, what would an ""Evil Dead"" movie be without some chainsaw. With all that being said, if you're a purist, go into ""Evil Dead"" with an open mind, and have fun with it; there are plenty of odes to the original, and if you're new to the world of Ash and the Deadites, do your homework and watch ""The Evil Dead,"" ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"" and ""Army of Darkness"" (the primitive screw-head next to me kept calling it ""Evil Dead 3."" I wanted to tell him to go home because his mom called, and he had chores to do, plus it was a school night). 2013's ""Evil Dead."" In a world full or remakes and bad ideas, its nice to see they got something right. Hail to the King, baby.....Check out more reviews at simplisticreviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Same old bland stuff.,"When I heard that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were backing this I had hope. But when it comes to remakes, you shouldn't get excited over them. I'm going to begin my ranting and raving now.Brief trailer thoughts: Before I get into the movie, I want to talk about the future of horror, or should I say lack of a future. There were three horror trailers, two about home invasions, and the other was that garbage Carrie remake. Why can't we ever get good horror movies any more, you either get a gore fest or generic ghost story. I am currently creating horror stories that are miles better than anything I have seen in years, it's just sad how low horror has stooped.The film: I am a fan of Raimi's three films, evil dead 2 being my favourite. I must admit this is my third favourite out of the bunch, mainly because I really didn't care for Army of Darkness. The opening scene was rather dull, you don't learn anything, it was a horrible opening. Then we meet the characters, I didn't care for any of them, Eric may have unleashed the demon, but he was the only one I liked. The movie was pretty boring until stuff started going south, once that occurred I never lost interest. The atmosphere is high at some points, but fails to remain constant. The woods are the highlight, they look great, I loved the grey tones and the rain. The only notable gore effects were when that girl cuts her arm off, that was awesome, the rest of the effects have been done before. These are the only good parts of the film. Every thing else was garbage, it seems explicit violence was all this film had to offer, to bad I don't care about that kind of stuff anymore. It's a shame this one didn't stand out much, but it is still better than most horror films. I gave this a six, I also gave Texas Chainsaw a six, I have to say I liked Texas Chainsaw better. Oh, and I should mention this film isn't even remotely scary or suspenseful, because you can already predict how the film is going to play out.It's the second best horror film of the year so far, I sincerely doubt there will be anything that could knock this film or Texas Chainsaw off of their perch, so for that I say give it a watch.I find it amusing how bad all of these reviews are getting trolled, it's hilarious how may thumbs down these got, mine went from a 4 out of 5 people agree, to a 4 out of 26 people people agree in the matter of a few hours, I love it, it's hilarious, keep crying.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad at all,"I went in to this film having seen the originals and with reading some reviews. needless to say some of the reviews were unfavourable. it is at the heart of it a remake. a terrible word in modern cinema but one which has become quite common place. i have seen quite a few remakes and this certainly was not the worst.Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell both were producers for this film so it had quite a few nods to the original, and in my opinion did not let it down. the acting was quite good but with most modern horror films it was a pretty unknown cast.It is a bloody film, going for a more traditional fake blood approach instead of cgi, which in my opinion makes the film more enjoyable.This was a good cinema film, it had scares, it had blood and most of all we had fun watching it. it is not an Oscar winner of course but certainly a film worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Real Treat - a solid action filled 90 minutes! Well done! p.s. There's blood - Olympic swimming pools full of it!,"I'd say 7.5 out of ten - and rate this film for viewing.Initially; fans of the pure cult 1981 low budget classic will notice that the story has changed, a little. The fragmented and often annoying play at gluing the original narrative of the earlier cult flicks is thrown out. We have stability.Mia (Jane Levy) and David (Shiloh Fernandez) are retreating to a remote Cabin with three of her - and David's old friends. To pull Mia out of addiction and force her to cold turkey her way to a Sober life. However; when things start to get eerie and Mia is thought to be hallucinating - the Demons are granted growth and time to manoeuvre their way one by one through the gang (as we predict).The 'book of the dead' - again, becomes a great tool and narrative aid in forwarding and handing the audience some insight into whats coming next - and often bracing us for the pure gore that follows. Something which i greatly appreciated - reading some reviews that boar negativity and blight the realism; they should have watched. The gore and range of tools used to dismember and maim our unlucky friends is imaginative; beautifully real and offers something most of Hollywood flicks can't grasp - actual fear and no CGI!Fantastic - legendary 'tree scene' - chainsaw, pliers, machete, electric meat slicer, broken glass, a nail gun, shotgun, boiling water, broken porcelain! Imagination we have - gore we have, narrative we have, decent acting we have - direction we have - Alvarez we Have!References and minor lines used within the picture take us back to our original love - but as we are torn through the story and ultimate countdown; i loved my predictions being wrong. No time is wasted or unpacked with action - no kitchen utensil unused.As for the negative feedback; i do understand - no person with an I.Q over ten would have stayed more than three minutes in that cabin (but then where would the fun be in that?) Our characters grow and true colours shine, and not without some very well-done dismemberment and tactful scheming.What id say, do your research on this one - i was pleasantly surprised and hesitant going in; but i loved it. Well worth the ticket fare and maybe something to look out for on Blu Ray - i'd heart to see some extras.A seventy day and night shoot is extremely impressive; no CGI and realism is superb - Alvarez deploys some very vintage wizardry tricks and camera work to make the audience cringe for more! He is a born tactician. If your not all too squeamish - and want to see a 'real' horror that wasn't scripted and shot in less than three days i'd say give it a go.Left satisfied, bloody - surprised and wanting more - bravo! It took ten seconds of the picture for me to turn to my friend saying - 'well it's already better than insidious' - 7.5/10 - a big thumbs up from me.If your unsure upon feedback given for this picture, swings and roundabouts leave you feeling attacked with folly - or any movie - go and see it yourself - this time; it pays off! Smiles against many recent releases with poor script + narrative substance; too much money and CGI! Brilliant.2013 has seen its first taste of a solid horror thriller - and particularly a Solid rounded feature over-all.Any comments please feel free - thank you - karl-meister.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody but without personality,"In the intro we meet a sweet girl about to be immolated by her parents. her mom recites lines in a foreign language from a book. The girl isn't so innocent, but possessed, and burning her alive is the solution to rid the evil.Later we meet 5 kids at a cabin, 3 girls and 2 guys. We learn that they aren't there for fun but for an intervention. One of the girls is a hopeless junkie who ODd repeatedly and nearly lost her life. Her brother is there, his girlfriend, and a couple- he's a school teacher and she's conveniently a nurse and brought all the medication necessary to have the girl stop drugs cold turkey.The next day the girl, Mia, is starting to show withdrawal symptoms, she smells something. Sure enough, the kids eventually go the basement and find countless dead cats hanging from the ceiling as well as the burned post and the book from the intro. The book is covered in black plastic and bound with barbed wire.Mia starts losing it more and more and the teacher guy decides to browse through the book and pronounce some of strange words which awakes some evil force in the woods. When Mia escapes, drives into a ditch and stumbles through the woods she encounters some girl/ghost that spits out some branches that make it to Mia's nether regions. Back at the cabin, Mia flips out and attacks everyone till they lock her in the basement. The nurse decides to cut her mandible off with a piece of glass and the other girl cuts her arm off with an electric carving knife. At some point finally the teacher guy realizes what he has done. And that they're not dealing with some disease or just madness. The ways to eliminate the evil are rather brutal and gory, and Mia's brother doesn't have the guts to go through with any of those until he has no choice.The original Evil Dead is one of the few great horror movies that could deserve a remake given how long ago it was made on a small budget. This Evil Dead is more of a new vision of the original. It's true to the motifs- the book, the clock, the basement, the chainsaw, etc. but it doesn't make much of a cohesive whole. Lacking also is some humor. And as with most movies these days, character development is near zero, we can't care about any of these people, and this movie is also somewhat unclear about who the main character is. It tries to get us to think that it's the brother, but it wouldn't be a 2000s movie without a female heroine so out of no good reason we get just that. Completely unnecessary is also the usual creepy J-horror evil girl who comes out of nowhere. The book talks of the evil force as a ""he"" not some girl. Also weak are the sounds and voices. The original Evil Dead used voices and sounds very effectively to create a scary atmosphere. This version doesn't at all. What this one does offer though is a lot of blood, violence, and some gore. It's nice to see a movie for theatrical release that is so enthusiastic about it, but that doesn't really make up for all its shortcomings.The surprise is that this movie wasn't as terrible as it could have been given that the director/writers are foreigners with barely any experience making movies. You can tell they are fans of horror, but you need a bit more than just that to make a stand out horror movie, especially one that carries the mighty name ""Evil Dead."" IMDb shows that Diablo Cody was involved in the writing of the movie, but the movie itself doesn't credit her. And that is exactly what this movie needed, additional writers to make the story more than just a bunch of bloody gags, and to inject some personality and humor, because to a large extent, that made the original so unforgettable. This new version is somewhat generic, efficient, bloody, but soulless as most of these reboots/re-envisions are. It's a good horror movie but not a good ""Evil Dead"" movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unrelenting, bleak, and truly terrifying","Do not go into this expecting any levity or charm that the original had. This movie is awesome, the acting, writing, makeup, and set design are all fantastic at making this the scariest remake I've seen to date. This could be a truly stand alone movie and I would still have high praise for it.The opening scene sets the tone for the entire movie. If you're looking for something gory, shocking, and absolutely tense for the full run time then watch this movie. Even when there is scenes where nothing is paranormal the tension lingers until the next scene and the pacing of this movie is really good.It has everything I'm looking for in a horror movie and because of that I think it truly deserves a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfect Reboot,"Sam Raimi returns one of the best cult classic horror films of all time to the big screen in what can only be described as one of the bloodiest movies of all time. While the movie was mistaken for a remake, let it be made clear this is no remake. This movie follows the same premise of a few kids staying in the crumbling cabin and discover the book of the dead. After uttering the sacred words the Evil Dead return once again and this time it's not quite so laughable. The original movies were comical while this was straight up disturbing. The movie was flawless with some nice extra twists to keep the audience interested. I saw it on opening night and I've seen a few more times since then. I'd say it's a great installment to the Evil Dead franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A genuinely pretty okay labor of love,"Evil Dead is the heartwarming story of a young woman struggling to overcome her substance abuse problems with the help of family, close friends, good old fashioned willpower, and a mystical book bound in human skin. She stumbles and relapses, but she eventually finds the inner strength to tear her own hand off and literally saw addiction in half.I'm just kidding. But only kind of. Of course, most of you know that this is, in fact, a remake of the ultra-low budget 1980 horror classic and icon of geek culture The Evil Dead, which launched the careers of director Sam Raimi and star/coolest person ever Bruce Campbell. One of these people has been slightly more successful than the other, but to be fair, the other got to replace their hand with a chainsaw, so it's a trade off. If you think that the idea of remaking The Evil Dead sounds sacrilegious, then there are a few things you should know: first, Evil Dead is produced by Raimi and Campbell, and it was supposedly their idea to remake it. Evidently, they wanted this remake to be the movie to be the darker, more serious movie that they originally tried to make back in 1979. Secondly- and this may seem controversial to you- The Evil Dead is not a great movie. Think about everything that defines an Evil Dead movie in popular culture: the cool one-liners of Ash Williams, the sawed-off shotgun, the iconic chainsaw hand, Bruce Campbell's speech about shopping at S-Mart, the juxtaposition of insane, off-the-rails horror imagery with slapstick humor. The thing that all these things have in common is that none of them are in the first movie. Everything that we associate with The Evil Dead is actually in either Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness. Those are great movies. In fact, Evil Dead 2 is the greatest horror-comedy ever made, and if you disagree with that statement, then you are wrong.The point is, that if there were ever a well intentioned horror remake with a genuine reason to exist, it would be Evil Dead. And for the most part, this remake does work. Sure, it has flaws, and it copies a little too much from Sam Raimi's bag o' film making tricks, but this was clearly a labor of love by the people involved. Specifically, it's the kind of labor of love that involves a metric ton of fake blood. It's this point that I would normally remind people that Evil Dead is not for the faint of heart or stomach, but c'mon- it's a remake of The Evil Dead. While this movie constantly skirts the line between an R-rating and an NC-17, most recent DVD releases of The Evil Dead actually carry an NC-17 rating, so you really ought to see that coming. If you couldn't figure out that this movie is gruesome, I don't know what to tell you- maybe movies just aren't your thing. Of course, the gore in this new version is far more realistic- long gone are the days of spaghetti intestines and red tempera paint blood- though the violence is still cartoonish in nature, even if it's more real in execution. No pun intended, I swear.Like any remake that has ever worked, Evil Dead does not completely copy the story of its predecessor. It keeps the basic concept, but it is a different film with different characters and different motivations. Most notably, these five people actually have a reason to go out to a cabin in the middle of nowhere that kind of makes sense. As mentioned earlier, one of the characters is trying to quit drugs cold turkey, so she, her friends, and her brother travel to the middle of nowhere so she'll have a harder time relapsing. It's not a good idea, but it's certainly better than going to a cabin in the woods to drink and screw. However, that isn't to say that it doesn't resemble the original in very obvious ways: it keeps the demon-vision zooming camera stuff, and it has numerous sequences that are very clearly re-workings of events from the original and its sequel. Moreover, if you're familiar with the original trilogy, nothing in Evil Dead is going to surprise you; the plot may differ from the original, but all the beats are in the same place. It's a pretty okay horror flick; yes, the gore is the textbook definition of excessive, but it builds up nicely, and it is often genuinely scary, even to someone as hard to scare as I. It succeeds mostly as a modern companion piece to the original films, but it's not without its flaws.Evil Dead takes more risks than most films, but it never goes off the rails in the way the originals did. While this is a better movie than the original on a purely technical level, that's not what made the originals so good. The Evil Dead ultimately succeeded because it made up for its lack of budget in sheer ballsiness. It wasn't great, but it sure was memorable, and it was truly scary in a way that really sticks with you. Nobody's going to accuse it of being forgettable, but it never reaches the highs that it should.But still, Evil Dead is a good movie. It's worth checking out if you're a fan of horror movies, and fans of the original will get a kick out of it. If you want to see it, you should see it. But it's not a great film, and it's not really worth more than one viewing. But hey- it's still worth one more viewing than 95% of horror movies made in the last fifteen years, so there's that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Finally, a remake done right.","The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience? That may be a bit hyperbolic (it looks good on the poster) but this new Evil Dead is certainly a lot of fun. The movie starts off with a bang (quite literally) and then we join our five 20 somethings on their way to the cabin in the woods. This time around they're not there to engage in partying and sex. Mia's friends and her brother David (the first letter of each of their names spells out DEMON) have dragged her to their mother's old cabin as a drug free, get clean retreat. The movie doesn't quite seem sure if it wants to be an addiction allegory with Mia literally fighting her demons or if it just wants to use her heroin addiction as an excuse for why these characters are at the cabin and later, why none of Mia's friends believe her when weird things begin to happen.The film's biggest flaw is that it amps you up at the beginning and then introduces quite a bit of exposition. We hear a lot about Mia's addiction, how David left her with her mother...etc. etc. While I'm not opposed to a horror movie fleshing out it's characters, it only seems to care about fleshing out two (the others are just Deadites waiting to happen) and it does so with a decent amount of downtime before the horror. I read a review that stated that the original Evil Dead films had characters who were defined by how they handled and reacted to the horror, not what happened before the horror and I believe this is the re-make's biggest sin. Yet even the exposition is made tolerable by clever winks at what's to come.Exposition aside, this film does SO much right. Winks at the original films are all over the place, from Raimi's car to Mia sporting a Michigan State sweatshirt, to a necklace that looks awfully similar to Linda's in the original Evil Dead. Oh yeah and one word: chainsaw.The movie revs up once Eric (the third most fleshed out character after Mia and David) discovers the Necronomicon. This Necronomicon looks less like a face stretched across a book and more like someone sewed several chunks of flesh together. When Eric finds it it is wrapped in a plastic bag and barbed wire. This doesn't turn Eric away any more than the writing carved in the book explicitly telling him not to read the incantations. In fact Eric takes a rubbing of the crossed out translations.It is then that all hell breaks loose. Throughout the movie the Necronomicon shows pictures of each stage of horror. At times you wish the book didn't spoil what was going to happen but other times it adds to the tension. One scene in particular works especially well because the book has shown you what is going to happen.While the movie isn't exactly ""terrifying"" it is often cringe inducing and those looking for blood, gore and practical effects will find a lot to love here. For those fans of the original who can't fathom a remake, especially without Bruce Campbell's Ash, give it a shot.

"Lacks The Originality, Creativity & Lasting Appeal Of Sam Raimi's Breakthrough Classic","Drenched in gallons of blood & jam-packed with nods to its source of inspiration, this remake, sequel & soft-reboot of The Evil Dead scores high in violence & gore, but still falls short of leaving a memorable impression, thanks to its cliche-ridden narrative, uninspiring script, cringeworthy dialogues & cardboard characters.",,Anonymous,Horror
Does the job!!,"OK, so first off, I haven't seen the original! So I wasn't going in with preconceptions of what the film should be. I think that's where all these 1 star reviews come from, because there is always going to be a massive amount of added pressure to please the first generation of fans when remaking a 'classic'. No, this film isn't original, the back story all happens very quickly, but this is done to get you to the catharsis asap! this ain't no drama! What happens to the characters from then on is gripping and intense, you won't get a moments rest. It is hard to take the film completely seriously, because of the situations the characters find themselves in, but its all part of the fun, and what comes with dealing with gory demonic possession. Although there were plenty of moments where I was able to suspend my disbelief and experience the intensity of what the teenagers were experiencing. So know what to expect when going to see this, You wont find interesting plot, clever dialogue or Oscar nominations. But you will get an entertaining, fun, gory ride to hell and back!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ignore all the haters!,"Fellow horror fans, this is the movie you have been waiting for. This  is the gory horror film that is unlike any other film you have ever  seen! Most gory films have one or two really gory scenes, but Evil Dead  has gore throughout the entire film, beginning to end. Evil Dead is the  ultimate bloody roller-coaster that all of us horror junkies have been  waiting for and it does not disappoint. Evil Dead is not only creepy,  scary and gory, but it is phenomenally perfect. The acting is  excellent, the cinematography is beautiful and the minor details are  perfection. I am confident that you will enjoy yourself, if you truly  love horror and gore. Evil Dead is the ultimate gore-fest!   Here are a couple of tips to prepare you for the Evil Dead experience:  1. Don't eat before you see the film 2. Stay till the very end. There  is a special cameo after the credits. 3. Dress comfortable enough to  squirm in your seat 4. Duck Tape is an unexpected hero (you'll  understand after you watch) 5. And prepare yourself to witness the  perfect American horror movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An awesome thrill-ride,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and went in as a fan of the original. When I first heard that the next film Raimi was going to have a hand in was not going to be Evil Dead 4 but a remake of the original, I was doubtful at first-- having seen the scores of remakes that had none of the charm of the original (I'm looking at you Friday the 13th...)But a good percentage of the charm of the original was lumped into three categories: atmosphere, gore effects, and creature effects. In fact, I would argue that's pretty much the three reasons anyone likes the original. The formula for the remake is a bit different-- I thought that the highlights included an interesting character development, gore- effects, and a huge amp-up in pacing from the original.In other words... it's not a clone. Much of the atmosphere of the original was hit or miss-- Raimi's lingering camera sometimes caught things that were creepy, like the basement or the dimly lit forest, but it often just sort of sat there staring, essentially breaking the pacing completely. This film decided to do the opposite-- but while not rushing through and skipping fair introductions to characters that are much more human (although not hugely deep) than in the original.This film is not for everyone: if you can't handle a film that hit a list called the ""video nasty"" list, then the original film and this remake are not for you. If the idea of watching something that you aren't SUPPOSED to see, if that idea sounds delightfully dangerous to you, then I highly recommend this film.For those that found the original to be putrescent and vile-- and loved every minute of it-- you will find a lot to love here. The characters are introduced as essentially a group of young adults staging an intervention, and this immediately allows you to be more sympathetic than the original's characters (who were.... spring breakers.... I... think-- it was never fully explained). As far as symbolism goes, it is as sophisticated as a film called ""Evil Dead"" can be expected to be, but a little bit moreso. The inclusion of drug use puts narrative perspective into question, as does a history of mental illness that gets revealed a bit later on into the story, adding depth to the depravity. Was it all a drug-induced hallucination? Was it a delusion?I LOVE films that have this double-edged sword of unreliable narrator, especially when used in horror films, like this or Lovely Molly. It allows you to connect with the characters, but it also allows you to have fun with the supernatural elements, as they can be as crazy or wild as you need in order to be thrilled, but ultimately the believability is flexible because, well... how serious are you going to take the world through a junkie's eyes?All in all, a bit of a popcorn film-- you won't find the meaning of life here or any sort of deep Beckett-style experimentation with absurdity, but you WILL find a wild romp that is just devilish fun for those who truly understand what makes horror great!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Horror Remake I've ever seen!,"Saw this in Kansas City couple of days ago! Wow! This was an amazing movie! The cast was great, The Cinematography was beautiful, and The Music was amazing! Fede Alvarez did a fantastic job directing this movie! The best part of this movie is No CGI, only practical effects! The effects was amazing as well! This was a well done remake! Stayed true to the original but at the same time adding a new twist to the story! The approach on why the teenagers go to the cabin instead of going there partying and get laid like the original was really good, it really makes this remake more realistic than the original, but my point is i love the different approach of this remake! Check it out April 5th and stay after the credits!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Lot of Things to Mention Here,"First things first, if you're looking for a fresh, interesting, bloody, entertaining and different kind of horror film, go see the Evil Dead remake. If you are looking for a low-budget, campy, lacking 1980's film, well..that's the original.This Evil Dead remake is by far more like a reinvision rather than a remake, and that's an excellent thing. I do not understand people's hold on the original. Yes, I've seen it. No, I do not think it is better than this remake. Why? I'll get to that later, now to the film review.If you're looking for plot synopsis, you can find that anywhere. I want to talk about the film. I personally enjoyed, like truly enjoyed, this new version of the Evil Dead because it tried to improve on the original and in many ways it did. It had a great atmosphere, a more coherent story, more three dimensional characters (well they tried), some scenes will haunt you in terms of scare and WTF did that just happen? If you want a fun, but flawed, horror film, go see it. If you're looking for award winning performances and an amazing script...well, why are you watching horror in the first place?Now, to the original. Besides our hero Ash, who were all the other characters? Oh yeah, that's right. Flat, two dimensional characters that don't get developed and who we could care less about since any line they said could have been said by anyone else around. This film improves, while these aren't amazing characters, they are more memorable (besides a filler blonde girl...who, well...yeah). The special effects are amazing in this version, which is why it had a much bigger budget and was advertised more. The original was a cult hit, this is meant to be a money making hit because a lot more money was put into this film. Why the hell do people get mad over this? I don't know. Either way, the budget difference showed, and I personally liked it. The storyline is a lot more coherent and makes more sense in this version. Vast improvement in terms of how everything played out the way it did. People also mention how the ""humor"" was gone...umm, if you're a true fan of the Evil Dead series, you should know that the first film had anything but humor. It wasn't funny, it was meant to scare you. This film does the same. Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness are the ones bathed in dark humor, if you want to complain about that, wait for the sequel. So much for fans, right?Was this movie scary? Meh, but then again, was the original really that bad? Was this movie gory? Yes, and enough to make you cringe as the movie goes on. Was it necessary? Nope, but I enjoyed it. Should you watch it? If you praise the original blindy and hold on to it like dear life, look elsewhere. However, if you have an open mind and want to see a fun reinvision of a praised classic, go right ahead. You won't regret it. A very solid 7/10, and thats saying a lot for a modern horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sorry it wasn't scary,"Lots of gore but no glory. The film has almost a similar plot to the original but doesn't have the charm. It's another Hollywood scare fest that tries to be scary but ends up being slightly predictable. I felt like some parts of the movie tried too hard to scare us and other parts felt like they didn't try hard enough. The blood and gore was enough to freak some people out but not me. I've seen a lot of scarier, bloodier, and disturbing movies in my life and this movie was as mainstream as you can get, in other words, it's what you would expect for a popcorn movie. That being said the acting was quite well and I thought they did a good job with the cast. If you're a fan of the original I recommend you wait for this and rent it. But if you really want to see this film by all means go ahead. Just don't worry about getting nightmares, you will forget about it as soon as it wears off.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
You want gore? You want insane? You'll like this.,"I saw an advanced screening of Evil Dead in San Diego and this was one wild ride! First off, don't go in expecting the greatest character development. If you go into this movie looking for character development and such, you are sadly not in the right mindset. Remember how you approached the Evil Dead trilogy? Did you look for character development there? You go for the pure entertainment with the horror, laughs, and gore. This remake, it's the same sort of approach, only it's a huge emphasis on the gore. The gore really delivers in gallons here as there is not a single moment that is dull. Once things start going crazy, they never let up and this movie just becomes insane.Was it a scary movie? Well, people did scream. I got chills on some parts, and you are constantly on the edge of your seat as you just don't know what to anticipate with each ticking second. I'd say it can be labeled as pretty scary at times.The acting was solid all across the board. Levy gives the best performance as Mia. She really made you love or hate her and it was to both extremes. The characters were likable overall, despite you not really getting to know them all too well. Then again, did you get to know all of the characters that well in the original Evil Dead? You did not and it is a cult classic. There were some nods to the originals, but I will not say what they were as I feel everyone should experience it.This movie was an awesome ride with all kinds of blood and crazy moments. This movie will stick with you and it won't completely sink in because, let's face it, you're eager to see the next installment in the Evil Dead franchise. Typing this review, I can say that this movie has not completely sunk in. Great stuff! As for the post-credits, I say ask yourself: would you stay after the credits for a Marvel movie? That should give you a good idea there.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What are you expecting?,"That's the question to ask before you see this. Are you expecting a carbon copy of the original? If so, then why bother? Just watch the original. And all these reviewers dying to see Ash...Ash didn't come in to his own until parts 2 (a remake in itself) and part 3 (a movie even Bruce admitted he didn't like). So if you're expecting a bad ass, one handed chainsaw wielding Ash, then you'll be disappointed.However, if you want an original horror movie based on material created by Sam Rami, but not the exact same movie, then you're in luck. Because if you're anything like me, all I expected from this movie is blood, gore, cheesy acting, and more blood...and thats it! And it delivered. Do you honestly think when Sam and Bruce made The Evil Dead they were worried about bad acting, too much blood, or any of the other crap that people here are slamming them for? No, and if all you are wanting is a copy of the original, i say again, just watch the original.Oh,and for the DB's that say there's no homage the original until the credits, how about the car in the first few minutes? Yes I know its not the same one Sams dad bought, but its meant to look like it. That's an homage dude. And only one of about 20 I saw the first time I watched it.Bottom line...good movie, worth the time, as long as you're not a pertinacious DB",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't get it,"I really don't get it what people are looking from movies nowadays. When I go to the cinema or when I read people's reviews on any kind of a horror film, I always stumble upon hearing/reading: ""pssh, this is not scary!"", ""omg, whatever, this is stupid"", ""this is not even realistic"". It is just dumb how people treat great stuff that have been done for them. It seems that people focus on the wrong things when it comes down to watching movies. There are actually hardly any realistic scenes in ANY MOVIE. And then there are people who hand out the ""the original was better!"" argument. I mean, seriously? - All the remakes and the originals are very different from each other, so what the hell are you expecting?The movie:Right away I felt taken by the movie when the intro started. The cinematography is done really well and has this artistic feel to it. The situations people go throughout the movie are tense. I like how everything is served. Didn't actually get into the details with the main story as it seems not to be a movie where you would need to. The location looks awesome and some of the best scenes take part in the woods. Jane Levy is doing a really good job in the movie. You can really tell how she tried to push herself to the limits without looking fake. And I think it is the hardest part with a horror film - to give out strong emotions like that. You can see it well during the situations when she is slowly becoming fully possessed. There are parts in the movie that do make me laugh but I'm still not sure if they're supposed to or not.Cons:There are some scenes which have this ""epic feel"" to them, but they don't really work out like they should. The huge amounts of blood should have looked a bit more realistic but regarding to the amounts they used in the movie, I can understand this downside. They have fixed some things in the DVD tho.I give 9 out of 10 to this movie because I think they made the same mistake as ""The Purge"" did - TOO big promotion and TOO big promises before the movie is out makes people get TOO excited. Because people are right about the scariness in this movie. It is more of a tasty gore movie.Otherwise I really, really enjoyed it. Went to see it 2 times in the cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Fantastic,"Wow! What a relief this was to see that horror still exists and directors are beginning to understand the genre. Loved, loved, loved this move from start to finish. Excellent character development, I felt the love between brother and sister which was absolutely great! I went into this movie with an open mind, having never seen the original and had no idea what I was up against. The gore, the story, the plot, rising resolutions all held the attention of the audience and even caused me to shake a little. I trembled as the movie reached its climax and found myself completely horrified from all the gore and the deaths which had taken place.I am not here to spoil this adventure for anyone and encourage individuals who are looking to see horror revived to take time and watch this movie. Great way to start the spring and a great way to say ""no more BS horror flicks"". Thank you Evil Dead for setting the bar of what horror is supposed to look like.....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Remake Ever,"After the outdated 1981 first film of the franchise, a reboot was kind of necessary and the dead return in such an epic fashion. Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods. It might not be the most original plot and it actually has a lot of the most common horror tropes, but it shockingly compensates with its gory scenes that are guaranteed to terrify the viewer one way or another. It is incredibly bloody and the terror is genuinely thrilling and entertaining. Making it (IMO) One of the best splatters of all time. It respects the old Evil Dead films but also does everything better than the 1981 original. It has better effects, it's still brutal and the camera work and music is great too. Even the creativity was there (car battery scene). Even all the characters are more interesting than in the first film. Mia is significantly more badass than Ash in the first evil dead. She is the first victim but still the final girl. Even the book looks good too, and the finale against the Kandarian demon was terrific, even though the demon was surprisingly weak.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as campy as the first, but mostly the same plot. No humour, though.","Some of us remember The Evil Dead fondly because of Bruce Campbell's shenanigans and especially the funny persona that was created for parts two and three. The first part, the original, was only a campy horror, with lots of fake blood and mustard thrown around and some obnoxious acting. As such, this film is a pretty straightforward remake, with a slightly different plot, death order and survivor. It lacks any hint of campiness or humour, though, or that manic craziness that Campbell portrayed, which might upset people.For me, though, The Evil Dead was the first horror I've watched, aged 6, and I had nightmares over it for a few days afterwards. I was way too young to understand it and at the time it was a pretty horror experience. The feeling for the 2013 remake was completely different. Not only did I know what was going to happen, but films like this have been done since... well... at least 1981; to death, pardon the pun.Also I have to say that The Cabin in the Woods spoiled any chance of me ""feeling it"". I kept waiting for Richard Jenkins to appear, LOL. And all the characters are really unlikeable, and some over the top scenes really broke any spell that might have gripped me.Bottom line: It's a really direct demon possession in the woods film. It is as horror as movies like these get. It is also similar to the story of the film they were remaking, which is good for any remake. However I really don't see a funny Evil Dead sequel coming up; it would have nothing to build on.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So much hate,"I get it. I get that all of you die-hard oldschool horror fans out there were upset that they went and made a remake when the original was awesome, because I agree. Many are critical of the effects, or the acting, knowing full well that the original didn't have either of those, and that's not what made it great. If you can manage to pry yourself off your high horse and try to assess this remake on its own merits instead of just comparing it to the original, I think you'll find that the film is better than some would lead you to believe.I found this film refreshing in that it's a modern take on the more traditional horror genre we grew up on and have been deprived of in the last 20 years. That is what Evil Dead has always been about, the epic horror story! In a lousy horror world of mock-umentaries and first person camcorder BS, its nice to relive a decent horror story with some gory 21st century updates. It's easily one of the better new wave horror films I've seen, probably because it is oldschool at its core.Don't waste your time comparing the two, just enjoy them both! I think you'll find either film to be more entertaining than another regurgitated blair witch-esque ghost/demon film or ""people who torture people for fun"" junk horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Major Disappointment and an Insult to the Horror Genre,"While the original was self aware, goofy, had great, self made special effects and a lovable lead in Bruce Campbell, the remake completely misses the mark. Obnoxiously violent, gory, sadistic, misogynistic and cruel, this isn't ""fun"" horror in the vein of say ""Cabin Fever"" ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" or even the first two Evil Dead films. This isn't exciting like Friday the 13th or A Nightmare on Elm street or Halloween is. It's not scary like The Shining or the Exorcist. This is pure, unadulterated GARBAGE. Hell, ""Troll 2"" is better than this turd. The actors are pathetic, the cinematography is dark, unfocused and jittery and the writing is choppy. We switch from lead to lead, without any character development to speak of, (save for the lead's archetypal druggie character), and some characters exist only to scream, get tortured and die. Usually people like horror films or engage with them because they either care about the characters or have a strong hate for the characters. Neither applies here. Aside from Lou Taylor Pucci, (and I'm saying that because I've seen his past work and know it's not his fault his character isn't given much to act upon), every actor is a cardboard cut out. Alvarez is dead in the directors chair and thus the film is void of any self-awareness, humor or meaning. This is, by far, the worst film of 2013. A completely unnecessary and stupid remake. A book the length of War and Peace could not adequately describe my loathing of this abomination.",,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead is probably one of the goriest films I've ever seen.,"I can only assume that the film makers supplied several swimming pools filled with fake blood...because there is so much of it. Blood on the floor, blood on clothes, blood on faces, raining blood, blood on...wait a minute, raining blood!? Yes, it goes to that extreme. So Evil Dead is a remake of the original of the same name, we follow a group of teens in a cabin in a remote location who try to help their friend to stop taking drugs. They find the book of the dead and what ensues is a heck load of blood and gore! Oh, and all of the following: tree rape, slicing tongue and snogging someone, car crushing a girl's hand and her pulling it out...and my favourite, absolutely decimating someone with a chainsaw. I'm talking ripped to shreds! Total annihilation! Ohhhh so satisfying to watch...in a sick weird way. As you can probably tell, I enjoyed the hell out of this and have done for several viewings. It knows exactly what it is, a fun gory flick that does not take itself too seriously. Yes the characters are bland and expendable and yes the acting is mediocre, except Jane Levy who was actually really good. But you didn't watch this for an Oscar nominated performance. No no no you wanted to see a girl slice her mouth open with a shard of glass! I mean the enhanced use of makeup, prosthetics, costumes etc. just made the experience all the more enjoyable and authentic. I appreciated the dark comedic undertone, particularly from the possessed Mia, that definitely harked back to the original. Director Fede Alvarez did a good job, lots of creepy camerawork and I adored the opening bird's eye view shot where the teenagers are driving along the road. His usage of visual exposition, such as flashbacks to the opening scene, were pointless and unfortunately spoon fed us everything. You'll guess the whole plot in the first 10 minutes, which is its downfall. However, I wanted to see gore and it delivered...massively. My advice: don't read a book made of skin and wrapped in barbed wire. Just don't.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy,"Evil Dead takes everything that was great about the original and makes it amazing. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best horror film I have ever seen; and as a big horror fan, that means a lot. Evil Dead tells the story of five friends who end up trapped in a cabin with an evil demon after one of them accidentally releases it from a book. This film is perfect Lovecraftian style horror. Even alluding to Lovecraft's work by calling the book ""Necronomicon"" which H.P. Lovecraft fans will recognize as the focal point to many of his stories.While Evil Dead perpetually borders the line between frightening and ridiculous, it does so in a way that keeps you from laughing at the absurdity of it while forcing you to cringe and scream. The story is a simple,yet upgraded version of the Evil Dead storyline we all know. The plot differs in many points but most of the iconic scenes are present or at least alluded to. I strongly felt the storyline was more greatly developed than I had expected and you truly want the characters to survive, unlike in the original. The sub-plot between the siblings gives Evil Dead real heart.Evil Dead is (Expectedly) violent and gory. I would not recommend taking children to see it, as there are many disturbing scenes. This film is far more graphic than the original ""The Evil Dead,"" but we should expect that considering the advancements in technology since 1981. The differences between the two films visually are not unlike the technological/visual differences between ""The Thing"" (1982) and ""The Thing"" (2011). The effects are enjoyable to look at; albeit frightening at times; however, because it is a reboot, there is a wonderful feeling that you've seen many of the events before, though this time they look better.The acting is surprisingly good for the genre, and the film makes several nods to ""The Evil Dead,"" most notable being the soundtrack, inclusion of a shotgun, fruit cellar, and of course, chainsaw. However, the book unfortunately does not have a face on its cover. There is not a single negative thing I can say about this movie. The absolute best part is the climax. It differs so greatly from the original that I did not expect it in the slightest. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 10 - 15 minutes (?) it takes up.I honestly believe Evil Dead tops the original in nearly every way (And I loved the original). It was clearly a labour of love for the filmmakers.Evil Dead is worth your money. All of your money. Watch it a hundred times.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good remake with a few benefits,"First of all this is a good Remake/Reboot/Sequel.It starts as an average Teen-Horror Movie and goes onto some fantastic effects and Splatter par excellence.The story is settled after Army of Darkness and works as a Reboot/Sequel, although the movie takes some scenes from the original, it creates its own story with new characters.Splatter fans will have their fun, as well as Evil Dead fans.

Great re-imagining of a classic series.,"Awesome movie! C'mon did you guys really just want a comedy rip off of Evil Dead 2 and 3 with better SFX? Let's not forget the original was a straight horror movie. This is a great interpretation. Demons, bloody violence and self inflicted nasty bits. A clever homage to the original series. Also reminded me of the Exorcist in parts. I actually liked how the demons were 'updated' from Sumerian/Lovecraft demons to your more traditional satanic ones :) Maybe some of the negative reviewers should stick to Xena Warrior Princess re-runs. I will be looking forward to Army of Darkness 2 tho and I hope there's a sequel to this one! Groovy indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The crown belongs to Fede, now","Five people, friends and family, go to a cabin, so that one of them can quit cold turkey, far away from the city. This helps explain why the others do not take her seriously, when she behaves in self-destructive ways, and starts talking about the horrible evil present. Because by the time this was made there was a bit of an expectation of logic in these things. The interpersonal relationships make sense and resonate. No one just acts obnoxious for no good reason. Every jump scare leads to something.It was always going to be a hard sell. There are scores of people who want a sequel to the second, countless others who want another army of Darkness, but Drag Me To Hell did not fare as well as was hoped, probably primarily because it was hampered by a PG-13 rating. I am happy to announce that this is my new favorite of the four. I think each of these is better than the last and it started out incredible.Realizing that there's no way to outdo Sam Raimi at his best, they got rid of almost all the camp and macabre humor. This is very much a straight horror film. It is much bloodier and the gore is gritty and harsh. Where the others alleviate some tension by getting us to laugh, this one focuses entirely on being terrifying.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this also features a lot of strong language and a little disturbing sexual content. I recommend this to any fan of the genre. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead: Twilight Edition,"A Hollywood remake of the indie low-budget classic horror film that introduced the world to Sam Raimi didn't need to be done. Unfortunately fans of the original, despite their disgust at the idea of a remake, are not going to be able to keep their curiosity from leading them to watch it. We hope that maybe, just maybe, this new Evil Dead will be the same woods and same cabin but new characters to become their victims. We hope that it will enhance the original or that this new director will make it more bloody and brutally extreme, as Alexandre Aja did with The Hills Have Eyes.The new Evil Dead begins by trying to give the cabin a reason for feeling haunted with an out-of-place back-story in the vein of The Exorcist. Not the original Exorcist but one of the sequels or even the prequel. A little girl is burned alive and shot in the head by her father. Sound horrific? It would have been if the special effects used to create the scene were at least a little better than something out of a Silent Hill video game. The horrible CG after effects make the scene a joke. This also takes away one of the key elements that made the cabin such a mysteriously cold and uncomfortable place. Instead of leaving it's audience to use our own imagination for possible reasons this place is so uninviting, we now have a reason and that reason isn't anything better or scarier than not knowing anything at all.After the opening title we are introduced to Mia and her friends. Turns out Mia is a drug addict and has come to this cabin with her friends, one of them being a nurse, to over-come her addiction cold turkey. Why has this become a good reason for going to a cabin in the woods in horror films? Anyone who has survived withdrawal from any substance between heroin to crack-cocaine knows that this is the dumbest idea anyone could ever think of. But as in the original Evil Dead films, it's not like anyone with any brains has ever bothered to try to stay in this cabin. This can be forgiven. What can't be forgiven is that this cabin is sitting on a sound stage and the forest surrounding is fake. If there is one thing that truly elevates horror it is reality. In the original, the forest set the mood and the trees were characters. It brought a very real feeling of solitude only found in nature and that feeling came through the screen. It added an eerie presence. Shooting a cabin in the woods horror movie on a sound stage is treating your audience like children going to see a family-friendly fantasy film. The director might as well slap us in the face and call us stupid.Fede Alvarez tries to get serious with over-dramatic scenes that are so poorly written and executed they wouldn't even pass in a network television drama. The acting and dialogue are something more suited for the Disney channel. These scenes that are suppose to give us insight into these characters are something only children under the age of 12 years old would believe. Is this not an R-rated extreme horror film for mature audiences? Alvarez doesn't seem to know the difference. Perhaps he should go work for the Disney Channel and leave the horror genre alone.When we do get some practical effects with the gore, it is not anything we haven't seen before and seen done better. The few jump scares are forced and it seems as if Alvarez is desperate to use every trick in the book to try to scare us. The thing is, if it's in the book it means it's been done before so no matter how hard you try or how many different techniques you steal from other films, it still doesn't fool anyone who knows the genre. Shiloh Fernandez is one of the worse actors I've seen on-screen in a long time. If the filmmakers wanted to cater to Twilight crowds, why not just throw Taylor Lautner in the film? He would have done a better job acting than Fernandez anyway.In the end it is not an unseen force or presence lingering in the woods that has been awoken by a foolish character reading from the book of the dead. In Alvarez's vision, it's something that looks like an Asian ghost girl from Ju-On: The Grudge, which we got used to seeing back in 2004 and is far from scary now.For fans of the original Evil Dead films, this will be as horrible of an experience as it was for Star Wars fans to witness The Phantom Menace or Indiana Jones fans to watch The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This new Evil Dead is nothing short of a movie abortion. You won't see more horribly written and performed dramatic scenes aimed at a mature audience on-screen. As for the director, Fede Alvarez should not only never be allowed to work in any aspect of the film industry, he should be taken to Guantanamo Bay for 3 years of torture followed by a slow and painful death. Any critic who gave this film a positive review should be fired and publicly shamed because they are the reason this industry is dying.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The First Decent Remake I've Seen,"Brilliant. I enjoyed it a lot, and was scared- Only reason really being jump scenes, though. Despite knowing most of them were coming, they still made me jump! The lack of CGI made it even better, more... 'Believable'. I really enjoyed the lack of CGI, it really was rather convincing. I enjoyed it a lot, and I sat through the credits because I liked it so much. Not better than the original, for the original holds a place in my heart as a classic film-- But if you are disregarding it's relation to the original Evil Dead trilogy, you can say honestly, it's a great movie. I am easily pleased with horror flicks, I will admit. But this was probably one of the few movies to scare me, and I loved it. I hope they have an uncut DVD version to come out, I'd love to watch that. I'm very excited for the rumored sequels, and hope to see more work from Sam Raimi and Alvarez soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Humorless,"Same story, but much more bloody and humorless. That's not to say it's a bad film, but despite it's name it's not an Evil Dead film either. Some scenes mimic Japanese horror flicks like The Ring and the excessive gore and violence is copied from the SAW legacy. But if you're gonna make a bleak and serious horror movie you have to go all the way -which the French have done very well the last couple of years- but there it falls short. The young actors are just uncharismatic zombie fodder (you won't care if they live) who can't replace the memory of Bruce Campell (who got a nice cheque as the producer on this film sellout). The closest thing I've seen to Evil Dead is from Mr. Raimi himself: Drag Me to Hell. Better watch that if haven't seen it yet instead of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Classic, Hard-Hitting Remake","The Evil Dead is about 5 twenty-somethings who take a trip to a cabin in the woods where two siblings - Mia and David - used to spend their time growing up. Not long after arriving, the group discover an old witch-craft book called the Book of the Dead, but one of the group members unknowingly brings an evil demon to life after reading from the book, so it's not long before all hell starts to break loose.Now, I know that the film industry has come a long way since 1981 (when the original was made), but let's be honest - the original is a camp, low-budget flick with just a few scares which is cheesier than a cheddar factory. Whether that was intentional or not, I don't know, but when you read what a movie's about and has the title Evil Dead then this new version is what I'd be expecting...not the Edam one. I've never understood why the original gets such rave reviews as it's just a bad-acted, mediocre film.Anyway, enough about the crappy original and onto this much better version. This one is extremely dark and is most definitely not for the squeamish. There are a few scenes that will definitely make you flinch & feel uneasy and for one of these scenes all I'll say is ""tongue"" and ""knife"". It's obvious the makers of this version wanted to go with unsettling, gory and relentless instead of laughable, badly-acted and boring and credit to them for doing that.The make-up was fantastic, as were the visual effects. It may be sometimes obvious or predictable on what is going to happen at times, but the vast majority of these of horrors are, and if you're let down by some predictability in a horror movie like this then you're pretty naive.I actually really enjoyed this version. We know it was never going to be a Hollywood Oscar-winner or an all-time ""classic"", but just watch it for what it is...a very gory, squeamish - and sometimes unsettling - horror film. Ignore the original and go with this one instead as it's much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is how you Reebot a classic with Low Budget,"First of all if you are fan of the original one, then you would know that the Evil Dead's tradition is always been to make a really scary movie with a low budget. And yes they followed the same tradition with this one, but it is impossible to say that this movie was on a budget because it purely just DELIVERED!!! I wouldn't call this to be a reboot/remake, this was more like a really good sequel and filled in a lot of holes left in the original one. Although the story had some similarities with the original, but a lot of new stuff.I'll be honest I was really nervous that they wouldn't live upto it and by the end I was really happy to say they really lived upto it. I really felt the lady actresses did an awesome job, guys could've done little better but trust me that's the least of your worries once you enter the Evil Dead World. The mood of the film was perfect,it basically complimented the original one in every aspect.Bruce Campbell, you should take a bow. He started this cult with Sam Raimi and produced this new Evil Dead with all respects to the classic. He made sure the audiences would cringe every time. And the best way to know this is when you see weak hearted people getting up and leaving during the gore scenes.So let this be a caution for you. This is not just your average horror movie. It's on a whole new league of horror and you must have a strong mindset to watch everything.Overall I am sooooo happy that after 32 years later, this movie remains alive. I really hope they go through with the trilogy again like last time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't need a headline,This is one of the films that I consider personally to be one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Even the trailer when I first saw it scared me. There is a lot of blood and gore but it doesn't have the comedic elements from the original films. Plus it has no Ash in it so that right there is a bit of a disappointment but besides that it nails the scares well.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best remakes in recent years.,"This film is definitely one of the best remakes in recent years. The female characters aren't just there for sex appeal, the characters aren't complete idiots, and we finally get a horror without teenagers being obnoxious and trying to get laid! However, that's not to say that this film has characters we can root for and relate to. The film doesn't really try to give us likable characters, they're just there to die, really. Therefore, upon retrospect of watching this movie, you realize that the characters don't really do anything before they die! So you might as well have obnoxious teens because no one in this movie has any character traits other than scared! The lead female (I can't remember her name) has the trait of being an ex heroin addict, but that's dropped instantly! At first it seems Eric may be our lead this time, but then he dies and that other guy takes over and I could barely tell he was there before he had to kill the demon in the end!As a result of these poor characters, this movie doesn't really seem like a movie - just a series of events! The characters turn up, they die, the end. There's no progression or evolution of the plot, it's just there to set up a few cool moments and that's really all you can take away from the movie - it's pretty freaking cool!The deaths and action will either make you cringe and look away from the screen, or make you whoop in excitement as you watch the badass chaos ensue! I'm personally the latter. This of course means the effects, both practical and CGI are spot on and there's not a single moment that'll make you think ""they really could've cleaned that up a bit.In the end, really, the only thing going for this movie is the cool action and effects, the story and character writing feels lazy but it is one hell of a fun time!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Why Sam Raimi, WHY???","I must say that when I first saw that a remake was being done for this movie I was, to say the least, very excited. I am a true fan of the original movie and own the other two follow on movies. When the movie was released I rushed out to the theater to view, what I was hoping would be, a brilliant remake of a cult classic. After a short period of viewing I was becoming disenchanted but decided to stick to my guns and hope for the best, a decision that I would later regret. All I can say is that I have lost 91 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I was very disappointed with the remake of this movie. It did at times have moments that looked as though it was going to turn around and get better but alas it never did, at least for me anyway. All I can say is that Sam Raimi should be slapped for destroying what has become over the years a huge cult film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty scary,"This is actually the plot of the original Evil Dead. The Evil Dead is an American horror film franchise created by Sam Raimi consisting of four feature films. The films revolve around the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, an ancient Sumerian text which wreaks havoc upon a group of cabin inhabitants in a wooded area in Tennessee. The protagonist, Ashley J. ""Ash"" Williams (Bruce Campbell) is the only character to appear in every installment of the original trilogy (Linda, Ash's girlfriend makes an appearance in all 3 films, but her only appearance in Army of Darkness is during the prologue). The original trilogy includes The Evil Dead (1981), Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992), all written and directed by Raimi, produced by Robert G. Tapert, and starring Campbell. The franchise has since expanded into other formats such as video games and comic books, and a musical opened in Toronto in 2003 containing material from all three films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There Will Be Blood ( and More Blood ),"This film is not recommended.Yesterday's creative ideas can easily become today's cliché. The perfect case in point: Sam Raimi's 1981 low budget thriller, The Evil Dead, a true cult classic in the horror genre. ( In fact, Raimi and his star of that film, Bruce Campbell, are co-producers of this update, so much of this new film's flaws belong to them too.)The original film had lousy acting, a dumb script, and bad production values, but it also brought with it the innovative director's keen vision and camera-work, plus some wit, to redeem its bloody limitations. This new reincarnation, directed by Fede Alvarez, essentially follows that story with some interesting tweaking, but it sorely lacks the humor and real suspense of its predecessor. However, what is doesn't lack is Alvarez's inventive ways to systematically dispose of his young victims and his obsession with more detailed close-ups of grisly deaths and dismemberment. ( Alvarez does seem to have an unhealthy and morbid obsession with tongues in this version.) Entertainment to some, but for me, not very satisfying. ( But then, I never much liked mincemeat either.)For those who may not know the basic plot, it goes like this: Five friends go to that cabin in the woods and find a heavy flesh-bound volume entitled The Book of the Dead, where upon these sacrificial lambs unleash those evil spirits that will later maim and torture them. ( Right away, the savvy moviegoer begins to wonder the I.Q. of these people, but we go along with the premise anyway. It's all par for the course. )The acting is still less than stellar, with the exception of Jane Levy as Mia, who comes to this remote forest via intervention for her drug abuse. ( This is one of the few revamped touches that improves upon the original version. adding some logical sense to the story. When she starts hearing voices and seeing things, the others really don't know if she is hallucinating or possessed. ) Needless to say, they begin to find out, one by one.This downgraded version trades its cleverness for graphic torture scenes involving all sorts of tools to aid in the increasing body count: pliers, box cutters, nail guns, meat slicers, machetes, the tried-and-true chainsaw, etc. ( ACE Hardware really should have paid for the product endorsement rights. ) Yet the real horror in horror films these days is the latest advances in state-of-the-arts technology in its bloodcurdling realism. The filmmakers had nary an ounce of creativity or humor added to their new revision, rarely straying from the formulaic plot structure or improving upon the earlier film. But they seem to pool all their skills to gleefully share in their bloody pound of flesh. Self-mutilation has never looked so darn good! ( I have to say that I turned away from the screen numerous times to avert the violent onslaught of carnage on the screen. It is an understatement to say that this film is not for the squeamish.)Evil Dead (2013) slaughters the essence of its original source to satiate today's modern movie-going audience's thirst for blood and gore. Less is more, but that old adage is too often forgotten by filmmakers and producers and far away from the clichéd nowadays.Perhaps, the next sequel ( and yes, there will be another in this series ) should be titled: Evil Dead 2: Pardon Me Sir, Is That a Chainsaw in Your Hand, or Are You Just Happy to See Me?

"Good, but a major disappointment","When I heard they were remaking (or rebooting, which seems to be the term these days) Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981) I first thought: why? Even with the approval of Raimi, producer Rob Tapert and actor Bruce Campbell why even bother? In my view, The Evil Dead is perfect and needs no modern update, even then, I would have thought the rabid fan base would be enough to scare someone off touching this. Well, it doesn't really matter what I think because here I am reviewing Evil Dead, directed by newcomer Fede Alvarez and boasting the very bold tagline ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience.""Well, this is most definitely not the most terrifying film I have ever experienced. In fact, it is probably one of the most disappointing films I have ever experienced. Is it bad? No, not at all. Is it as good as it could have been? Definitely not.It's a fairly fun ride for the most part, with a strong opening and plenty of neat gross-out gags (with minimal CGI, which is a big bonus). The actors are serviceable, as is the music and direction. But to me it feels lifeless, almost like it tries too hard to be gross and disturbing. The story also leaves a lot to be desired in some parts.I will not break the plot down, it is basically the same as the original with minor changes I will not spoil here. My big issue is that no character is really likable or interesting. Now, the original didn't boast deep or complex characters, but they all seemed more human, more easy to relate to in some strange way. There is no hero like Ash which I found really strange, as that was a huge part of the original. There are also plot holes and contrivances which I can't go through otherwise I will spoil the movie, needless to say they are fairly obvious and disappointing.As I mentioned previously, the acting is serviceable, Jane Levy is the stand out as Mia and Lou Taylor Pucci does a great job as the unlucky Eric. The other three are okay, but nothing to write home about. I think for a debut film Alvarez does a great job behind the camera, the direction feels assured, he definitely knows what he wants, which in this case is blood, lots of it. Once the carnage starts it doesn't let up, there are plenty of gags that the special effects team get to show off. No body part is safe, no sharp object unused. These scenes are nasty and in your face, with a darkly humorous edge to them. By the end of the movie they do feel a little forced, but overall the level of gore in the film is not disappointing and any hardcore horror film will appreciate what is on show here.Overall the film is enjoyable and easy to watch. I can't say it was ever boring, and I am impressed that this is a debut feature film. For this reason I am giving it a more positive rating; however I think the excessive praise that Evil Dead is 'near perfect' and 'astonishing' is mostly hype. I enjoyed it enough to buy the Blu-Ray to add to Evil Dead trilogy Blu-Ray collection, it is something I can watch if I want some cheap thrills or to gross out a friend, but when compared to the original it just doesn't make the cut. Sam Raimi's film was scary, funny and insanely gory yet very simple. This tries too hard to be all of the above, and only just succeeds.3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One of the best remakes out there, still not as good as the original","I went into this movie expecting very few of it because well... its a remake. But when you learn that Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi produced the film and were very involved, you start believing that this movie might be good.Surprise, the movie is good. I believe that this is the movie Sam Raimi intended to do back in the first one, but had a limited budget (I am not saying this one is better than the first one).The movie delivers on the gore and the scares as effectively as the old film. Every time someone gets cut or hurt, you feel it, just like in the first one.I must say that the lead actors (although very good) do not stand near Bruce Campbell and his performance which really improved the first film. There are some issues with tone as well, the first and second act are more scary (like the first evil dead movie), and the third act just goes f*cking crazy and hilarious (like the second evil dead movie). Another problem is that if you thought the secondary characters of the first movie were not that good, these can be even more forgettable.Some plot-holes of the first movie are answered in this one, which is very good. The movie also does some interesting twists with the story that turned out pretty good. But of course, this movie is not better than the original, it just lacks its spirit and rawness.If you are a fan of the original or gore in general, I would advise you to check out this flick just to have a bloody good time (no pun intended).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing Special; Jane Levy Has Lots of Potential,"I love the ridiculousness of the Evil Dead franchise and all the blood and guts. This movie only really had blood and guts, nothing iconic, nothing that stands out. Jane Levy's acting is what saved the movie towards the end, she was great. The story was just barely given a base to stand on and the other characters were quite bland, except for Mia. The acting for the brother and the friends could've been a lot better. I forgot the blonde girl existed until she talked haha.The gory scenes were well done, given the modern technology and so props to the makeup and effects people. There is lots of gore in this movie but it almost gets cartoonish as no one really reacts that much to that much pain. The book of the dead turned quite cartoonish as well, it was very basic.All in all, it has the guts and gore but not much of what made the original Evil Dead so terrifying and a classic. I get that they had to do a modern remake but it could've been done so much better. The cast could've been better too. I'm only giving this a rating higher than 5 because of Jane Levy and Bruce's awesome cameo at the end. Only worth a one-time watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh God. No. Just no.,"This was the worst movie experience of my life. THE WORST.I have never wanted to walk out of a movie theater more in my entire life. If I had been alone, I would have been out within the first half of this film.I want to preface this saying: I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. I'm not a wimp. I'm used to them; I've seen a lot, good and bad. I enjoy a good scare.If you are a fan of fun, entertaining, horror movies that scare you, then this is not the movie for you. If you are a fan of the original, the series, or of your own sanity, then this is not the movie for you.If you'd like to have your mind warped, disturbed, and crapped on for two hours, then go for it.This contained some of the most disturbing imagery I have ever seen, falling just behind photos of holocaust victims and two girls, one cup. What's worse though, is that it's got no purpose. It's not the kind of horror that is so over the top, it's funny. It's not even designed to scare you. It's a horror movie designed, not to tell a story, not to make you jump, but simply to make you want to throw up.I'm not sure it even qualifies as horror. Because I wasn't scared. I was disgusted and disturbed and I wished I could scrub my mind clean. But I wasn't scared.If you a re a glutton for punishment, sure, give it a try.

his is one h e l l of a remake ! All hail Jane Levy :love:,"The story picks up 30 years after the original 'THE EVIL DEAD' film ended with a new group of kids going to the same cabin so Mia (Levy) can try to detox and get over her opiate addiction. Her friends Eric (Pucci), Olivia (Lucas), Natalie (Blackmore) and brother David (Fernandez) are there as well to help her get through it. They come across the 'book of the dead' (the Naturom Demonto) from the original films, in the cellar and Eric foolishly reads from it (despite several warnings not to). He of course awakens the dead and Mia is possessed. The others originally think she's just going through withdrawals but they soon find themselves being taken over and killed off one by one as they fight the deadites for their survival.The film was made on a budget of just $17 million (which is a lot higher than the original film obviously but a pretty small budget by Hollywood standards). The filmmakers decided not to use CGI , the practical effects are outstanding! Filmed for 70 days. The results are definitely rewarding. The film really has that 'old school' classic supernatural horror film feel to it capturing the fear of isolation, and demonic threats, and it's surprisingly loyal to the original films . 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dead on Arrival,"If a movie tagline is anything to go by, then EVIL DEAD the remake should be ""The most terrifying film you will experience""; or so the makers would have you believe. But depending on what makes your skin crawl, this tagline is either true to the word or entirely misleading.Void of time and place, an unceremonious prologue tells us that evil exists in and around a desolate cabin in some Godforsaken part of the woods. The cabin is almost rundown but serves as the perfect spot for Mia (Jane Levy) to go cold turkey on her heroin addiction. Aiding Mia's detox is her brother (Shiloh Fernandez), and their friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). Mia and David have a strained relationship that is never fully explained, but an unseen bond between the siblings becomes apparent as the story progresses. This of course is merely a distracting subplot because Eric, meanwhile, has discovered a book known as the Necronomicon, or 'Book of the dead'. And before they realize what the book holds within, all hell breaks loose. Quite literally.For a horror movie remade more than thirty years after the original, visual effects are impressive but rarely do these effects induce the fear or terror that is promised. To begin with, the atmosphere is never chilling or ominous even as demonic possessions start to become the mainstay in the plot. In comparing to the 1981 original, debutant feature director Fede Alvarez has made a competent horror flick that is just a few notches above the schlock-o-meter. The premise and the fight for survival remains faithfully true to Sam Raimi's original, with multiple throwbacks to THE EVIL DEAD franchise. As a homage, this remake could sit fairly well with horror fans relentless with an appetite for blood and gore. On that note, violence is of an extreme nature and Alvarez's camera-work is very unforgiving during the many slicing and dicing, and slashing and stabbing scenes. Even if you choose to close your eyes, you cannot the escape the sound of tearing flesh or many of the other forms of bodily mutilation and dismemberment. In keeping with the exploitation theme of 70s and 80s low-budget horror flicks, Alvarez stays on course and then goes all out for the blood soaked finale. This final showdown benefits from some originality, particularly when good and evil switches positions. But up until this point the suspense and fright factor is pretty much an assembly line production consistent with standard Hollywood pop culture.Ultimately, the new EVIL DEAD relies heavily on multiple references to the original without so much as exploring creative individuality. That being said, Alvarez and the screenwriters have opted for maximum gore fest instead of working towards really terrorizing the audience. Characters are unremarkable and you don't really bother who lives and who dies. Fernandez's David is particularly annoying as an idiotically gullible protagonist. Levy's Mia has one or two good scenes before becoming possessed but remaining cast members have little or nothing to work with except gallons of cinema grade corn syrup. Potentially, this film had all the wicked ingredients of a perfect remake. If only the makers (including Sam Raimi as the producer) had focused on personifying evil with some sort of tangibility, this film would have easily rubbed decaying shoulders with the likes of THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. Eventually, what you get is evil dead on arrival. And by this I am also referring to the fact that I slept like a baby.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Bloody Good Time,"Evil Dead is one of the most brutal and disgusting films I have ever seen. I applaud the unique direction to take the franchise, which has previously embraced camp, into a super realistic and vicious horror film. The effects and gore are the best of the franchise, having a nearly 20-year gap between the previous entry. Some of the scenes go down as all-time greats in horror that have been cemented in my mind ever since. The bread cutter scene is just disgusting and done so well, I absolutely loved all of the blood that was used in these scenes. The story is not as fleshed out as the first or second film, but it does take unique directions that I can appreciate it. The use of a recovering drug addict was done really well and was an interesting motive to keep the cast at the cabin. The weakened state she was in made her the perfect victim to be the first possessed, which worked really well. The dialogue and acting were quite atrocious. Other than Jane Levy, everyone else was quite bad. The lines were corny and delivered in a somewhat awkward fashion. This made the twenty-minute rising action of the film to be quite lackluster, but luckily once the action gets going, there is plenty of things to distract you from it. Overall, this movie's visuals and horror carry the film to its rating. It unfortunately does not live up to the hype I once had for it as a 15-year-old boy, but it is still one of the better remakes in cinema history.Score: 73% 👍

A good reboot...,"When I first heard they were going to do a remake... I was worried...I need not have been - While the film loses much of the Classic and misses much of what made the original Sam Raimi Classic such a hit, it also does a great job of paying homage to the great man!The film has lost its dark humor, and tries to be a very serious film... Some aspects work great - At least there is a plausible reason for them to be at the cabin for instance.Other parts do not work so well... The film focuses of trying to squeeze in as much action as possible, so lacks some character development - Then again, the original lacked character development while focusing more on the story...While it will never beat the original - It stands well as a great film!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Introduction to the Evil Dead Franchise,"Evil Dead, 2013So this is my introduction to my Evil Dead Franchise. I've heard a lot about the Evil Dead Franchise, and I have always wanted to get into them.I could've chosen the Original but for some reason the 2013 version interested me. I think the fact that it is a horror remake that actually got positive reviews gave me a good impression. So today I watched it!The First act of the movie, I was fairly invested, and was quite impressed with the Cinematography and atmosphere. There were some clever plot devices too. The fact that Mia is a drug addict and is staying in this cabin to get sober & other people are trying to keep her there - I liked it. It gave the characters a reason to stay in the cabin. Also when Mia is acting strange, they just think it is because of the drugs. It is clever.However, when it comes to actual scares and tension, I wasn't too impressed. Most of jumpscares did not really work for me, and I think I did not feel the intended tension in some of the scenes.Also, *for the first act* I wasn't really caring about the characters.But rest of the movie, I would say I enjoyed a lot. I think the movie got better and better as it kept going. Without jumpscares, the movie made a investing story and as a result, I began to care a lot more for the characters and I did feel tension more.This is a very gory movie, and I'm sure most of them were practical effects. And as a result they are very effective. Some moments, I just kept thinking to myself 'just let them die at this point lol' with the amount of gore.I mentioned the cinematography earlier, but I have to talk about it more. Not only the cinematography but the location, the look of the movie are just so good. It adds to the atmosphere a lot. Especially during the final moments of the movie, there are a lot of impressive shots utilizing color red.Might be a nitpick, but whenever the 'devil' spoke, it sometimes felt cheesy. Maybe it is the way it is in the original, but that is just what I felt *in some moments*.After watching this I found out that this was directed by the same guy who directed Don't Breathe (2016), another horror thriller I really enjoyed. I am also looking forward to what this guy makes next.Maybe I am giving this a higher score than it actually deserves because I just saw it, but nonetheless I really liked it. Maybe I will change it to 7 later.So obviously I am now more interested in this universe, and I am looking forward to Evil Dead Rise ... don't know when it is coming out tho!*idk if it is true but one of the doors in the house had an upside down cross in it.*who tf names their dog 'grandpa' lol.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I don't scare or ""jump"" easily with horror films but this one caught me a couple times. The ""feel"" of this movie is definitely different than the originals, it felt more like a horror film compared to the original's horror content but comical overacting mood. Both styles and movies are great in their own way, and I love Bruce Campbell as much as the next guy, but it was refreshing to see the new approach and new vision to this remake! (I mean, who really wants to see the exact same movie with different characters anyways?) The Cinematography was beautiful in this film, so props to Aaron Morton, and the acting was on par. A lot of horror films have at least one actor who seems..well, like they can't act. I felt like this film had no weak actors. Now to address the haters. From what I've read on the low votes on this movie was because 1)It wasn't exactly like the originals and 2) It wasn't realistic. As I previously said, I liked how it wasn't the exact same thing and that they are both great in their own ways. So if you think the originals are absolutely perfect and don't want to see anything else other than that, then KEEP WATCHING THE ORIGINALS. You're already setting yourself up to hate anything past them. As for the second point, I'll say ""As if the originals were SO realistic..."" haha! The point of the originals were to be over the top, and they achieved that. This remake may not have been SCIENTIFICALLY realistic, like on how to dismember an arm, but the effects were pretty damn grotesque and real ""looking"" to anyone with a sense of imagination. Definitely far from cheesy. So if you are a scientist/doctor in human biology AND a perfectionist where if tendons tear the wrong way it will bother you, then this film may not be for you. But props to the FX team, I thought they did a fantastic job. I totally recommend this movie to any horror lover.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Big Budget Not Remake of Original,"Other than taking cues for creativity in depicting possessed people and the way they commit acts of gore, this film more than stands on it's own for thickly layered evil. Roughly the exact opposite of the Paranormal movies, where scares are derived from long periods of nothing, this films tries to up the shock value more like the torture porn ""Saw"" movies. What also pushes the envelope is the incredible punishment all our victims can endure. Which makes the film just that more creepy and bloody. I was amazed to read that the budget for this heavy effects film is just 17 million. There are enough practical scenes of gore to make three low budget horror films. But there are also well shot scenes of swamp and creepy forest chases that did not look easy to film.We barely get to know our group of cabin dwellers before the evil takes over. Each scene was well thought out in terms of pushing the ick factor, making each possession as superhuman as they are supernatural. Yet the director is wise enough to keep this film from feeling conventional. Again, seemingly a great deal of time was put into creating a creepy atmosphere (foggy woods, dark and lonely cabin rooms, point of view attack scenes), and trying it's best not reveal how much was created in a studio.Some of the gore reminded me of the classic 80s version of ""The Thing"", which also took pride in coming up with creative gore effects. The recent remake of ""The Thing"" was an example of how hard it is to try and best the original or at least give the title some dignity. In this Evil Dead update, other than a few obvious CGI effects, most of the gore is only touched up slightly with digital manipulation. When things get crazy as time goes on, the film still finds ways to up the ante, and make it not so predictable as to who will survive and who won't.To compare this to the original Evil Dead is not appropriate, because other than the basic premise, this film finds it's own sense of style and execution. It certainly invites a sequel, but I have no great enthusiasm for an obligatory 13 sequel franchise to milk the concept beyond it's rate of return. So with a real budget I would guess near 25 million, there are thrills aplenty in this graphic and creepy franchise maker.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Opening Scenes in Horror,"The first 5 minutes of this movie is arguably the best opening scene in horror. Unexpected, witty, stunning, and gory, setting the vibe for the rest of the movie that follows.I am a huge fan of the original film, The Evil Dead (1981), and its sequel, Evil Dead II (1987), having gone to see the latter three times in the theater at the age of 12. That being said, I liked this reimagining better. The comedic element of the originals is mostly gone, but the wit and the horror remain.A cabin-in-the-woods trope with demonic possession turned up to eleven. Over-the-top even by Evil Dead standards. I took three different dates to see this movie when it came out and wound up marrying the one who liked it. Coincidence? Maybe. Awesome horror movie? Definitely.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not very scary but still enjoyed it,"I am a huge fan of the original films as i watched them as a kid and think Bruce Campbell is an absolute legend! I watched this 'remake' with an open mind and not expecting it to replace the original films. I have to say I enjoyed it, however it is not very scary. Very gory but all credit to the makers that they didn't use CGI everywhere and went for traditional effects. I think they could have done more to introduce suspense instead of going for the full on gore fest, but at the same time the characters are in a cabin being attacked by evil demons. I don't think they are popping round for tea and sandwiches and to ask nicely if they can have your soul! Im surprised at all of the bad reviews talking about the level of gore as when i have watched other films like Hostel and Saw I have found those to be totally over the top. I laughed a few times at this films level of violence and gore just as i did at the Evil Dead 2 so for me I think the makers of the film knew exactly what they were doing. I would be up for a sequel but maybe next time go more for the suspense and pull back a little on the violence...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Absolute gore fest unrelated to the original,"This seems to have little to do with the original other than the basic premises. Taking out the main hero might seems like a strange decision and I'm not sure it works all that well. It's not a bad movie it's just abit of an oddity. It's gorey, brutal and horrific. The work on the effects is stunning. The plot is simple and not overly intresting. The teen culture is cringey as with all these similar films. Its a gore fest that you might enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was Decent,"I didn't really like this one as much as the original 3, it just feels generic. The originals had a charm too them, but this one doesn't have that charm (and no it's not because Bruce Campbell isn't in it), so this gets a 6. It's just not as entertaining as the first ones. I know it's ment to be darker like the first one but that one is still iconic this one isn't, maybe when I watch it again in 5-8 years I'll like it, but for now it's just mid. It's not all cool and bad ass and gory like the first one, or dark and humerous and gory, like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. Just not my taste in movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

a blood fest with brains,"Yes, the new Evil Dead was a real blood fest with a believable storyline, good acting (Jane Levy is great!), a scary/disgusting ""villain"" and an astounding (!!!) soundtrack.As you probably already read, this is not a remake, but a new approach to the Evil Dead universe. It still has the main elements of the series but delivers a completely new story, new scares and winks at the audience a few times (specially old school fans), but not so much in comical way, like on the original movie.A special note on the powerful soundtrack: for me, it really made the difference in this movie, contributing to create some of the most nerve wrecking sequences I've seen in the past years. The final scenes will leave you grabbing your chair, while being beautiful to watch at the same time.This became one of my favorite horror movies of the decade (and I do enjoy the classics), so... give it a go. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I enjoyed this film, even though it's somewhat controversial among horror enthusiasts","I recently revisited The Evil Dead (2013) on Prime. The story revolves around a young woman who is recovering from recent drug struggles and joins her brother and friends on a camping trip. During their excursion, they stumble upon the necronomicon, also known as the Book of the Dead, and unwittingly recite its sacred words. What follows is a descent into a nightmarish horror that threatens to consume their souls.Directed by Fede Alvarez (Don't Breathe), this film features a cast of Shiloh Fernandez (Red Riding Hood), Jane Levy (Don't Breathe), Jessica Lucas (The Covenant), Elizabeth Blackmore (Skin Deep) and Lou Taylor Pucci (Moon Manner).I'll admit it: I enjoyed this film, even though it's somewhat controversial among fans. The movie excels in creating the right atmosphere and delivering an abundance of gore and blood splatter in all the right places. The intensity of the kill scenes are perfect. The opening father/daughter sequence sets the tone for the film and there's a legendary tongue sequence that's must see TV. The acting surpassed my expectations, with Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez delivering strong performances. However, I found some scenes relying too heavily on CGI, the iconic hand scene fell short compared to Evil Dead 2, and the Olivia character was annoying. Switching back to the positive notes, the film's ending was awesome and included some worthwhile twists.In conclusion, The Evil Dead (2013) faces more criticism than it deserves. If it weren't connected to the Evil Dead franchise, it would be recognized as a solid addition to the horror genre. I would rate this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it to horror enthusiasts.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as I had hoped.,This movie was entertaining enough for the most part but I felt it lacking overall but that may just be because I had heard about this movie about a year ago and I have been waiting ever since then so I was hoping for something really good that could have lowered my opinion of it.The first thing you will here people say is there is tons of gore. Now I don't know If I have became totally desensitized over the years from watching some of the disturbing movies I have watched but for me this movie was not that gory. It had a couple moments with some pretty intense gore but the scenes were very short. I fear that they had to cut many scenes out of it.Overall though despite the hype it was a decent movie. The acting was good for the most part and it did have some creepy moments in it however I think many of the creepy parts were cut out and toned down seeing how many of the parts in the red band trailer were not in the movie.Not as scary or as gory as I had hoped but I have seen every scary and disturbing movie out there so my opinion may not be valid as I don't get scared.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unworthy of the title Evil Dead,"Evil Dead? More like Abysmal Dead! Terrifying? No but the popcorn prices gave me a shock! This movie is shameful with no redeeming features of any kind. The original movies are superior in every way on a scale i can't even begin to describe. This utter pile of a movie is slow and disjointed, featuring a cast displaying little or no involvement in events going on around them. It lacks any kind of momentum or crescendo. The effects boil down to this - spooky contact lenses indicate the person has become evil. Low budget, low effort, low and behold once again we see a great opportunity for a remake turned into garbage. Avoid avoid avoid!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was never going to touch the original was it?!,"It was obvious that this remake of Evil Dead was never going to touch the sides of the original Sam Riami cult trilogy classic. Of course you can't replace ASH famously played by Bruce Campbell. Instead this is more blood, gore and serious. No funny moments like the original. At the moment in todays film world we are seeing tons of remakes... some do it better then others. I always try and watch a movie like this baring in mind there will be tons of people who have not even seen the original. Bare in mind the original Evil Dead would not get appreciated by modern day younger horror fans in my opinion. This is certainly a decent remake for modern day horror films and full of blood gore and jump out moments to keep a horror fans curiosity entertained so for that reason i give it a 6. Compared to the original though.... if you are a fan of the original Evil Dead then you will not enjoy this movie if you go in trying to compare it looking for a new ASH... hence the bad reviews on here.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible!,"I was very unhappy with this film. Rarely do I turn a movie off before it's finished, but less than an hour into it, and I was very bored with the plot & so grossed out with the excessive unnecessary gore. Thank goodness, I spent under one dollar to rent this! The beginning of the movie showed a HINT of maybe, possibly, a decent demon story, but I was wrong. Blood blood, blood, predictable horror movie clichés...It's just all wrong. Also, I didn't feel that any of the characters were well developed. I don't understand how this has such a high rating. I guess some of the early ratings & reviews must be fake.. As a horror movie lover , I feel it's my duty to warn others to NOT see this one. Bad Bad Bad!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Fun Movie, Yet Something's Missing","In the months leading up to the release of his Evil Dead remake, rookie feature director Fede Alvarez made some promises to the die-hard fans of Sam Raimi's cult trilogy. This would be a gory film with an unprecedented quantity of blood and several nods to original Evil Dead series, with no attempt to recreate scenes or characters from those films. On these promises, he and the producers of Evil Dead have delivered completely.The film plods along carefully without overtly stepping on the toes of those fans who have a special place in their hearts for such things as The Necronomicon, boomsticks, deadites, Bruce Campbell and soul-swallowing demons. While several distinct tributes are made using props and set pieces (cabin, Oldsmobile Delta, chainsaw, shotgun, cellar) and the camera work, this film has it's own direction and a completely different tone.This might be where Evil Dead begins to falter somewhat, as the previously employed fun and comical approach to the subject matter is discarded in favour of a more serious tone. Alvarez deliberately chose this strategy, maybe without realizing that a concept as goofy as the Evil Dead probably should not be taken seriously. There's something hilarious about a mischievous zombie giggling and scheming, but it's certainly not genuinely frightening, and this film's attempts to scare the audience are more often just silly.The faltering continued with characters in the film. The lovable hero Ash is replaced by a group of unlikeable nameless twenty-somethings with very few redeeming qualities. While the actors portray these forgettable characters well enough, there really isn't anyone to cheer for in Evil Dead - there's no villain, and no hero.That being said, it was a very gory film with some fun parts. So if you are looking for a bloody disgusting yet unintentionally goofy cheese-fest, you might like this flick. Or you could just go watch the far superior Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (1987).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
i liked it,OK to start off with I'm a big fan of evil dead 2 and army of darkness was OK. I was never that interested in the original evil dead seen it a couple of times and I'm just not interested.So if you haven't seen the original as a lot of people haven't you don't have to be to concerned about it not really having reference to it.To start with its a remake so its not gonna copy it shot for shot and yes the overall feel of the film is different but its 30 years newer.Its meant to be a lot more serious without the humour because its trying to cut the link with ash being as they are going to be making an army of darkness 2 then another serious one then apparently on film that joins the 2 story lines together so of course they cant copy the original film to heavy.Not the scariest film about made me jump a couple of times I wont add no spoilers. I found the 1st 3 paranormal activity films scary but i dint find the same things with this.There is a fair bit of gore init for no real reason then for shock value but if you've seen the saw films nothing new here.The characters are abit and get on your nerves abit especially when they do something stupid as they always do in films like these but the acting isn't bad overall.Im not concerned about a movie being art or the greatest actors in the world as long as they are better then the actors in silent hill revelations I'm happy. I don't go to the movies to watch stuff high rated stuff like the artist or the hunger games an well you get idea all these award winning films and critical acclaim i normally find abit crap except for say the LOTR films and some others.If like me you like to go to the movies for some entertainment and just wanna see a good horror movies with a few scares init go see this its not the greatest film ever made but its still well worth a watch and ill definitely get it on blu-ray.So yeah go watch it.Now.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but don't expect something better than the original,"In a nutshell its 'Good' and worth a watch, but do not watch it expecting more than the original.I often cringe when they make a remake of an excellent film as more so than not they are a flop.I did walk in with some level of expectations as i am a real fan of the original and i could not help but keep comparing it to the 80's version expecting similar scenes.Evil dead remake is not a complete replica of the original, in fact its a different story with similar key plot elements. This is a good thing and gives a fresh take on the story of Evil Dead.It's down falls ...Where the movie lacks is in the story, i saw many mistakes and goofs as some have pointed out and the characters were not believable enough. I will say they sure can take punishment from the dead thou. I also thought that that the movie lacked in the sound effects department and also there is no sound track to the movie. Evil dead lacks in building a scary environment, the original was good at this and if you have watched it the last 15 minutes is fantastic.It's high points ...Gore, gore, gore it goes without saying that if your looking for gore you have come to the right place, some scenes will make your butt cheeks clench and it is clear why it was given an R18+ rating.The special effects are great, the gore scenes are believable and it achieves to make the viewer react as they should if they were put into that situation.Conclusion ...Evil dead is worth watching, although you should watch it with less expectations to the original film. The gore and special effects is what makes up for the lack of storyline, half assed acting, mistakes and is why i have given it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Bad attempt to remake a classic. If you are expecting lot of blood , merciless killings and violence , you will not be disappointed","There different kind of horror films- one that scares you literally , one that thrills you with sudden twist in the end and then there are films which are meant to astonish you with gore violence and blood on the floor. Evil dead falls into the later category which has little substance but has more of slashing , spilling of blood like fountain.A group of friends visit a cabin in woods where they discover Book of Dead which unleashes evil when re-opened.A remake of Evil Dead with same name directed by Sam Raimi ( Spiderman series) , the new one falls flat on the surface. The movie begins with a witchcraft magic to kill the evil which is well crafted. However , there was not a genuine reason shown why people came down to the deep jungle as if was meant to take place. The movie is dedicated to all the slasher flicks with no actual stories and rely more on violence and blood. It is spooky at some point but has been elongated by few scenes. The good part is that it is gripping and you will not feel bore at any cost. Direction is decent. Screenplay is inefficient. Dialogues are good. Performance are nice by the lead star cast.Overall , bad attempt to remake a classic. If you are expecting lot of blood , merciless killings and violence , you will not be disappointed.

An Insult To a Cult Classic!,"First of all I want to Say This is my First Review at IMDb. As a Horror Film Buff for last 20 years (I am Now 29 :) I cannot bear the Insult This movie has done to the Original.I watched The Original Evil Dead In VHS when I was 8. It scarred my mind & gave me nightmares for at least 2 years. The total Atmosphere, Makeup, Gore, Violence,Special effects are Nihilistic & Disturbing. Even after 30 years in this age of HD & Blu-Rays its STILL give me creeps.But in this REMAKE I found the following points which made this a TOTAL GARBAGE & Waste of Time...1) No Build Up of Atmosphere OR Suspense. I know all of us know the Original story but you still have to make the atmosphere with creativity, SFX, Sound Effects etc which made the Original Truly Disturbing.2) Excessive USE of GORE. The original used gore with creativity but here we see Pool of blood, Shower of Blood etc. Also The Filthiness (like Green goo, Roaches coming out of Body etc) is MISSING in this Remake.3) Stupid Make-Up. The Original make up of Demons is 10x better than this remake. Considering 1981 with 2013 we expected far better make-up. Particularly The EYES of the Deads in the Original are Scary.4) Non-Likable Characters. There is No build-up of Characters which didn't help this movie. Also many of their acts are questionable & makes no Sense.we missed Bruce Campbell here.5)No ""Jump Out Of Your Seat"" Moments. The Original was full of Jumpy scenes which Torture your nerves & make you feel that you are nauseating. But Here you didn't EVEN find a SINGLE scene worth Mentioning.6) Horrible ending... In the Original you feel like The Devil want to eat you.. but here you got something which made you feel like you have been cheated!So as far as my opinion.. I gave this REMAKE 2/10 ONLY for the Effort. This will NEVER EVER will be a cult Classic like the Original.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
The bad reviews are due people who clearly do not understand horror unfortunately.,"I gave a fairly high rating because this film did a great job in mass advertising and had legitimate scary scenes. I will admit that they blew some of the scenes on the previews they've been showing for weeks prior to release which was a bummer to find out.If you're not an avid horror watcher then you will probably be disappointed with this film. It seems like people were expecting this to be the next coming of Exorcist proportions. Whether you liked that film or not it caused a huge sensor hip stir in many other countries, and scared audiences senseless.What the audience for Evil Dead 2013 is failing to understand is that is movie is very clearly an homage to the 81' Evil Dead. Hence the horribly cheesy semi offensive lines, super red corn syrupy blood and rather unbelievable plot. Jane Levys' acting as (Mia) is undeniably evil and scary. I think this movie set out to achieve what it intended which was to create a huge hype for an entertaining horror flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent!!!,"When I went to see it in a prescreening, I didn't expect much. Because for me the original is the best horrorpic so far.And it started off really badly, the dialog when they arrived at the cabin was so poor, even a soap opera would be ashamed of. The girl didn't look at all like a heroin addict and it was not believable, that they would stay in the cabin, coz a single nurse cant give the same medical treatment within a rotten cabin, as a whole hospital can.But from then on it was really quite a joyride. Even though I don't like splatter at all, and I had to cover my eyes a lot of times, it was one of the greatest horrorpics in years, right after ""Drag me to hell"", ""The skeleton key"" and ""The descent"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Evil Dead - An interesting re-imagining,"The Evil Dead, of course, needs no introduction. It was a infamous horror movie that sparked much controversy for its outlandish violence and gore. And not forgetting the famous tree rape scene which gained much attention.The movie gained cult status during the Video Revolution, even receiving the honour of becoming a ""Video-Nasty"" in the UK.Its low budget style, charming simplistic story, absurd gore, camp tone, not to mention publicity helped make it a horror classic that spawned two equally excellent sequelsIt also featured a young, then-unknown Bruce Campbell who would later go down in history as one of the best B-Movie actors of all time.So, it's no wonder why Fans were in such outrage and panic when they heard the terrifying news of a remake.Good news, The Evil Dead fans should fear not for as remakes of classic horror movies go, Evil Dead is actually very good.It's a refreshing, unique re-imagining of the groovy little gem.A more serious, darker toned film, that still keeps the over the top, ludicrous gore from the original.The serious tone helps create a more intense atmosphere. No fun goofy Evil Dead II goodness or the camp tone of the original here.The style of the film is very moody and very grim, creating a uneasy tension before the nightmare has even begun.The characters have a decent amount of depth, that little extra more than the original, but in movies like this, character is the last thing on many of the viewers minds.A genius move was the new characters, a perfect way to explore the new story without being bound to the original and no fear of annoying fans if there's a certain difference to their personality or a change in their fateI'm sure fans would have been outraged if the iconic Ash was portrayed in a different light and met a different fateNot to mention fans would always compare the new actors performance to the legendary Bruce CampbellSo it's a good thing they created new protagonists, no need to walk in its predecessors shadow in that light.That said, the movie tends to be held back at times, unable to reach brave new territory by the fact that it's a remake. It could have explored more back story of the Book of the Dead, explained its new origin, the new lore. Keep the basic premise but break away more from the traditions, did new, exciting things. Have more grotesque, imaginative scenes with the Deadites, push the boundaries of horror. It's 2013, they could have shown the most sickening, spine tingling, frightening things these monsters are capable of. The grisly end of the creatures could have spun heads.However, there are some very disturbing scenes that made me and many others in the audience cringe but they were no different from the dismemberment you'd see in the every day average torture porn movie or slasher.One thing that made the original so refreshing was it's bizarre gore sequences, that back then seemed so revolutionary.There weren't many horror movies where you witnesses a brutal slaying by an axe, or hand mutilation, or even impalement that resulted in Alien- Esq milk spurting.The remakes gore could have raised the bar for the generation of today like the first did for the generation of yesterday.A concept I found rather interesting was the main character Mia who is trying hard to go cold turkey in a desperate attempt to kick her drug addiction. A fresh take on the cliché: lets go to the deserted house or cabin in the woods, have a few beers, get laid and get killed by the madman, monster scenario that has been done to death, a cliché that was spoofed perfectly in 2011's The Cabin in the Woods.It added a new layer of depth for the characters, a drama that sadly never reaches its full potential, but what is shown is enough for this kind of movie.A daring and interesting direction the director should have went with was a psychological one, have a film that played on the idea of her withdrawal symptoms, made a story that toyed with the audience, made you wonder if the things she was seeing was really happening or all a delusion in her head.Have her fight her own personal demons, make the Deadites a representation of her struggles.Even be so daring to have had a twist where it all as a dream in the end, or to play it a little more safe, in a triumphant spiritual conclusion, shown that it was all real and that by conquering the Deadites, Mia had conquered her addiction.All interesting possibilities that are unfortunately never utilised. Once the madness of The Evil Dead begins, it enters demon slaying territory and stays firmly dug in there until the very end.The psychological aspects from the original is lacking here in the remake in favour for ultra violence and while that is a disappointment, lovers of gore SFX and buckets of fake blood will have a field day at the sinister delights that await them.The prosthetic effects are a nice change from the lazy, unconvincing CGI blood and gore that dominates practically all modern day movies.At the end, I found it leaving me feeling like they could have done a little more.All in all, it's a dark, trashy, over the top, ultra violent horror movie that is certainly not for the faint of heart.It's definitely worth checking out. For Evil Dead fans and gore hounds alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You all are going to die... op op op, Evil Dead style","The remake/sequel era continues. Will it ever end? Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, the Hills Have Eyes, are any horror franchises safe? With the latest remake opening today, is this the new normal and are we ever going to see original horror films again? The Evil Dead remake has a lot going against it. For one, it is a remake, and two, the original has such a strong cult following they are sure to cry foul no matter how good the film is. I loved the original, loved it, loved it, loved it and I was unsure about this release. This film actually was very entertaining and I took it for what it was - a horror remake. And based off of that criteria, it was an enjoyable, blood soaking movie that is better than the average horror flare. This movie has its flaws, which are many, but overall it was a good little horror film and will be in the top 5 for best horror in 2013.Some of the problems I had with it were that this time around, instead of having carefree kids go to a cabin for fun, we have a heroin addict trying to go cold turkey and under no circumstances will they leave the cabin. There is no reason why we need such character development in this type of film. All of the sudden, we know the back story of all of the characters whereas in the original you barely knew their names let alone their occupation, status, whether or not they where a drug addict or if they have abandonment issues. This type of character driven movie slowly takes away from what really is important, the deadites obviously.There are, however, cool self mutilation scenes, very cool kill scenes and a somewhat satisfying ending to the film, so it is not a totally drag. There is some CGI but not as much compared to others in the genre, which is a good thing because we can only take so much fake blood. CGI just looks cheap in other horror movies and really lessens the impact of the violent scene we are watching. And speaking about those violent scenes, they are really violent and it's nice to see the fake blood splash into the actors' faces rather than to digitalize the blood where it would look just like a cartoon.We have the burden of living in the Remake/Sequel Era of film and it sucks because instead of getting original material that could be mind blowing and would add a fresh new take of the genre we are left with these glossy, sharp looking remakes that just adds staleness to the genre. Why would they even remake Evil Dead anyway? It wasn't even that popular of a film, even its sequels were considered minor successes. The whole reason why Evil Dead struck such a cord with its audience is because it was so over the top. The axe chopping, the claymation foolery, the deadite eating off its own hand, these are the things that made the original awesome. While there are some scenes in the remake that do remind you of the original, the overall craziness factor seems to be missing. In the original trilogy, you couldn't guess what was going to happen next whereas in this remake, you didn't only guess, you knew what was going to happen. However there was a nice of enough twist at the end to remind us that there is some originality in this film to make it stand alone, standing alone 10 steps behind the original of course, but alone nonetheless. This movie was entertaining and it had a few jumps here and there but it is a remake and a remake has rarely ever been better then the original. But behind all of the glossy feel there is some fun to be had here. I recommend this film, especially for the people who haven't seen the original because their expectations wont be so high.For more reviews visit my Youtube channel Logan Toxic and visit my blog logantoxic.blogspot",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fan of originals, can't stand this one.","I am a fan of Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. I get them. Ash is a riot and a character with a lot of charm and theatrical winks to the camera. I'm writing this review because I can't stand thinking about other fans of the series of the movies that will be duped just like I was by the overall high score of the new Evil Dead movie and some of the glowing reviews.I feel like I should rate the movie a 1 instead of the 2 I gave it just to help balance out the people who are giving it a 10/10, etc. However, I didn't do that and instead gave it my honest ranking which is a 2 out of 10.This movie misses the point on several levels. Let me begin by stating that my impression is that the choice made in creating this movie was to try and ramp up the horror/gore while leaving out almost all of the dark comedy. However, the director has no idea how to make a horror movie or how to add tension. We sat in theater about to fall asleep because nothing was remotely believable, engaging or tense. Honestly, I'm not sure how you can have a film about a cabin in the woods and possession and stuff and not have some degree of tension innately present, but somehow this director pulled it off. There is gore and it caused some squeamish reactions in the audience, but the ONLY time I saw anyone actually jump was during a moment that was not actually scary, but rather a character moved quickly unexpectedly. I don't want to state more than that because I'm not out to ruin the movie for anyone who may be able to get a cheap thrill from it.You will not come away from having watched this movie with any favorable impressions about the actors. Mia strangely conjures the hollow actress of the Twilight movies to mind both in looks and acting capability many times during the movie. The other characters are extremely unmemorable. You'll not care when nasty things happen or as they do nasty things to others.I'm fine with Evil Dead being its own new thing, if it was a good movie in the process. This isn't. It feels like the director thought that buckets of gore and ripping things could make up for developing any tension, scrapping the comedy, having hollow characters with wooden actors and trying to spell everything out painfully to the audience. Even the good old evil book now has nice red scribblings in giant letters because it appears the director assumed the audience would be too stupid to figure out the book was bad news without it being written on it that it was in big red letters.This film might have worked going with the more horror and gore and stripping away the comedy of the originals. I can see that as a potentially successful path for a director to take, but you have to deliver on the horror, tension and dread for that path to succeed. That didn't happen in this movie.This film is stupid, it treats its audience like they are stupid too. This movie fails to scare, it fails to entertain, it fails to surprise, it fails to move anything forward, and I regret paying money to have seen it. It does a lot of the special effects better (which certainly wasn't hard to do) and has some more gross-out moments, but I don't think anyone going to see this film would have agreed to trade out the comedy of the originals for more minutes of mindless gore.If you're the type of person who realizes gore does not equal horror, skip this one. If you know who Ash is and know what a ""boomstick"" is, skip this one. If you're young and easily scared, maybe watch it. If you're a fan of mindless gore, maybe watch it.Fans of the original, be sure to watch after the credits. However, don't expect this small treat to do anything to make up for the movie you just sat through.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Trash,All gore and no substance. Whatever happened to something that made sense. This is utter trash and not worth the price of admission. The Executive producer may as well have put money in the street and watch it blow away. People who could use money and this guy pisses his money away on trash like this. Please get out of the movie business and send some of that money your losing on crap like this to people who could really use it. I think the Producer is the only Evil Dead thing about this Movie! I feel bad for the actors in this movie. No names from nowhere. Gore is not scary...and anyone who has seen The original Holloween can vouch for that! If you say Jamie Lee Curtis everyone knows her because the movie was credible. These actors will never be remembered cuz the movie wasn't credible. By the way who was in this movie?

"A promising horror remake which starts well, but eventually becomes mediocre","Evil Dead is another remake of a cult horror movie classic from the 1970's or 1980's. With the exception of a few, most of these remakes have not lived up to the high standards of the fans of the originals. Evil Dead however starts promising. While its story vastly differs from the original, it certainly offers an interesting setting with suspense thanks to the exiting prologue and the grim setting of Mia (Jane Levy) going cold turkey in a remote cabin. Since she failed in her previous attempt to quit drugs, her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is now present as well to support his sister and their friends. When David and his friends find the sealed Book of the Dead in the basement, they accidentally summon a demon which seems to possess them one by one until none of them will remain. As stated, this setting offers great potential. However, the quality of the film quickly starts to decline. There are plenty of scares and shocks throughout the movie, but they all feel too familiar and cliché. Evil Dead is nothing like its original counterpart. While that is not necessarily a bad thing, the remake quickly becomes a mediocre slasher movie. This is particularly disappointing since the original gained such popularity due to its original writing and excellent filming. Without spoiling too much: the ending is very disappointing and leaves you with a familiar disappointed feeling as with most of the recent horror movies from Hollywood. Nevertheless the film will keep you entertained if you are a fan of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A decent horror flick, but not a true Evil Dead movie","Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead ""remake"" is a decent horror flick in it's own merit, but really lacked the qualities that made the previous Evil Dead entries such classics. After hearing that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell themselves are producers, I had high hopes that this ""remake"" was going to be a ton of fun, just like the last entries in the series. Sadly, I was surprisingly disappointed as Evil Dead (2013) wasn't nearly as fun as it should've been. This entry in the franchise made the fatal mistake that all entries before it have managed to avoid. It made the mistake of taking itself seriously.This may seem like an odd complaint, but if you are a fan of the original Evil Dead films like I am, you must understand what I mean. The original films weren't full-on horror movies, but arguably the best horror-comedy films ever made. They perfectly blended wacky humor with low-budget, yet extremely graphic, special effects gore. This created one of the most unique horror experiences in history as it's cult status remains solidified to this day. Evil Dead (2013), however, decided to take an entirely different route and go with full-on horror with virtually no wacky humor. There was still plenty of awesome practical effects violence, but the lack of humor and lighthearted fun made this a disappointing, and frankly unnecessary, entry to the beloved series.Now it should be said that Evil Dead (2013) is certainly not for the faint of heart. It is by far the most brutally violent film I have ever seen. 90% of the violence in this film is practical effects, even further adding to the grueling and gut-churning ultra-violence. Despite it being incredibly sickening at times, it is truly impressive. The violence had a constant feeling of realism as all of the practical effects utilized are absolutely phenomenal. While it was, at times, shockingly graphic, I had a hard time looking away as the special effects work was so beautifully executed. Even the most bold and bombastic scenes of violence looked immensely realistic. I was very happy to see that Raimi and Campbell were sticking to the roots of their classic Evil Dead entries and fully realizing their potential for practical effects.While Evil Dead (2013) is incredibly violent, it doesn't maintain the originality that the earlier franchise entries set before it. Even with the impressive special effects, we only really have an average horror movie. Without the humor and goofy fun of the originals, there wasn't a lot interesting or unique about this remake. However, the final act of Evil Dead (2013) feels like a love-letter to all the fans as we are treated to one of the greatest sequences of the entire franchise, the rise of the Abomination.The Abomination itself sadly isn't too impressive as it mostly just looks like a slightly different standard Deadite. Despite the somewhat disappointing Abomination, this final set piece and grueling battle is such gleeful fun that it is reminiscent of the originals. Here we see what true Evil Dead is as the sky begins to rain buckets of blood and the Abomination rises from Hell. With mind-blowing amounts of blood drenching the landscape and the old cabin burning in the background, this final sequence is among my favorites of the entire series, all topped off with a goose-bump inducing visual of female Ash sending the Abomination back to Hell. It was hard not to smile when we finally got to see Raimi's and Campbell's full influence on the film.Overall, Evil Dead (2013) is a decent horror flick but it never earned the right to become a true Evil Dead movie. It lacked all the qualities that separates Evil Dead from every other horror film out there, making this ""remake"" pretty unnecessary. The practical effects where undoubtedly incredible, but it always took itself way too seriously, which is something a true Evil Dead film would never do. And sorry Ash, but that after-credits sequence didn't make me like this film any more, but rather made me want to watch the other ones instead, which is ultimately what I would recommend anyways.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bitterly Disappointed,"Whilst not a total waste of time this ""re-imagining"" of the original Evil Dead forgot one very basic and very important ingredient, FUN.It's not a fun night at the movies. In fact it's depressing with thinly drawn characters and some homages to the original. The problem with doing homages to the original is that it instantly allows the viewer to cast their minds back to that nostalgically and instantly forget what you're watching.The film has no heart, no soul, like a MacDonald's cheeseburger it may be edible but there's nothing but garbage hidden under layers of mean spirited gore. The only time this remake comes anywhere close to the original in terms of getting the tone of the film correct, is in its climax, which is reasonably well executed.As for the rest of the imagery in this film it's nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before, including all the spine twisting, neck cracking, obscenity spouting possessed women from any number of recent efforts. To re-iterate this isn't bad, it's just dead on arrival and frankly, quite boring.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suprised Kind Of.,"I have not seen the original. I stumbled upon this and for a possession movie, it was pretty good. Comparing it to The Conjuring, REC Insidious, this movie tops over them without a doubt.Sure I can rail how the plot is thin as it is, however, what keeps this movie going is the constant action that goes on. There's something about this flick that I really enjoyed. I was never really bored, however, what could be made this movie even better was better writing.There are many plot holes in this flick, like: Why did they go here instantly instead of bringing her to the hospital? Why did 3 innocent lives go over a sister of another character? Why did the main character take duct tape and tape his girlfriend's hand that she cut off?It's that kind of non-existent logic that breaks this movie and lowers its quality. However, I have to mention that Gore in this is amazing. If you liked Inside and Grotesque, this is in your boat. Tons of Gore here, and very well-made gore.The jumpscares are also for the most part pretty well made. However, except for Mia and the guy with glasses, nobody else is really likable, especially Mia's brother that is probably the most unlikeable character of the bunch.However, there's just some charm in this movie, that keeps you looped in, and even tho the story is shaky, the movie plot is thin as it is, and our characters aren't developed a lot, it's still pretty fun movie to watch.Another problem I had with this movie is the way the eyes have been done when Mia, and others are demonized. The eyes look really out of place. I think if the eyes were completely black it would be much more disturbing than what was here honestly.Anyway. Gore-wise, effects-wise, acting-wise, camera lighting-wise. Yes, go check this thing out. However, the plot is questionable, and I did not really care much for our characters, however, it was still a fun watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""This time, the only @#$%ing way is the hard way!""","Over 30 years after the original ""The Evil Dead"" first started to earn its place in horror cinema, co-writer / director Fede Alvarez and company brought this reimagining to the big screen. While it's safe to say that their hearts were in the right place, this 21st century version just does not have the impact of the original.The story is somewhat similar to the one concocted by Sam Raimi back in the early 1980s. A quintet of none-too-bright young people gather at a remote family cabin deep in the woods. The variation on the story this time around is that four of the kids are concerned about their friend Mia (Jane Levy), a habitual junkie, and are doing everything that they can to help her. But when the characters discover the type of ancient artifacts in horror movies that we know people shouldn't mess with, one of them, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) reads through the book, not realizing what he's doing. The demons in the woods are then free to possess these hapless schmucks.While Raimis' film was played straight (and commendably so) by its cast, it had a decidedly more playful edge to it. It wasn't about wallowing in unpleasantness so much as it was just about having some fun. This version is far more glum, and almost humourless. Some horror fans may appreciate a genre film that lives up to the word ""horror"", but it's simply a little too hard to care much about these characters. When they buy the farm in glorious, savage ways, one cheers basically because they're tired of spending time with these people.""The Evil Dead"" '13 pays homage to the original in certain ways: the ""Force"" P.o.V., the damned Book of the Dead, the necklace, the vegetation that comes to life, etc. But Alvarez and company don't come up with anything truly interesting of their own that they can add to this formula. But at least horror lovers who measure a films' success depending on the amount of its gore will be VERY happy here; once this flick gets going, it's just a non-stop onslaught of violence and sadism.The cast isn't as memorable, for sure. Shiloh Fernandez is not too bad an actor, but he just doesn't have the charisma of B movie icon Bruce Campbell. Levy gives it her all as the victimized Mia. Pucci is saddled with the task of providing all the exposition that he can derive from the Book.For the faithful, and those who are willing to sit through the end credits, will be rewarded with a cameo by a familiar face.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just another Horror movie to avoid,"**Spoilers included if you wanted to see this garbage** Evil Dead Review: How was this movie rated so highly? Why would the ""father"" in the beginning wrap the book in a garbage bag and leave it there on a table after he ""cleansed"" his daughter? To maintain it? If he was the one who wrote all the stuff in the book, then wouldn't he of known to hide it? or perhaps bury it so people wouldn't find it? So other people wouldn't have to go through what he did. Apart from all the obvious idiot things people did in that movie; go in the basement even after they all knew Mia was possessed. How did the hatch to the basement open up after it was shut then Mia was saying she was ""locked"" down there when she wasn't. How was the blonde girl able to escape after going to the basement and being locked up from the guy simply opening the hatch? The nail gun the movie wasn't connected to anything and yet it was able to fire off nails into the people, on a note with that. Nail guns can't be used to shoot people as projectiles, even if they (she) had a second arm to hold down the safety. If this was their Grandparents/Parents place (indicated with the family pictures hung up there) then why was those whole ordeal never spoken of? Seriously? Burnt you're aunt/Mother, and nothing was said. Now I could get over that part. But what I don't understand is the ""cleansing"" part where you could bury them and they would be demon free to say the least. Why don't you bury them and then dig them back up quickly? Ta Da! Sister saved. Also Why was the long haired male in the movie not infected? I assure you that the glass used to stab him was definitely covered in blood, which would make him infected. Another huge flaw in this, at the very beginning when the long haired male says the first word (in order to summon the creature) it summons it. I know out of 7 billion people in the world, someone would of said word that in that span. At the very end, when Mia is safe and ""resurrected"" all her skin and wounds are magically healed? I never knew if you had a demon released from you then you magically get healed. I think doctors might want to look into this treatment.Moral of the story; Don't be a junky or else you'll get demon creatures from hell which will possess you first. Because every demon from hell knows, junkies are the best to go after.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing Re-make,"This is hands down one of my favourite re-imaginings. Five friends hit the old cabin in the woods hard in this one. There to help one of them detox, however after some ill advised reading from the necronomicon found in the cellar and an unfortunate assault by a coniferous tree, all hell breaks loose. This brings some serious gore and overall creepiness and dread. Jane Levy is fantastic in the lead. A gore lovers slickly wet dream. Hadn't rewatched this in a long time. Very solid sequel/remake to Sam Raimi's Classic Evil Dead film. It's a very enjoyable film with many refrences and eastereggs to the original and a unique combination plot of Evil Dead 1&2 with new characters that expanded the plot story and more power and expansion of use of the Necronomicon then the past films. The combination of the both original films gives this remake it's own stand alone film that makes it a little original. One the flaws I had with this film is the run time. The film felt rushed with all the bloody events happening all at once but it was nice for the film to go stright to the gore but at least with a little more character development and characteristics to the Necronomicon and connect the events that had happened in the past. Overall it is a solid remake/sequel to the Evil Dead Franchise with some flaws but a well entertaining film for all fans to enjoy with the rain of blood.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A remake that isn't a remake.,"It's funny: this movie is a remake from the original Evil Dead from 1981, but it also isn't a remake.The original Evil Dead trilogy are classics. We can't touch that. Classics are ""unreviewable"". When a movie falls into that cult territory, you can't review it anymore: it's a classic. Same situation would be to review Mr. Romero's ""of the Dead"" series. They are all classics, with their faults, but they are classics. At least, they are watchable at its finest.I first was introduced to this movie as it being a remake from the original Evil Dead (1981 - ""ED-81"", for short); and I watched it expecting that. Oh, boy...When it ended, I was like: ""what the... did I just watch!?"". It's a mess! Iconical character Ash was absent, though David is the modern impersonation of Ash; the plot is similar to the original ED-81 with some modifications; remarkable scenes from ED-81 was absent as well. Basically, I'd go on saying that they remade the ED-81 focusing only on the gore and graphical part and, at the end, they put some dark humor onto it and thought it was OK. I was in shock!Then I did some digging. I found out that this is, indeed, a ""remake"" of the ED-81, but it's also a new entry to the Evil Dead series! It's as if they used the same plot with some slight modifications from the ED-81, but the events happens canonical to the Evil Dead series, meaning that, though the things happening to the characters from this movie are pretty much the same that happened to the ones in ED-81, this is a whole new event that's happening, adding to the series storyline. Whoah..!Funny, right? Why not make a whole new movie instead!? Money is the answer. They knew people who are familiar to the series would go crazy to watch this.Overall, I think the movie was OK. It's kinda confusing to figure what they were thinking: they entered a serious road, focusing on the horror aspect, but then, at the end, they went down the dark comedy section, similar to the ED-81 take -- but you can't forget this isn't just a remake, it's like this is Evil Dead 3 (Army of Darkness is a different approach). Messy... messy...Newcomers will get entertained, I think. It's the same old horror stuff. Veterans might get kinda mad, I don't know. I think they could've done a whole brand new entry to the series, not a ""remake"" of the ED-81 but also adding to the series storyline. That's convoluted.Watch it at your own risk.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
When oh when will they learn.,"I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers. Being a huge fan of the original ""The Evil Dead"", i was very disappointed with this one. Though not surprised, i went into it not expecting much, and i got it. Even thought the original was cheesy and goofy at times, this is what made it such a great movie. And at least we had a story and explanation of what was happening. In this shoddy remake we don't really get any idea what was going on until the credits, where we get the recording from the original movie. Why did they not put that at the start of the movie, viewers would have had a better understanding of the movie then.Again Hollywood has tried to cash in on movie by remaking it.

Very worthy,"I've been anticipating this film for a very, very long time. I read the script a month before its release date, not being able to help it. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy, and the trailers for this were absolutely amazing. Then when it came out and many seemed to have almost passionless responses to it (including may critics) my expectations lowered a bit. The film basically hit my lower expectations, if maybe not quite hitting them.Some of the dialogue here is clunky, especially the first time we meet the core five. It feels like necessary on-the-nose exposition. But still, I got over it. I want to say that I definitely did like this, but there's just something creatively missing in all of its execution. Truth be told, I expected some truly amazing horror pieces when I read the script, but if anything Alvarez never really goes all the way. I don't want to say much of it feels half-baked because I liked it a lot more than simply giving it that description, but I think much of it holds back. And maybe it's because of the pre-release talk of it being outrageously gory and brutal, but while there's definitely a lot of it to be found, it just never really has a truly effective impact.Again, always being disappointed with hugely anticipated films makes me come off a lot more critical, but I definitely did like this. It's completely entertaining, and while it's true that the brutality doesn't make as much of an impact as I wish, it's still pretty great to experience. The make-up here is amazing and the effort pays off, and the cinematography is quite brilliant, especially notable for a mainstream horror like this. The acting is hit-or-miss. Fernandez has a huge task and while he's never outright bad, he also doesn't have much screen presence and comes off bored. Blackmore as his girlfriend is easily the weakest of the cast and I think it's good that her character is very under-developed and has limited screen time before her craziness starts. Jessica Lucas is quite good in her small screen time, but the two who really make an impact are (unsurprisingly, since that's what consensus says) Pucci and Levy. The former is quite a hoot and he does his character more than enough justice, making up in charisma what Fernandez lacks. Levy is the star here and she delivers a truly chilling performance, completely believable in all aspects. She hits all of her notes with ease and while this is the first time I've seen her in anything, I'm already a fan.There's definite craziness and horror goodness here to satisfy many people. While it's true that my expectations were too high and it just hurts the film when it doesn't reach them, this is definitely still better than what horror remakes tend to be and it stands on its own as not just a mere remake. I also want to note that I was pleasantly surprised by the film's humor. It definitely doesn't really take itself too seriously and there's a sense of goofiness that comes with it (which is pretty much why the original managed to be funny and as the decades have passed has been lumped into being a horror/comedy when it actually never was).",,Anonymous,Horror

A group of friends head to a remote cabin where the discovery of a Book of the Dead unwittingly summon up dormant demons which possess the youngsters one by one.,"Being quite a fan of the first three ""Evil Dead"" films, it easily became apparent to me how frustratingly different this version was. But let's stray from that path of depression 'cause the truth is, if this was a horror film without having a cult classic descendant, it is arguably a good film. It has the goodness that makes a conventional horror film work: it's dark, gory, creepy and at times compelling.Just like ""The Evil Dead,"" this version is heavy on brutality, blood and gore, which was all-the-way efficient. It also has the irony of it when there's a scene in the film where it actually rains with blood. It easily reminds of how much of an explosive bloodbath this franchise has been especially the first and original film. Where tons of blood gets splashed all over someone's face not to mention the extreme violence which consists of dismemberment, decapitation, hacking, smashing and all of its gory variations. It's so over-the- top that you're more likely love it than hate it and might even get you laughing hard at one point.The film has a strikingly sharp and stylish look. It automatically builds a dark and creepy atmosphere. Unlike the original, the film takes place during a wet rainy season in what seem like a dead swamp with a connection road filled with water and completely dysfunctional when the tide peaks. The old, dusty cabin has a look that is entirely creepy and that visual feeling that something reeks in it. The woods are entirely covered with fog and filled with dead trees and mud. All that elements perfectly create a threatening and unsettling atmosphere that fits well in the film. It makes the exterior shots look remarkable and just appropriate to build a dark creeping terror. The make-up and special effects of the film were just excellent. The make-up effects combined with CGI for touch-ups to impress an improved look that on the possessed characters leave an edge of authenticity. Its special effects also, in every form of its gruesome employment, have weight and texture that its look on- screen is effectively translated.""Evil Dead,"" in my opinion delivers the goods but not in the same category its previous films were known for. The previous ""Evil Dead films"" are geniuses in giving utter satisfaction, those rare horror films that managed to harmoniously blend humor, gore and scares into one package. There are flaws and it's kinda amateurish and cheap to look at but that's all part of the charm. The new version, however took a different path, being darker and more ingeniously violent and graphic with an odd mood of sadness. Well, what's done's been done and my final say is that this film is good just how conventional horror films could be. It's not exactly the type that would follow a cult sensation like its predecessors but it's an honorable tribute rather. It's a stylish and striking exposition of gore, violence, creep and atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

""Most shocking ... bla, bla, bla"", OK, I don't care for the stunts the marketing guys try to pull off.After 30 minutes I thought: ""Hmm, when does it start?"" After 60 minutes I thought: ""Let's hope for the best ..."" After 90 minutes I thought: ""Damn, what a waste."" I wasn't shocked, I was as bored as watching a commercial for a hardware store. Hammer, nails, chainsaw - you name it, they are all in there. What else? Characters I did not care for, gore that was gore for gore's sake, a funny demon straight from The Ring and annoying music.No jokes, no over-the-top-humor, no fast pace action, nothing evil.Sorry, Mr. Raimi, I cannot believe you liked that movie.Next time, let Peter Jackson do a low budget remake.

A Splatter House Fun Fest,"I'm not one for remakes of classic horror films. I despised the Dawn of the Dead reboot and the slew of other horrid abominations to cinema that have followed in the wake of awful remakes that seem to be the poison of Hollywood these days; however, this was a most pleasant surprise. I will give nothing away as I feel this is a horror film that must be seen. Does it capture the magic of the original? Maybe not as The Evil Dead is one of my all-time favorite films and nothing can quite compare to the grueling and disturbing masterpiece given us by Sam Raimi all those years ago. Does it bring anything new or exciting to the table? You bet it does! This was a film exceeded in its gore factor only by the unsettling atmosphere of the movie. It's obscene, depraved, dark, and filled with violent delight. I was expecting the worst and found myself enthralled and appalled and ultimately so glad that I bought tickets. If you enjoy horror flicks as much as I do then nothing should stop you from seeing Evil Dead. Despite the poor user reviews I've seen this was a true feat of horror filmmaking at its goriest glory.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grossly disappointing,"If there was a moment of wit or humor in this film, I missed it. Perhaps it occurred while I took a restroom break for a minute or two.In 1981, when the theme of a group of youngsters imperiled in a deserted location was by no means new, Sam Raimi created The Evil Dead, and the film obviously did not take itself too seriously. In my estimation, Raimi was not attempting to one-up George Romero's Night of The Living Dead. Do I think The Evil Dead was intended to be taken as basically a horror film? No. Not at all. In 1981, Raimi took what was already a cliché in horror films, and made what is mostly a parody of such films. Yet the genius in the film is that Raimi's film could be enjoyed as a horror film by anyone unaware of what Raimi was doing. (Unlike the ""Scary Movie"" films, obviously intended as parody.)This film was promoted as being a remake of the 1981 film. If the creators of Evil Dead (2013) think their film is a remake of Raimi's, I can only say that they are probably one of those unaware of what Raimi was doing in 1981.This film--depressingly unfunny, and incessantly gross and unpleasant. How do we distinguish it from any of the dozens of other similar unfunny and gross ""horror"" films being released? Well, perhaps because this one did not go straight to video, though don't ask me why.So, if you are expecting a remake of the 1981 film, generally similar to the original, you should plan to be disappointed. If you don't have any idea of the 1981 film, and you are entertained by unfunny, gross and unpleasant horror films, you will love this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Sacramento Evil Dead,"As a loyal Evil Dead fan I was a little disappointed with some of the alterations to the Original's most acclaimed scenes. But once again Rami's signature blunt absurdity gave this movie a clever wit of its own. The frustrating stupidity of the characters that can obviously only end badly somehow manages to nicely spark a natural curiosity to see the next sudden scare. The new Evil Dead is extremely gory, definitely scary and very creepy. The well done graphic images are hard to forget and likely to give nightmares. As far as horror movies go I think the new rendition stands on its own merit. And it had to at the advanced screening in Sacramento when the studio surprised the excited fans by announcing that they would be giving away special Evil Dead t-shirts for the premier. But then when they brought them out silently walked past those fans all the way to the back of the line and began handing them to people just arriving and then each person starting from the back of the line.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A quite shiny turd,"Remakes are per definition turds no one should watch really. No point in making a movie again that was good to begin with. What's the point? I do however support ""remakes"" if the director intents to use the basic story into a different film altogether. I had NO hopes for ""Evil Dead"", and my expectations were lower than low. I actually tend to boycott remakes, and I never pay to watch them.But you see, what Fede Alvarez did here, was to take the basic plot and make the horror horrifying and chose to leave out the comedy and charm of the original. I must say, it works VERY well indeed. The first half of the movie is truly terrifying and creepy, and although it does work all the way through, the last half tends to lean to the pacing of mainstream Hollywood horror. But it never falls flat and it never gets boring. Alvarez even succeeds in using what made the original a trailblazer - the energetic cinematic brilliance, the panoramic shots and the ooze of dark terror and panic in the ambient atmosphere, all of which makes you think of the Sam Raimis and Peter Jacksons of yesteryear.It's just about impossible to make the same impact on horror audience here some 30 years later, but Alvarez just about nailed if if you ask me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hail to the king baby!,"Remakes are a sensitive subject in cinema. There are camps of fans that will be excited to see a favorite story of theirs remade or re-imagined. Then there are camps of fans that will decry even the idea of their favorite film being remade, heralding the death and ruination of the original. Both sides are equally justified in their arguments, as once an audience sees a film it ceases to merely be a product of the production team. Ownership passes to the audience as the movie is experienced, and as such they are entitled to feel possessive. Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is one such movie that has amassed a cult following in the 30 some odd years since its release, and feelings have been mixed since it was announced that it would be remade. The director was an unknown, the cast was a mixed bag of TV and indie film faces, and there was a decidedly large absence of Bruce Campbell. All of the ingredients were in place for this film to fail, and fail miserably. Trust me when I say that all of your worries are completely unfounded, and within your darkened theater, you have everything to fear.The frame of the original's minimal story is present but embellished a bit to provide some weight for the characters. The five friends are at the cabin to help Mia (Jane Levy) detox from heroin cold turkey. Accompanying her are her friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), her estranged brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). There is some past history between the group involving the siblings strained relationship with their parents and each other, as well as some stress between David and the others after he skipped town. There is also a little prologue that opens the movie that gives a little background on what's happening for those unfamiliar with the overall story that also sets the tone of what's to come. These elements that make up the first act yield mixed results, and are honestly the weakest parts of the movie. The story and relationships are decent enough to get you invested in the primary characters but the rest are clearly established as demon fodder. The detox is also a realistic enough narrative ploy to keep them in the cabin until it's too late because, as we all know, heroin addicts will do anything to score another fix. The beginnings of Mia's possession are attributed to her sober manipulations to get back to humanity, so the weight of the situation doesn't hit the group until it's too late.Once everything kicks into gear in the second act, Evil Dead proves that it belongs among the masterworks of the horror genre. It is a triumph of suspense, gore, and jump out of your seat scares, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time. Fede Alvarez has the same keen eye for atmosphere and lighting that Raimi exhibited in the original, and for every genre convention that he breezes through he immediately sets a new standard for horror films to come. The amount of dismemberment and brutality on display are felt and experienced with every fiber of being thanks to some impressive makeup and effects. Something worth noting is that the effects Alvarez utilizes are almost entirely practical, leaving distracting CGI at the wayside. He's also smart enough to know that the best horror films are built like roller coasters and that you have to allow for moments of levity to lift some of the suspense. It is darkly hilarious at times and it's this sense of humor that is one of the greatest assets it carries over from the original, while not necessarily to the same degree.Evil Dead pays its dues to its predecessor in the ways a remake should in the first two acts, and does a damn good job of it. But just when you think it's about to get wholly predictable, Alvarez kicks it into overdrive and flips the whole movie on its head. The finale is unpredictable, ruthless, and visceral to a degree that I didn't think the movie was capable of achieving. Horror films have a notable tendency to fizzle as ideas run dry in the third act, but Alvarez saves the best for last. Truthfully, it's one of the most satisfying and intense horror climaxes in decades.If you're not a fan of the original, or the genre in general, then Evil Dead won't change your mind. It's not going to be a crossover hit that draws in the crowd outside of the one it's catered to. Also, there are some genre rules that are diligently followed, thanks to its tie to the original, which may seem hokey or weird to a modern audience. For fans of the campy cult classic they grew up with, Alvarez's Evil Dead is the realization of an impressive vision of horror approved of by both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, and that should be all the encouragement you need to see this movie. For those that might still be on the fence, I'm here to tell you Evil Dead is well worth your money. It is everything you want from the established series and then some. By the end you will have laughed, cringed, shrieked, and cheered for the rebirth of a franchise that has been buried in the woods for far too long. Hail to the king baby!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Thoroughly good movie, but very disappointing ending. 7/10","This remake of the old classic ""Evil Dead"" is definitely one of the better horror movies I have seen. The setting is generally very fitting for this gory, dark and twisted horror movie.Fede Alvarez definitely deserves credit for creating a so tense atmosphere in this movie that constantly reminds you of the isolation these people are trapped within. The movie goes to great length to show that there is no actual escape, and as the events escalate, the only option left is to fight.Evil Dead is a somewhat short movie, running for about 80 minutes. This fits the movie just fine though, as it is a pretty fast-paced film that will not let you be bored for a second. However the ending gets dragged out way to far, as the movie had several opportunities to end in a very decent manner but instead chooses to drag out into some far too confusing and unimpressive scenes. I do not know whether they chose to add these extra scenes because the movie was simply to short without it, or if they really found the plot ending better in that matter. Either way the last 10 minutes of the movie is pretty much the worst, and are generally unnecessary for the movie to come to an end.Evil Dead really scores its point in the ""villain"" of the film. This supernatural demonic creature, is incredibly well done. While not exactly being super scary, it just completely suits ones expectations of a demonic creature engulfing in a human body. It is very different from ""The exorcist"" style of possession, and honestly. I prefer it this way. The whole set definitely deserves props for this amazing hostile entity.As for the characters of the movie, they are unfortunately pretty matching for what you would expect of a newer horror movie. They are overly skeptical, illogical egoistic, cowardly and sometimes just plain dumb. There are a few cases where the characters breaks these horrible bonds of indecency and show some actual courage/some sign of intelligence, but generally they are very disappointing and predictableWhy should you watch this movie? Evil Dead does not hold back on anything. It refuses to cut off anything and shows you the raw (fictional) reality of dealing with a greater evil. It is a very gory movie, but does for the most parts not exaggerate the bloodiness, so it really makes you wish you had not started watching this movie, but without making you feel like you should throw up. While Evil dead is definitely not the goriest horror out there, it is not for the weak-hearted. So if you have trouble with blood, needless or small isolated rooms, then this movie is not for you.Helix' Horrible Reviews",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Because of course i thought there might be a 5 percent chance of it being watchable. I was dead wrong! Blood, more blood, and more. apparently 70,000 gallons of fake blood was used in this movie. If i would have known that before going into the movie i would have stopped and turned away immediately. Nothing in this movie spooked me several times like the original movie did. I'm quite sure Bruce Campbell shook his head several times at this absolute mess of a movie remake too.

"It wasn't that bad, it was quite good actually.","I watched this movie with very low expectations since most people gave it horrible reviews. I have never seen the original title so I'm not going to compare the two films. The movie escalated pretty quickly which annoyed me at first but it sort of fast forwarded the cliché scenes that you see in every horror title these days so that turned out to be a good thing actually. The first half of the movie is average at best but the second half is the game changer it keeps throwing plot twists at you even though they're predictable yet just when you think that this is going to be the end, you're faced with another twist,I really wished they did not include the final scene/twist though. I wished that they told us more about the characters only interesting character was David , i really did not care at all about the others, would've helped the story a lot if they told us more about him but what they tell you about him is enough. A lot of people are complaining about having ""Too much blood"" in this movie, people it's a SLASHER of course it's going to have a lot of blood in it, although i must agree some scenes were disgusting and i don't mean that in a good way. the rest of the movie is pretty good actually it's not going to be a classic but it delivers good stuff.

The Vidiot Reviews,"Evil DeadWhen reading the Book of the Dead it's probably not a good idea to lick your finger before turning the page.Mind you, the pages of the tome in this horror movie shouldn't be turned at all.David (Shiloh Fernandez), his girlfriend (Elizabeth Blackmore) and their friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas) arrive at the isolated cabin where they will assist with his drug-addled sister Mia's (Jane Levy) withdrawal.In the basement of the cottage, Eric unearths a barbed wire bound book that he liberates from its bindings and reads.His words invoke a demon that takes possession of Mia and threatens the lives of the others in the cabin.A re-make of The Evil Dead, this contemporary take has the production value to amp up the gore but not the scares to surpass its ancestor.Besides, books in the wild should only be used to start campfires.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Casey's Movie Mania: EVIL DEAD (2013),"A horror fan's wet dream in term of its graphic violence and excessive gore display, but EVIL DEAD suffers from weak script and mostly forgettable characters.Okay, if you ask any die-hard horror fans out there, you can bet your answer that the 1983's THE EVIL DEAD was one of the holy grail of all horror genres ever made. So naturally, when the filmmakers first announced the remake was greenlit, (everybody) are skeptical about the result. But before you cried blasphemy, Fede Alvarez's EVIL DEAD remake is surprisingly effective horror movie that will pleased (most) of the original fans as well as newcomers.First-time feature director Fede Alvarez knows well that a great horror movie doesn't rely on extensive CGI when comes to gore and violence. So what you get here instead is a great deal of practical special and make-up effects that guarantees to make you twitchy or shocked in either ways. Nevertheless all the technical credits are top-notch. As a lead character Mia, Jane Levy delivers an engaging performance worthy of mention here.Despite its added ""Mia-has-to-overcome-her-heroin habit"" angle, it's a shame that the plot doesn't scratch beyond its surface once the real horror kicks in. Apart from Mia, the rest of the supporting actors are mostly caricatures while Alvarez's choice to play his remake all dead serious rather than the uniquely campy tone set originally by Sam Raimi, is sometimes too depressing for its own good.The new EVIL DEAD may not have lived up to Sam Raimi's iconic original as well as his 1987 sequel, but at least this is one of the rare horror remakes that doesn't feel like an overrated, cheap knockoff.http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/04/evil-dead-2013.html",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brutal, ferociously entertaining and insanely over-the-top, 2013's ""Evil Dead"" remake is good, old-fashioned gory horror done right!","Director/Co-Writer Fede Alvarez and producers Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell have done it. They have accomplished the impossible.They have, in 2013, made a horror remake/reboot that was actually good. Actually startling. Actually worthwhile.In an age of horrid Platinum Dunes reboots, watered-down PG-13 horror, and awful direct-to-video gore-fests, Fede Alvarez's ""Evil Dead"" is a breath of fresh, blood-fueled air, filled with dozens of callbacks to the original series and enough internal originality to make it worth a watch for any fan of the original trilogy and any fan of extreme horror.Four friends gather at a secluded cabin deep in the woods to help their friend Mia battle her addiction to dope. Among them are Mia's brother David, David's girlfriend Natalie, David's former friend Eric and Olivia. They have decided to band together to help Mia quit cold turkey after an OD left her legally dead before paramedics were able to revive her.However, after investigating a mysterious, derelict basement filled with animal carcasses, the five find a mysterious book- bound in flesh. Eric reads passages from the book, unleashing a demonic force that takes hold of Mia and begins to spread throughout the rest of the group, turning them into violent, zombie-like cretins that will stop at nothing to destroy every single one of them.This is, without a doubt, ""Evil Dead"" all the way.The acting is actually admirable for a horror film. Jane Levy as Mia steals the show, both in her performance as human Mia, a sad soul going through withdrawal from drugs, and as the possessed-Mia, an insane, twitching ""Deadite"" who is a ton of fun to watch. Shiloh Fernandez as her brother is also well-played, giving a lot of emotion and becoming a begrudging hero-figure throughout the course of the film. Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore round out the group in performances that are decent, but nothing to write home about. (Although this is mainly due to the script, which focuses mainly on Mia and David's relationship as siblings.)And the script itself is fundamentally solid. It does dwell a bit before the horror kicks in, but unlike some of the more negative reviews suggest, it gives all the characters motivation and development, and creates a good framing for the events to unfold. I really have to disagree with many people who complain about there being no character development or story- there most certainly is character development and there most certainly is a story here.The film does take liberties and make changes to the formula, but it's all for the better here. It throws fans familiar to the series curve-balls, and leaves us unable to know what to expect next, which is a good thing. It also builds towards a more natural and fitting climax than the original film, and the stakes feel higher than before.Alvarez's direction is top-notch. Everything is shot brutally and simply, with a lot of little winks and nods to Sam Raimi's style in the original. I also applaud Alvarez on not over-doing the gritty ""shaky cam"" style of camera-work that has been plaguing horror for the past decade. You know what I mean- that faux-realistic look where everything is shot in shaky hand-held in closeup. Alvarez does use hand-held footage, but for the most part, is able to use it wisely and to add to the chaos, rather than distract from it like most films.The horror and gore is also outstanding. Some have been complaining about the level of gore in the film, but this is ""Evil Dead."" The original was extremely gory for it's time, and this film had to step it up. And it did. This is one of the goriest wide-releases I've ever seen. From dismemberment's to burns to slices to mutilations, this film really pushes the boundaries of it's R-rating. And I'm glad it did, because it captured not only the desperation of the situation, but at times it also hinted at the camp value of Raimi's original. I was shocked that a few scenes were left intact. And the film is all the more ferociously entertaining for pushing these bounds.This is, without a doubt, the best horror remake since Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" or Carpenter's ""The Thing."" The original film is still objectively a little bit better because of it's purity and low-budget charm... but this comes close. Very close. And it's still darned good fun.This is brutal, insane, over-the-top fun. Best horror movie experience this year, and one of the best of the decade. Ignore the nay-sayers. If you love insane, over-the-top madness, this is the film for you. ""Evil Dead"" gets a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is an hugely entertaining and quite frankly hardcore gore horror that is completely captivating and achieves everything that a modern horror should.

Overall it was quite a ride.Bad: Quite a few loopholes in the script. Some of the things didn't make much sense. I feel like they could bother some people while others can look past it.Final thought: Difference in taste of movies and styles within them make this movie 50/50. Some love it some hate it.

honest review from horror fan,Thank Heavens a traditional rated R horror movie. Currently the horror genre turned into the Suspense genre which relies on Shock & sudden scares from being nervous. I personally hate suspense being that its for 13 yr old. This movie wastes no time in letting the viewer know what is happening and what will happen. There is no mystery or questions everything is straight forward. The action is traditional and leaves you mostly satisfied without questions about loop holes in the plot. The only complaint is that I'm not a big fan on possessions but this movie did a very good job. I hope this movie will be a stepping stone for Horror movies to get away from Suspense & back to what it use to be with Physical Horror not talking & mystery.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More blood than the original, may or may not work for you","First, I shall say this right off the bat, I enjoyed the original a bit more. This is mainly due to the fact I love watching Bruce Campbell in anything. As I was watching this film, I could not help myself but ask, ""What would Ash do?"" That being said, I thought they did a good job with the remake and it was not to far off the original. The plot was different enough to keep me wondering what was going to happen, but it paid homages to the original. It did subtract a few laughs, but it did add a lot of blood and gore. Though, I do not remember the original Evil Dead having to many laughs. I remember it being more of a straight horror film, it was really the two sequels where large additions of comedy were added. So why I keep reading reviews saying this one subtracted the laughs had me a bit confused as the original Evil Dead to me was a straight horror too.The story has the same premise of friends going to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. However, the reasons for them being there are quite different, as this is no relaxing getaway. Instead, it is a trip to help a young lady detox and get over a substance abuse problem. There is something in the basement though, as a ceremony took place there. A book is also found there and one of the friends, for some unexplained reason, really has to find out what the book is saying and he accidentally releases a force that will possess and tear apart the group of friends in most brutal fashion. At first, they think the young lady is going through withdrawals as she is attacked trying to get out of the woods, but they soon realize there is something evil at play here.The rehab part of the story works as there is no way anyone was going to the cabin they featured here for a pleasant stay. Most would have left after what they saw in the basement, but they were trying to help their friend. The gore was ramped up in this film, making it one of the more gory films I have ever seen on the big screen. I have seen worse though on DVD. This film relied a lot on tension, too as I was never quite sure how things were going to play out. All in all, they did a good job of making a different film, but still in the spirit of the original. They paid homage to the original by having the camera moving through the forest as an unseen force, there was a scene that was like the tree seen from the original and near the end it paid a bit more homage to the second film with a chainsaw.So a good horror film, for me anyway. I have heard many people say they enjoyed the film. However, I have heard others who did not care for it much. Just depends on your tastes. I like gore and blood and such...add to that a supernatural presence and you are most likely going to have a film I am going to enjoy to some degree. Others though may simply think the film was a bit too brutal, or gory just for the sake of thrills and the story was lacking. I can see this too, as the behavior of the David character at times had me nearly yelling at the screen! So I enjoyed it, mainly for the bloody romp it was. The gore effects were way beyond the original film, making my girlfriend avert her eyes through most of the kills and attacks. Still, though I think the original is the better film. I kept thinking, ""Ash would have had this wrapped up by now."" It was also nice in this one that if computer generated graphics were used, they were not apparent. So, I enjoyed this film and the original. In the end, though, it was nice being able to watch a horror movie like this in the theaters for me. I like a bloody gory film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I am justified in giving this a 5. Here's Why!,"My friend and I have been waiting for this movie for so long; we haven't seen the original, no, so this review in no way applies to the initial film or the storyline within that.I was just like, ""eh."" That was the problem. My friend and I went in there ready to be terrified and screaming, but really there was nothing to scream at! It was definitely one of the most disgusting things either of us have ever seen - that goes without saying. But as far as scare tactics, I'm not sure where the critics are getting the feeling that it's ""redesigning the horror genre.""Jane Levy, for one, was awesome. I believed every aspect of her story - possessed and not - from beginning to end. She really is on the rise. Lou Taylor Pucci comes in a distant second; at least he understands what it means to ""feel"" scared rather than ""appear scared."" Lucas, Blackmore, and Fernandez, however, each failed in some respect to deliver what was needed to be believable. If a girl, who is close to you, is cutting through her tongue in front of your face, don't you think you'd be doing a little more than breathing somewhat heavily and staring?The last 10 minutes were by far the scariest. No spoilers here, but at least there was some edgy music and intense visuals to make it ""scary"" rather than ""gory."" Realism was also something that was unexpectedly found in this movie; every character had pretty good reason to do certain things or act certain ways, and each actor showed effort. Not all succeeded.That's why I gave it a 5. Trust me: I have been waiting for this for months and honestly wanted so badly to run into my house when I get home, shaking, giving this film a 10 and rave reviews. I really did. Sometimes, though, too high of expectations lead to too much leeway for disappointment, and this was one of those times.Go ahead - see it for yourself! It had it's moments. But as far as the critics reviews go, there's too much hype. Definitely worth watching for Levy's stunning performance, but not if you're waiting for pop-ups or heart wrenching scares. You'll be sick from this movie before you're trembling from this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Disgusting, Gory, & Completely Unapologetic","Fans of this type of horror movie should be very excited. This movie is a class-A remake and fantastic update of a cult-classic.Those of you who have seen the original know that the film is known for several things. Absolute carnage and a unique development. This reboot of the classic franchise isn't short on either. From the very beginning, the viewer isn't quite sure where the movie is heading. The opening scene (and several afterward) leave you wondering if this is going to be another remake that doesn't take enough chances to stand on it's own, or if it's another that strays too far without finding any common ground with fans of the original. This film walks that line wonderfully.Now, if you aren't a lover of horror films of all types, you may or may not enjoy this movie. It's disgusting, gory, and completely unapologetic. That isn't all this remake of the 1981 classic has to offer though. The story is going to be something you've never quite seen before in a big-budget motion picture. Not only that, but it sneaks into the film in a very clever way, making everything that happens in the first 40 minutes or so decently believable, yet horrifically unreal. The character development isn't exactly golden, but is definitely above the standard set by the reincarnations of other hit horror films. The acting is sometimes fantastic, sometimes only average, and sometimes a little lacking. It should not distract from the gross imagery, but the dialogue at times can come off as a little awkward for modern audiences.As an avid horror fan and a pretty big fan of the original Evil Dead movie, I can say without any doubts or reservations, that this movie is by far the best remake of a horror film this generation has seen to date. Enjoy it for what it is, not what you want it to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More is more!,"Another day, another remake and yet another of modern ""horror"" movies that follow the same pattern that excessively showing more blood, more gore and more torture porn is definitely more frightening, what happened to less is more? Raimi's original film is not more scary but it has its personal charm that makes it stand out, whereas now horror movies are being churned out like some heavily chemical processed food, no soul to it.I miss when movies actually provoke and shock your audience without all the mess but I guess no one wants to mess with a winning formula, the public likes it and I guess that matters most in the end, right? Despite all that, I don't think this is the worst movies I've ever seen but I really wish the genre can move on from this, I don't this to be the standard 10, 20 years from now, we can do so much better.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Have you even seen the original??,"My goodness people. Have you even seen the original before posting reviews about what this movie should have been?? You are saying it was just mindless violence. Thats what it was supposed to b. Not some extreme storyline looking for Academy Awards. It was made to be an extremely bloody movie and so it was. The originals were rated nc-17 and even ""x"" for violence!!! people open your damn eyes up and see what this movie was made to be!

Mediocre Horror Film with a Legendary Title,"Evil Dead was a mediocre horror film sporting a legendary title. Legions of fan-boys demanded, hallucinated, or expected a remake of The Evil Dead. I, admittedly, have a hint of the The Evil Dead fanboyism in my veins; I admired the low-budget efforts of the original, reveled in dark horror / comedy of the second, and was amused by Army of Darkness.I was immediately disheartened with the character development of the film. Character development in horror movies shouldn't extend much beyond examining a characters reactions to horrific events. Learning about childhood memories, lost lovers, dead parents simply warns us that someone is going to die. The original Evil Dead developed a slow yet ever constant feeling of unease; you felt as if someone was about to snap at any moment. The remake conveniently uses the excuse of drug withdrawal to force the kids to remain at the cabin despite strange things happening. Then, suddenly, bam! Possession! People are hacking each other to bits.The attention to gore and brutal scenes were a hallmark of the original, but it was well-prefaced with foreboding and unease. I found myself having little compassion for the characters and was unfazed by the sudden emergence of self-mutilation and violent possessions.Admittedly, the movie lost me after Mia was buried. Her return and defeat of the risen one found me out of believability. Obviously, this movie isn't realistic, but a dual syringe cattle-prod defibrillator revive-o-matic with car battery? When she rose I hoped she was still possessed. Also, the hippy-stoner who wasn't high and had an odd interest in the occult was just a little off-putting.I enjoyed the setting in the woods. I enjoyed the painful, brutal scenes for their reminders of the original. I didn't enjoy the new characters, the plot hook, nor the pacing of the movie. Bruce Campbell's 'Groovy' was my favorite part of the movie. 6.0 of 10.0.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Horror Film In Years!,"A lot of you older guys out there that remember the Evil Dead films from the 80's might not enjoy this film as well as I did. I have seen the original films and thought they were pretty corny to be honest. I mean they were scary when I was a kid but I can barely watch them now as an adult. Most of that is due to the special effects that they used in those days. Obviously the technology used in the films from 80's has greatly improved in the 2000 era. The 2013 Evil Dead is probably the best remake of a movie I have seen in years. The story line has changed a little but it works in the film's favor. This film exceeded my expectations unlike remakes of the past{Example: The Wolfman (2010), A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010)}. However, this film takes a fairly realistic perspective and is very gory. If you easily get nightmare then this movie is not for you. I gave this film a ten simply because it's one of the best remakes I've seen and it is one of the few films out there that is good and gory at the same time, which seems to be rare now days.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Gruesome, gore-drenched remake","Gruesome, gore-drenched remake of the 1981 film, again has a group of five youths stranded at a remote cabin. After ignorantly reading from a book of the dead, bound in human flesh, which does not burn in fire, evil forces are raised, which possess and kill as many of them as it can. Hot little Mia (Jane Levy) realises something is amiss early on and tries to warn them, but is not believed, the rest think it is just the effects of her withdrawal.Our protagonists all seem immune to multiple attacks, gunshot wounds, nail gun attacks, limbs being hacked and ripped and sliced off, tongues sliced in half, even syringes almost piercing their eyes, and tree branches crawling into Mia's vag- they seem pretty much indefatigable themselves. This blood-raining flick has plenty of gore to spare, and some effectively cringe-inducing shocks, but not enough humour to balance out the shocks, which weighs the film down, and seems to make it drag a bit.The road being washed out confusingly seems to turn the film (or at least that particular segment of it) it a nature-runs-amok movie, instead of horror. Are we to be concerned with the demonic forces raised, or with the weather? When, at the film's climax, a torrential downpour of blood begins, it appears as though the filmmakers were not exactly sure.It is a good film, a decent enough remake, overall, but nothing spectacular, and hardly ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience.""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A movie full of gore rather than thrills,"I am a fun of horror remakes strangely, I enjoyed Halloween and Nightmare on elms street almost to near perfection , the Evil Dead was em was just Okay-ish! It had a good metascore of 7.2 from IMDb so I knew it was worth seeing , which it wasn't frankly. The plot has been done many times over and over since its original so you would have that deja vu cliché feeling hanging around you. The story line in the beginning was not so clear but it made up for it with its superficial gore that kept me tuned whilst it sent some shrills down my spine. The dismemberment of the limbs was a little ""SAW"" in nature but that was just that.The movie certainly has its flaws which are:1) There is no build up to the suspense ,everything that happens just happens ( I am not going into detail without giving much spoilers).2) The movie apart from its gore is not scary (I thought this was a horror movie not a slasher thriller)3) I expected some twists and surprises which came only at the end and that was poorly done.4)Too much emphasis on the evil book.In all I will give this movie a 6/10,its not a good movie but neither a horrendous one , I will say wait till it comes out on Netflix/Lovefilm or DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Girl From Hell,"My film review is on the movie ""The Evil Dead"" (2013). It is a horror film that starts out with a young girl Mia, (Jane Levy) that is addicted to heroin. Her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and their 3 friends take her to their parent's cabin so she can detox. She swears up and down to never touch the drug again and dumps it down a well. When she starts detoxing, she goes crazy and starts hearing voices and steals her brother's car and tries to go home. She ends up crashing and at that point one of the friends, Eric (Lou Pucci), finds a book and reads a passage in it. He ends up waking up a demon that possesses Mia when she's running through the woods. They end up finding her and take her back to the cabin. When Mia gets possessed she starts killing each and every one of her friends saving the brother for last all because in the book the demon needs five pure souls to bring his own corpse up from hell.I believe that the director's intention was to provide a movie with not only a subtle plot scheme but also the most gore ever seen in one movie. This movie makes the blood spilling in Kill Bill look like someone got a paper cut. Fede Alvarez is the director and I think he did an excellent job at creating the gore affect. Some might say if was a little over dramatic and the actors reaction to their limbs and stuff getting cut off was a little less than someone would react to in reality. I mean Eric was one of the last guys to die and he was shot and shot with a nail gun and beaten by a crow bar and he still didn't die.My overall opinion on the movie would be an 8 out of 10 the plot and acting was a little weak but the gore and demon affect was spot on. I especially like the special effects they did with the demon and the eyes of the people that were possessed. They turned a hazel looking color which made the watcher know for sure that the characters were possessed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great remake, prefer the original though...","I think It was a great remake. Most Hollywood horror flick now tend to show a ""realistic"" point of view in horror movies these days and usually It makes the movie more frightening and for this movie they showed a more intimate version of the characters. For example, the story introduces ""Mia"", a drug addict who is struggling to stop his addiction who had to take care of his mother while the brother David was not there.The movie has a LOT more gore in it, way more than the original, maybe too much. What I would have love to see is a more psychological approach, horror that keep messing with your mind instead of having all the blood and guts splattered over the screen which don't leave much for the imagination. It was entertaining but not that much scary, only disgusting... I think the original movie had this creepy ""old movie"" feeling that we didn't have in the new version...But overall i'm giving it a 7, entertaining, good movie, better than a lot of horror movies out there, worth to see if you don't mind gore",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally a remake worthy of the original!!!,"After years of remakes of classic horror and cult movies, this one finally does it right. The classic still stands the test of time but this one can do what no other horror film has been able to do in years...actually be scary. Modern technology has enabled Hollywood to add some terrific special effects with lots of gore and violence. Beyond the gore and violence the story is pretty much the same. This time the hero is a heroine which actually plays better in my opinion. Fans of the original Sam Raimi film will not be disappointed. He was afterall, one of the producers on the film. Stay tuned after the credits for Ash fans!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as expected...,"It has been just a few hours since I watched ""Evil Dead"" at theater and I thought of leaving a review about the film or not as I read many misleading reviews of the users about the films on internet. Thus, I d like to state that my personal thoughts on the film should not change your mind not to see it at theater.First of all, I can say that I am a fan of horror films and I have a film collection with more than 750 digital video discs, I must confess that my expectation from re-made ""Evil Dead"" was very high, I was looking forward to seeing it very much.When I watched the ""Evil Dead"" of Sam Raimi (1981), I was a teenager and I liked the film so much, I still think that Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" is one of the best horror cults. However, re-made ""Evil Dead"" of Fede Alvarez, compared with its older version was not that good according to me.1. When you watch a re-made film, you often remember the original first version and compare with it. When Evil Dead of Sam Raimi was on theaters in early 80's, it looked very different from other horror films with its unusual script and very fantastic make up according to 80's.2. As you saw the original first version, you almost know the whole story and you can even guess surprises if the re-made one has. This is an other reason that new version doesn't make the same effect that the old one did.3. Cinematography of ""Evil Dead"" is fine. Fede Alvarez gives good signs that he has a great potential. However, what I don't understand is why producers and film makers think that people will think it is a good horror film when they see more blood and more cut organs in that film. So, does it mean ""the more blood and cut organ, the more horror""? I don't think so. It doesn't fear you, it just makes you disgusted. The blood used in old version is just in the way it should be, but it is exaggerated in new version.4. There are some points that I don't like about the developing of the story. In new version, there is an opening scene that shows what the book of the dead is and what will happen. I think this opening scene destroys the mystery of the story. Sam Raimi didn't use such opening scene, in old version the guys find a tape and listen to the record of the man who examined the book of the dead and free the evil. This makes us curious about what happened to the man who saved his voice.5. The idea of developing the story on Mia, the girl addicted to drugs and the reason they don't leave the cabin due to this (they come to the cabin to help Mia give up) is not that creative. The old version didn't need such excuse, the evil, itself doesn't allow them to leave the cabin in old version.6. In old version, the forest rapes the woman and i think it was an unforgettable scene. This part of the film is not as successful as old version.7. What made me laugh while watching the film is the brother (David) of Mia still thinks that the reason of the change in her body can be a disease, virus, although he witnessed such paranormal activities. I cant stop saying to myself in that part; ""Man, cant you see her eyes and cant you hear her voice?"" Even though the whole story is not logical and this is a horror film, you want to see some little logic in such stories.8. Also, at the end of the film, dead Mia comes back to life and gives a last fight against ""the bad"" and it makes the film more banal. The film looks like its end will never come, it will last and last.9. What happens in the film happens step by step (page by page) according to the book of the dead, this is a difference from the old version. The old version deals with the situation more than the book of the dead after everything starts.10. As a result, I do respect all the efforts given for re-making of ""Evil Dead"" even I think that the vote over 7 is high. I can say that the performance of the crew, especially Jane Levy (Mia) is good. If you are a horror film fan, you will probably like it. It takes 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A Brutal, Visceral Modern Vision of the Cult Favorite","This is the part where I make the most obsessive of fans' stomachs churn: I didn't hate the new EVIL DEAD. Not only did I not hate it, I actually had fun with it. It's no masterpiece and it doesn't come close to the level of Sam Raimi's original cult favorite, but it's good enough for what it is. Let's face it: remakes are the current go-to cash grab in Hollywood and just about every film you've ever loved is probably going to be rebooted, remade, reimagined, etc. at some point in the near future. EVIL DEAD might be a popular example as to a property that didn't need modernization, but I believe it to be a lot better than most people give it credit. There are a lot of, admittedly, viable complaints about the new movie but, if you can overlook some of it's problems, there is some awesome stuff here. The movie is an all-too-familiar premise: five friends are secluding themselves away in the woods in a long-abandoned cabin. As opposed to the average 'cabin-in-the-woods' horror movie, these friends have a purpose behind their visit besides boozing and debauchery: David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his friends have gathered for his sister Mia (Jane Levy) to help her kick a nasty heroin habit. They've brought her out to the woods, away from temptation and escape, to help her get clean. The cabin belongs to their family but they haven't used it in a while, and it's since been used for other sinister purposes. In the basement, sitting among the remains of some bizarre occult ritual, the friends discover a flesh-bound book wrapped in barbed wire and unleash an ancient evil with their meddling.Before I explain why I don't hate this movie, let me clarify that, yes, I have seen the original EVIL DEAD movies but it's been over ten years. I don't own them in my collection, not because I don't want to, but because I'm a sucker for the best edition of a movie on DVD with the most in-depth special features and the EVIL DEAD movies have about three billion different DVD editions and each has their own separate group of special features. When attempting to decide which edition was best, my brain shut down from all the input and I just gave up. Maybe some dayFor starters, I love the look and feel of this movie. It's gritty and gloomy, the woods are constantly fogged over and give the cabin an even more remote feeling. This place truly feels like it's own little world and there is no escape when the evil forces join the fun. It's isolated and claustrophobic. Then there's the fact that everything in this movie has a grimy feel. Everything seems wet and dirty, and the colors are pretty muted with the whole movie having a very neutral tone with the exception of the color red. It seems to me the filmmakers really wanted the red here to pop. There's so many earth tones, blacks, and grays that the blood gets an extra visual bang when it explodes on the screen. And explode it does because this movie is easily one of the most brutally violent I've seen in a good long time. Maybe this is because I'm not the biggest horror fan but my experience with modern horror movies is limited to some smaller indie shockers and horror anthologies. EVIL DEAD is incredibly graphic and people with a weaker stomach might want to just skip it. I've got an iron stomach for movie gore but I'll admit there were a few moments in this movie that had me cringing. Dismemberments, immolation, blood, vomit, carvings, and on and on. There should be enough here to satisfy gore hounds, but I need a bit more than that to really dig a movie.My problem with horror movies, and I've mentioned this in other comments on here, is that there's little focus on character development because we know as an audience going in that most of these characters are just there to die gruesome deaths. No sense in giving a character more personality than your average archetype if you're just going to disembowel them a half hour into the film, right? Well, that makes for boring times whenever there's a lull in the action because I don't care what the characters have to say. At least the characters in EVIL DEAD are fleshed out enough to give them a little purpose. We learn about David and Mia and their tormented histories. Olivia (Jessica Lucas) is some sort of nurse, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) is a high school teacher, and both come in handy a bit with their fun in the cabin. Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) is nothing more than David's girlfriend and serves no purpose other than a wicked little throwback to the original film with the help of an electric carving knife. I'm not saying these characters are well-written, flesh and bloodbut we know a little about them, they're distinct personalities (except for Natalie), and they contribute a little to the film.Still, above-average horror film characters and enough blood and guts to open a hot dog factory are not enough for me to find more than a passing interest in the movie and, for the first two thirds of the film or so, I wasn't all that impressed. I was entertained enough but I wasn't wow'd. But then we came to the final act. The movie fooled with about an hour in when it seemed everything was wrapping up and coming to a close. I was disappointed and ready to write this movie off as throwaway entertainmentbut then, the movie kicks into overdrive and takes a sudden left turn into CrazyTown. I'm not going to spoil anything here about the end but it was so over-the-top that it saved my opinion of the movie at the last minute.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Remake that doesn't quite make the cut,"There are two things for certain regarding the 2013 remake of 1981's The Evil Dead. First, the film's advertising tagline ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience."" is, not surprisingly, a lie. Second, if you have no tolerance for blood, gore and accompanying viscera, then you would do well to avoid Evil Dead. That being said, Evil Dead is not a horror film to be trifled with, that's for sure, although while it has it's moments of unease and shock, the underlying sense of terror and suspense is largely missing. Evil Dead is designed as an endurance test, can you make it past the next major set piece without turning it off, and on that front Evil Dead certainly makes an impression.Five friends, Mia (Jane Levy), her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Eric (Lou Pucci) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) are at David's family cabin in the woods to engage in an intervention for Mia who is a recovering heroin addict. In the basement of the cabin, the group discovers a book that is full of satanic imagery and Eric reads a passage from the book, resulting in demon spirits being unleashed. The spirits possess Mia and one by one the possession begins to spread to the others who then engage in attempts to dispatch the still human survivors in rather violent, gruesome ways. Trapped by a washed out bridge, the group must try to find a way to stop the onslaught from the possessed souls, even as their number dwindles.The original Evil Dead has earned a place in the popular zeitgeist, partially for introducing the character of Ash, portrayed by Bruce Campbell, to the general American audience, and for spawning a number of increasingly comedy oriented sequels. But, it's easy to forget that the first Evil Dead was largely a straightforward horror film, and a fairly scary one, in my opinion. There is certainly no trace of goofiness in the remake. It is a solid, no holds barred serious horror film, although there is a moment or two that does elicit a chuckle every now and then. Directed by first time filmmaker Fede Alvarez and co-written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, Evil Dead pulls no punches in it's attempts to shock. From copious vomiting, people being attacked by nail guns, crow bars, shards of mirror and various electrical power tools, Evil Dead is intent on pushing the envelope of violence, leaving no stone unturned in its search for gory scenes intended to test the audience's willingness to keep watching.However, the reliance on violence proves one of the film's downfalls. It is so wrapped up in assaulting us with its gore that it doesn't put enough effort into the other elements of what makes a good horror film, such as suspense. Evil Dead isn't without it's moments of making us feel uncomfortable or uncertain of what comes next, but those are fewer and far between than the gore. Evil Dead is trying to make us feel terrified, but it succeeds more often in just making us feel uncomfortable as limbs and other body parts are hacked off.This remake does not directly rehash characters from the original film and manages to provide a slightly different setup for the story. The character of Mia takes on an unusual position of serving as, at times, both protagonist and antagonist, being both the lead character and the first to be possessed by the demon's of the title. By introducing the plot thread that Mia is a recovering heroin addict going through withdrawal, the screenplay attempts to play with the idea that the things Mia sees at first are all in her head, but that is quickly dropped because you can only explain so much from the concept that she is going through a bad withdrawal, and speaking in demonic voices and causing your housemates to start slicing off their own flesh doesn't really fall into that category. Lead actress Jane Levy provides a good performance as Mia, both as the tortured former addict trying to get herself clean, and then as the chilling demonic version, taunting the others both physically and verbally. Shiloh Fernandez is solid as her brother, trying to make sense of the world that is rapid crashing around him as strange things keep happening. Lou Pucci gives a bit of comic relief and also serves as the film's token ""geek"" who seems to be the only one understanding what is going on and coming up with answers on how to escape. The other two female roles are fairly underdeveloped and the characters fail to register much with us.Evil Dead missteps in it's last act, with an ending that fails to really provide any significant payoff to what has come before and that also seems to be something of a head scratcher in terms of the film's internal logic. Needless to say, being a remake of a horror film that launched a franchise, there is room left open for a sequel (look, its the Evil Dead, you can more or less count on them being available for another round, right). So, when all is said and done, is this Evil Dead remake successful? Yes and no. The filmmakers were certainly trying their best to take the series back to its horror roots, and if you are looking for a hard core gore fest, you can't do much better than this. Where Evil Dead falls a bit flat is in making the whole experience scary and affecting. It gives it a shot, but doesn't quite grasp the brass ring. You can do worse for remakes, but you can also do better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad but lacked the intrigue of the original.,"Hmmm, where to start, this film isn't really even a remake, not in my book. It has a few references if you know where to look and it tries to have the suspenseful and foreboding atmosphere of the original but lets go of the scares too quickly and plunges straight into a gorefest. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it just doesn't have the imagination of the original. It has the blood and gore down, there are some real nice wince inducing moments, but the real horror isn't in the gore it's in the other elements which make a truly frightening horror film. The psychological fear of the unknown menace, keeping the original characters isolated in the woods is gone. However this is replaced by gore and bodily punishment, of which the characters seem to shrug off with relative ease, lessening the horror and desensitizing the audience to the carnage on screen. All in all a good but not great horror film. It had the shock factor but not enough of the ""originals"" terror. Maybe the director tried a little too hard to out-do instead of re-do and missed a few of the important aspects which made ""The Evil Dead"" a cult classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie, But a long shot compared to the Original","I would have to say just like Rob Zombie tried to remake Carpenter's Halloween movies, Alvarez had to compete with The God Raimi's Original Evil Dead (1981). I liked the effort and effects put into this movie to give you that scent and taste it had something to do with Evil Dead. That it was in the same ballpark. The death scenes were epic enough, but I didn't get the Oatmeal and maggots hand made gore I was hoping for. A lot of CGI and special effects with changing camera views. I think they did a really good job when it came to the Gore. I also thought the acting was pretty good for a group of amateur actors. They kept the plot simple, and nailed it on the head when it came to things like the soul taker's point of view camera angels where I could tell the opening scene from the air was similar to the ones in the Original when they were driving in. I felt some comedy when the possessed girls were talking. All in all I think they did a really great job going off the Original, but it's nothing really I expected. More of a modern new age Evil Dead. No cons really I caught myself asking how could you be so dumb? The door blew open and your sisters voice changed and wind slamming the doors open and shut yet you think your sister is sick and needs to go to the hospital. What about the hanging dead cats in the basement and witchcraft, could it possibly be that? 6/10 Good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Looking to finally get their friend Mia (Levy) off of drugs for good a group of friends head out to a remote cabin in the woods for the weekend. A gross smell leads them to a room full of dead animals and a strange book. While investigating the book one of the friends unknowingly unleashes an unspeakable horror on all of them. It has been a long time (around 15 years) since I have seen the original trilogy. From what I remember the first two were OK but the third one, Army Of Darkness, is one of the funniest movies ever. There were a few call back scenes to the original in this and from what I remember this is a little better, but still really nothing but gore and blood. There is a few scary parts in this, but with all the gore and blood it distracts from the overall horror aspect I was going for. To me when you just slice up people that is not horror. Other then that though I do have to say that this is a rare remake that is just about as good as the original. Overall, horror fans will love this, I thought it was just too much gore for it to really be scary. I give it a B-.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film didn't have a single point of comedy in it..,"A trademark and main distinctive feature of Evil Dead is the dark comedy and jokes/ catchy one liners. This element was completely cut from the film.If a film maker is going to change one of the fundamental points of a film they should just use a different name for the film. Instead they cash in on a previous franchises success by suckers Evil Dead fans in to paying to watch the film which ISN'T EVIL DEAD. Sure location and back story/ the general idea is the same but it barely even fits in the same genre... this was a gore horror... the original was SO much more.I was that disappointed I almost couldn't be bothered writing a review... but after the credits came the biggest bird flipping of them all from the man himself. And it's the reason I came on here to add to the many voices of discontent. It's as if the makers of the film thought ""hahahah, and at the end... right after the credits... just to rub it in the faces of all the original fans who wasted their money on a cash-in insultingly bad copy of a beloved franchise... we'll do this! arghahaha""Fede Alvarez, I am now on a life long boycott of your films.

I found the movie very enjoyable to watch,"We have a girl. A girl with an addiction to drugs. Mia (Jane Levy) decides to better herself and quit her addiction cold turkey. With the help of her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and her friends, she is determined to get through the withdrawal process once and for all. They choose a remote cabin deep in the woods with no outside influence to help Mia recover. While cleaning up the cabin, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), one of Mia's friends, finds a book and decides to read it. Not knowing the evil he is about to unleash, Eric reads the book out loud. The fight for survival now begins.Not really sure where to take this one. I am kinda of on the fence. Director Fede Alvarez teeter totters from a brilliant really dark horror movie to an average film. I believe if he would have stayed on track with the way the movie started out and focused on the darker side of evil, he would have had a masterpiece.The character development was sparse. We picked up bits and pieces about the characters as the movie went on but nothing that really impacted how the story was told. Even with the lack of background, the actors did very well. Their reactions to what transpired were very believable and true. Shiloh Fernandez could have played a stronger character. He lacked the take charge attitude a lead actor should have and kind of got lost in with the others at times but overall they all did decent.Any GORE fans out there? Well we have some gore for you! Minus one scene, Fede Alvarez kept the gore coming. He was able to throw more and more gore into this movie without making it a grind-house featurette. It was very well done, believable and as tasteful as gore can get.I also want to give credit to the entire makeup department. I absolutely loved the disfigurements they came up with and were able to put together. The cuts, bruises, missing limbs and hacked-up faces were outstanding looking. I am looking forward to the special features on Blu-ray for this.I did not compare any part of this to the original Evil Dead as I believe every movie should have a fair shake. I found the movie very enjoyable to watch. The way the demon plays with the characters and unique gore scenes are a huge draw. What the movie lacks in story and guidance, it makes up for in cinematography and good ole fashion gore.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't give up on it if you didn't like the original. It's way better to me.,"When I first heard of the remake I thought it would completely suck. I really don't like the original. I'm not into older films in general but in my opinion it was just weird and rather a sick kind of funny than a shocking Horror. A lack of great visuals really disturbed me there. Next to the rather stupid story. Of course it wasn't going to beat the visuals of the remake as there's simply more possible in film and costumes/make-up nowadays. Also the funniest thing is that you can't get the original here - until today. It's simply not being sold since it got taken from the market back then. A joke to me, there's way more shocking stuff out there. And the remake is out here. Just funny.Back to the actual film: the first trailer had me. Though the original wasn't for me I thought it seemed quite well done. As a Horror fan that's definitely enough to make me want to see it.Overall I liked it way more than the original. They created a better storyline around the strange happenings which was kind of missing in the original. Some things like the rain towards the end was a great idea to me. That was really something. Just to mention a few things without giving anything away.I still can't rate this as a 10 - it was not shocking, rather sick minded and brutal. I know a Horror can be that but you're promised a shocker and it just isn't. Im comparison to other films, a 6-7 would be appropriate to me so I'll make it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you love to watch a movie that makes sense and which characters have right reasoning of actions. DON'T WATCH THIS!,"Reactions of the characters and the 'show off' of the bloody gory killing-dying scenes are such a turn off, especially for me and people who like to watch a movie that actually can make sense and has right reasoning of actions from the characters. I must say that the storyline is so weak, and the 'common senses' of these people are simply below normal, I mean, REALLY! This is a fiction, yet, seriously, it's just too forced to be 'scary' and too unacceptable in almost everything that happens. The occurrences of the events are fantastically annoying, it's like the characters have no survival instinct at all, it seems to me that they even want to die by doing dumb things. Moreover, the scenes are all so predictable and boring, and unbecoming because (again) the characters make it happen thanks to their stupidity. Furthermore, I don't know if the producer or director or whoever that made this movie knows any biology at all, but, I believe if a person loses too much blood, the body won't work properly, right? Oh, but again, maybe the excuse will be the witchcraft. Overall, this movie is terribly unappealing. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, maybe. Or maybe not.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm not sure why this doesn't work,"Unlike many horror fans, while I did enjoy the original ""Evil Dead"" movie, I am certainly not hyper about my praise of it. This may be why, when I first heard about this remake, I wasn't yelling ""Blasphemy!"" I was open to a new interpretation... at least as long as it was good and had some original ideas.The remake does have some positive features. The production values are pretty good, for one thing. There isn't a lull or boring moment any time during its 91 minutes. And there is a considerable amount of blood and gore.But despite those things, this remake overall didn't work for me. Why, I have to admit that I'm not quite sure. After a lot of thought, the closest I can come to explaining my lack of enthusiasm may be that the movie unfolds in a way that it seems you've seen all this stuff many times before. The ""surprises"", the shocks, the behavior of the evil forces... to me, it didn't seem different from what I've seen in many other horror movies. Also, the movie may be too slick for its own good; the original low budget movie had a rawness that stuck in your mind and generated creepiness.While I won't say this is an awful remake, it feels very unnecessary. Stick with the original movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Spoiler free review,"This movie was really good. It pays tribute to the original on the fact that it does not use CGI and also some scenes after the end credits that will make fans of the original smile. The overall story was really good, taking basic elements from the original Evil Dead and adding some that will become iconic. The acting was good too and the gore was brutal. The movie is REALLY tense. I think this movie (due to the fact of its initial mixed reviews) will become a cult classic and part of the original Evil Dead series. I only have two complains on the movie... The music seemed sometimes dated and a plot point that doesn't make to much sense near the end of the movie (which involves Mia).

"Entertaining, unless you have high expectations.","Dear people who complain about the gore: Did you even watch the original? There was perhaps even more gore in that. The only difference was colour.Dear people who ask, ""Where's Bruce Campbell when you need him?"" I will tell you: He was CO-PRODUCING THIS FILM.That said, I wanted to view this in theater but real life gave me no time. Just finished watching the DVD. I had no expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the 'OMG absolute BEST' horror film ever, but it was very entertaining. I'm enough of a horror fan that nothing really ""scares"" me anymore, but I did enjoy it. Also, as a visual artist -- Not to spoil -- I very much appreciated this version.

Wholesomely Uplifting and Inspirational!,"This film truly was a heartfelt and brilliant story of struggle, tragedy, loss, perseverance, and a testament to the human spirit. It tells the story of a young girl that is hopelessly addicted to drugs, and how with the help of friends, family, and a Candarian demon, she finally overcomes her vice and finds her way back to a meaningful and fulfilling life.Follow Mia out into the woods as she heads out to a remote cabin in the woods where, surrounded by her caring friends and her brother David, she finally decides to put a stop to her life of self-destruction and shame.The cast, dialogue, and directing were all fantastic. The use of light effects and make-up were astounding, and the plot was rich enough to cut your heart out with a chainsaw, wrap it tight with barbed wire and then affix it to your chest cavity with a nail gun.Anyone who has a close friend or relative struggling with drugs should definitely see this movie.

Its not that bad for a horror movie....fan boys are just mad,"I just watched this movie and honestly its not a bad horror movie at all. I think the only reason why its getting such bad reviews is fan boys wanted Ash and they got Mia. I love the original trilogy but I didn't start watching this movie thinking it was going to be the same at all. Its honestly not a bad horror movie compared to crap that's coming out left and right. Also they do all lot of bad mistakes, but that's horror movies. You can't ask why would they stay in the cabin when they discovered the stuff in the basement, because the movie would end right there. If the original trilogy never existed there wouldn't be so many bad reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An exercise in carnage that's not to be taken too seriously.,"Probably the least interesting thing in this film is the cast of characters, who are basically just there to be put through the wringer then killed. The performances are fine, but it's the dialogue the characters are given that lets them down, because it often feels forced or melodramatic - sometimes the dialogue is deliberately perverse or profane, à la ""The Exorcist"" (1973), but it's more silly here than shocking.The premise that Mia has come to the cabin to go cold turkey is a decent justification, but then no justification is given for why Eric reads ancient text from a book wrapped in barbed wire that he finds in a basement full of dead cats. Nevertheless, it allows for some awesome, over-the-top horror set-pieces, including self-inflicted mutilations and amputations, brutalisation, and chainsaws through the skull.And these horror scenes look great - there's awesome makeup and prosthetic work, and when the blood really comes it's just magical. The cinematography is lovely with both fixed and moving shots, though some of it feels like it's trying to imitate the original ""The Evil Dead"" (1981), particularly the handheld quick-cut stuff. The score is okay but generic, but it's the sound design that annoys me - it's mostly pretty good, but the unnecessary inclusion of a ghost girl in the film means there are at least three occasions where the audio will completely drop out for a couple of seconds (good use of silence), only to be followed by an obnoxious demon scream (cheap and lazy).Really this film is about the spectacle of absolute carnage, and while I appreciate the attempts at emotional hooks and arcs, they really do just fade into the background when people start puking blood and tearing off their own limbs. In other words, it's just good fun.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Heather and Alessa?,"I liked the film. I'm a deadite and I love the original, the original is still far scarier (if the original is 10 out of 10 then this is a 7) and I was waiting for bits like the cellar scene to be far creepier. I expected some insane giggling and a character called Linda who just won't die! I was genuinely waiting when all the girls introduced themselves for one to say Linda. But I liked this as a separate movie... and it has some nods in the direction of original fans.The thing I had a problem with that I can't escape is that it is Silent Hill in parts. Even the siren sound has been stolen in the end battle. Sure it's a lot better than the Silent Hill film featuring the Heather and Alessa battle, good God Silent Hill movie is absolute rubbish in every way, so this is done better! In essence it's been nicked. It had the uncomfortable reminder of Silent Hill right from the moment ""the abomination"" first appears to our protagonist in the woods.I understand most horror movies steal things from others, but it was the siren that made me think ""nah you can't take that as well"" and unfortunately I can't forgive it.I think the lines should have just stayed the same instead of changing ever so slightly, they could have just used the originals, like the song mummy used to sing them to sleep with... on a sidenote why was ""not another peep, time to go to sleep"" cut from the movie, cause it's in the advert? And why is it ""I'll feast on your soul"" when I was dying for ""I'll swallow your soul"" or ""dead by dawn"" or ""we want what is yours, life!"", anything! No levitation! Naaaay! I did miss Raimi bits.They did make it more about ""a demon"" than I cared for and I don't like the new necronomicon with it's silly scrawlings of foul language to stop you reading it... I'm also a little sad that daylight doesn't rid you of possession! But this is all irrelevant because in itself it's a good horror movie. Just try not to think of anything you loved about the original and try to ignore the Silent Hill undertone. Good, good...P.S. my favourite bit in the new one is the blonde girl's possession, from the hand to her death. To me her name was Linda.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

mediocre at best,"Would be a decent nothing-special kind of movie, if not for satanic symbolism.

The Evil Dead is oh so alive!,"This movie was a tough one for me to take in at first. After having seen the originals countless times, I was very skeptical. With so many remakes, it is plain to see that a director can make or break the story.Evil Dead I thought was a very refreshing, modern take on the original! Of course it isn't exactly the same, but why should it be? I know people want it to stay true to the story (and it does) but where is the excitement in seeing the exact same thing, only in a more current time? There are changes but nothing drastic. One thing that I feel was done for the better was the gore. If you enjoy gory films, you love this. It spares no mercy in that department. Also, if you're a fan of the original you'll definitely enjoy the many ""easter eggs"" thrown in throughout. Overall, I loved the movie. Sure, it wasn't perfect but I didn't expect it to be.

A commentary and review from someone who's actually seen the movie,"After actually watching the new movie last night, I came to this sight and began reading many of the ""reviews"" and came to the conclusion that a lot of the reviewers didn't like the movie because they either hate the movie simply for existing or hate the movie because it didn't live up to unrealistic expectations or they haven't actually seen the movie. That being said, I admit that the film ain't perfect, but it was an enjoyable experience and overall, I liked it a lot! Is it a re-make or a re-visioning? IMHO a re-make sticks to the original source material with only very minor changes. A re-visioning uses the source material as an overall premise only but takes it in a different direction. Using that criteria the new film is clearly a re-visioning of the original and should be viewed on it's own merit. I've seen the original films dozens of times. I've even read a couple of books about them. I'm no expert, just a fan, but I can tell a good film from a bad one. On it's own, the new film was well made. The script was lean and fast paced. The gore effects were good. The young cast was as good if not better than some in various other recent re-visioning. The film didn't break any new ground, but it was entertaining and one of the better ones out there. The film begins with a short prequel that attempts to set the mood. Personally, I didn't care for it. I understand why it was included (to explain the presence of the book, etc) yet it looked like it was added at the last minute. There are standout performances from Jane Levy (Mia) and Shiloh Fernandez (David) as well as relative newcomers Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. The characters behave like you would assume. Even Olivia (Lucas) a trained nurse acts appropriately when she finally realizes that she is way out of her depth. Blackmore's character (Elizabeth) could have had a bit more to do though. Director Fede Alvarez, a newcomer to feature film-making does a decent job of pulling together a fast paced, gory ride. Even the obligatory gold Oldsmobile was present! Originally rated NC-17, a few cuts were necessary to ensure an ""R"" rated film. Hopefully, an unrated version will be available on Blu-Ray. The gore SFX were good enough to convince some people that it was all CGI! There are few jump scares and the pacing is a little too fast to build up a decent atmosphere in parts, but the overall feeling of helplessness does come across in the latter half of the film. Overall, I thought the film was an enjoyable experience and it succeeds in paying homage to the original while still standing on it's own. Now to respond to some of the more negative comments. The new movie takes itself too seriously. The original film was NOT MEANT TO BE FUNNY! Raimi and company wanted to make a serious movie that scared the Hell out of the viewer. What most people find funny in the original film is, actually, due to amateur acting, and a minuscule budget (no re-takes). Several reviewers have even mistaken humor in the 2nd and 3rd films for being in the first! The gore was emphasized over storyline and character development. The gore was the major selling point of the original film! The original film was released with an ""X"" rating for GORE. It was primarily due to Stephen King's ""ferocious"" review that it got major distribution. Character development? What's Scott's last name? How do Ash and Scott know each other? There's almost no background given for the original characters. The gore and visual effects were the main concern as per Raimi and Campbell themselves. In comparison, the new version has better character development by far! Too much CGI effects. If you believe that then you haven't seen the movie, nor have you read anything about the making of the movie. Either that or the physical SFX were SO GOOD that you couldn't discern them from CGI. From day one, everyone involved in the new film has stated that CGI was only used for a couple of touch-ups in post-production. The acting in the new movie is terrible compared to the original. Have you seen the original? Richard DeManincor (Scott) blows his lines twice! Ash gets ""trapped"" under a 10 pound bookcase! Re-watch the scene in the new movie when Mia begs David to take her home. Compare the intensity of her performance against any performance in the original film. The dog and it's death was unnecessary. This is only IMHO but the dog was the one that found the basement door. Also, because of the dog's death, David storms into the bathroom to confront Mia only to find her scalding herself in the shower. This leads him to drive her out of the woods thereby discovering that they were trapped. It was a simple way to get the plot moving in a logical manner. The witchcraft/Satanic angle was dumb. Yeah, the intro could have been done better. The movie simply doesn't go into details and is meant only to explain the presence of the book and all the dead cats. There are other issues I could address but I got other stuff to do and writing this review was a good time killer and hopefully, a bit informative. All I can really say is that everyone's tastes are different and trashing a movie based on misleading or false information is pretty low. I recommend that if you're considering watching this, or any other movie, watch an online preview, read a few reviews, take everything with a grain of salt then decide for yourself. If you think the movie is your cup of tea, it probably is.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent soft reboot,"The first time I watched this, it just felt like it was relying on a lot of gore to hide how uncreative the writing is. I had only seen the original when I was a kid. Now that I have seen the original trilogy, I am able to enjoy this way more. I enjoyed all the references to those movies. And even though this is made to look very serious for the most part, there are some very intentional comedies that felt meant to be more as a homage to the franchise's history rather than straight-up comedy. And it does follow the tradition of the franchise by disregarding the continuity from previous movies but still acknowledging their existence.So, all these together made it very enjoyable for me but it still felt like it could have been a little bit better at writing. The whole drugs angle fails to be effective on its own and especially being part of this franchise in my opinion. Also felt like the movie would have been much better if the actor who played David would have looked the part and knew how to act.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sure its not Godard but what did you expect?,"I'm truly surprised by the amount of negative reviews here. Considering that most of the horrific gore-gimmicks were revealed in the prominent redband trailer, why did so many people who didn't want to see 91 minutes of sickening camped up gore go to this movie? I thought it was pretty clear that the film's sole objective was to gross you out with as many different power tools and sharp objects as possible.The negative reviews should be ascribed to the people who knew what Evil Dead was, saw the trailer, read critics reviews, and then continued to go see a movie which they quite obviously were not interested in. This is not to say that this is a good movie, or more specifically a movie that most people would enjoy. But honestly, you went to a movie called Evil Dead and came back complaining about bad acting, over the top merciless gore, and lack of substance?Shame on you.If you have the intellect to understand what this movie is all about, and can manage to find some joy in cringing in the face of all things unsettling and morally depraved, by all means, join in on the fun.

Exceeded All My Expectations,"I've been a huge fan of the Evil Dead films for 3 decades. They're a big part of my movie-watching while growing up. During this time, I've shared the movies with all my friends and family. Any new addition to these films would have to reach a very high bar to meet my approval. So when I heard a remake was in the works, I was both excited and concerned.My concerns grew when I found out the movie would not be directed by Sam Raimi, and would not be starring Bruce Campbell in any capacity. Then I found out this was being directed by a rookie, who also penned the screenplay. I was convinced this movie had ""disaster"" written all over it.Turns out I had nothing to worry about.It's been many years since a movie actually got my heart racing, and it was amazing to have that feeling again after so long. Evil Dead is a thrill ride that gripped me and didn't let go until at least an hour after it had ended.It was also refreshing because there were almost none of the typical moments where I asked yourself ""Why did he do that? That's stupid!"". The premise of the movie gives a good reason for the characters to remain at the cabin long after most sane people would've taken off.Half the fun of the movie was spotting all the cues taken from the first 2 movies, but given their own twist in this re-imagining. Bitten hand that goes bad and needs to be chopped off? Check! Stump-wielding a chainsaw? Check! Demon locked in the cellar? Check! If you've got a favourite scene in one of the first 2 Evil Dead movies, then there's an homage to it in this movie somewhere. But these cues aren't shoe-horned in for the sake of fan service, they're skillfully crafted into the story line in a way that makes these cues unique and shocking in their own way. It's like the writers took these ludicrous moments from the first 2 movies, and turned them into the genuinely scary devices they were meant to be in the first place.I loved how this movie kept me guessing. Sure, I think I KNOW what's gonna happen next. It's been done this way in movies countless times before. But the story throws just enough loops in that there's always doubt. I thought I knew how this movie would end, and I was wrong. And being wrong was awesome, because the end turned out to be way better than my expectations.Mind you, that may not be the fairest way to put it. After all, my expectations were pretty low. So let me state it this way: I can't stand to watch a movie twice in a row, no matter how much I enjoy it. Usually, if I watch a movie, I'm done with it for at least 3 years. But I want to race back to the theatre and watch Evil Dead again RIGHT NOW! And I bet I'd love to watch it a 3rd or 4th time. It was just that much fun.Do I have a favourite among the Evil Dead series? Not really. I enjoy all of them for different reasons. But Evil Dead stands right up there among my favourite movies of all time.(as a counterpoint, my wife watched most of the movie with her eyes half-closed, and felt disturbed for hours afterwards... so this movie definitely isn't for everyone, especially if you're squeamish)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gory as hell,"I was unsure about this sequel/remake as soon as I heard of its more serious tone. The reason Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite 80s movies is bc of its campiness and comedy. But this movie delivered a worthy addition to the franchise. The gore is nasty and completely uncensored, and I can safely say this is one of the most gory movies I've ever seen. This movie also feels very slickly produced. I didn't care about the characters, but I don't think that's really the point. The plot is also surprisingly smart, as a character is a recovering heroine addict and her seeing the Evil is excused as hallucination. Solid remake.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slightly better than the original,"I have long been a fan of The Evil Dead, especially the 1981 film that launched it all. Putting the two films side by side with an honest comparison of each, discounting budgetary differences and advances in effects technology, this one wins in my book, but just barely.

I greatly appreciate the camp factor in the original, but enjoy the darker feel to this film batter. I am in no way denigrating the first Evil Dead.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Blood, guts and gore - and more blood, guts and gore!","The original 'Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead 2' took the demonic possession genre to an entirely new level, so I was curious to see what a new director was going to do with this installment.Let me start by saying what I didn't like about the film: the characters. With the exception of Mia (Jane Levy) all the other characters felt two-dimensional and uninteresting, especially Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), who felt dispensable. The other issue I had, was the back story and the reason why they went to the cabin in the woods.In the original 1981 film, the youngsters were boisterous and filled with joy and adventure, so when things started going wrong for them, I sympathized with them. With this installment five young people - including a brother and sister - clearly have issues between them and this resulted in the film starting off on a somber note. The group didn't look like they were out to have fun and felt like none of them wanted to be there. According to the story, the reason they decided to spend a weekend at the cabin, is to try and 'cure' Mia of her drug addiction. In reality, a drug addict would need professional help and will definitely not overcome her addiction with the help of friends away from society for a weekend. So this back story failed in my opinion. Had there been another reason it might have worked better.What did work, was the fact the others thought Mia was hallucinating from withdrawal symptoms when she started seeing strange things happening around them. This was well set-up. I still would have preferred the film to start on a lighter note. I think I would have rooted more for them had they not been so depressed to start off with. There was also no chemistry between any of the characters, not even between brother and sister.Let's talk visuals and make-up; my gosh, these were exceptionally well done! So much so that this is a very difficult film to watch. If gore and bucket loads of blood is not your thing, then you're definitely going to want to give this a skip. If you're familiar with the 'Evil Dead' films on the other hand, then this is probably the reason why you're watching this one and you knew from the beginning what to expect. Even so, this is an extremely gory movie!! This is not for the faint of heart, and truly the stuff nightmares are made off. I mean, bloody hell, this was just sick!Why do we as humans watch these kind of movies and actually find them entertaining? Who knows? I did. The film is fast-paced and relentless. Once the horror starts, there's no stopping it until the credits roll, and by that time you're bound to be on the edge of your seat, clenching your teeth, sweating, and your heart will be racing. Ah, yes, and this is why we enjoy these kind of movies: the adrenaline rush!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Take a look, worth your time","http://www.immersiononline.net/film/Evil-Dead-ReviewI spotted Lou Taylor Pucci at The Grove market/mall in Los Angeles back in early January. I geeked out inside a little and immediately wanted to get a photo. However, he appeared to be with a couple family members and I didn't want to bug a family outing. After seeing the remake of the 1981 film, The Evil Dead, and Pucci's performance in it, I sincerely regret not taking advantage of that photo op and ruining his nice day out with the fam (but what up-and-coming Hollywood actor wouldn't love to get recognized?). Where last year's The Cabin in the Woods satirized the horror genre, 2013's Evil Dead has taken the new direction of horror shown in The Cabin in the Woods and taken it to the next level.",,Anonymous,Horror
First decent modern gore/horror produced in years,"With due respect to the previous reviewers who are fans of the original evil dead I found this movie nothing like how they've rated it. Yes there are parts that don't make sense but to enjoy a movie you can't question every aspect unless you're trying to solve the mystery which this movie doesn't have.In relation to a modern horror movie this is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Not overly frightening but the suspense is great and it is very well acted and produced.The genius of this movie is that it isn't over done with gore and special effects which ruin the concept. There is just enough grotesqueness involved with the evil presence that leave you thinking that maybe, just maybe, this could happen and make you think how the f*#k would I escape that?!If you're a fan of the original maybe you shouldn't have high hopes but to the younger generation I would definitely recommend this movie. Very well done.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just watched the new Evil Dead Rise,"Wow, the fact that the new evil dead rise has a higher score baffles me. It's completely trash compared to this movie. Everything from character development to gore are weaker and lazy. Not a single character is redeemable in the new 2022 movie. This 2013 film is actually excellent. The gore is over the top a bit but every scene feels real and not cgi enhanced.I would highly recommend this 2013 remake to anyone and already did so to it buddies. Really appreciate Fede for putting out such great content, cannot wait for the new Aliens series that he is working on. Anyways, don't waste $20 on the new Rise movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining but far from a masterpiece.,"The Evil Dead(1981) is probably one of the first horror movies I saw as a kid on VHS. So yeah i'm one of those guys. I heard many a movie watcher say these movie was horrible so I didn't expect much. But I actually enjoyed it, It had a good amount of gore and I particularly liked the emphasis on the demonology, It wasn't scary, funny or suspenseful.Recently I've seen several people online saying how awesome this movie is. I watched it again thinking maybe I didn't have the right mindset upon first viewing.But no. I still feel the same way. Entertaining but far from a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie is so boring that now I am afraid to see the original. But nothing can be so bad as this movie.It seems like they did not have Money to hire a director and actors. There is no suspense or fright scenes, the actors seem to be reading medicine prospects.It could at least have some humor.

A great movie that stands on its own,"I put this movie off for years because I was upset at the absence of Bruce Campbell in an Evil Dead movie. The movie stands on its own as great even without him. The over-the-top horror is reminiscent of the others in the series but instead of horror-comedy, it reaches a point that it's almost horror-action. Every minute there is something terrible happening, disfigurement here, dismemberment there, blood spraying everywhere (in typical fashion). It's very nearly almost too much. The on-and-off possessions of the characters are gruesome and terrifying, a recurring trope that reaches its mind-bogglingly awful height in Evil Dead (2013). Needless to say, I would not want to to be these people.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Should be called ""Worst movie of our Generation""","I have seen some terrible movies in my time, and when I say terrible, I mean any movie that ever starred Billy Blanks or Jalal Merhi terrible, so I want you to fully understand my meaning when I say this movie is absolutely awful. It might have been the fact that I am such a fan of the original series, and bought into the nonsense hype for the film, and was soundly and brutally disappointed.Everything about this film is terrible. There is not a single thing about it that is actually scary, and is in fact, so stupid in its presentation that any notion of fear is quickly pushed aside to the overwhelming ""Seriously??!!"" that you scream for the entire 90 minutes. The characters themselves are so one-dimensional and stupid, that it is impossible to feel anything for their violent ends other then elation. This is one of the few movies where I was rooting for the demon. The whole movie is sloppy in its presentation, with more detail being given to fancy murder scenes that hope to distract the viewer with hyper gore so they'll ignore how bad and stupid the entire story is.Don't bother with this film. Don't even rent it. Just forget it exists. Hopefully the rest of the world will too.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
a great addition,"I've always loved the evil dead films. Bruce campbell was always my favourite and I loved how they could blend horror and comedy together. And the series too. Now in the modern day we find ourselves back at the original cabin, with ashes car still there. Jane Levy plays Mia, the star of the show and is great as her characters all the cast do well. A great lot of characters aswell and I feel its overall a really well made horror thats effective. Also the impressive amount of blood that was used near the end, I would love to stand in that and dance. It also does continue with the comedy combination and it works just aswell. Ovrall this evil dead reboot is great, with a great cast and overall a well made movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead is no longer campy and is just straight up horror,"So the plot is like you took the same high points in the original, wrote them on cards, then dealt them to new players. Character names are different, character types are ever-so-slightly askew from their originals.If you're coming into this without seeing the original first, you're going to view this new film as a pretty straight run-of-the-mill horror story. Teens/young adults go to a cabin in the woods. That's a trope basically *because* of films like Evil Dead.I'm on the cusp between a 6 and a 7 rating. 7 and up, I'll watch again on my own. 5-6, someone really has to want me to watch it with them. 4 and below are just a waste of my time.I guess on the Good-Recommend, Bad-Don't Recommend Quadrant style rating, I'd still give it a Good-Recommend. Movies generally fall into one of four ratings:
Bad - Recommend
Bad - Don't Recommend
Good - Recommend
Good - Don't RecommendAnd to be fair, I gave the original film a 5 strictly because of the lack of budget leading to obvious bad makeup. The original is a Bad - Recommend movie. The story is good n fine, execution was in fact better given more money and new technologies in the new movie.Plot devices are slightly altered for today's audience. Special effects are realistic and well done. It absolutely gives more than a ton of nods to the original. I'd agree with reviews saying it's the modern telling of generally the same story, with a massive increase in budget.I actually really like the reverse play technique and they use that in the new film too. That idea was groundbreaking for practical effects in the original. Film it one way, play in reverse. I'm glad that was included.Each iteration has improved the movie. Can't say that with every sequel, prequel, or remake. That said, they should never remake this movie again. It's been done. Let the Evil Dead lie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You people are ridiculous,"This movie does exactly what it's supposed to do. Going in I had low expectations. I do for most new horror films. Nothing is really scary. However this one had its moments. Plenty of tense scenes and gore that has you cringing. THATS EXACTLY WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO!I love reviewers who use a bunch of big words (like pretentious) and then talk about the flat acting and scenery and blah blah blah. It was great! Everyone did their job. Sure the whole movie is based on people making stupid decisions.... I'm pretty sure that's 99% of horror movies. So quit acting like you know what you're talking about, because you don't.Great film. Watch it in the dark with your lover.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alvarez's Reawakening,"Alvarez helms a reawakening, pun intended, of Raimi's cult classic and delivers a formidable horror film. It is frenzied from start to finish. Excellent direction, screenplay, special effects, cinematography, settings, score and acting. All of the actors involved offer gifted and truly frightening performances. This time around five friends visit a cabin in the woods to detox Mia. Along with Mia are her brother David, Eric, Natalie and Olivia. Soon the ""Book of The Dead"" is discovered in the cabin's cellar. Eric, against everyone's pleas, reads from the book and Mia is immediately possessed by an evil force although the others initially believe she is going through the detox process. It's like no other detox process this viewer has ever witnessed. Having awoken the dead the friends fight off attacks from the force A.K.A. Deadites at every angle. Eric continues to try to reverse his actions and figure out what has happened. He believes killing Mia is the solution. This film is much more gory than the original and lacks the quirky and outlandish vibe, but at times odes to the original are referenced. Nonetheless this film works.The plot is horrific, creepy, disquieting, grisly, brutal, thrilling, bone-chilling, ferocious, gory and has a sublime ending. This film is part of ""The Evil Dead"" franchise and this viewer sees it as a re-imagination for newcomers to enjoy if sleepless nights are your thing. There is also an interpretation presented for a possible sequel, which would be welcomed if it can stand up to this caliber of horror. It is a terrifying experience, memorable and at the very top in it's genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Even thou I was nevus about going see this remake. I am glad I went to see it. This a great movie. The original The evil dead from 1981 is better. Evil dead 2 dead by dawn is better. Evil dead 3 the army of darkness is also better. But still this is a great movie. It is very scary. Some teenagers of to a cabin in the woods. They accidentally some a demons that kill people and posses there dead bodies. This movie is well written. The acting is great. The special effects are great.

Evil Dead,"For many, it doesn't get better than ""The Evil Dead."" The 1981 original and its two sequels are the perfect blend of blood-drenched, graphic horror and B-grade camp, giving birth to one of the most abused horror movie clichés of all time: naive college or high school kids, alone in a cabin or other secluded area, making predictably dumb decisions that will only make their situation worse.This new ""Evil Dead"" remake (which drops the definite article from the title) is produced by original ""The Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi and his trilogy star, Bruce Campbell. Make no mistake, these two are extremely protective about their property, have a great relationship with the franchise's many fans and, I fully believe, wanted to deliver the best possible ""Evil Dead"" remake they could. In order to do that, they put the franchise in the hands of director Fede Alvarez, which was exactly the right thing to do.This time around, we find five friends gathered at a remote country cabin to help one of them, Mia (Jane Levy), kick her drug habit. Joining Mia is her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez); his girlfriend, Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore); Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), who's angry at David for leaving town and apparently forgetting about his friends; and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), a nurse who, supposedly, will be able to administer any sort of drug should Mia need it.Turns out, the cabin sits above a cellar once used to exorcise a demon from a young woman who was burned at the stake while surrounded by dozens of dead cats hanging from the ceiling and cast of characters who looked like they were on a break from the set of ""American Horror Story."" Thanks to the odor emanating from the basement, the friends discover the creepy subterranean dwelling, where they also find the demonic book used to dispatch of the possessed girl. Clearly, Eric hadn't seen many horror movies, because the barbed wire wrapped around the book certainly should've raised a red flag. And if that wasn't a clear enough signal to stay away, the Frankenstein-like stitching of the book cover — suggesting that the book isn't leather-bound but perhaps human skin-bound — should've been another dead giveaway. But NOOOO, Eric just had to know what was in that book, and when he got it open, he just had to read the various Latin phrases inscribed below the demonic pictures covered with messages written in blood.So far, this sticks close enough to the original movie, when the recorded messages unleashed hell, literally. Soon enough, Mia, in the throes of drug withdrawal, becomes possessed.Putting Jane Levy (TV's ""Suburgatory"") in the role of Mia may very well be the best bit of horror movie casting since Naomi Watts in ""The Ring."" This is a breakout performance for her. Her energy — whether it's nervous, frenetic, scared — is infectious. Levy pulls you into this disgustingly gory, graphic tale and never lets you go, making you feel as though you're experiencing everything she is. Alvarez certainly deserves credit for utilizing his young star's prodigious talents.While not as funny as the original ""The Evil Dead,"" and none of the characters are quite as memorable or iconic as Bruce Campbell's wisecracking Ash, there's plenty of humor in this remake, most of which can't be repeated here. Campbell promised fans a blood bath and the team that he and Raimi assembled delivers.Except it's less a blood bath and more like a blood monsoon. But, if you're paying money to see ""Evil Dead,"" you know what you're getting yourself into, and you're not going to be disappointed. While there's room for improvement, ""Evil Dead"" is still a cathartic, nauseating (in a good way) crowd pleaser you'll want to see more than once.Three-and-a-half out of five stars.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Stiff actings, cheesy and very reminiscene of 80s horror. Wouldve been great if it was taken seriously.","It was okay. The storyline was a bit childish and the execution was a bit off - reminds me of classic horrors, maybe it was intentional. Similar to other sam raimi's projects.Im not familiar with this franschise, heard it was a remake of the first movie of the triology - which explains everything on the odd choices. They should at least, modernised it. The scores was okay, very halloween-ish tone setup. The pacing was very sam raimi.Not familiar with the casts but all of them were terrible. The audio and video quality was fine, and the make-up were great. No comment of the movie set, seems very small and crampy.

One of the better remakes,"I didn't watch this as a remake of the original; I watched it as it's own film. And I'm glad I did, because it's a whole different film. It's got the Necronomicon and the deadites, but it's very much it's own film.
I had no expectations for it, but it was a dark and gritty surprise. It didn't rely on jumpscares and it delivered some of the most gory violence I have ever seen in a mainstream movie. It may have bad character choices, but the logic behind it is admirable. Definitely a movie for gore hounds and horror fans only, but it isn't bad, and I could definitely watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time,"This movie was horrible... predicable and the story was just plain awful. Why did they stray so far from the formula?

In the end, this movie just goes to remind us of how Hollywood has lost its creativity and continues to remake great movies into horrible new releases.

Good Gore,"Had I not grown up on the original starring Bruce Campbell and watched with expectations this would have been delightfully terrorizing.

"Hail to the Queen! Jane Levy lives up to Evil Dead standards in remake, but the film not so much.","I am very curious to read and hear reactions from people with no knowledge of the Evil Dead series. The film begins as a remake of the original cult classic, which leaned heavily on horror instead of the camp humor that would dominate the sequels. But once the movie reaches its second-act, it starts to slowly transition into Evil Dead II territory. Co-writer and director Fede Alvarez never comes anywhere near the trademark comedy of that installment but he's definitely tipping his toe in the water. So I can imagine many viewers that are newcomers to the franchise will be thinking, ""what the...?""This remake, released 30 years after the original became a genre favorite on VHS, tries to correct several flaws made by its counterpart. It is better paced and has a superior screenplay. The plot revolves around Mia, who is played brilliantly by Jane Levy of Suburgatory fame. She's a drug addict trying to go cold turkey after the death of her mother and an overdose soon after. She stays at her family's cabin with support from her closest friends and estranged brother. After one of them discovers the Book of the Dead in the basement, a demon is unleashed and the reign of terror begins.Evil Dead, like its predecessors, is unrelenting. There aren't many moments for audiences to catch their breath. It's a near endless stream of mayhem. It definitely lives up to its promise of being the most terrifying film experience of all-time. However, it lacks the charm and tongue-n-cheek of the Sam Raimi helmed trilogy. Alvarez recreates Raimi's signature visual style, which is great, but he avoids all the eye-winking except for a few moments. Teenages attacked in the woods is a tired concept in horror films. The Evil Dead movies are supposed to freshen up that sub-genre and provide something different. This remake is mostly run of the mill and only slightly stands-out through entertainment value, strong visuals, and a memorable lead character. It's a great gateway to the original trilogy, but it's not in the same league. Well, at least not on a pedestal like Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. Regardless, it succeeds as far as remake are concerned, but it breaks no new ground.",,Anonymous,Horror
"'Simply astounding!', 'Near perfect experience.. ' - It's good but I wouldn't go that far.","When I first saw a lot of these reviews of the Evil Dead remake, I was very excited.I've seen both Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, along with Army of Darkness (with Army of Darkness actually being my favourite) and although they're all fun and I think highly of them, I wasn't going to kick up a fuss about a remake ruining my childhood, like some people are prone to.But to call this 'a near perfect experience', or 'simply astounding' is a little daft. It's a good, very solid, incredibly gory horror but it does little different from other, similar genre movies and can't exactly be called entirely original.On the whole, I'd recommend for fans of horror, provided you had a strong stomach but I wouldn't mislead anybody by inferring this is a stone-cold classic and you just have to see it.There are many better and will be more to come too but if you lower your expectations you won't come away disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore > Scare?,"Kids in their twenties in a cabin in the middle of the woods to help their friend get through heroine withdrawals. There is the obvious stoner, the dumb girl, the hot girl, the troubled girl, and the strong, older brother. Here we go, this is the review for Cabin in the Woods, oh wait I already reviewed Cabin in the Woods, oh wait this is Evil Dead, oh wait, their almost the same movie. Evil Dead is a remake and Ii starts out like every horror movie ever. I hate horror movies today because they follow the exact same formula but at least the second half was mainly different and changed it up a bit. Evil Dead has a basic storyline, isn't scary at all, but it very disturbing with a lot of blood and gore, but it was enjoyable.It's obvious that a evil spirit or demon is present in a house, or in this case cabin, the obvious answer is to leave. I give Evil Dead the benefit of the dead because they stay for the main character who is struggling with heroine withdrawals so when she acts nuts it makes sense that they stay. How would they know she was possessed by a demon? Then when they finally realize what they have done it's too late, so touché Evil Dead. This still follows the stereotypical cliché horror movie. They find an evil book and of course they read it even though it says not to read it in blood on one of the pages. That's our story to the movie, basic, you know who will live and who will die, but at least it's still entertaining to see how.I was hoping that the atmosphere of a movie theatre would boost the scare factor while saw this movie, but it didn't. I cringed at the gore and jumped at most of the jump scares but that's not scary. Jump scares are the worst form of a scare in a movie, especially in horror movies because you expect it. So if you are concerned about being scared then you have nothing to lose with this one. However, if you have a weak stomach and don't like blood and gore you may want to reconsider. The gore is intense with arms being cut off, chainsaws, it rains blood, ya real blood, and I laughed, nail guns, shotguns, crowbars, third degree burns, and the poor girl even gets raped by a tree, I did not laugh. That probably crossed a line. There is a few things a movie should never do, one is murder kids, that's just a no no. The second is definitely getting raped by a tree, that's beyond unnecessary. Other than the tree the most disturbing image was when the girl licks the knife and cuts her tongue in half. It was hard to watch.Other than that the gore was awesome and made the movie that much better. There was one character, whose name I'm forgetting because the characters were so forgettable, but he suffered the most. He got a needle in the eyelid, nails in the arm, he got stabbed, anything bad really happened to him. He was probably my favorite character because well I don't even know why, but he was. He made me laugh along with the gore. I'm not sure why but there were a lot of scenes where I just laughed and laughed. Especially when she talks with a weird whisper to her brother saying they need to leave because there was a demon or something there with them. I couldn't help it, I just laughed. The scene when they discover the cats hanging in the basement, laughed. The chainsaw, laughed. I probably laughed too much for a horror movie but I was entertained.The acting is usually awful in these types of movies but Evil Dead wasn't as bad as I expected. Characters are usually irrelevant and are just there to look pretty, be dumb, or die in a sadistic way. Now these characters existed but the relationship between the brother and the possessed sister was interesting. They have a dark and troubled past and it shows a little characterization in them and I liked it. It sucked me into the story a little bit and I even felt a little sympathy for them, but only a little.The character I hated the most was the black girl, no not because she was black, but because she was so obnoxious. I hated everything about her character and I was counting the minutes until she died. I could not wait until the demon tore her to shreds. When it happened, I could not have been happier. The demon was interesting because it possessed the body and made them kill themselves which I thought was neat. I don't want to spoil it but when it's all said and done you will probably clap because it was so awesome and fulfilling.Overall, Evil Dead was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. It wasn't as scary as I wanted it to be but I didn't feel like I wasted my money either. I loved the gore, loved the demon, and thought the deaths were sadistic but fun to watch. I laughed more than I should have but that's not a bad thing either. I thought it was funnier than most of Adam Sandler's movies recently. I hated the acting, but I had low expectations, didn't really get into the characters, the story was bland and predictable, but it's a horror movie and for a horror movie it was good. For a movie overall it wasn't but I can't compare a horror to a comedy or to a drama. All movies should be judged based on their genre and for this genre it passes. Evil Dead gets The WillyT Recommendation. Go see and be disturbed by all the blood in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Groovy Homage,"Firstly let me get this out of the way, the reviews on here for this film are just shocking. I was excited to see this movie ever since it was announced and while the critic reviews pumped me up, the user reviews disappointed.I was scared when I went into the theatre last night, the first night of the movies release in the uk. I did not know what the film was going to be like, so i crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.Let me first say what is wrong with this movie. The characters feel flat, not your usual dime a dozen meat bags who usually occupy horror films, but for as far as this film goes it just does not have the character development it deserves. the second problem is the overuse of jump scares, if like me you enjoyed the evil dead films for the gore and not the laughable jump scenes then this may come as a disappointment, this entire thing is a lengthy collection of jump scares ranging in quality.However when this movie does something right it REALLY does something right. The last 15 minutes of this are truly something to behold for true evil dead fans and fans of classic practical gore effects. That said the gore is beautiful, tons of unsuspecting girlfriends sat in the cinema last night screaming and mentioning how they 'were going to be sick' it was a lot of fun. While the movie is nothing like army of darkness and takes itself completely seriously the black comedy is there, if you are an evil dead fanatic then you should be able to get a chuckle out of a woman cutting her face off with a shard of glass.There are a lot of throwbacks to the original evil dead's which i will not spoil here as well as a distinct 'exorcist' vibe going on with the deadites. All in all this is a movie well worth the £6 admission for the gore factor alongside a few good jump scares if only for laughters sake, throw all this in with a great post credits bit and you have the perfect reboot/re- imagining/quasi-sequel to Sam Rami's classic evil dead series.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the better reboots out there,"""I can smell your filthy soul""Even if it hadn't been the much-anticipated reimagining of a successful franchise, it would have earned recognition because it is a good movie. The direction is competent, there is ample tension, and despite having minimal material to work with, each member of the ensemble performed well enough.Especially Jane Levy as Mia; she played both her possessed and non-possessed roles with equal credence.Additionally, they avoided making it campy; in contrast to the original, the tonality here is predominantly serious, and they upheld it from the opening to the very last frame, which I did find impressive. Overall, the 2013 version of ""Evil Dead"" did a decent enough job of paying homage to the original while also succeeding as a stand-alone horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So incredibly boring,"Missing all of the lightheartedness you would expect from an Evil Dead movie. No twisted demon taunts. No silly poems. No classic one liners. No twitching body parts!Way too much nonsensical back story. Too much explaining.There was some gore, but nothing over the top and not enough blood.So boring - I almost fell asleep!Just terrible.With such a copious amount of awesomeness to fall back on, how could they have so completely missed the mark with this?3 out of 3 horror snobs agree that this movie should be dropped in a pit and never be seen again.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead is an absolute blast!,"I'm actually baffled to see that Evil Dead is sitting at a 7.4 on IMDb, not because I disagree, but because every review on this site is absolutely tearing the movie apart, and that's a shame. I may be the minority here, but I had a blast with the new Evil Dead. While it didn't blow me away like last year's Cabin in the Woods, it was a lot of fun, and that's more than I can say for most recent horror movies.In all honesty, I don't know what kind of expectations had for this movie. If people were expecting groundbreaking levels of intelligence, they clearly were looking in the wrong place. A movie named ""Evil Dead"" isn't meant to make you think, it's meant to entertain you, and this new variation of the classic horror film definitely entertained me, albeit in a different way.Evil Dead hasn't changed its plot much from the original. A group of teenagers go to a cabin, they open the infamous book, and all hell breaks loose. The story does have an interesting twist, where the now female protagonist (played wonderfully by Jane Levy), is a heroin addict sent to the cabin by her friends to help quit her addiction cold turkey. The new twist to the story isn't exactly necessary, but it helps add a deeper level of drama.However, drama isn't what the movie is about. The movie has the same intentions as the original – to deliver plenty of gory scares. Evil Dead succeeds well in shocking the audience with its absolute brutality. As someone who rewatched the original specifically in preparation for this remake, I can confirm that the movie plays out largely in the same way as the original. It has sadistic scares left and right, combined with small doses of scattered black humor. Yes, I'm well aware that the movie isn't nearly as funny as the original, but that's not the movie's goals. This is an Evil Dead for a new generation, and it does a fine job fulfilling its goals.One other thing to note is that Evil Dead is a technical triumph. Unknown to many, one fun fact about the movie is that it doesn't feature a lick of CGI. This movie is all clever filmmaking tricks. If you think back to the original Evil Dead and remember the god awful makeup and effects, you'll come to appreciate the masterful technical work of Fede Alvarez.The movie is obviously not without its flaws. Besides Jane Levy's character (Mia), the rest of the cast is pretty bland and forgettable, and I'm not just talking about the performances, I'm talking about the actual characters. The characters aren't people you're going to be upset about if they die, which has become pretty standard for horror movies. The overabundance of forgettable characters in horror movies is precisely why this doesn't bother me as much as it does everyone else. Think back to the original Evil Dead – now think about the characters. Aside from Ash, who were you really attached to? Though it would be nice to have some characters with depth, I've come to expect it from these kinds of movies. The movie isn't about characters with layers upon layers of depth, it's about bloody fun.The other flaw I'd like to point out isn't necessarily the movie's fault, and it does nothing to keep me from enjoying it. However, some people may have a problem with this. Evil Dead isn't anything new, so for those looking for something with the intelligence of say, Cabin in the Woods, I apologize. Then again, the movie IS a remake. If they twisted the plot too much, people would be even more enraged. The plot stays true to the original in more ways than I expected, but keep in mind that this isn't a movie that will revolutionize modern horror movies, though some positive aspects of this movie should be noted by aspiring filmmakers.As far as horror movie remakes go, Evil Dead succeeds. I will agree with everyone, it's not as great as the original, but it's still a blast. With buckets of gore, impressive effects, and plenty of jabs at its big brother, Evil Dead succeeds. It's (clearly) not for everyone, but for those looking for an entertaining movie and nothing more (sorry, this isn't a psychological thriller), this should be a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This thing...it does not burn...,"I walked into this movie having read the reviews. Some said it was brilliant. Others said it was bad. This intrigued me as there was no one really on the middle ground.Having now seen the movie I now understand why that was the case.First of all here is my breakdown of the movie. visuals 7.5/10 script 0/10 Acting 3/10See the visual effects in this movie are are very good. The gore level is high, though not as high as I expected for an R18+ Australian rating. So these aspects of the film are going to impress the horror fans who are not looking for a story so much as an adrenaline rush. 90 minutes of mindless violence to their minds off things.But those of us who are looking for a little bit more, those of us that are looking for a storyline where we actually care about the characters and where there aren't any gaping plot-holes are going to be sorely disappointed.I'm of the opinion that in order to make a good horror movie you need to make the audience care. The more they care, the more they scare. The more they are pulled along with the journey of the main characters and when they feel scared so do we. But to put it simply, I did not give a dam about any of these characters. They were all annoying and whiny and badly acted for the most part.I guess I shouldn't have expected anything better from a script that Diablo Cody was involved in (My god Jennifer's body was so terribly written). I honestly don't know what people see in her writing.I also thought the script itself was very limited. The same motifs and the same references to the original Evil Dead were repeated to us so many times it got annoying.The acting itself whilst at times okay. At other times was very ordinary. Jane Levy was perhaps the only exception to this. You can certainly see why none of them are A-list actors (though to be fair they didn't have a lot to go by).SO to sum up. the gore and visuals were exactly what most horror fans wanted. It just lacked us caring for the characters and therefore the actual scare factor was very low. I thought that Fede Alvarez overall handled the DIRECTING aspect of the job okay. but I re-iterate again and again the script needed about another dozen re writes.3/10 If you're looking for a horror film with any sort of depth...Avoid this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"watchable, not enough to be terrifying.","when I saw the Evil Dead remake poster was written, this is the most terrifying movie will you watch, it made me a little excited to watch the movie, and with high expectations, the more the film left me very disappointed, the film is not bad, is far from being bad, most also ta far from the scariest movie of the world's few scares, unlike the Evil original Dead, this film attempts to give more scares, and not the much scare, the film also is much like the original, is set in a cabin, and a woman is possessed, the script is a bit tidier, more so do not be better than the original film, Evil Dead is a watchable movie, more is far from terrifying.

Evil Dead Breaks The Cycle,"We all know the long list of remakes that basically sucked in every way, and only a few have managed to pull off a good response, this film gets my approval! I'll break it up into simple categories as to why this film is worth a watch!The Production Team: Everyone involved really put everything into this film and it really shows, it has great set pieces, and top notch special effects.The Cast: Though not Oscar worthy, the leads manage to act realistically throughout the film, I found myself saying ""I would totally do that!""The Story/Purpose: In the original, we get a bunch of college kids going to party and of course, to have sex. In this film, we get the same thing, but this time around they come to get (the films lead) ""Mia"" clean, adding much needed ""purpose"" to the story.The films Score: Sirens, a Satanic Choir, and many more creepy sounds add to the ""edge of your seat"" moments. The sounds in this film really stand out like a ""Nail"" :PThe film succeeds on every level, and it expands upon The Book of the Dead, and it's origin. A fun, cringe worthy (in a good way), crazy roller coaster of a movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Remaking a cult classic is a monumental task,"And as such one has to appreciate that the makers of this 2013 remake of the legendary original by Sam Raimi wouldn't have been easy. The creators of such movies are under the constant pressure of raising the bar of something that's already a cut above. The 1981 Evil Dead had a distinct personality among the horror genre basically owing to its unprecedented arrangment of eerie elements that relied more on in-your-face atmospheric horror than jump scares. The 2013 remake sticks to the basic skeleton of the original script while putting the gore and splatter entities on steroids. The casting is apt. Basically, with the movie set in 2013, the viewers expect way lot in terms of visual experience compared to the CGI devoid 70s and 80s. Brings to mind the same situation the directors of remake of 'I spit on Your Grave', another 70s horror gem must have encountered. Evil Dead (2013) doesn't give the viewer much time to relax right from the beginning. It's not a slow burn. This movie may not be as patient as its 1981 counterpart to form precise character arcs. From the disturbing prelude of the characters to eventually turning into a body horror, the movie doesn't leave any trick in the book to make its audience uncomfortable. Fans of gore fests will not be disappointed. Not a lot of change has been made to the original plot except the violence being more graphic. The one part that did let down was the end. While the original sported one of the most epic endings that yelled ""The Evil Has No End"", one longs to see a more sinister end to the current movie, something that would extinguish all hopes of any good happening. Basically, watch this for the shock factor and a unique blend of classic horror and modern gore.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sequel Should Be Better,"First time I watched...... It was astonishing- brilliant- fantastic- Remakes that follow the original scene by scene just get on my nerves because they wasted money to copy the same thing they did 20 so years ago, not this time. But one thing remakes do wrong every time.this was done brilliantly- the only thing they get wrong again and again with this movie and every horror movie is casting (the girl who played Mia was freaking bad-ass- best part of the movie) but the hippie dude and Dean Winchester looking guy and the others just made the movie annoying, I mean I don't see why they have to apply the same thing to every horror flick- good looking young teenagers- I mean come on. it would have been more interesting if they had a parent staying with them- even if he died at the start it would have been more interesting- maybe the parent could have been casted as Bruce Campbell and get the movie on the fans good side, but no- filmmakers are to scared to be creative anymore. Overall, they did a brilliant job- but they could have made a great movie, instead have just a good one",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I really wanted to this movie to be good, but it's absolutely awful!","The original Evil Dead was so bad that they re-made it with a comic-twist as Evil Dead 2. I loved Evil Dead 2 & 3. So why would anyone chose the worst movie of that trilogy to remake? (apart from the fact the other two were so awesome that no remake could ever do them justice?) I assumed that the movie would have a more robust storyline and amazing special effects, the truth is the storyline is practically non-existent, the lack of continuity in the film really ruins any sort of scare-factor, the characters are very shallow and their behaviors vary from completely predictable to completely illogical with no middle ground. I am huge Bruce Campbell fan and I was really anticipating this movie to see what they would do with his legacy. They completely mucked it up. Terrible movie, seriously, don't spend your money on this one, wait for it on Netflix if you must.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
How all remakes should be done.,"One of those great remakes that are just as good as the original but without copying it. Instead, It gives it's own flavor and color but always remembers it is still Evil Dead.This is the movie where TASTES will decide whether the movie is better or worse than the original.The FILM as a whole, is just fantastic. As a horror film it does everything it's supposed to have. Great dark scenery, great pacing, really cool violence (this includes death scenes and other moments where blood is shed)And as a REMAKE it does everything right.Why do you want to see a remake that does EVERYTHING scene by scene like the original???? To see better special effects??? the original effects where fine!! if you are going to make a film that was already made, then you BETTER bring something new to the table.But you ALWAYS got to stay true to the original. You CANNOT bring something new without respecting the original, and i believe this film did that.All the beats form the original where there, but they gave it their own twist. all the moments where there, but with their own flavor.It was like Watching Evil Dead all over again, but as a COMPLETELY NEW EXPERIENCE.Think of it like this. What if somebody else did Evil Dead instead of Sam Raimi?That is this film, and THAT is why i think all remakes should be that way. It's a what if scenario, have all the familiar queues but have something new happen.Totally recommend it",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Garbage,"This a filthy yet humorous film rolled into one. If you favor a horror show that possesses cheap shock value instead of true creativity you will enjoy yourself. I think the women used F*** approximately 30 times combined. Enough gushing blood was spilled in order to supply a blood mobile for a day. And I will never understand why film-makers will create a film where the players are critically wounded yet they are still able to function like a regular person. I laughed through much of it. I almost walked out before it ended. But I decided to remain for its entirety in order to ascertain weather or not a remaining scene of gushing blood and filth would somehow give me a surprising jolt,,, it didn't.It is upsetting that motherhood and fatherhood are disparaged in this production.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy :D,"I have a knack about horror flicks, have been a bit uncertain of this one, I loved the previous versions and think Bruce Campbell did a great job (was expecting him for a cameo), but after reading a bit and finding that this was intended as a reboot and both Raimi and Campbell was thrilled about this new version, well I thought what the hell :)This is gory, this is bloody, this is violent, this is all that the good old horror flicks was, but with new deafening sounds, great visuals, more power and just what was needed for a great horror splatter flick of the modern age.It was entertaining and had me jumping a few times, it is a good homage to the classics, mixed with some new effects and CGI it all works out very well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new twist on a beloved classic that stays true to its roots while finding it's own Independence as a new film..,"Great movie with a ton of throwbacks to the original films.

With no cgi used in the film (yes everything is a prosthetic) and plenty of messy/ gory parts to make you squirm, it is a great movie with a huge throw back to the original films that is sure to make you squirm. Destined to be a new classic. It will be a definite buy on DVD for me. It is also confirmed there will be a few sequels to this and an army of darkness 2.

good remake without the humor,"Didn't I write a report about this yet? Shame, so let's correct it.I just watched it for the 2nd time, the difference with Raimi's series is
that it is all presented a lot more seriously now, the setting is otherwise the same.The strong points are the impressive gore effects that are fortunately really visual instead of from the computer,
the acting is more than adequate and the humor from the 2nd part has been omitted, which I think is a plus.I think the presentation of the demons themselves is somewhat inferior to the original 1st part, in which they present themselves much more menacingly and thus make more of an impression.But all in all a very pleasant surprise and I secretly hope for a sequel to this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely nothing wrong with this remake.,"All of you hipster fanboys/fangirls should really calm down giving this movie bad reviews. Your nostalgia is interfering with your ability to objectively rate this movie. I happen to be a HUGE b-rated horror film lover. Evil Dead was a movie i grew up on, watching numerous times. When i heard a remake was coming i was for one very excited and 2 very skeptical. I went into this movie after reading all of the bad reviews here on IMDb expecting the movie to be horrible. Was i so very wrong. It was Gore galore. The grusomeness of the kills and the makeup make this movie worth it alone. No this movie is not original, it is a REMAKE. Why would it need to be original. Although the writers and director did a very very good job of not following the original to the T. There is just enough nostalgia in it to give you the warm and fuzzies. But the beauty of this film lies on its own accord. If you are a horror movie fan i sincerely recommend this movie. If you are some lame hipster that already thinks this movie is going to suck because its a remake, you should stay home sip your chai latte and listen to mumford and sons.

It's more gory than it is scary,Just saw this movie last week.Fan of the original but only seen the original once.And don't remember much about it and couldn't really compare that with this remake.Other than the blonde girl's acting I thought everyone's acting was pretty decent.Specially Jane Levy's acting is worth mentioning since she is mainly known for comedy.Playing such an intense and horrific character really proves her ability as an actress.There was definitely enough gore .Less CGI and more real make up made them look scary too.But this movie is definitely more gory than it is scary.However I don't like the storyline much.Its kinda common.Reminded me of the Friday the 13th movie.Though i do like the reason for which they didn't leave the cabin.Camera work was OK but could have been better in some of the scenes.Just wanna say that this movies feeds enough when it comes to gore.It can't be compared to the original and people shouldn't either because no remake can ever surpass any original movie.This movie stands OK on its own but since its a part of the franchise now and people can't help but compare it to the original one.I am giving it a 6/10 .,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A so-so redo of the classic,"Five 20-somethings go to a cabin in the woods to help their friend Mia (Jane Levy) go cold turkey from drugs. They are Mia, her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), his gf Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), friend Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and her bf Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). Naturally they find the Book of the Dead, open it and Eric reads aloud the incarnation to resurrect the demons. They possess Mia first and make it clear that they're all gonna die.I remember seeing the original back in 1981 in a small theatre in Boston. I remember being scared silly by the over the top graphic gore, gruesome makeup, creepy music and the gallons of fake blood that was used. It was unrated (no one under 17 admitted)made on no budget and caught everybody by surprise by becoming a huge hit (although most critics tore it apart). This can't duplicate it but they try. They use practical non-CGI effects which helps. They pour on the blood and gore (how this got an R rating is beyond me). There are quite a few very scary moments--especially when an undead girl goes after her bf. But, all in all, it was just OK. With the sole exception of Levy the acting is pretty bad with Fernandez being the worst. He's a handsome man but totally blank. People do incredibly stupid things a lot--especially Eric. The story gets stupider and stupider and makes absolutely no sense by the end. If you're just seeing this for gore you'll love it. Otherwise you might not.

i really wanted to like this,"I was skeptical when I heard they were going to remake one of my favorite horror movies of all time. When I saw it, I came into it with a very optimistic hope that all by skepticism would die once I saw the final product. What I got was nothing like the original film. Which can be good sometimes, but not this time. The direction made me feel that the director had just been handed the script with no understanding of what the original Evil Dead was about. The remake of Dawn of the Dead was good, and in fact you could tell the writer and director truly loved the original material. Like he'd taken cliff notes after a quick viewing. They treated it with respect and made something different, but that could also stand on its own two feet. The actors were just awful. They were boring and generic. The lead woman was probably my favorite, and in my opinion she carried the movie. The direction was horrendous. It was shot way too dark, and suffered from many of the stereotypical film techniques of today's horror. This was a completely different movie with references to evil dead crammed into the movie. It was all too bland and BORING! My thought on it was why even call this an evil dead move? Without the cabin and chainsaw it's just another generic horror film. The props on the set were probably the only connection to the original.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy Enough I guess,The original Evil Dead (1981) is to this day one of the scariest demonic possession horror movies I have ever seen it gave me nightmares as a teenager and now as an adult really made me appreciate just how unique the movie was and still is almost 40 years later with great makeup and practical effects that you just don't get in horror movies today so when I heard Evil Dead was getting a remake I went to see it on day one and honestly I was a little disappointed by it.The movie follows a girl named Mia (Jane Levy) who has come to her family cabin in the woods with her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) his girlfriend and her best friends as she attempts to go cold turkey and beat her addiction to Heroin when they arrive at the cabin they discover that someone has broken in and trashed the place and they discover a room in the basement full of dead cats and ritual items mainly a book titled the book of the dead a passage is read from the book awakening a demon within the woods Mia begins to go crazy hearing voices and steals the groups car but crashes it into a nearby swamp where she is chased by the demon she is then possessed and begins harming herself and the others as one by one they each get taken over by the demon and attack each other aswell as harming themselves by severing limbs cutting themselves and even burning there own skin with hot water now they must try and survive the night and kill the possessed each other.I recently rewatched the movie on Blu Ray and honestly it isn't a bad movie by any means in a lot of ways it's actually pretty good especially when compared to most horror movie remakes like Friday the 13th and Halloween if you forget it's meant to be an Evil Dead remake then actually it's pretty enjoyable but if you try and compare it to the original it's just not gunna meet your expectations.The makeup effects are pretty good and there is an absolute ton of blood used throughout the movie especially in the movies decapitation scenes and climax but sadly most of the gore is CGI based which let's it down a little but it's to be expected in modern day horror movies.I recommend this movie to any horror movie fan especially if you enjoy movies heavy on the gore and doesn't go overboard with it's jump scares if you have never seen the original Evil Dead (1981) then I highly recommend watching that first as it is a far better movie but in the case of this remake just enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of gore and screams.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead: A Timeless Classic of Horror and Innovation,"As a true fan of horror, I recently rewatched the original Evil Dead and was reminded why it remains a classic. The film's captivating storytelling and incredible visuals still hold up, making it a standout in the genre.One of the most impressive aspects of Evil Dead is its storytelling. The plot is tight, well-paced, and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The climax is particularly gripping, delivering a satisfying resolution that leaves a lasting impression. Unlike some modern horror films, Evil Dead doesn't rely on jump scares alone but builds a genuine sense of dread and tension throughout.The special effects and makeup are nothing short of groundbreaking for their time. Despite being made on a limited budget, the practical effects are both creative and convincing, adding to the film's unsettling atmosphere. The scenes with the over-the-top blood, while exaggerated, work perfectly within the context of the film, creating a visceral and immersive experience.The cinematography in Evil Dead is another highlight. The film's visual style is dark, moody, and atmospheric, capturing the essence of horror. The direction is spot-on, with clever camera angles and shots that enhance the sense of terror and suspense.The characters in Evil Dead are well-portrayed by a talented cast who deliver authentic and compelling performances. Each character feels real and relatable, making their ordeals all the more harrowing. The makeup and special effects used to transform the characters into terrifying entities are impressive and add to the film's horror.Evil Dead also succeeds in its ability to deliver genuine horror. The film doesn't rely on cheap scares but instead creates a haunting and terrifying experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. The makeup and special effects contribute to this, creating horrifying visuals that are both memorable and chilling.The film's creative approach to horror sets it apart from other entries in the genre. Evil Dead manages to blend elements of supernatural terror with visceral body horror, resulting in a unique and unforgettable experience. The blood and gore are used effectively, enhancing the film's horror without feeling overdone.In conclusion, Evil Dead is a must-watch for any horror fan. Its captivating storytelling, incredible visuals, and genuine horror make it a standout in the genre. The film's practical effects and makeup are groundbreaking, and the performances are compelling and authentic. While it may not be for everyone, Evil Dead remains a classic that continues to influence and inspire the horror genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sam Raimi has left the building,"Okay, fellow Dead-ites, I was willing to give Mr. Raimi the benefit of the doubt; even though he didn't direct this unfortunate happenstance of a movie, he did have a say in who did direct it. Therefore, I was willing to believe it would be something that his fellow Dead-ites would enjoy, but that just was not what happened. It was like watching Cabin in the Woods, with a mish-mash of The Ring and The Exorcist thrown in for good measure. I mean, really? Really? Do NOT watch this film and expect it to be even remotely entertaining as the original is. It does not have the same grit and fun, and the characters are a joke (but not a joke as in ha-ha, but more like, Oh God, no no).

D I S M A L   remake of a horror classic,"Contains a few spoilers, yep. But can you spoil something that's already rottenThis one was certainly made for the teen-agers (and they love it!).Utterly forgettable. So glad I didn't pay money to see this trash, as my expectations were very low, no surprise this movie has none of the charm, wit or humor of the original Evil Dead movies. Lets run down the check list of failures this movie has going for it. BAD CASTING - impossible to care about anything that happens to these people. BAD WRITING - did the dialog bore the bejesus out of you too? Just wanted them to stop talking and die already. The junkie girl is quite grating, is she not. Hate her. The gore, although there's a lot of it, is not effectively used and makes little impression and was it necessary for it to rain blood. Which leads to the painfully stupid ending, the junkie being raised from the dead and then kicks undead a$$. Terrible. The ""bridge out"" sequence has no visual flare, very mundane - no effort put there. The roving POV camera shots that represent the demon (one of the true hallmarks of the series) weren't done according to spec, nor did they occur often enough and created absolutely no suspense or excitement. I really did think they could have at least got that aspect right, but no, they didn't. The soundtrack, as in the music,(one of the only positive aspects about this miserable movie) is under-mixed, I.E. not loud enough, rendering it to little effect. The obligatory ""rape of the vines"" sequence didn't last long enough to be effective/entertaining and there simply wasn't enough vines grabbing her to make it fun to watch, plus it occurred during the day which is not the way its supposed to be done. How many fatal injuries can the bearded guy with the glasses shrug-off, as if he just stubbed his toe. Lets start with the 4 to 5 inch deep knife wound very near his heart, that oozed blood with every beat, how many nails were fired into his head and neck and probably else where. Plus there's a few other injures I can't remember. Point is: He lingered too long. The book of the dead looks different in every single Evil Dead film, in this one they resorted to childish vulgarities being scrawled in its pages - looks very juvenile. So what's to like about this extremely awful movie, other then the already mentioned good music score (under mixed, of course) there were a few interesting looking exterior shots of the cabin....... man not much comes to mind. The blonde chick was hot, I hated seeing her prettiness destroyed by the efforts of an amateur film director and over-done gore effects that are simply a bore. And who was the dark haired guy, was that supposed to be Ash, ha ha, !!!FAIL!!! A beyond pitiful attempt to resurrect a mighty film franchise......Well let me end this with a little advice and that is, just watch the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell Evil Dead movies, you know THE REAL ONES - they are entirely better in every possible way.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"[7.1] ""Feast on this"" !","A ""marvelous"" movie, true to the Evil Dead franchise, set in those creepy woods, in a remote cabin full of rotten construction and a stinky hidden basement, all to the pleasure of fans and true viewers.The acting is decently good, well above average with stinky charismatic play, the development well done in that tight 90 minute runtime, the visual effect section and horror factors deserve reD praise, bloody creativity and more than satisfying, though, I would have liked it to be more gory, more frightening and gut-wrenchy, to pour non-stop horror into our mouth and nostrils. That didn't unfortunately happen, but the high quality was there and that's what matters.I came to the conclusion that in these sorts of movies including Evil Dead productions, what is important is a high number of people and victims. The more the merrier and if they were around 10, what a blood fest and guts flying around, we could have expected!Overall, a (very) satisfying production, made in 2013 in a Friday the 13th.

Evil Dead is reimagined in a nastier gorier version that harkens back to the darker grindhouse roots of the first film,"David Allen (Shiloh Fernandez) his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and their friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas) head out to an isolated cabin in the woods in order to allow David's troubled sister Mia (Jane Levy) to detox under their supervision after having previously OD'd and been legally dead for several minutes. They find the cabin in a state of disrepair which only exacerbates Mia's withdrawal symptoms. Eventually the group find a hidden trap door that leads to a celler with all manner of macabre artifacts including a book bound in flesh. After Eric reads the text aloud, ravenous demons are unleashed that intend to claim the group one by one.Evil Dead is the re-imagining of the 1981 film The Evil Dead which is notable for being the feature debut of director Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell, and the start of the long running Evil Dead franchise. Both Raimi and Campbell planned to produce a remake of Evil Dead with Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues co-writing the script with Diablo Cody Americanizing their dialogue. While fan response to the remake was initially negative, the presence of the original creative team in a producing role did help to alleviate some of the negative response. The movie was a sizable hit earning $97 million against a $17 million budget and critical reception while mixed was certainly more positive than comparable horror remakes. Evil Dead stays true to the roots of the original film and while it does lack the absurdist humor of the more quotable entries, it does deviate in unique fashion and stands on its own.The first half of the movie very much follows in the same path set by the first film with the cabin in the woods and of course the group of unfortunates staying in it. While the movie doesn't establish a clear lead like the original did with Campbell's Ash, it does make most of the characters more substantial than they were in comparison to the original and the fact that there's no 1:1 analogues for characters from the original film is a good decision because it keeps the setting while also changing the dynamic and characters. The fact that the meta-horror film The Cabin in the Woods was released prior to this film does kind of undercut some of the material especially in regards to how comparatively unaware the characters are. But despite treading over some very familiar territory, Evil Dead does make it well worth it in a climax that does everything the original couldn't do and with no CGI meaning everything in the movie is a practical effect. Assuming you're a gore hound you'll find gore galore as buckets of blood and visceral rain (sometimes literally) throughout the movie and mess up the environment in creatively splatterly ways. I also liked the dynamic between Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez as Mia and David Allen who use the fact their brother and sister more than Ash and Cheryl did in the original film.In terms of Horror remakes I'd place Evil Dead somewhere around the level of Alexandre Aja's The Hills Have Eyes remake in that they're certainly polished with dialed up intensity, but they don't have the cynicism of something like a Platinum Dunes effort. A worthy addition to the Evil Dead canon.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It Is Serious Starting Right in the Beginning!,This film was one of the best remakes and had provided us less of a tree scene and more of a serious feeling. This is pretty freaky and some of the dialogue was kinda weird. Who knew Mia showed many similarities like Ash. I won't go into detail but there's some dialogue towards the end that I think the director purposely put out to reference the original. 7/10 for it's AMAZING graphics and a remake as terrifying and almost as Gory as the original.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror gore lovers,"This is definitely a movie for gore lovers, to say that this was a bad movie simply because of the gore is a bit much, horror is horror of all kinds. The story is great like the original from beginning to end with a few reminders from the original in the reimagining. I think props and blood and guts have a good deal in horror movies, I can appreciate a great ghost story or an insane family, but not to have gore and massive amounts of blood also helps its part in modern day horror films. Even in a comedic way, the amount of blood is staggering and sometimes there to just freak out the audience.

"""Cold Turkey can be Deadly""","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.Look, I'd watch pretty much anything with Jane Levy, and she's awesome in this, far better than any two other actors in the movie.It feels like someone with some sense look at the original movie and identified some much needed upgrades. Just having a dramatic reason for these characters to gather at this cabin immediately makes the story a bit more palatable than the original. There are also several sequences towards the end of the movie that diverge from the original that makes this version vastly superior.The other big difference is that the special effects has come a long way in the 30 years between the two movies. The do an excellent job of keeping the pacing of the first movie and matching the effects to the original, but just better.Similar to the original, the majority of this movie is gore effects, but they add just enough explanation and narrative to keep decent motivation in place.This is a rare example of how to ""upgrade"" a movie, changing it, but keeping the spirit of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How Remakes Should be Made!!,"The new Evil Dead is truly a remake that deserves to keep the original title. While countless horror remakes have failed over the years, Evil Dead manages to successfully return to the straight-up horror roots of the original while telling the story at a different time, with a different group of people, from a different perspective. It pretty much sticks to the original premise about a Book of the Dead that contains demon resurrection passages that when read, cause people to become crazy, possessed, self-mutilating Zombies. I still like the original Evil Dead better but when it comes down to it, it was made in 1981 and the effects are dated. The remake however, has excellent special effects and is super gory. There are honestly too many cringe inducing scenes for me list in this review but if I could summarize everything into one word it would be, Relentless. I strongly recommend the remake of Evil Dead to any and all horror fans, especially fans of the original series, you won't be disappointed. Be sure to sit through the credits for a special surprise.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ok, flawed remake","The Evil Dead scared the hell out of me back when I was 13-14. It was intense in the 80s, were we never had seen anything like it. 30 odd years later, the likes of Saw and Hostel has changed horror forever with the ""torture porn"" concept. So for the new Evil Dead, they went completely gung ho with splatter. The story is thinner than a sheet of paper. Mia is a heroin addict. People goes up to a cabin to help her get clean. A book in the cellar... witch clearly says DON'T OPEN, trapped in barb wire! Not only does the idiot open it, he starts chanting every word he find. On the plus side, you don't get the cliche of people looking for a cell phone signal. In fact, you never see a phone, making the setting timeless. And these people are just... people. No stereotypes to get annoyed over. They are just there. Dead by dawn, one by one. But it's so much blood and gore, you have to laugh in the end. Not just buckets of blood, in the end, it's raining blood. For... reasons. I btw never understood the concept from the Necronomicon to ""free someone from the demon"" (why would that even be in the book). The last 15 minutes makes very little sense, were the director/screenwriter goes overboard with the story. How exactly was Mia transformed back from a demon? Because of a car battery? Or the burrial. Or both?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Love it for the Horror, but missed some original Evil Dead Charm","I enjoyed this film for what it is. It's horror with some gore mixed in. There are also just enough tense scenes to make you jump out of your seat. If you were a huge fan of originals, you may miss some of that extra 80s cheese that made the film somewhat.. charming.The extra bonus is that you get some explanations in this film that were missing from the original films that makes them all tie together pretty well.The plot is not intricate, but the characters set the mood for the carnage very well. As another reviewer pointed out,the cinematography and graphics are done very well, and there aren't many CGI cop-outs. So kudos goes out to the graphics arts/special effects/make up teams.Still, if you loved the originals, you may be disappointed in the hopes that you're going to see Bruce Campbell running around telling jokes and fighting possessed humans. However, if you're looking for a gory, horror film, this one is a good one to catch. I happen to enjoy both.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing remake of a classic,"Well, I waited impatiently for this one, as the original is what made me a fan of the horror genre in the early eighties. Needless to say that this remake ruined a classic for me in so many ways.What made the original so compelling is that its idea was first of its kind back then (friends gather at a cabin in the woods and the horror ensues). Between 1981 and 2013, countless movies were made around the same general plot until the subject became a tacky horror cliché.You would think that, 32 years later, a remake would include some new elements or plot twists, or the story would be developed further in one or more directions, but alas, no. It's a just a pointless remake devoid of thrills.I kept waiting till the end for something intriguingly unique to happen, but unfortunately the film ended seeming as a boring and tired rehash not of the original, but of those countless horror B movies of the past 32 years.Way to ruin such a great classic...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid Re-Imagining of a Classic,"This is the remake to the low-budget classic. It does something that I think remakes should do, where it takes story elements and plot points, but then makes it it's own. This one I actually originally caught in the theater with my sister and since then have seen it a few times. The official synopsis for this film is five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of the Book of the Dead which leads them unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.As I started to say above, I'm not opposed to remakes when they do something that is different and can stand alone, which I think this one does. I like the reason they are at the cabin here. Mia (Jane Levy) is an addict. Her friends having her out there to get over the withdrawals as she tries to get clean. This is a place they can't easily leave and allows her to recover. Helping her are her brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez), and their friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas). Also with them is David's girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore).The film starts off with others that are possessed and an old woman informs the father how to get rid of the demon that possesses his daughter. When this group gets to the place, they find the aftermath of what happened there. Mia's heightened sense of smell due to the withdrawals leads them to what is in the basement. I found it interesting they went with a new look to the Necronomicon. I also like that the withdrawals make it so none of the people with her believe her when she starts to see things. They think it is her making things up in order to be taken home. I enjoy the nods and aspects of the original trilogy that are used, like a hand becoming infected, locking one of them in the basement and of course, the chainsaw. There are a couple parts of the story that I don't like though. One of them really hurt the story for me and it involves a car battery.Aside from that, I think the editing of this film is really good. The film doesn't take long to get into it and it builds tension from the beginning. I like the opening of showing us what is happening to another family that overcomes it before getting us to the main story we are following. I thought the ending for the most part was good and it does somewhat keep in line with the other films in the series. This is a popcorn movie and with this last viewing, Jaime watched it with me. She is normally bothered by possession films, where this one didn't have that effect.The acting was okay. I really like Levy as an actress and thought she was good in her role. I definitely believed her as a junkie that is trying to recover. I know she is an attractive woman, but they do some great work to really temper that for the role. Fernandez comes off as a little bland to me. I wanted more from him. I'm just not a fan and his performance here was lacking. Pucci I thought fit his role as the jerk high school teacher. He is upset with David and I thought it helps build tension. This is really all his fault as well. For what he goes through, it is fitting. I thought Lucas was good as well. She is a nurse, but there was something that bothered me about her. She seems a little too uptight and combative. Blackmore didn't really impress me; she kind of just fades into the back for a majority of this film. I also don't like her yelling at the friends of David, she probably literally just met all of them and I don't buy it. It is interesting is that Jaime falls in line here and stated things I hear in the horror community as well.Something I really have to commend this film is on the effects. The original two films had blood and some gore, but this one tops it. This is really where it sets itself apart in that this one is much more focusing on the body horror and it looks good. I do believe there is some CGI in this film. Some of it didn't hold up. This one definitely made cringe with how real some of the effects look. There is one thing that happens at the end that I don't buy happening, but it does look pretty amazing. There is a lack of blood at certain times that I noticed with this most recent viewing.I also found the soundtrack of the film to be good. The theme that is used is somewhat of a jump-scare and I found that to be interesting. During the climax it also sounds like they were using a tornado siren or an alarm of some sort. I like the vibe it gives the scene. I definitely think that the score of the film was fine and it helps to be the necessary tension for the scenes.Now with that said, I don't like this film better than any of the originals, but I do find this to be good still. I like that the direct and writer, Fede Alvarez, took something that was great and made some interesting changes. He brought enough of the story and things that happen as well. I like the concept of a junkie trying to sober up in a cabin in the woods when the evil gets unleashed. Focusing on the body horror was something that I also liked and the effects back up what they were going for. The editing builds the necessary tension that the film needs all the way to the climax and I thought the ending was good enough. The acting is okay. I really like Levy and thought the rest were just decent. The sound design of the film was fine. With that said, if you like the series, I think this film fits in pretty well for being different. It is pretty gory, so if that's not what you're into, I would avoid this. If that's not an issue, I think this film is fun.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Good Remake,"Entertaining, gory, and surprisingly fresh- Fede Álvarez's take on the classic horror flick is a surprisingly fun and scary remake that doesn't hold back. The main cast is pretty good for the most part, mainly Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez who play brother and sister in the film. The cast is rather small for the flick, but as for the other actors, they are certainly not as consistently good as the two leads- but they provide just enough into their performances to make them tolerable and pretty enjoyable. The cinematography is quite interesting and excellent, providing a fresh glimpse into the tale we all know. The script can struggle with uncertainties of how it wants to tell its story toward the beginning, but as it goes on, the film becomes very enjoyable, and quite fun to watch. It can be incredibly gory, violent, and downright grotesque, but it's all in good fun, and quite amusing to watch just how far the film is willing to go to push the limits. In the end, I was delighted to say that Evil Dead (2013) was a surprisingly decent remake that holds true to the original by also providing something fresh and exciting.
My Rating: 8.75/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A remake just for the fans,"I don't blame Sam Raimi for deciding to produce a remake of his original film. I absolutely do not. His original film, The Evil Dead (1981) has such a strong cult following that like several other films have received the Hollywood treatment of either getting a sequel, remake or prequel made in their name. What saddens me though is that I didn't find this movie anymore entertaining than its ancestor. There were a few slight pluses that distinguished it from the 1981 film but overall this remake made me favor the first one a little more.For the most part, the plot is the same as the 1981 movie - Teenagers decide to stay at a log cabin unknowingly surrounded by evil spirits that inhabit the forest that are currently lying dormant. The only way for them to be unleashed is by one of the curious teens to read the book of evil sayings. When this is done, gradually each teen is possessed and ends up either killing someone else or hurting themselves. However, I do give credit however to the four writers of the screenplay for at least slightly changing the back-story (two of which were Sam Raimi and director Fede Alvarez). As it turns out, these teens are not up in the cabin for a vacation. Out of two siblings in this group, one has an addiction problem with drugs, so the plan was to help her break the habit.Then again, this also confuses me because in the story, it sounded like these kids have previously visited this cabin before...so why didn't they notice all the dead animals hanging in the basement before? I don't get it. Oh and let's not forget the beginning scene. I honestly don't understand of what the relevance of it was. The characters involved with the scene are not connected in any way to the other characters that revolve around the plot...so why have it? The beginning scene was only connected to an inquiry that one of the main characters had, but besides that nothing else was explained to who these previous individuals were.And to bill this movie as the most terrifying movie - I highly disagree. The more psychological horror movies become, the more terrifying they are. Just having a ton of gore and creepy looking demonized individuals is not terrifying, especially if you are one who has seen plenty of other gore fests. And that possessed tree rape scene...the only other thing I could not stand. Something like that, no matter how lengthy on screen is not considered entertainment. I acknowledge that it is not real, BUT why would anyone want to see that? That's not horror. I said this about the Raimi's 1981 film as well.Besides the back-story being expanded on, I will also give credit to the acting, gore and music. The actors portrayed their characters very accurately as if they were really scared and frightened of what was happening around them. The gore was also definitely up there too. Depending on who you are, it'll either be gross out night or a ""eh whatever"" night. But to be honest, I'm only giving credit for having it and for being similar to its parent. I'm not saying that any of the kill scenes were original or innovative. They're more like nods towards the original.The one thing that I am sure about giving credit to is Roque Baños for his musical score to the film. Not only does Baños create some really dark and creepy tones and even some emotional tunes to the movie, but he also creates a main theme for the actual franchise. Throughout the film, audiences will get a chance to hear the specific tune that will belong to this franchise. If composer Joseph LoDuca had done that in 1981, I also would have enjoyed the original better too. Sadly Baños is the only thing that truly stood out to me as an improvement over this run-of-the- mill remake.Just like Raimi's first film, the remake to the original is by no means bad at being an efficient horror film, but it hardly makes anything more entertaining. The screenplay has an intriguing back-story and its score has improved but the only audiences it will truly please are its devoted fans.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great remake,"Evil Dead follows in the footsteps of its original, taking a while to get going but once it does the carnage just does not stop, offering what is easily one of the bloodiest horror films of all time and the scariest Evil Dead film so far. It also succeeds where many a remake fails in its balance between callbacks and originality.Also, as far as going to a secluded cabin in the woods goes, this film actually has a surprisingly smart central idea for that which allows it to do the usual set of tropes early on in a way that makes them less frustrating and more believable.Jane Levy gives a terrific lead performance that really puts her through everything by the time it's over. The rest of the cast are all good, their characters do dumb things but they make it work so it's only the good kind of annoying and they establish a solid bond early on.Fede Álvarez's direction is excellent, it makes sure to deliver the things that you can't help but expect from this franchise whilst still standing on its own 2 feet with it's own style and violent sensibilities. The music by Roque Baños is really good, extremely unusual and most importantly very oppressive.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Evil Dead takes the horror genre to the next level.,"Having been able to see the world premiere of this movie in Austin, with the cast and crew was an absolute dream!

Dead Evil!,"In truth this was always going to struggle to appease many of the horror hordes, Sam Raimi's original film held up as some sort of religious artifact that should never be tempered with - this even though it was considerably trumped by the sequel (erm: remake). Is it fair to say that even before it was released there were those hating it? It certainly seemed that way.Can you judge this piece of horror film making on its own terms? Are there a new breed of horror film fans out there whom haven't seen Raimi's trilogy and therefore can go into it and get the tar shocked out of them? I hope so because this is a rip-snorter of a remake. Full of jumps, guts, gore, and genuine moments of terror, with Fede Alvarez and his team adding some fresh touches to Raimi's original nightmare.It is what it is, a horror remake of an old favourite that ramps up the horror and uses the tools available to splinter the ears - turn the stomach - and fray the nerves. It's illogical, daft even at times, but this is one of the better horror remakes of recent times, a real pant soiler. Bravo you undead muthas. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pathetic,"We need money to survive,but in lieu of what? Our work.When we work we have a degree of pride that I am contributing to the society.When I started seeing Evil dead I thought the director will give us something to think,something to enjoy.Evil dead released long ago of our time and I really enjoyed the movie when I was a child.I had expectations.After seeing this on 2013 I feel pity about the director.Perhaps he need money more than anyone.Or he has a poor idea about the intelligence of commoners .In the movie he thought blood shower and severing arm is the best he can do and that will make people happy!! I am utterly disappointed with the I.Q of the director.He can start selling shoes rather than making movies,Pathetic,pathetic.why you need to make movie?!!You think just changing of scenes and adding more blood and gore will make you good director??

Outstanding 'remake' High quality horror,Evil Dead is a remake but one that actually works!This stands on its own merits and contains blood soaked scenes of terror and action.It starts well and ascends from there into a survival movie of carnage and is one of the great cabin in the woods films.The acting is top notch from a cast of relative unknowns and the tension is directed admirably well.The story is relatively simple but is enough for a movie that wants to scare and entertain.This entry in the new Evil Dead universe is a superior slice of modern horror and is far far better than the next entry 'Evil Dead Rise'.Don't doubt trying this excellent movie.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Evil Dead film with no camp and a big-budget.  I didn't ask for this.  Did you?,"Contemporary effort of the now-legendary 1981 Raimi film is refreshing at first, but finds itself being overlong once all the gore and scares have peaked in the middle. The story-differences between the old and new films create an intensity that gives fans from the original series an equal amount of jolts as the newcomers, and the cast is slightly more likable than your typical horror film—though that's still not saying a whole lot, unfortunately. The opening scene is completely unnecessary, even though it was pretty cool. The main issue with this film is the main issue with many remakes modernization. And the main issue with modernization is that itself will one day be outdated, not unlike its inspiration. Thus, pointlessness. The different ending doesn't change anything either; nice try. If the objective was to place the audience in Hell for 90 minutes, mission accomplished; but there is a feeling of emptiness when camp and low-budget are absent from an Evil Dead story.** (out of four)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"With all the liquid bodily fluids, a solid remake!","When word got out that Evil Dead, one of the most beloved horror/gorefests of the previous century, would get the remake treatment, most people were less than enthusiastic. Every decent horror movie from those decades had probably already been remade, and not even classics like Halloween proved untouchable enough for studios to stay away from. Most of the time, these 'reimaginations' (as they are euphemistically called) lacked the skill, bravado or craftsmanship of the originals, and even if they managed to match their quality, they often lacked creativity, originality or daring vision.I love the original Evil Dead films for their energetic pacing and humorously icky approach to horror, so I wasn't convinced either that an Evil Dead remake was something the world needed. On the other hand, I was too young to watch the Evil Dead films when they came out, so they are not sacred to me, and I like to keep an open mind to all developments in the horror genre. Unexpectedly, the new Evil Dead was released with high praise from many critics and fans, and as far as I'm concerned, Evil Dead can take its place among The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and Dawn of the Dead (2004) as horror remakes that can peacefully coexist with their respective originals. Why? Because they take what was good from the original, yet also add something new. They start on the same road, yet don't walk it all the way to the end, taking the occasional sidetrack that brings a few surprises.Both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell co-produced the movie, stating a desire to revisit their beloved first project, and do things with it they had not done yet. Usually, when the original creators say something like that, it seems to mean that they were notified about the remake, and received a sum of money in exchange for taking an executive producer's credit and providing active support for the new movie. But Evil Dead Reborn is different. The original film had such a massively inventive display of special effects and in-your-face energy that it was easy to look beyond the holes in the screenplay and the technical shortcomings; audiences these days won't fall for that so easily, but the writers came up with a great screenplay that allows for plenty of scares and physical horror, without resorting to a lazily-written re-thread. We start out on comfortably familiar grounds, in a cabin in the woods, where a group of young people inadvertently awaken an old evil that takes possession of them, one by one. One of the nice touches is that when the terror starts affecting the ex-drug addict, the rest initially explains it away as on of her drug withdrawal hallucinations. Needless to say, when they finally get smart and want to leave, the bridge is gone and there is no escape.One big departure this movie takes from the original is the tone. Where the original movies were violent and gruesome, yet appropriately slapstick due to the anarchistic photography and excessive amounts of gore, the remake is more serious, sincerely terrifying, nerve-wrecking, and has some well-timed shocks. Two aspects of the originals were kept: the frenetic pacing, and the copious amounts of bodily fluids. Where most horror movies muddle through introductions and set-up, and don't pick up speed until well after an hour (leaving only thirty minutes until the end), this movie shifts into high gear after 25 minutes, and keeps speeding up until the end. And in a day and age where studios try to contain the amount of splatter in order to not scare off the general public and keep the movie financially profitable, we get showered with amounts of gore quite unheard of since the eighties. I found it disturbingly pleasant to see such an old-school amount of blood, rotting flesh and severed appendages flying around, which could have easily become ridiculous, yet nowhere does it completely undermine the creepy punch the movie delivers.Although not overtly goofy as its predecessors, this movie isn't without its subtle yet crude humor, for instance when Eric slips over a piece of skin that Olivia has just cut from her face; the improvised amputation with an electric knife, the nail gun antics, and the final appearance of the true star of each Evil Dead movie: the chainsaw, which makes for good old-fashioned mayhem. It is fun to see how the creators have added new elements, such as the Abomination, and found ways to present big and small elements from the originals with inventive twists.Of course, many people will think the original was perfect, and the remake is useless by default; they complain that it is too much of the same, or straying too far from the source. Some say it is ridiculous with dumb characters. Well, what horror movies doesn't contain characters doing unwise things? Most horror plots are actually moving forward due to people doing ill-advised stuff. What can we say? Times change. The original movies had their shortcomings as well, but they were a perfect product of their time, and work exceptionally well within that context. The makers of the remake acknowledged that modern audiences have different perspectives of horror movies, and I think they did a fine job translating Evil Dead to a new era. Bruce Campbell himself helped to get it made, and he concludes the movie in a post-credits scene with his signature 'Groovy!' Who am I to argue with Ash?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Honest Review,"So the hype, yup even the poster cranks that one up a notch by saying it's the most terrifying film like ever!!!I'll start off by saying that a lot of the reviews on here are from people who have not even seen the film, they started bashing it before its release so. Ignore any you see before the date of the film's release.I've watched the original, scared the hell outta me as a kid and respected it a lot more as a film lover over the years.This film? It's a different sort of Evil Dead, it's what I like to call Glossy Horror, the sort of Horror film that looks good with a good budget and doesn't wanna make you hurl by looking cheap and nasty.the best way to walk into this film was by thinking ""this is a spin off"" it's TOTALLY NOT!!! But a lot of people are comparing it to the original and it just kept the basics. A revision. There were a lot of things in the original that didn't make it into the 2013 version, such as the demons creepy playful singing and laughing and just being bat sh!t cray!!!! But then there are things about the 2013 version that was just amazing to watch such as the finale!!! What a showdown!!!It's not a scary film,, it's really not and a lot of peoples reviews just made me think that they were putting it on for the sake of looking tough but I'm not sure if this is what they were going for but it doesn't go for the cheap scares, its more ""watch whilst this chick totally messes her face off you still watching? Of course you are! You paid for it!"" but the film is very WTF!!!If you're a hardcore film lover then this is a good film, if you're not so much then I would say this might be too intense for you it's a very graphic and violent film and there a certain films that I won't watch again just because they cross the line and are unnecessary,An example, Hostel part 2, girl being hung upside down, that for me was too much. Walking out of the cinema, my partner and me got chatting and he felt that this film crossed the line too much, so I guess its your own thoughtsThe acting it's a strong cast, the BFF was the best of the bunch, it seemed that she had more to give and it was a shame she was first out!! Mia was a strong focal point but bad editing and sound effects caused her best lines to run away with her and some lines actually sounded a little slurred she came into her own in the final act and if it wasn't for that scene, I would have written the character off as a body count as we didn't really see much of her before and during as she was well a mess the bro was a misleading ASH if you wanna call him that, he was one to route for, Natalie was the most underwritten, a line here and there and then when there were a few less characters left I was waiting for her to ""nail it"" and, ummm she didn't it has nothing to do with the actress who was brilliant, I just wanted more from the character which she never got the chance to do and finally, that guy that's always a stoner and does the wrong thing like read demonic books? Actually one of the best, completely surprised me, a lot of heart and not what to expect, his last line was just sweet!The film shots are beautiful, I think they managed to capture every single good angle of darkness the only reason I didn't get the full score was just down to one thing from the Original. Ash has to survive the night alone. This was truly an amazing horror scene back in the day and I was always on the edge of my seat and to have the rights to work with the original and not use this was just a waste, the clips from the trailer that didn't make it into the film were just frustrating as this is what I call false advertising and I hate it when they do this. The film did dip a little in the middleBut overall, it's a good horror, its bloody, its fresh and it's a lot of fun!One last note, the music was excellent, the sound of a WW2 alarm ringing out was epic!!! Sharp and clever!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More 'Evil Dead' than 'Evil Dead 2',"Unlike a lot of the people interested in the Evil Dead remake, I was not really a fan of the original Evil Dead. I was, however, a big fan of Evil Dead 2, which was in many ways a remake of Evil Dead. The second film kept the first film's elements of fear, creepiness and gore and added a bad ass protagonist, humor and creative violence. I was disappointed that this 2013 remake seemed to draw its inspiration only from the first film.Even though I'm not a fan of the original Evil Dead, I think this film is inferior in many ways. It does away with subtlety almost completely and draws on more clichés than the original, which does not help with creating suspension of disbelief. It goes to greater lengths to try to explain what's going on, but the explanations don't make any sense. And I know main characters acting foolishly is a common joke about horror movies, but this one took it to new heights of stupid.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"All the gore, none of the charm","Like many horror remakes, this improves on the visual effects and updates the hairstyles but strips all the charm and originality from the story. The Evil Dead remake is competently made, has lots of gore, and is thoroughly suspenseful but it will never rival the original or any of its sequels.The remake begins with the burning of a witch in our cabin in the woods by a group of Deliverance style hillbillies. We don't know precisely when this action is occurring, but it would seem to be in a previous era. Later evidence suggests that this actually might have been quite recent. The MF profanity, for instance, has only been in use since the late 60s. There are animal corpses still not completely desiccated when the kids arrive. And there is evidence of a break-in at the cabin since the last time it was visited. The cabin, by the way, is still on the electrical grid. No harbinger warns the kids, so we're never exactly told the significance or history of the cabin itself. We're not precisely told when the story is set, but it seems modern day.The five young characters arrive, and in this scenario, they are there to assist in the intervention/detox of heroin addict Mia. The characters don't seem to like one another, and except for estranged brother David, their relationships are unclear. They would seem to have been childhood friends who previously visited the cabin. But most of the characters seem awfully prim to have maintained a relationship to a self destructive heroin addict. I never quite figured out where the hippie character Eric fit in. He's not even in the movie as stoner or comic relief. His chief duty in the movie is to discover the necronomicon, unleash the evil and try to warn the other characters. The necronomicon, while we're on the subject, is among the movies worst flaws. It looks like a goth teen's notebook full of pencil sketches and ""scary,"" profane jargon in red ink. A second flaw is that none of these characters has any real personality.The detox angle has possibilities, because – as in Trainspotting – people coming down from drugs often have terrible hallucinations. But the main point in this story seems to be as an excuse to stop Mia from fleeing the cabin. However, they do not disable the cars, so Mia takes off at her first chance where she meets the witch in the woods, who – in a scene straight out of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday – infects Mia with evil by throwing up a black oozy snake which crawls up Mia's skirt into her body.Mia's infection and the subsequent killing of other characters is done in gory zombie movie fashion. Mia actually behaves quite a bit like Regan in The Exorcist. I recall the original zombies being full of joyful, laughing evil, which was part of its campy charm. The post possession scenes become a stalk and slash with various weapons around the cabin. It will be a treat for fans of gore; the movie doesn't skimp. But I also don't recall hearing any trouble about it with the MPAA.There is some originality particularly toward the ending, as the movie takes some twists and switches heroes and villains. The movie lets you know that animals aren't off the table as victims, etc. It is a bit of a flaw to not know whether it is Mia or the witch who is the movie's main villain. During scenes where Mia returns to her own identity, she appears to bear none of the scars that would surely result from all the violent action she's been through. Overall, it's a competent, scary horror movie. But the characters or mythology do not win over the viewer. This is unlikely to itself become any sort of long lived phenomenon and I wouldn't expect anybody to come out of this movie with the cult following attached to those involved in the original. BTW, I write this before the movie has officially premiered and the 7+ point IMDb rating it currently enjoys (virtually unheard of for a horror movie), has been incredibly inflated by fanboys.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie destroyed the series,"So after watching The Evil Dead, I have to say I was far from Impressed. The Story line started strong but made me loose interest quickly as the movie was filled with Animal Abuse, Intense Gore. The Plot remained the same but toward the end it got really stupid, it branched off into a totally different direction which compared to the first three ( which I loved) made NO sense at all. The High end technology that had gone into the movie was fantastic, but I found my self questioning where the original Cast was namely Ash and as the movie progressed I came to realize that this movie had to have been the beginning or origin of the Evil Dead movies.There was many different times I had to turn away due to the intense violence the movie offered me, and at many a times it seemed that the director only focused on how much gore he could produce rather than making a compelling story line. Toward the end as things took a rapid turn for the worse I found myself only wanting this movie to end but it continued to not only confuse and destroy my belief in the series but I just couldn't wait for it to end. Honestly I would have given this movie 3/10 stars and that was mostly justified by the amount of gore and special effects.. does anyone else think they should have let the evil dead alone or do you think this was worth waiting for, personally I don't and hope they don't make another one",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody thrill-fest,"Evil Dead (2013) is totally wicked. I've seen it a couple of times now and it is such a joy to both watch and experience with others who haven't seen the terrors that pack out this hour and a half of blood soaked madness.After watching Sam Raimi's original trilogy (with the perfection that is Bruce Campbell), I was really excited to see that the Evil Dead had been given a fresh, new horrifying reboot. I was even more excited, however, to have been totally wowed by how exceptional this piece of horror turned out to be.The story isn't mind blowing, but it didn't need to be as the familiar cabin in the woods trope was made plenty claustrophobic with Mia's interesting character and her attempting to overcome drug addiction (again), with of course all that entails in any Evil Dead movie. The kills are brutal, the blood is plentiful, and the twists and turns leading to that all so glorious finale will not disappoint.Jane Levy's performance as Mia certainly deserves serious praise. As the core character she thrives in both her horrifying portrail of possession and in selling Mia's desperate state. I can't sing her praises enough, she takes this film to new heights and I couldn't see anyone else in the role.The Evil Dead is a wonderful franchise and I believe Evil Dead (2013) is a great instalment in developing the more brutal side of what can be unleashed by the Necronomicon. Closing the curtains and turning out the lights couldn't be more thrilling with Evil Dead on the screen, this is a must watch for all horror fans alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Humanized evil and lost touch with the original,"I had such high hopes for this movie, having read some of the reviews. It was a pity then to see it, disgusted at how low-end it was.The original was a work of art, succeeded only by part two. The madness that the Ancient Ones were portrayed having - to utterly inhuman perspective - was interesting and poignant. The absurdity was the alien nature of the Old Ones, and how it was handled by the magnificent Bruce Campbell.This version is cold, to say the least. The Ancient Ones have been given human values of evil, and the human characters are all imbeciles. The director seems to have no feeling for the Lovecraftian evil, that is both bizarre and ridiculous. We are talking about praeter-natural beings that move between the spaces, completely oblivious to the workings of the human mind, but this movie makes them into your common psychopath killer, with human motives.The fear that entices in the original is not the life of the characters, but their mortal sanity and very soul. Here it is all about staying alive; the risk for your soul scattered about more like an after-thought. Tons of blood and seemingly almost immortal humans are kept alive until the last parts of the movie, where they die in pointless manners, so that you just go , ""So what?!"" or even ""Finally!"" instead of ""WOW that was!"".The final scenes are the biggest yawn in history, without giving spoilers.It is a testament to Sam Raimi - who created the first Evil Dead - that with the limited budget he managed to create a classic. This becomes even more apparent seeing how an AAA budget could miss the mark so greatly.The funniest part is that it isn't even entertaining in a bad way. The production value is great, the effects are stellar, the cast of actors know their job; what is missing is the soul and the mystery.Something the movie DID accomplish was to make me want to go and see the original trilogy again.

You will likely only remember it for a few minutes after the film has finished.Bruce Campbell and the rest of the crew were consistently hyping this film as the bloodiest film ever made. That is not reason enough to create a film, and besides they fell short of many Japanese Splatter films as well as most recent faux exploitation films.However, I will say that for a young director it is impressive that he was able to craft something that looks as stylish as it does.Evil Dead fans should see it and so should most people, just to support horror films making it to the 'big time'.But please lower your expectations and do not believe the hype you have heard from clueless critics.5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great remake!!,"Those who follow my profiles on different social networks know that I'm not a fan of the horror genre, due to its implausibility, its lack of conviction and its extreme morbidity. There are few bloody blockbusters that have managed to catch my attention. As incredible as it may seem, this remake of a cult film (but horrible, as you may have read in one of my previous reviews), is one of them.Unlike the original material, this movie is well written, in a serious, intelligent way and filling in the many plot holes left by the 1981 film. Everything has a logical explanation, everything has its reason for being, everything has a cause and consequence. Nothing is shown, just because. The seriousness of this film even reaches the technical aspects, as the soundtrack is really spectacular, the photography is exquisite and the editing highlights the changes of pace and leaves the plot as a well-rounded story. The most brutal sequences are well supported with special and visual effects, making the action shots well used. Everything in its place, so that the cast can shine, and boy did they do it, being convincing at all times.This is the way things should have been done in the 80's with Raimi's saga. The difference in budgets is no excuse for being able to achieve a quality product with such a simple and flat story. Even that improves here. The characters have a background that serves the plot itself. Although they don't have much development, their stories already explain several things in a better way.Evil Dead really surprises me pleasantly and closes a month of horror with a rather pleasant feeling.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
10/10 for the Biased Reviews,"Great sequel to ""The Evil Dead"" from Sam Raimi in 1981. For those that say this is missing the slapstick humor of Bruce Campbell, this isn't a remake nor is it a sequel to Evil Dead 2 and AoD. This is a sequel to the original, which means it carries the spirit for what it was then (Serious and Disturbing). Unfortunately, this was not known to many so a lot of the 'negative' reviews are of people who see this as an inferior remake or as not a true successor to the trilogy as a whole. Remember Halloween from 2018? This is exactly the same approach. If you don't take my word for it, rewatch the film and keep an eye out for a rusted 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88. If that's not obvious enough, read the director's comment on this being a sequel to the original (the director is known as Fede Alvarez, hand selected by Sam Raimi himself); you're welcome.P.S. If you have seen the theatrical cut of this film and liked it even in the slightest, I recommend watching the Director's Cut that was released a few months ago on Blu-Ray in preparation of the sequel Fede announced last year. I hope Bruce considers pushing two more out; Army of Darkness 2 (Mad Ash in Post-Apocalyptic Earth) & Evil Dead III (Ash-Mia Crossover), in which Ash attempts to return back to the present but ends up in a parallel reality where he died at dawn, giving Fede's Evil Dead Sequel a faithful direction with Ash's car remaining on the property.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Groovy""","What a glorious remake.There's primarily one reason to see this film: the violence. When you think it's reached its most sadistic peak, the movie pushes the envelope further until you're completely desensitized to what's happening on screen. The crescendo of the splatter comes in the finale with a chainsaw--you won't be disappointed.Evil Dead is an amazing homage to the slasher genre. If you took ""Night of the Demons"" and bred it with ""Cabin Fever,"" you would get this amazing Evil Dead remake that is so fun and enjoyable to watch, you forget you're watching a bunch of sexy idiots get hacked up and chewed on to death.For gore hounds, Evil Dead (2013) is almost impossible to beat in mainstream cinema except for maybe the I Spit On Your Grave unrated remakes.

Absolutely disgusting,"Evil Dead, the ""remake"" of the classic Sam Raimi film, is one of the better horror remakes of the modern time, or at least I've seen in a while, usually in remakes we see the exact same events of the original happen with usually no changes, and while that isn't entirely not the case here, this remake actually manages to build on the story and kinda connect the timelines together.While the characters in this movie keep it from being capital G great, the kills are absolutely insane, this is one of the goriest, bloodiest movies I've ever seen in my life, right on par with Terrifier 2, the acting isn't what I'd call phenomenal but all the suspense is high tier.The last 20 minutes of this movie will keep you on your toes the whole time, and instead of just cheap jump scares the movie puts in actually suspenseful scenes, and also scares the living daylights out of you, like it did me.Evil Dead gets an A-",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mislead and extreme disappointment.,"Saw this last night here in the UK. I am soooo peed!!! Its was beyond CRAP!!. I't was just an extremely poor, regular horror flick with absolute no story to keep you gripped. My best friend stopped me from walking out towards the end of the movie :(Yes, I was curious, being a Evil Dead fan, but what persuaded me to watch this was IMDb.I made the mistake of trusting IMDb's ratings so early when a movie is released (that said 7.2 / 15,000 views) and trusted that all the ratings are going to be genuine.Anyway, watched it, and yes, I cried. No way on in this universe anyone would score this above 4. I can not believe that for a second. I went back to IMDb site, wondering why the hell people recommended this crap, and found all the recent reviews were all in-between 1/10 and 3/10. All the old (most probably fake reviews) were rated at around 7/10 to 10/10.Obviously, the marketing team of this movie, faked reviews on IMDb before the real people got a glance at how bad this movie was..Being an Evil Dead fan, I really was curious but I wouldn't have watched it, if I knew it was this bad. You can't beat an original horror flick and I don't know what possessed me (get it;) to think its going to be alright... Thanks IMDb :(Conclusion: Be prepared to be peed. And the only horror your going to experience, is how I've tried my best to convince you, NOT to see this, yet your curiosity took the better of you and forced you to burn a few hours of your precious life. Don't say I didn't warn you!!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead - without the cheese,"Don't get me wrong, with Bruce Campbell, stop motion animation, and Sam Raimi's hyperactive camera style, the original Evil Dead is one of my favourites from the golden age of horror. This remake at first suckers you into thinking your going to get some tame re-hash (like the Crazies remake) before rubbing your face in a vomit inducing pile of gore.Just like the first one, five folks head out to a cabin in the woods, only this time it's to help junky Mia get off the skag. Mia thinks something's up in the cabin, but no one believes her as she's going through withdrawal. Really though, the fault lies in the geeky guy who rather naively opens a book bound by barbed wire, ignores the 'don't read this' warning, and opens some gateway that lets a demon through that starts possessing the youngsters (starting with Mia).This is when the film really takes off, and tries to up the original in the gore stakes. People cut their own faces off, get stabbed repeatedly in the face with syringes, cut their own limbs off and use all the last toilet paper without replacing it with a new roll. There's gallons of blood here and like the original, people do stupid things for stupid reasons, and there's aspects of the film you'll be scratching your head at.On the other hand, you can't go wrong with a horror film that goes all out in the horror stakes. Gave me the dry bowk, as they say in Glasgow.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great remake!,"When I knew there will be a ""The Evil Dead"" remake I got angry, even I refused to watch this film when it was theatrically realeased. I watched this remake three years later, same story with some character changes, fulled of gore and with a creepy cinematohraphy and locations like the original one, but I really enjoyed this remake or alternative version, it has a special touch.

A horror film with ill intent and simply mean,"I like the original evil dead films, I normally don't like mixing horror and comedy, but the original series made it work, the remake is 100% undiluted horror. I love when a remake tries to be different, and this one really works. There isn't any other way to put it, this movie batters the audience without mercy. The first 30 minutes or so is just building the story, some could consider it slow, but it builds a solid foundation. Once the story is set the remainder is a nonstop visual assault not for the faint of heart. The violence is extreme, the scenes are intense, and I can't imagine finding anything to laugh at. If you haven't seen it and are trying to get a feel for if it's for you, the best comparison I can make on the tone is the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the Hills Have Eyes, so this film is in very good company.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was overwhelmed with shame and disappointment. I am confused why Raimi and Campbell would put their names on this hunk of crap, and have no intentions on watching the sequel if there is one.This movie is not good because; it lacks any form of a story or cohesive plot, there is no character development-but in the least there is no desire to form attachments because they are all annoying, the movie is boring, and the horror scenes are cliché.

Worthy remake,"I don't mind remakes. Just about all horror remakes are fun to watch, but there's nothing special to them. This is one of the best if not the best horror remakes there is. The original is one of my favorite scary movies, and while this one is not as good, its stands above the show(or what I've seen of the show which is season 1) evil dead 2 and army of darkness. It was cool seeing the same story, but in a more scary humorless tone. Very creepy throughout. Likable characters. Tones of outrageous gore. Even more than the original. Final scene is creepy, intense, bloody, and has a really inventive kill. Definitely worth watching. It's better to watch it as it's own thing and not as a remake to the original.

A Poor Attempt to Recreate a Classic Horror Film,"This film is a pathetic rendition of both Evil Dead I and II and they should be ashamed of the horrible job they did. I understand that they tried to recreate much of what Sam Raimi did in the 80's but they failed miserably, relying on poorly done special effect ""shock"" scenes to attract viewers. For those of us who grew up seeing the original films there is much to be appreciated about the impressive effects that Raimi accomplished without the use of computers. Considering the technology available in Hollywood today this was really poorly done and I was very surprised to see the 7.4 rating on IMDb.

NOT Exactly What Its Hyperbolic Poster Would Have Us Believe,"I have not seen the original 1981 ""Evil Dead"" by Sam Raimi, so I am judging this film on its own merit, not on how loyal it was to the original. Horror film that I am, I must say I do not like blood and gore type horror films. So the fact that this film had gallons of blood and gore splattering, gushing and dripping all over the place certainly did not make me like it more.The premise was rather shallow. Five people are gathered in one lonely cabin in the woods supposedly to help one of them, Mia, get over heroin addiction. However, when one of them finds a chain-bound book in the basement and started reading the mysterious words it warned him NOT to read, then the demon awakens and the bloody mayhem begins, killing them one by one, until the inevitable last man (or woman) standing.Nothing was spared to make each member of the cast all bloodied up. There just happened to be an electric knife, a nail gun, a chainsaw, anything and everything to slice, to stab, to dismember, to maim, everything to make a gory film gory. So if you hate blood, you should not watch this at all. Gallons and gallons of blood-like liquid were used in shooting this film.As I have mentioned, I do not particularly like blood and gore type horror films. I went into this movie not knowing that this would be like ""Halloween,"" ""Texas Chainsaw"" or similar massacre type films. I confess I cringed and averted my eyes alright, as there were truly disgusting scenes. But I have to say that this definitely was NOT the ""astonishing,"" ""astounding,"" ""awesome,"" and ""near perfect experience"" that its hyperbolic poster would have us believe.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Different from the original, but incredibly sensational!","In the 2000s, we had a wave of horror remakes such as Friday the 13th (2009), Halloween (2007), Carrie (2013) and so on. But, none of these were as successful as Evil Dead (2013). Being a remake with as much originality as the first one from 1981!Unlike the original, its aesthetic is much darker and macabre, without the comic strips. But, like the original, it has many more practical than digital effectives, it is extremely brutal and bloodthirsty. Excellent direction and driving of the film, pulling the horror to the max!Script with important differences, being a reinterpretation of the work today, as the very reason for the young people to be there, which is the case about drugs of the character Mia. In addition to having this fundamental change, there are others within the film that make it extremely original. But, the gore and brutality of the original is super explicit here!A totally different and original ending, with more blood than any movie has ever had!

A Nutshell Review: Evil Dead,"It's hard to live up to one's tagline, especially when it's screaming the words ""most terrifying"", because it's building expectations sky high, only for it to come out a little bit underwhelming, despite having cult classic pedigree backing it. Evil Dead is that continuation of the Sam Raimi Evil Dead films that had Bruce Campbell in the starring role, but this installment is all seriousness without the camp, which made it a little bit dreadful to sit through, and an exercise in excessiveness.With the slew of horror and slasher films trying to out-gore one another, a plateau has been reached as to how many times something can be dismembered on screen, full on view, without the need to cut away for decency. Then comes the gushing of copious amounts of blood fit for vampires partaking in their own version of Oktoberfest. There's a limit to how much is enough, though that limit has constantly been pushed further and further away, that it's probably not far fetched to start pondering about how much more the envelope can get pushed, before enough is enough. When one's desensitized, the ability of shock-and-awe diminishes, and the obsession to drape everything in blood isn't really healthy.But I digress. Credit has to go where credit is due, and the entire make up department deserves that pat on the back for making its main cast of five look grotesque when they needed to be, given that the Book of the DeadXX has unleashed a demon amongst the midst of five young adults, who are assembled in an isolated cabin in the woods to assist one of them, Mia (Jane Levy), to kick her drug habit. This in itself is a smart premise, because when Mia experiences spooky occurrences, it could be brushed aside and treated as just another side effect, until of course it's too late. Iconic scenes do not get replaced, so when Mia issues her threats while under possession, you'd know just what to expect.The body count's pretty low here for obvious reasons there are only a handful of characters, but there were some nifty moments to ensure some of them got recycled as part of the plot. There's possessions and mind control, coupled with characters who can take a lot of punishment given the slew of weaponry being targeted at them, from chain saws to machetes to a nail gun. It has everything including the kitchen sink, and everything and anything can be used as fair game to stop the madness from decaying from within each of the characters.As an expansion to the Evil Dead franchise, this has set itself up pretty neatly for future installments for this component, and the established mythos, to collide some time in the future. The soul, erm, sole redeeming factor here will be the finale, with Fede Alvarez crafting what would be an excellent scene of Man vs Monster that would be a no brainer as the poster-child of the movie, and one that's most memorable. It's a pity it had to plod along to get to the best part.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice remake/ reboot,"Re-making a movie which has cult classic status is very difficult. You have to impress the fans of the original which is not an easy work but Fede Alvarez (the director) did a great job.It contains shock gore just for the gore. If you thought this was going to be a supernatural type then forget it. It is more of horror type than supernatural.Yes, it didn't look like the original but that didn't cause any problem. Back then a few effects were done with stop motion, which I didn't like. In this one, CGI is used very brilliantly. Everything looks perfect and real. The movie was scary and horror environment was perfect.The acting was also good. I liked that humour was not included in this. Humour is not needed in these type of movies.I don't know what critics want. This deserved same/ more rating than the original. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to everyone.

Very bad copy of a great movie.,"Fede Alvarez, did what Asylum, pictures does and that is take a great movie and copy the theme and change it a little and the finished product is a total waste of the viewers time. This movie was neither well acted or scary. I had a hard time watching the whole movie but I did hoping it would get better because I have copies of the 1981 version starring Bruce Campbell, which was the scariest movie I had ever seen then and the sequel ""Evil Dead part 2"" (1987) which was also great but this movie never got better only worse.The special effects were cheap but not too bad and that's all I can say about it. I wish people would stop wasting moviegoers time by copying other masterpieces thinking theirs is as good or better because I haven't seen this to be true yet. Someone should also look into how Asylum, and others get away with making such bad copies of brand new major motion pictures just by changing the titles a tiny bit.

Not a worthy remake,"Usually good or even great remakes go in a different direction but has certain similarities to the point you can call it a remake but better or at least as good or even near good. Or go in a similar direction but has it's own flare for it to be worth a remake. But that really isn't the case for this one. All of the characters in this combined just couldn't replace Bruce Campbell as Ash. And never felt even remotely attached to any of them. It's 2013 and it there is better technology to make things appear real. And although the original ""Evil Dead 1 and 2"" lacked the technology and looks fake in certain areas. It's just a more scary and suspenseful movie, plus it's even creepy and has uncomfortable dark humor to go with it. This remake lacks everyone of these elements. Sure it has more graphic imagery that is cringe worthy and I did cringe during few scenes. Although I have seen even more graphic movies before. But I never felt like I was entertained or scared. And I do think this movie's tagline is false, it's just isn't all that terrifying. The beginning few minutes starts out well and eerie but it quickly becomes dull. I just don't get the constant positive reviews this movie is getting. It's actually somewhat of a hit at box office so there will be a sequel but currently just isn't interested or hyped for it. I think I rather re-watch the whole original ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Or just re-watch ""The Cabin in the Woods"" which the makers of this movie was probably inspired by because of it's success. Although ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was inspired by many many different horror movies. The thing is Sam Raimi actually help produce this movie and it is still a let down.

Faces at different times,"The Evil Dead (1981) tells of a story that a crowd of young people come to a cabin and accidentally evoke the demons in the wood through 'Book of the Dead'. Actually to say, I love its tempo! The tight plot moves the tempo of this film forward so quickly, as if there are so many monstrous scenes bumping into my sight form every corner. Even every step the film characters take brings me the feeling that something evil is always watching every breath and every second. However, the tempo of the re-make Evil Dead (2013) is apparently slower than the original. But I think it is a great re-make version! Because the atmosphere of terror in the re-make is better than the original through the delicate camera movements and exquisite film set. In the plot, the cliché is not as simple as the original one. It has the new idea of some gore-spreading and slaughtering scenes. It is very creative. Only one thing I have to say is the impression of the faces in the film at different times. It seems that the makeup techniques and computer-generated images in 1981 are old-fashioned, but I think the possessed faces in the original is more horrible than the faces in the re-make. These faces in the original and the symptoms of the possessed people make me think of The Exorcist (1973). Maybe the horror films about the possessed at that time all do that alike makeup technique so that the faces are similar.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary if you are 10 years old,"I am not a horror genre fan I admit, but I do enjoy them from time to time, but this film is an example of what is wrong with the Genre now. Remakes of classics, with nothing new to add, why take the step at all if the step is backward? The same old lazy horror clichés, for example, the mirrored bathroom cabinet opened, and when the door is shut, the reflection has changed, and why do Hollywood now think that the scariest image we can cunjure is a girl with long black hair covering her face in a nightie? Any tension built in the film was because I was getting annoyed by the characters doing the same horror film mistakes 'go on, get back down in the cellar, the thing wont get you this time!' I found myself laughing at the parts which were meant to be the most disturbing, probably because the director is treating the viewer in the lowest regard, by simply making the film as gory as possible, throwing as much fake blood around as they could lay their money grabbing hands on, and not really bothering to think of any original ideas.Avoid this film, or watch it if you want, what do I care?",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally worth the time to watch,"Something people don't understand about remakes is that the entire point is to ""remake"" the original to be something that younger movie-going audiences (that weren't around for the originals) will enjoy. Altering parts of the plot and making a new story is part of the remake franchise. This film was no exception. If you're a die-hard fan of the original odds are you won't like the remake. However, today's younger audiences see originals (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Evil Dead) to be cheesy and dull so the only way to make these films more appealing to younger crowds is to add a bit of gore and a bit more story. Is this film cliché? Of course! The original film set the standard for what cheesy horror is all about so the remake's full attempt was to be cliché as well. Regardless of how it compares to the original it has gore, the supernatural, and an overall eeriness that makes it worth watching.

The only characters I cared for were Mia (the main character) and her brother. The others were very zombie-like,emotionless and seemed like fill ins, I didn't really care to see if or how they ended up. Because of this the movie was more gory to me then scary. It's only scary to me when I develop feelings for the cast and I didn't get that for most of the movie. There were some funny parts, but nothing compared to Sam Raimi's versions.

Fantastic remake of The Evil Dead (not Evil Dead II),"As a card carrying deadite fanatic I went to this movie with the bar set high and I wasn't let down. Whats great about this movie is that for once a remake strikes a balance with frights, novelty, and lip service.I was very surprised to see some mixed reviews for this film but found the rational given for in most of them was actually based on a fallacious premise that this was a remake of Evil Dead II. If your looking for a remake of Evil Dead II, your gonna have a bad time. Go see Cabin in the Woods if your on the market for a lighter take with more goofiness. The original Evil Dead is still one of the scariest movies ever, and this movie did an excellent job of holding its own.Like the -original- Evil Dead, slapstick comedy is low/absent while scares, violence, and gore are raining from the sky. In retrospect the decision to exclude an Ash character was a stroke of genius and allowed me to really enjoy the hell out of this movie without trying to compare and contrast a role that any fan would agree could only be filled by Bruce Campbell himself.With the assistance and blessing of all the original key players (read the credits and note the Campbells, the Raimis, and the Taperts) the unproven newcomer Alvarez has outdone himself in crafting a great horror experience that will surprise both fans of the original and new comers alike. The fresh take on the old story is still peppered with dozens of clever throwbacks to the original without feeling forced or distracting.The gore is bar none with classic effects taking center stage with CGI functioning as support. The result gives Evil Dead a look and feel that is coarser, chewier, and more... sinewy then recent comparable horror films. Wash it all down with blood by the buckets and there you have it.

A Clever and Relentless Bloodbath of a Remake with a Dominating Female Lead,"In his full length feature directorial debut Fede Alverez, this film Evil Dead starring Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore, was the film that Sam Raimi set out to originally make. And this remake came out swinging. And this remake came out swinging. Produced and given the blessing by the creators of the original trilogy, Bruce Campbell, Rob Tapert, and man himself, Sam Raimi, this remake was indeed on the road to success.The story stays relatively consistent to the original. A group of friends go up to a cabin, discover an evil book, and evil is awoken, only to reek havoc on the souls on the young bunch. But what separates this movie from the original is that this isn't a generic cabin in the woods, college party turned wrong movie. Many claim this movie lacks depth but what they fail to realize is that this is a remake of one of the first cabin-in-the-woods horror films. The main character Mia, played by the amazingly talented Jane Levy embarks on this trip to finally rid herself of heroin addiction and is accompanied by her brother and close friends to beat it once and for all. Might this 'Evil Dead' just be a metaphor for Mia's never-ending quench for Opiates? This level of depth was a welcomed addition to the remake and adds character development as the story progresses. As Fede Alverez first film the movie acts decently balanced. It keeps consistent with the story, plot holes are filled, the pace is okay, and the dialog is decent but nothing special.The acting was, in comparison to the original, more evolved and surely fulfilled the expectations set by A-class movies. Jan Levy, the star of this film, dominates her dialog, executing line after line with sheer fright and is convincing the whole way through. I consider the move to have a female lead an absolute spark of genius . Audiences want more Female leads who can command the screen. Actresses like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, Carrie Fisher in Star Wars and Linda Hamilton of Terminator 2. And Levy blew it out of the water. Veteran actress Jessica Lucas was also quite good. Although she didn't get the same amount of screen time as Jane Levy, she is just as good and is a welcomed addition to the Ladies of the Evil Dead. The third female character Natalie, played by Elizabeth Blackmore is mainly pure cannon-fodder. Her only purpose in this film is to be subject to the evil that lurks within the woods. I have a feeling that she was wrote in latter in the script merely to spread the carnage out throughout the actors. She does do well in some parts later on in the film, but overall she wasn't a very interesting or developed character. This is what holds the movie from achieving success. The audience needs to care about the characters and this only fueled the fire of making an unreliable film. The boys in the film aren't that much better. The brother of Mia, played by Shiloh Fernandez had his head so far up his rear-end that he couldn't focus on the acting. I think the idea that he was playing a major role in a big production film got the best of him and instead of taking charge and really understanding his role, he focused more on what his hair looked like before every shot. The last of the main characters, Eric acted by Lou Taylor Pucci only barely shines. His delivery is okay, he seems believable but the lack of screen time and character development just pronounces him as target practice for the deadites early on.What shines in this remake is the fact that the Director and producers wanted to make it clear that NO CGI was used in this film. This is something everyone should have known going in to see this film because most people just assume everything is CGI today. ""Computers did not dare try to recreate the horror that your eyes will see"" should have been their tag line. On the Evil Dead's IMDb crew page, there is no listing for animators, 3d modelers, or 3d texture artists, but there are about a dozen ""visual effects artist"" which is quite ambiguous, but i will take the word of director Fede Alverez and original creator Bruce Campbell that there was none...Rob Tapert has hinted though that this is not entirely true during a screening of the film back in March(probably referring to the beginning scene). The film's attempt to create the ""Most terrifying film you will ever see"" will intrigue most, and when you understand that all the shots are essentially done with practical effects and a reported 100,000 gallons of fake blood was used to recreate this movie., the scenes then seem that much more gross and indeed terrifying.What is also worth mentioning is the directors style. The cinematography and camera work itch closely to that of Sam Raimi but with a less jerky roller-coaster ride. The lighting, atmosphere, and color palette is quite something. Alverez shows that he is in it to win it. The film also has quite the number of nods to the original and films like the Exorcist. It acts very much like a throwback.It ends with a revving climax, resulting in activating the gag reflexes in the audience and screams of joy from fans of the series. I have learned that if you go into a theater or watch a movie with a certain expectations then you will be most disappointed. But if you take it for what it is then your outcome will be that much more rewarding. This remake stands on its own as not only a successful addition to the series, but a decent remake worthy of recognition....and remember to stay till after the credits for a special treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not scary, not even all that gory, and not artistic","I wouldn't say its a bad movie, but I don't know why I would need to watch it.It differs from the original in a lot of ways, none of them are an improvement. This version, I would say, is less scary than the original by far. Its also, in an odd way, less gory. The ""realistic"" (cg) gore is less impactful than old cartoonish gore in a lot of ways. Not what I expected.This movie feels devoid of art. The way it is shot just isn't creepy like the original. There's not even a good catch phrase in here. So its not horribly bad, just not worth seeing.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great, great film.","In short; I gave it a ""9 out of 10"" solely because three things don't line up/get answered.But, in full... I have been an avid fan of the original Evil Dead, making connections to it in other movies and video games and the like. When I found out they were remaking the original, I could not wait to see it for myself. And if anyone else is in the same boat as I am, we will recognize that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell just didn't have the funds for their true dream. I think Bruce was the one who said Evil Dead 1-3 were collectively the very first script for one film. This remake is the closest thing imaginable to that original script. When Sam and Bruce called this ""a new vision"" that's really just the way any viewer needs to enter this film. If you sit there thinking ""that's not in the original"" then you will not enjoy the spectacle before you. This is as much of a masterpiece as the original, but for different reasons. The original taught us that with enough heart and willpower, you can create a staple in pop culture. This film has proved that all things get better with time.Now keep an open mind and appreciate this as a stand-alone film, if need be. But at least go see it once... or more.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
They'll swallow your soul but I doubt they could swallow this garbage,"I really wanted to like this film...honestly I did, but the film was flawed from the start. This remake of what has become a horror cult classic could not compare. A poor pretender to the throne if you will. Firstly there wasn't even a hint if humour in this film like the original. Secondly, the main girls back story wasn't really something that endeared the viewer to her plight. Half way through I actually rooted for the demons. I guess the one thing I liked about the wasted time I spent with this film was trying to see how many references I could pick up as homage to the original three movies. I am so pleased however that the lead guy did not say 'workshed' or 'groovy'. My advice is this: watch the Bruce Campbell version, it may not be as slick but it sure is better than this.Give peas a chance",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Now I understand the mixed reviews!,"Just got home from watching Evil Dead and it's only now that I understand why it has received such split opinion.First of all, Evil Dead is a great, entertaining modern horror film - fact!What Evil Dead doesn't do so successfully is capture the original's creepy, cursed-like atmosphere - fact!So, if you score this about around a 7, 8 or 9 out of 10 I totally get it - and I'm with you. If however, you scored this a 5 or under, I think it's likely because you expected the film to reflect the original's notoriously creepy, low budget, relentless fright fest quality. Even the original's hammy acting aided it's atmosphere - I still rate the original ""The Evil Dead"" in my top 2 or 3 horror films of all time.Unfortunately, though I really enjoyed Evil Dead from beginning to end, I have to admit, I really, really wanted the film to creep me out in the same way the original did in the 80's - but it didn't, and that's the problem. Still, I gave this a solid 8 out of 10 as it is probably the very best out of all horror remakes of the last 20 years. Evil Dead looks and sounds great, the acting is decent, there's plenty of respect and nods to the original and there's gallons of blood!...And when was the last time that happened? Not perfect, but I enjoyed every minute!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A gory festival of fun and horror,"First of all, it saddens me to see so many people giving this movie one star based almost entirely on comparisons to the original. Scrolling seven pages, I have not seen one legitimately fair review. If anyone reading this has ever seen the kind of trash movie that actually qualifies for a 1 star you will KNOW that this is not even close to that.Now let's get into it. This movie is quite entertaining.Writing/Plot: You have the basic premise that we've all become familiar with. Five friends take a trip up to a run down cabin in the woods, someone reads from a cursed book and (pardon the pun) all hell breaks loose as the group tries their best to survive. While this is ""technically"" a remake (or a reboot I'm not sure what they want to do with this) it is not an exact retelling of the classic movies with updated visuals. There is no Ash, and there is no comedy. It is strongly reminiscent in its events, but it does have its differences.-For all the people complaining about plot holes, lame writing and generic story, if you are a fan of horror this should be of no surprise. Horror's are RARELY known for their Oscar winning scripts. Stupid decisions and conveniently placed dangers are part and parcel for this genre and in this film aren't even distracting (I didn't notice or care, I was having too much fun). You should know automatically what you are in for the second you decide to watch this movie. In that aspect it is excellent. The story we all know, and if you are an Evil Dead fan, you will be even more familiar with it, that's not to say it's all a rehash though. There are some twists to give a fresh breath to even the old fans.Scare Factor: This movie doesn't have a lot of psychological scares, it's much too in-your-face for that. It does build up a bit of tension early on before the ""S"" hits the fan which is nice and it does have a few ""jump"" scares. However, this movie as you will know if you've seen the trailer relies much on gore. It's a shock value movie which is just plain fun. This will really test how much you can take. The use of live props over CGI also really adds something quite enjoyable to the ride.Acting: It's good. Works with the movie just fine. Anyone who complains about it is just looking for reasons to hate. (for bad acting see Mark Whalberg in The Happening)Score: Excellent for the movie, eerie then 180's to terrifying. Worth a purchase on its own.Overall: Don't compare this to the originals. It's not meant to be funny. It's got the plot, but it attempts to be it's own film, and successfully so. If you want Bruce Campbell hilarity, go watch the original. That's not what this is, it's a dark retelling of a classic story. If you are a horror fan, you know what the genre is, what to expect, and you'll have great fun with this. If you aren't, what are you doing here?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good experience,"I am uruguayan just like Federico Alvarez, the movie's director. I went to the first day in the theater for this reason and other one. I am a big fan of Evil dead. This movie has several things related with the original. The problem is some downs in the script. Other problem are the characters. They are weak. In the first 15 minutes you know who will die first. And also, you wish the dead for everyone. Of course, the movie has some twists. And some really effective moments, full of fear. Entertaining, with good cinematography and rhythm, a good gore effects. I recogniced the car of Raimi and I missed the steadycam of the first version. Here looked without the charm of the first movie. The independent films, in horror movies, always look better. I am waiting more from Federico and his crew.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Basically Evil Dead without Ash, which should sum it up for you","I am a fan of the Evil Dead movies (who isn't?) and I'm glad I didn't put my expectations too high for this. I can totally see why some of the old fans of the series like this reboot. It takes some new turns so it's not a complete plagiarism, and it still manages to set the setting completely right. I didn't laugh once though, which was a shame, because I found all the other Evil Dead movies to be hilarious (even the first one). This one therefore takes a much more serious tone, which is not bad... but I liked the fact that the Evil Dead movies could be so silly but it didn't take away the disturbing content in them. This one just abandoned that. But, it has tons of gruesome and disturbing moments that will please the fans of this genre!So, why the low score then? Because Bruce Campbell. This was such a dumb idea to reboot, seriously. Ash was the character who made the movies so much more entertaining, and without him, this just feels like our typical gory teen movie with bland characters that could have used its ambition (which it does have in my opinion) on something else more interesting.However, it's one of the more gruesome flicks I've seen in a while, so I give them that.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Movieman Review,"Recently saw the new Evil Dead and for a short and sweet review, in my opinion, it was pretty good.PROS: The gore (which is one of the main reasons for the remake, higher budget, more money to gross us out) Same eerie feeling from the first one. Different take. Didn't follow the original story line but yet didn't stray to far away.CONS: Acting was sh**ty No development of characters so you really didn't feel anything when they got hacked up. More plot holes then the road that led to the cabin.Overall, the good out weighed the bad. It was a movie that could have done so much more, but yet still made me feel satisfied when I left the theater. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Groovy Summer Blood Fest,"A Group of friend's journey on up to the Ol' Cabin in the Woods— Really, if you know the plot to the original, you know the evil dead story. However for all the new gen of fans, that haven't seen the original there is a kind of different story— A recovering heroin addict coming off from an over-dose close friends decide it's time to stop using drugs ""Cold Turkey"" So they journey up to the family Cabin that the brother and sister use to visit when they were kids. Strange smells coming from the basement? Time To Investigate— Finding a book called the Necronomicon, and reading from said book, sees our would be hero's being possessed one by one until there is but one soul survivor.I went into the evil dead like most people, having hope that it pays homage to the 1981 classic, which I hold close to my chest as one of my favorite horror films— boy was I wrong, this in my opinion is nothing like the Sam Raimi classic, a few classic camera angles thrown in a time or two, but in all retrospect this is a complete different film, squeamish look away— the evil dead movies in a whole aren't for everyone anyway. Strong stomach is required and this one takes that to a whole new level. missing appendages in every corner of the film, I really don't see how they got away with an R-Rating. This movie was a blood bath. Nice creepy atmosphere, it won't scare the avid horror buff, the jump scares are rather predictable, the acting is rather mediocre kinda like the original, potty mouth demons, we've heard that before which reminded me of The Exorcist more then the Evil Dead— I don't see anyone quoting lines from this movie in the near future. But all in all, it is a great film, if you don't mind the bloodshed which was one of the bloodiest films I've seen in awhile, it does the franchise justice, and I really hope to see more horror films from this director, without a re imaging of an old title, I think they have serious talent. the kill scenes were really well done, with what I could tell I didn't see much CGI, it feels like they tried to keep it authentic. It's a real polished film, the humor is still there although it's toned done a notch, you will get some chuckles out of it. Mostly depends on your personality. ""One of The Scariest Movies"" I think not, although some scenes did give me ""Goosebumps"" it is though a great throwback horror film, you must remember the original wasn't known for the best acting, best story, it was known for the blood, gore, comedic atmosphere. This one was all that then some— This just feels like a summer horror flick to me. And rather you like it or not, it has the possibility to be a timeless classic. I'm not going to spoil anyone's thoughts on this film, we all have an opinion I recommend to go into this film as a blank slate and just sit there and enjoy. if your on the fence about this film, just see it. it is worth watching ignore any negativity this is one of the best well done remakes(rebirths) in recent years. People will complain about anything, Take negativity with a grain of salt and who honestly cares. It's a summer blood bath that's what it's supposed to be, just like the original. A great film in my opinion— looking forward to the uncut blu-ray release. It will defiantly be getting a lot of future plays from me. Is it like the Classic ? No. It is entirely a Peripheral to the franchise. And a great Flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the original but definitely worth a watch,"I went to see this movie today at my local movie theater not expecting a whole lot of. Expecting more Paranormal Actvity/jump-scare BS that seems to creep it's way out from the pits of Hollywood's armpits. However, though it's not as good as the original it was one of the goriest and better horror films to come onto the big screen for quite sometime. I like how they used as little CGI(computer generated images)and mainly used practical effects like makeup and fake blood. It was quite refreshing to say the least. Although the story was kind of weak and the acting wasn't all that great, the hardcore gore and cringe-worthy imagery was totally worth it.

Chix Chat on Film review: Scary remake no comic relief,"A remake is always a risky undertaking because it will invariably be compared to the original. In the case of Evil Dead I couldn't shake thoughts of two other films,' The Cabin in The Woods' and a short which I had the pleasure of viewing at SXSW 'Hell No', unfortunately I did not get a chance to see Evil Dead at SXSW, which was also screened, but I decided not to miss out on it. This update of the original campy horror flick was a veritable blood bath or perhaps I should say blood shower, but no matter how you slice it there was a lot of blood and gore. The reason that it brought CITW to mind was that I saw that film recently and it was somewhat patterned off the original with five young people in an isolated cabin, although there was some comic relief in Cabin. The fact that this story was played out so straight just added to the fear factor. I only buried my face in my hands once to avoid the on screen mayhem, which is pretty good considering that any film with a demonic possession theme gets a license for any nature of next level bodily harm. This group came to the cabin to assist Mia (Jane Levy) with her personal demons and decided that this was the best place to help her. Mia's brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is described as 'absent' when the going gets tough, so of course he chose this situation to step up. The group enter the cabin and find that is smells of death but still stay and then ignore every single hint and warning that could avoid unleashing evil, thus the horror is set in motion. HN came to mind as I watched every opportunity to make a sound decision quickly get passed on which makes it clear that if the characters employ good rational sense it would make for a very short horror film. The special effects used to create the gruesome slice/dice, boiled flesh, dismemberment and such, was visually too frighteningly real, again adding to the fear factor. If you have an appreciation for a great horror tale where you get to see beautiful people tortured from the inside out and the outside in then this is the film for you. I found it to be entertaining and scary. The scenes with the nail gun where graphic enough that I never want a nail gun around me again. I give it a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I've seen some terrible remakes, and this isn't one of them.","Okay, so I wouldn't necessarily call this a remake, as I would a fresh view from new eyes.I have to say that I'm not sure why people are giving this movie such grief. Would it have made you happier if it wasn't called Evil Dead and was just a movie that was similar to one that already existed? I have to agree that there have been some miserable remakes *cough.. Alice In Wonderland*.. but that might just be the nature of the beast.On one hand if it doesn't hold true to the original, then it's a piece of Hollywood trash that's just a cashgrab on the name for greedy execs, am I right? .. but wait a minute! If it's TOO true to the original then it's a piece of trash ripoff that ""didn't have to be made""..So it's a double-edged sword.I agree that movies sometimes need to be remade for the sake of the creative integrity (Batman, common now) and I agree that there are crap remakes (insert Burton/Depp movie here.)

Perfect in every way,"Evil Dead, simply put, is a new horror classic. It's a remake of the memorable 80's time capsule The Evil Dead (a film which has actually aged quite splendidly thanks to some impeccable filmmaking), but this new film is a creature all by itself. Directed by Fede Alvarez and featuring very little CGI (if any), Evil Dead is the horror movie by which all modern horror films should will be looking up to years down the road.The most immediately distinguishing and intriguing characteristic about this new Evil Dead is how polished and neat the storyline is able to flow. These aren't just some people coming to hole themselves up in a cabin for awhile with no particular rhyme or reason other than that they just want to have a good time. David (Shiloh Fernandez) comes to the cabin to help kick his sister (Jane Levy) Mia's drug addiction with some of her closest friends, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). Her addiction is becoming a downward spiral and negatively affecting everyone around her. As a last effort, the group decides the best way to get Mia back to normal is to hole her up in the family cabin and not let her leave.The movie takes its time to let us know the characters before bad things start going down, even though the opening scene kicks things off pretty deliciously as it marks the audience's first introduction to a deadite. From there, things don't kick into overdrive until Eric starts playing around with the flesh-covered book they recover in the basement. After this, really bad things start happening rapidly that lead to blood. Lots and lots of blood. To discuss what happens in further detail would be to divulge entirely too much information.The directing is slick and stunning with some phenomenal camera-work and shots that rival anything you will find in the original movie. To compare Evil Dead to the original is unfair, though, because the original movie is a product of its time and the best possible movie it could have been at that time. Evil Dead is polished, precise, perfect down to the last scene of the movie which will stick with you long after the credits have rolled. The cast couldn't have been better, either, with Shiloh Fernandez and Jane Levy especially standing out as the brother and sister duo. Each of the five main roles contributes something significant to the flick and there isn't a single player involved that the movie could have done without. The new design of the Book of the Dead is flawless and creepy: while it might not be a face like the original, the skin on the cover and the pages within are still effectively chilling.If you are a horror fan in any fashion, Evil Dead is the must-see movie of the year. At this point, I'd be shocked if any other horror movie this year comes close to matching the brilliance, brutality, and spectacle that is developed over the course of 91 minutes of terror. Evil Dead is a modern horror classic that you have to see to believe. Bring on the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Is An Abomination,"That a classic film, one so profoundly iconic in the history of cinema, should be remade is a huge risk. Unfortunately, those involved with this abomination only insult the memory of a truly great film and provide a complete wastage of film stock in the process. Why Sam Raimi allowed this to happen is beyond all imagination. His direction of the original was superb and his visionary masterpiece of a motion picture required no remake. The very concept of such an blasphemy is impossible to grasp. The performances in the real Evil Dead were stunning and Bruce Campbell's Oscar worthy. The intensity and humanity he brought to the character of Ash is unforgettable. At least the character of Ash is omitted from this utter failure of a film. For anyone who cherishes the Evil Dead of long ago, this is unworthy of consideration and deserves unregulated contempt.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hearkens back to the golden era of Splatter,"I have this quirky habit of judging films based on what the director/writer promises, rather than marketing or any sort of standard set by a previous installment or source material. If I were as judgemental as most people are comparing Evil Dead to The Evil Dead 1/2, I don't think I'd have nearly as many series I'd enjoy. Horror has many different flavors and angles, and within even the most solid series the style can fluctuate greatly.So if you're the type with hardcore standards and discerning tastes only for the most perfect films, this review will not serve your purpose. There are other films that can satisfy you in that regard.What I will say is that while this film is full of more holes than fossilized swiss cheese, it didn't once stop me from enjoying it. Are the characters paper thin? Yes. Are the effects over the top? Yes. Is the plot weak: Oh hell yes.But I like that about splatter films. They're films you turn your brain off for, and enjoy the over-the-top roller coaster ride of blood, guts, and 'splatter' as the genre is named for. There are few films that I can think of that go to this level of practical horror.So I'm quite happy. If you're looking for something highbrow, pushing the envelope of what stabs are our hidden psyche, and questions our very humanity...Don't watch this.But if you're looking for a fun Troma esq bit of gore, akin to the original Evil Dead, Braindead, or any number of low brow films, give this a shot.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not my cup of tea!,"¨No! You don't understand. There was something in the woods... and I think it's in here with us... now.¨Hollywood has seemed to have run out of fresh ideas when it comes to making horror films and year after year they keep on bringing us either remakes of classic films or sequels. Evil Dead is perhaps one of the best known cult horror films of the 80's, and Sam Raimi has decided to produce this remake of his original film. Other horror remakes are coming out this year (like Carrie) so I don't think this will be a trend that is going to disappear anytime soon. Despite not being a horror fan I decided to watch this film because of newcomer Fede Alvarez, who made a name for himself in my home country of Uruguay with a music video titled Panic Attack where the capital city is completely destroyed by huge robots. Alvarez managed to accomplish this feat with a very low budget and he also directed some short films as well (El Cojonudo) which garnered the attention of some Hollywood people. Discovering Alvarez's potential they decided to put him in charge of the direction of Evil Dead, a film he himself claimed to have been influenced by as a child. I don't blame Alvarez for accepting this offer because anyone in his shoes would have done the same thing and it will probably help him grow in this industry, and perhaps in the future he will be able to produce his own personal projects. I appreciate the fact that Hollywood is looking for some outside talents, and in my opinion Alvarez doesn't disappoint here. It's impossible to remake a cult film like this and make it better, but somehow he manages to be unique in the midst of the predictability of the genre. He has proved to be very talented, but my problem with this film is that I really despise this genre so it was hard for me to criticize it fairly. I think these campy gory horror fests are all pretty much similar to each other and the only thing that really changes are the effects which over time become more realistic. This was just too gory for my taste and I never felt scared, only disgusted which isn't something I look forward to in a movie. I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead franchise so I can't honestly say if it lives up to the expectations of the fans.The film is closely tied to the original film in that it involves a group of five friends who travel to a cabin in the middle of the woods and discover some mysterious book which summons the dead. Mia (Jane Levy) barely survived a drug overdose and her friends have decided to bring her to her family's old cabin in order for her to recover. Her friends, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), along with her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) promise to do what it takes to keep her in the cabin no matter how bad her craving for drugs gets. This isn't the first time that Mia has suffered from a drug overdose, but her friends are determined it will be the last. Once they arrive at the cabin they smell a strange odor and find some dead animals in the cellar. Some kind of ritual has taken place and that is where Eric finds this strange book. He makes the big mistake of opening the book and reading out loud some strange passages. As soon as he does this something evil comes out of the woods and attacks Mia. That is where the horror begins to take place and all hell breaks loose. A storm prevents them from leaving and they are on their own against these evil forces.Evil Dead is extremely gory, there is a lot of blood but hardly any scares. It also has some funny moments like in the original film, but it just didn't work for me. A much better movie is Cabin in the Woods which does some interesting things breaking the genre and taking it to new places. This version is an interesting homage and some fans will probably enjoy it, while others will hate it. In my opinion Alvarez's touch in this film makes it a little more tolerable, but I really don't like these type of films unless there is some originality. The performances were pretty strong for a gory film, I enjoyed Jane Levy's lead performance and Pucci also had some interesting and funny scenes. These characters are as stupid as pretty much every character we've seen in a horror movie. Who in their right mind would open a book like this and read the passages out loud in the middle of the woods? It is all part of the genre and we just have to play around with that fact. I really didn't care for these characters either; it was hard for me to empathize with anyone of them. I never felt like I was being transported into the movie, but the effects were pretty realistic and well done.

The irony lies in its production budget,"Just as I'd expected EVIL DEAD turned out to be just another typical remake of today. Seriously, Hollywood needs to learn its lesson of not cashing in from originals.I was gingerly anticipating to see this new ""reboot"", if you will, as I knew remakes don't usually make it good on the screen these days. And people these days are far more preoccupied with their mobile devices to be even remotely interested in watching movies anymore.That said, on with my thoughts about how the new EVIL DEAD was. For a start, I'm not making any comparisons to the original 1981 Sam Raimi's version. Although the effects and makeup in that latter version were filthy cheap, not to mention extremely cheesy by today's standards, somehow 1981 EVIL DEAD gave a far more superior spooky atmosphere than this latest one.In the original EVIL DEAD, the audience are treated immediately with an aura of evil as soon as the film started. There was no studio logo introduction. We started off with evil's POV running through the woods as if sensing its victims.The 2013 one, however, wasted the audience's time by attempting to build a story around it and that tremendously slows down the pacing which I could certainly feel.However, credits still have to be given to the effort of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell (the director and protagonist of the original film) in that I could see remnants of their 1981 film in this one. One of these includes the pendant that the protagonists in both versions gave to their lover (1981) and sister (2013).I wouldn't go any further in elaborating how much I prefer the original version than this new one. But sufficed to say that this 2013 relied too much on its goriest and gruesome tortures. Even the ""possessions"" looked cheap. The irony is that the so-called ""makeups"" looked far cheaper than the cheap 1981 version, if that makes any sense at all.To be honest, I was sitting in the theater constantly thinking how many of these (pardon my tone) idiots ever saw the original.In short, I'd say this 2013 EVIL DEAD looked like the gorefests of the SAW franchise and 1972 THE EXORCIST (times 5) with the makeup effects of Hollywood's THE RING.To quote Sidney Prescott from SCREAM 4, ""Don't f**k with the original"". Giving a vote of 3 out of 10 is as generous as I could get.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfect,"With confident and masterful direction by Fede Alvarez, Evil Dead is the rare remake that actually works thanks to great performances, tons of gore and a great sense of respect for the original work. Definitely one of the best remakes out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dread..,"This movie is not a bad horror film, but being a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies and Army of Darkness. I was extremely disappointed with this film. I feel as if Bruce Campbell worried to much if a new Ash was to be born than the reference to him would be shattered. Instead he helped give us this . A horror movie that would have stood better under a different name or Evil Dead title. The absence of Ash in an Evil Dead film is quite obvious when you see it . This film feels more like one giant reference to a great film but falls short on adding it to the collection. There's enough gore to hold fans over throughout the movie and only a few moments that surprise you. So if you're looking for a horror film that's bloody and better than the disasters that have come out in the past 2 years this is not a bad choice . If you're looking for an Evil Dead movie blow the dust off your collection and enjoy the fact that a chainsaw -handed-badass -hero existed at some point but unlikely to come through again.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

If your like me and think that some of the new remakes have been not all that good then you will be happy to know that this one was.Not going to tell you anything about the movie, but it was worth the money spent for my daughter and me to see it. Those that like a good scary movie this is a good one to see. But like always with movies not everyone is going to like it or love it. You need to see it for yourself to know.

Loved It- Even as a Rabid Fanboy of the Original,"I absolutely loved the new Evil Dead! If you have any interest at all, see it.It's not so much a retelling of the first movie (as far as the first had a ""plot,"" ha ha). It's more of a sequel that takes place in the same cabin with the same evil forces. Other than that, the reboot holds it's own and has a story that actually makes good sense, e.g., there's a reason for the twenty-somethings to go to the cabin, and their reasons for sticking around are feasible.The characters are likable. The music is excellent. The thrilling scares come-a-plenty. Gore-fans will be pleased with the rivers of blood. (It's hard to believe the MPAA approved this for an R.) Even the credits are beautiful.Just realize this one doesn't have the same campy tone. There is a lot less dark humor, but, strangely, it doesn't really need it. The movie is thoroughly enjoyable.Of course, if you haven't seen the original 'ultimate experience in grueling terror,' go with that!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Groovy? Well, not that much actually...","As a big fan of the original ""Evil Dead"" film, nay, strike that, a fan of the original trilogy, it was a bit hard to approach this movie with a neutral stance.But in all fairness, then this 2013 version of ""Evil Dead"" is a good enough way to introduce a new audience to the franchise. However, was it a necessary project to see the light of day? Hardly so. In my personal opinion, a continuation after ""Army of Darkness"" would have been better off.The effects in this 2013 version was good, although they were visually great and gory enough to keep most gore-hounds happy, then they just lacked that special touch that is found in the original trilogy. As campy and out of date by today's standards, then the original trilogy just somehow pulled it off better. I suppose that is part of the cult legacy.This fresh and new take on the original story did have some striking similarities to the first two movies, yet there were parts that deviated far, perhaps too far (I am, of course, talking about who ends up with the chopped off hand, the chainsaw and walking away as a sole survivor here). And no, I am not going to ruin it by saying who it was. However, I will say that this twist and turn from the original story didn't sit well in my stomach.The book, Naturon Demonto, was just more wicked and vile in the original trilogy, with far better illustrations, glyphs and sigils. But of course, that is not essential to the movie itself, it is just a horror nerd like me noticing and commenting on that.The possessed people in the movie were actually quite interesting to look at, especially with the mutilations and gore they were subjected to. However, the eyes just lacked that shiny yellow color as seen in the original movie. But still, there was some pretty interesting effects and ideas to be seen here.As for the people cast to portray the roles in the 2013 version. Well, they were doing good enough jobs, but they had pretty big shoes to fill out, to which they managed to do well enough in their own right.For me, as an avid fan of the original trilogy, then this 2013 version was sort of a disappointing, although not surprisingly so, revisit to the 1981 cult classic. But for people not old enough to be familiar with the original movies, then the 2013 version should provide adequate entertaining, and hopefully light an interest in watching the original trilogy.Watch the movie up to the very end after the credits are done rolling, it is well worth it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

No Plot No Characters Some Good Gore,"I gave this one three stars b/c some of the gore was good and gory. Otherwise, I would have given it 0 stars but gore takes work, so I threw them a bone. However,if you have no plot and no characters, it's hard to give a sh**t or feel anything when the gore hits you. Would it kill these guys to even pretend to create something passable as plot. The big setup here is one of the girls is going cold turkey at their long forgotten cabin in the woods. The cabin was so clearly a set and the lighting so bright it ruined any sort of atmosphere. There are no characters at all. They didn't even try to give the characters any motivation except scream yell and bleed. That Shiloh Fernandez was the worst of the acting bunch.

I'll Swallow Your SOUL!,"I must admit, I was adamantly opposed to a remake of 'The Evil Dead'. When I heard this movie was being made I was livid. A wholly new set of characters? A Female lead? No Ash!? How can this be?!I was ready to write this off as another attempt by Hollywood to recycle beloved movies to turn a quick buck... but then I saw Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell were producing. ""How bad could it be?"" And then I saw the red band trailer. I was amazed.I don't go to the movies often, but here was a film I was more than willing to pay to see.Much of the negative reviews I've seen do either one, or both, of these things: Remember the original 'The Evil Dead' with their nostalgia glasses on OR remember part II and the original as one entity.This movie is light years beyond the original. It hurts to say it, but it is. The acting, directing, story, and effects are all vastly superior.It's not as if this film erases the original. It still exists and you can watch it whenever you want. But, if you compare the two, it's obvious this is the superior movie.I, for one, loved every minute of it. I defy anyone to illustrate how it is not the better of the two.Now, the sequel?

A flat dull remake.,"I'm not a fan of the remake. Admittedly there are some powerful scenes, but it's a pretty lifeless remake. None of the actors stand out. It's not that visually interesting. The color palate is drab. The music score doesn't fit. The allegory for drug addiction is okay but it's character baggage. They double down on the character baggage with Mia being pissed off at her brother for not helping to look after the mother as a plot point. That felt tacked on. In an attempt to make The Evil Dead gritty and realistic they made it dull. Overall, it's another case of a remake no one asked for or wanted.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bad-Ass Reboot Film for the Apple Generation,"First things first, this movie is not at all a ""remake"". A remake implies that all aspects of the original film were going to be evolved and morphed into a new film, and that is not what this film is. The character of Ash (brilliantly played by Bruce Campbell) isn't even in this movie. The original 1981 masterpiece is about 5 friends going out to an isolated cabin to party and go wild, and slowly but surely they become possessed, tortured and killed off. This film follows the story of a girl trying to shake her addiction to drugs and her four friends go along with her to help her with this difficult transition. Second, this film, unlike most horror film remakes, actually stay true to the tradition of building suspense and affection for the character before killing them off in gruesome manners. Evil Dead has everything you would expect a horror movie of 2013 to have: sex, blood and drugs. This film a tour-de-force of gore, mayhem and good times that is not to reckoned with.

The Evil Dunce,"Let me preface this review by saying, that I am a fan of the Evil Dead series. These movies are the last vestiges of honest creativity in the cult classic world. No seriously, think about it. When was the last time you saw a movie maker just take and run with his ideas; not giving a crap about the status quo? Not caring about if his stuff is macho enough for the 1 in 25 sociopaths out there? Now everything is stylized bullcrappery meant to elicit a reaction, not tell a story, not meant to entertain. It's just created to satisfy the urge to see women scream. Sick, sick, sick.I am the exact opposite. I expect a horror movie to scare and entertain me, not terrorize me or encourage violence against half the human planet. I don't confuse blatant, violent misogyny as an acceptable expression of ""Horror."" I don't expect to see racist or homophobic crimes in a horror movie, nor should I expect to see crimes against women used as entertainment fodder for the psychos in our society.All you have to do is look at the advisory warnings to see what's in store for you if you decide to spend money on this movie. Violence, gore, more gore; sick sexuality with some lesbian appropriation thrown in. Ooooh sex. Tee hee. Sex is always a Big Deal to the repressed and immature.Sam Raimi has officially lost my respect because of this movie. He has taken a perfectly good movie franchise and sold it out to the crowd of ""the biggest, most aggressive, violent, cruel, sadistic butthole rulez! (bro)."" This movie didn't add anything to the storyline, and it didn't enrich the viewer's enjoyment or understanding of the movies it was based from. The magic of the original Evil Dead movies is that they were creative, funny, ironic, and did NOT rely on cookie cutter stylized pop culture garbage. That magic is gone now, completely RUINED. Thanks for nothing, Mr Raimi. I wonder if Bruce Campbell regrets ever being a part of this franchise.I'd like to make one last point about horror - the point of horror is not to create movies for psychopaths to get their jollies off or satisfy a need to see women in pain. For godsakes. Horror is meant to be intriguing to a degree as to the possibilities that exist outside our normal lives. That is where the bona fide reaction of being afraid comes from, geniuses - the realization that things exist outside our normal understanding. Whether they are a dead person rising from the grave or a monster from parallel universe. Read Lovecraft, he knew exactly what horror was even if his writing style is not your favorite you will learn more about what horror is reading one story of his than you will watching 20 modern ""horror"" movies (lolz, if they can be called that).In my time at IMDb, I find that the real fans of the horror genre are intelligent and cynical. Cynical because they have already confronted the aliens, the demons, the psychos, etc and you won't find them GUSHING about how WONDERFUL it was to see women sliced in half, because they don't watch horror to be entertained or expect the movie to reflect their sexist worldview. No, they want to be taken OUT of their worldview, they WANT to confront something that is new and different, a possibility they have never considered before. And they want to TALK and DISCOVER about those possibilities, not sit around staring at mindless gore.Yes, I know, the Evil Dead franchise was not meant to be the most intellectual or radical movie series, but it was at least entertaining until this piece of crap remake came along. But you could at least say, ""Yeah, I've seen those movies. What a hoot huh?"" and now I can't even say that anymore.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Scary? No. Just really, really bloody",From everything I had seen and read it was trying to be more realistic and scary. To me this remake of Evil Dead was neither. Being gory and making the audience feel uncomfortable is not the same as them being afraid to go camping or walk down to their basement for the next week or two.On top of that was some pretty bad acting.

The original is still there in all its glory; this is just another version, which I thought was fantastic.Going in, I knew that it wouldn't even come close to the tag-line's claim.

Neither terrifying nor terrible,"I'm a horror fan and I had been waiting for this film for some time trying to keep my expectations low (since the film was advertising itself as 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience' which actually meant 'it might be a good idea to check it out' to me.) So I watched the film with four friends at the cinema today and after the film I was the only one who didn't regret watching it. Although one of them said 'at least we did something different' but he was most probably referring to going to the cinema. The original film was one of the first horror films I saw as a kid and it really did terrify me then but this one was just a horror-flavoured blood bath (almost literally in some scenes) and kept me on the edge of my seat for quite a short time. Nevertheless it kept me watching and I didn't get bored. I don't think this film is underrated or overrated but generally speaking, even the best horror films are underrated. No horror film gets a 10 or even 9/10. All in all, I recommend this film only to horror fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best in the genre,"Gathering at a cabin-in-the-woods, a group of friends attempting to rehab a friend learn the area was used to cure demonic possession and accidentally free a trapped demon that possesses them one-by-one and forcing the survivors to get away alive.Frankly this one was one of the best remakes and an even better stand- alone effort. One of the film's best parts here is in how much action this packs into here, as there's a lot of scenes here featuring either the possessed charging after them or being attacked by them. The chilling opening, from the woodland abduction and chaining up in the basement before the actual manner of driving out the infected occurs makes for a fine intro to this one, as does the initial escape attempt from the house where the driving rain forces the car out into the pond and shows the demon rising and stalking afterward into the twisting, disorienting woods for another confrontations that's especially chilling. As well, the gradual build-up of her possession instead of the relapse following this encounter is not only genuinely frightening but build the action really well. Starting with the running water in the shower and the revelation of what happened to the others around her, this sets up a solid base here for one of the film's highlight sequences in their first encounter with the possessed as the attack with the shotgun, the vomiting ungodly amounts of viscera onto the friend before being locked in the basement and then battling the now-possessed and deformed friend in the bathroom gives this on an incredibly strong and chilling scene filled with some solid jumps and brutal action. Likewise, the attack here by the bitten friend is even more brutal from the action in the locked basement where she becomes possessed and forced to dismember herself from the counter and now begins chasing the ones left throughout the cabin in some really brutal, vicious battles really adds nicely to this one. Even more impressive here is the finale, which here is the film's best part with the initial cleansing attempt and subsequent revival, the encounter back in the house leading to the demons resurrection in the area where a thrilling, brutal and quite exciting sequence plays out here with the demon leading her throughout the leftover areas and into the woods into a thrilling, utterly bloodbath-soaked carnage that really lets the blood flow here quite nicely from the wounds but also raining blood on the entire sequence. Along with some truly outstanding demon-make-up that gives them a truly inhuman look and attitude that fits perfectly with their mangled features, these here are the film's positives against the few small flaws here. The film's biggest problem here is the fact that it resorts to such cliché and predictable manners of tormenting here for the possessed who resort to the old standby of demonic cursing to tease and torment the survivors here that the taunts aren't even creative enough to mean anything and don't even fit the tone of the movie at all being so lazy. This also could've done a little more here to set-up the contents of the cabin which just comes out of nowhere and doesn't feel all too logical. Beyond these, this one was an absolutely amazing entry.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language and violence-against-animals.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Absolutely Awful,"I sat here and watched every evil dead movie in the series and then the series itself. This movie in no way even resembles anything to do with the evil dead series. It was just made to be disgusting gore p0rn and felt like the creator of this film had no ideas, saw the first evil dead movie, and decided to have his own ""take"" on it as a cash grab since graphics have improved since the 80s. The first evil dead movie had story it had character and while it might've dragged on a bit, the characters were actually important to the story and what happened to them was important to the story. This is just... a horror movie using the evil dead name to get people to watch it. Honestly if you want to watch evil dead and see wonderful gore and have good writing and it actually stick to cannon, watch the evil dead series. It's actually SO good. Watching this after watching the series is like eating a well cooked steak and then taking a bite of a raw potato. Technically the potato is edible, but it'll taste like dirt. This movie is technically watchable, but its really awful in context of the evil dead series. ALSO it relies WAY too much on shock horror. The dead cat in the beginning.

Scarier and bloodier than the original,"The franchise returns to its roots with this fourth installment that takes up the horror and gore of the first film, but taken to a higher level. The story clearly recreates what was seen in the original film, plus some references to the second, but with different characters. As much as the film is a remake, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell made it clear that it is a derivative story, hinting that it is something that takes place in the same universe as the original trilogy. That's even more apparent with the post credits scene. The difference lies in its dark tone, since we are dealing with a one hundred percent horror-oriented film without the humor of the original films. With the absence of Ash Williams, this is another story where we meet other people who had contact with the Necronomicon. Already at the beginning it is announced that Mía is the one who takes on the most relevance in the entire film. What makes this film somewhat superior to the original is the amount of violence and gore it offers. It's a fairly dark film with very well-achieved gore effects. The production is quite good and the performances are also admirable. The soundtrack by Roque Baños is also one of the best things about the film that, added to the direction of Fede Álvarez, gives the film a good atmosphere and tone. The truth is that Álvarez managed to make a good film despite the fact that this was his first feature film. Curiously, the effect that I generate in Fede Álvarez is almost similar to the case of Sam Raimi when he directed the first Evil Dead. This fourth installment of the franchise lives up to the original film. A movie so violent with disturbing moments that make it one of the best remakes of horror movies. My rating for this movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Remake of horror classic is a bloody, scary blast!","The original Evil Dead is one of my all time favorite fright flicks so, I was very apprehensive about a remake. With Sam Raimi, Robert G. Tapert and even Bruce Campbell on board as producers, I hoped the material would at least be treated with respect. Now having seen this new vision of one of the all time horror classics, I can say not only was the material treated with respect but, it is one of the best horror remakes and one hell of a nasty, scary, bloody blast. The best thing is that co-writer and first time director Fede Alvarez smartly takes the basic premise and does his own thing with it. This version has heroine addict, Mia (Suburgatory's Jane Levy) being taken by big brother, David (Skateland's Shiloh Fernandez) and 3 friends to an old family cabin to try to get Mia to quit her habit cold turkey. But, someone has been in the cabin since they were last there and something gruesome has definitely gone on inside with blood stains and dozens of dead animals hanging in the cellar. Of course there is also a mysterious book and within it ominous warnings that it not be read... so, of course, someone does... and at the same time Mia is alone in the woods... uh, oh... I don't need to tell you that soon Mia is possessed by some horrible demonic entity and the gruesome blood soaked nightmare begins as the ancient evil wants to claim them all. Alvarez really crafts a strong, gruesome and scary horror of the likes we haven't seen in a while. It's vicious and nasty with top notch gore and make-up that is done the old fashioned way without any CGI. When limbs fly... and they do, it is good old fashioned prosthetics and I loved the lack of CGI when it came to the ghouls and gore. Alvarez and co-writer Rodo Sayagues (Diablo Cody was supposedly hire to work on the script but, if she was credited, I missed it.) basically give us enough elements of the original to make it recognizable as an Evil Dead flick and thus fits in with the series but, makes the flick it's own animal. And that's the way to do a remake like this. And Alvarez is the real deal who knows how to make a good old fashioned horror movie complete with suspense, tension and intensity, not to mention, plentiful scares. He also gives the film a strong atmosphere and I really liked his visual style. He gets good work from his cast too, especially leading lady Levy whose character has a few stages to go through from heroine addict to a demon possessed creature to... well, you'll have to see to find out. Shiloh Fernandez is also very good, after a lifeless performance in Red Riding Hood he shows us the actor we saw in Skateland was no fluke. The rest, Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric, Jessica Lucas as Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie, do fine making their characters more then demon fodder and they are all likable enough to make us afraid for them when all hell breaks loose. The flick is not perfect but, any flaws are minor and can be overlooked due to all that is done right. Evil Dead 2013 may not be as groundbreaking as the original and only time will tell if it will be highly regard like it's predecessor but, it is a strong, visceral horror that gives equal parts suspense and scares with all the goo and gore. Maybe not quite a classic but, a film worthy of the title Evil Dead. Well done!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great entry into the Evil Dead franchise that earns it's name,"I've been seeing a lot of user reviews on here bashing this movie, and I honestly don't understand why. For everyone calling Evil Dead a money grab and poor remake, you are way off base.This is a re-imagining not a flat out remake. The director was asked by Sam Raimi himself if he wanted to be a part of it. So stop bashing it and saying that none of the original people had anything to do with it. Sam and Bruce both consulted on the film to keep it true to what an Evil Dead movie should be.Now that I got that off my chest, here's the review.Evil Dead whole heartedly earns it's name. It's fast paced, brutal fun for anyone who has enjoyed the other films in the series. The acting, while not the best I've ever seen, is still good enough to keep you interested. And the detox back story gives a real reason as to why they would go to the remote cabin. The special effects are top notch, and the pace is just right once the carnage starts.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and would gladly go back to the theater for a second viewing.If you are a fan of the films in the Evil Dead series, you will enjoy this one as well. Just don't go in expecting to see Ash running around with his chainsaw and shotgun dropping one-liners on the undead. Go in with an open mind, and you'll be treated with a brutally good time that earns the title of Evil Dead.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One dead viewer,"Please, I am begging all of you not to see this movie. It is not because I especially care how people waste their time but my fear is that if many viewers watch this crap and even worse - like it - then companies are going to make that kind of horrors again and again and again. And what I mean by ""that kind of horror""? Basically the formula works like this: introduce a group of young people with girls wearing always something super tight and made wet by some incident in the plot which is really a cheap trick of writers; acting skills are optional; gather all characters in a lonely cabin in the woods with only one road which is cut off right away. By the way, where are those cabins? If anyone has seen some recently, then perhaps alert the government and they could be given to those who had lost their houses in the recession. Another important element of the formula is to avoid any substantial conversations which may conflict with super heavy amount of action with people screaming and running constantly and instead limit the dialogue to few self-explanatory statements such as:""something is wrong here"", ""Oh my God!"", ""let's get out of here"", "" ""you will all die tonight"" or ""fuck you Satan!... There must be lots of black,greenish substance pouring out from mouth of the cursed; there will be blood, dirty water,mud,broken glass, ugly faces appearing all of a sudden in mirrors to be met with yet another scream,doors which always close and very strange trees without leaves. There also should be a few mythical genetically deformed Ozark type of creeps to run after characters, or just watch them through windows and maybe eat their flesh. And let's us not forget about The Book which gives answers only young do not read nowadays with the exception of one guy in glasses. It is always a nerdy type who knows first The Truth and tries to warn others but he is being ridiculed until it is already too late. In my opinion The Devil should communicate via cell phones or text messages. Even Vatican uses Internet. And really Satan! - those old hints with shadows, axes, dead dogs and heroine speaking in tongues are becoming a bit tired, don't you think so? I strongly suggest that you do some makeover of your helpers and modernize the way you communicate with victims. Now dear viewer, if you need to watch this movie because you want to avoid mowing lawn,doing dishes or you can't sleep (my case) - then, there are all legitimate reasons for watching this colossal waste of money. Otherwise, avoid it at any cost and rather read the Holy Bible or the Communist Manifesto. Or knit yourself a nice pair of mittens or tea cozy. Enough said.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome for Gore fans!!!!,"I really don't get the so called claiming of some of these horror fans. If they are really horror fans, then the gore should not bother them at all. I can't believe the reviews, that I am reading here. This is one of the best horror movies. An instant classic just for the gore. This just reminds me of how good ""The Dawn of the Dead"" 2004 remake was good. These people rating it low, and saying they are horror fans, and complaining are the PG-13 wanna be horror fans.True horror fans are the rated R or Unrated movie watchers. If they can't handle it, then stay in the PG-13 groups that will never be true horror fans. I saw the viewing of the first in theater last night, and there were so many clapping and laughing at the over the top gore, and that is great. I am mind boggled at the stupidity of people tearing this masterpiece apart just for the heck of it, and also other masterpieces, and giving the crappy PG-13 ones better ratings.Learn the rules of horror, and PG-13 is not the rule of horror. Directors that do PG-13 for horror, just can't think of anything good to make the fans excited. I recommend this movie to everyone that is the true horror fans, not the fake wanna be crappy PG-13 fans that are lame, and make up excuses to not see it, because of the gore.Sometimes I prefer to watch this over the other first two, and those first two movies are full of gore and more than this one, which boggles my mind why you tear it down because of gore.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Impressive,"I saw this without seeing the original. (After which I did see the original, but that is a different review for a different day). This movie starts out with a scene that totally sets up the tone, which also gives us a wonderful sneak peak at what to come, the beginning being the scene where you first see the demon, and they can shut off the ""evil demon routine"" and be the real person. I really enjoyed that, i loved how they played that up in the movie, which gives a great moral fight with some characters. Then we see the characters we are supposed to like, but really the only character I cared about was Mia, the main girl (which i thought was really well played by Jane Levy) and for his credit the main guy David wasn't bad either. The filmmakers also give really great updates from the original that in my opinion improve on it. I won't spoil it here though, however its really good. I also really wanna touch on the gore, the movie uses practical effects so much that it becomes a love letter to people who grew up with ""no CGI"" it gives us so much of what we loved in the original with great references and also a lot of BLOOD, i loved the BLOOD, but its so bloody. LIKE WOW that was a lot of blood. In the end this movie hearkens back to the old days, gives us a horror character that you care about, (Which i didn't say before but that is still impressive especially for a remake to even have one character to root for) and a lot of blood (i cannot state that enough this was so bloody) I personally had a lot of fun with this movie, and is a movie i will be buying when released on blu-ray. It deserves to be next to Cabin in the Woods, The Evil Dead, and Evil Dead 2. Well done guys, well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I've Seen More Evil In A Garbage Can. LOL!,"I saw the first Evil Dead(1981) film directed by Sam Raimi, who later directed two more"" Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn(1987) and Army Of Darkness(1992) which was his last horror film. Then after a lapse of 17 years he directed Drag Me To Hell(2009) which I feel paid tribute to his die-hard followers of Zombie Horror(myself included!). But Drag Me To Hell lacked the bite(pun intended!) of his original first two Evil Dead Films.This 2013 remake's script was written by Sam Raimi and produced by Bruce Campbell who played the character of Ash in the Evil Dead Trilogy who did battle and eventually destroyed the Evil. Fede Alvarez was chosen to direct this film. He is an Uruguayan film director and screenwriter. He is best known for his short film Ataque de Pánico!On to the review. I have been watching horror films since the 1980's. With the help of internet I have seen horror films as old as the 1930's. I saw this remake in my mid-thirties. I am a hard-core horror fan and I have seen the most gruesome horror films which are so disturbing that they linger in your brain afterwards.Among the ones I have seen are Eden Lake (2008), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 and the prequel film Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning 2006 as well as Tobe Hooper's Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). Also a separate film Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3(1990). I have also seen Wrong Turn (2003), Wrong Turn 2(2007) and Wrong Turn 3(2008). I have seen Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes and its remake. I have see George Romero's Night, Dawn and Day of the Living Dead. I have seen The Exorcist Trilogy of films written by William Peter Blatty. I have seen The Reanimator Trilogy Of films.The list is endless...So nothing is new to me: a hardcore horror fan. I watched this Evil Dead remake from start to finish without a twitch. The special effects in the film are standard. The sound effects these days are awesome with advent of surround sound technology. The direction of the film suffers in the area that there is no real plot in the film. A guy reads an incantation in the book and wham! The evil spirit is summoned and it starts to posses its victims who proceed to mutilate (or mutate LOL!) themselves. There is no clearly defined hero or heroine in the films. The actors are not seasoned enough to be able to lift the film with their on screen presence. There is no real climax in the film.The first Evil Dead film(which developed from Raimi's short Within The Woods) had a good selection of actors, who despite having no big films behind their backs, made the setting of the film come alive. There was solid atmospheric horror in the film and the zombie-makeup and effects was top-notch. The tension built steadily step by step, which is the hallmark of a good director. The climax itself is awesome and is left for last.Verdict: I don't think Fede Alvarez has future in directing more horror films. He should either change genres or pursue a career in directing theatrical shows or plays which is more rewarding. This is not due to any fault in the director but because of the over-flooded Hollywood film industry who are making more quantity then quality films. I think people have just run out of ideas.To all movie lovers: if you have a chance to go to a theater to watch a play, be it a classic, suspense or romance, DO SO. It is much better to go outside and get some fresh air with your loved ones and watching REAL ACTORS at work, than spoiling your eyes glaring at the big screen.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Delivers hyper realistic horror but no comedy.,"No Spoilers are in this review, just honest opinions. Like most people who first heard about this remake I immediately checked out the IMDb to see if Sam Raimi was the Director (He is not) and if Bruce Campbell was going to give new life to the hero ""Ash"" we all know and love (No Again).The Director is Fede Alvarez, a first time feature filmmaker from Uruguay who's short film Panic Attack! went viral and caught the attention of Raimi and the other producers. The hero of this version was played by Shiloh Fernandez. This actor is best known from Little Red Riding Hood and Deadgirl, the latter being a very original twist on horror.In this climate of desperate cash grabs with all these remakes, reboots and spin offs I had every reason to hate this movie going into it but I was surprised. The reason for the group to go to the cabin was totally different from the original and the strongest element of the writing. If you are hoping to see an Evil Dead with the same tone as the original I'm sorry to say it is not there. The over the top gore, the creative camera work and comedic elements are absent on this trip to the cabin. What the remake does deliver on is amazingly strong cinematography and a hyper-realistic take on this story filled with practical gore effects.According to IMDb Diablo Cody did a pass on the screenplay but it seems like everything from her draft was dismembered from the shooting script. This movie could have used some smart lines and more defined characters. Instead within the first 20 seconds as all the characters meet at the cabin they announce each of their jobs. What someone does for a living is a great incite into character but this was forced into the scene in an unnatural way. Diablo Cody did not get screen credit in the film so there you go.Fans of the original will be happy to know that the score, the props, the camera blocking and editing will bring you back to the fond memories of Evil Dead 1 and 2. The tree attack scene was great and used reverse motion. Scenes like this and others take place at roughly the same running time as they did in the original film. For the modern horror film goers this new Evil Dead will be artfully shot and top of the line. I recommend this movie but not to people who want the fun independent over the top style of the original. Stay for the clip at the end of the credits, you'll be glad you did.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Is Not Horror,"I love horror films. Horror films should be smart, convey a sense of dread, make you care about what happens to the characters, and simply scare the crap out of you. Jaws is a horror film. Alien is a horror film. The Exorcist is a horror film. The Shining is a horror film.Evil Dead 2013 is not a horror film. It is a splatter fest with blood and body parts everywhere. It is not the least bit scary. We could care less what happens to the characters because they are all idiots. I am not going to compare it to the original because there's simply no point. The original had all the horror devices that this one does not.Do yourself a favor, pay attention to the one star reviews, this film deserves nothing more than that.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Misunderstood Yet Fitting Follow Up To A Splatter Classic,"I have seen all three original Evil Dead titles dozens of times each and I love each of them equally but separately. The Evil Dead is a brilliantly disorienting splatter film with little to no plot, dizzyingly bizarre camera work, and a cast of kids that couldn't act their way out of a mud puddle. Evil Dead 2 is a slap stick gore comedy based loosely on the events of the first film. The gore and scares are softened with rainbow hued fluid instead of blood in most cases and punctuating each death with campy humor. Army of Darkness is a swords and sorcery adventure/comedy the thrives on it's own campy goofiness and lazy story telling to produce a uniquely cinematic adventure classic.There seems to be some misunderstanding about Evil Dead 2013. A lot of supposed hardcore fans of the original seem to think that The Evil Dead was full of humor and the reboot missed the comedy mark. Well hombres, unless you think the line ""party down"" is a real laugh riot then I think you are remembering the wrong film in the series. Ironically there is more humor in the 2013 version.Another complaint the sycophantic internet neck beards seem to have is that the acting and story were sub-par. Please reread my previous synopsis of the original and understand that the character Mia in the reboot emotes more in her first 10 mins on screen than the whole cast of the original did in 90. The only thing different about the story this time around is that the kids have a reason to go to the cabin and the demons have an actual motivation for killing everybody.Evil Dead 2013 is like a wet dream for any fan of the original. It's riddled with horror convention, plump with demonic imagery, and soaked in blood. This is a horror film that would be very much at home among the blood and guts films of the 80's so if that is your thing like it is mine please ignore the poser fan reviews and enjoy the senseless carnage. For those not interested in senseless carnage, skip it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Good Horror Movie,"I am not sure what people were expecting from this movie. Being a huge fan of the original trilogy, I had low expectations. Yet I went into watching this film trying not to compare it too much to the original. It is, after all, a re-imagining of the original. So, yes as much as I would like to have seen Ash in this film, it really would not have done justice to have another actor try to play the part. And with it being a complete re-imagining, they could not have just had Bruce play the part.I thought the film makers did a good job of creating a movie that was both new and old. It did pay homage to many aspects of the original film, but without completely copying them. Some of the characters were unmemorable and stupid at times, but that is normal in a horror movie. I think people forget they are watching a horror movie sometimes.I thought it was a good choice to use actors and actresses that were not known. Usually when a film does this, it suffers from overacting or just plain bad acting. That was not the case here. Yes many of the characters were hollow and underdeveloped, but who cares in a 90 minute horror movies where you know most of them are going die anyways? The one area that I was a bit disappointed in, was the demonic faces. At times, especially in the beginning, there was a bit too much CGI. I do think it got better as the film went on. But one of the things that made the original films so great was the use of great makeup effects rather than CGI. Honestly most of it was quite well done, but occasionally you could tell it was not.Overall, I think this was a great addition to the Evil Dead franchise. Perhaps not as part of the Ash trilogy, but as a stand alone tribute.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the original but still loved it,"I don't understand why everyone is hating on the movie, I'm a huge fan of the original but even I could enjoy this movie. The lack of comedy the original had was a bit of a let down but it made up for it with Raimi's gore factor he's famous for in his movies. It's also been said that this wasn't so much of a remake as somewhat of a continuance of the original. The rumor is that there is 3 more possibly to come and I look forward to seeing them also. Don't let all of these bad reviews stop you from checking it out. I stand by my opinion that this is an awesome movie without a doubt. I will be adding this movie to my collection of Raimi films, right next to my Evil Dead Trilogy. Keep it going Sam, you haven't disappointed me yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not to be confused with The Evil Dead,"The remake (or should I say reboot) of the horror cult classic was disappointing. The movie wasn't all terrible but it's just not anywhere near the incredibly horrific yet hilarious Sam Raimi version. The original was unintentionally funny, incredibly creepy, the possession is much more entertaining to watch and it stars Bruce Campbell.On it's own, the reboot is deliciously gory (if you're into that sort of thing), surprising well-acted, and includes an interesting twist at the end. (Interesting doesn't always mean good.) It lacked the humor and creepiness the original brought and was instead filled with excessive amounts of blood and gore.Evil Dead had more of an explanation to why the friends were at a random cabin in the middle of the woods. It's more than just five college friends going on vacation in creepy cabin in the middle of the woods (but seriously, how did they find this place?). That was a nice change in a genre that's full of clichés and unoriginality.I'm not a big fan of gore or blood at all. I can't watch any of the Saw films and I barely even watched Hostel. Evil Dead was no exception. I spent most of the film partially covering my eyes or trying to tune out the disgusting sound effects from the gore scenes. The main attraction was the gore and that was the main premise of the movie. There was nothing as good to balance it out. The original had a nice balance of gore and black humor where I could actually watch the movie in it's entirety with only covering my eyes once. That may have something to do with the $350,000 budget that they had.Jave Levy as Mia, the drug addicted sister and Shiloh Fernandez as Mia's brother David were good casting choices. They did a great job creating their own brother-sister team that differed from the original. Jessica Lucas and Lou Taylor Pucci were strong additions to the group of friends and were great as the supporting characters. The only weak person in the group was Elizabeth Blackmore, not because her acting was in any way terrible, the character was just boring and very forgetful.Evil Dead is a fun, guts and gore filled horror flick that is no where near it's predecessor. The movie will scare you (if you're a baby like me) and gleefully disgust you with it's gory scenes.As much as I found it disappointing, I would recommend at least seeing it once. 5 out of 10 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
