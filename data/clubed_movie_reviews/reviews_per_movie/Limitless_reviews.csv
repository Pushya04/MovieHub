"Original, creative, enjoyable","I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)So, the good: Original, creative writing. Original, creative, beautiful cinematography. Original, creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable, except when it isn't trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.The bad: Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The fore-last scene is over the top. I loved it. (My wife said: ""They're trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right?"" and they were.) I can't blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn't believable. It isn't consistent with the rest. But it's definitely where the roller-coaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast, the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It's like the script saves the best for the sequel.So, unfortunately, this movie doesn't have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely a fun movie!,"If you've ever found yourself staring into nothingness, wondering why you couldn't muster even a hair of energy to get up and do something, then you're going to find this movie highly satisfying. Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a ""super-you."" The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" The movie graphics, plot, and main actors (well, DeNiro, Cooper, and Johnny Whitworth) were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us, ""What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind, who would you be?"" Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also, there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity, and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though, the one guy, Johnny Whitworth, did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented.I'd definitely recommend watching this movie. If only just for the ridiculous scene with the skates. Hilarious.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Witty, uncontrollable and imaginative","An aspiring writer struggling with his love life, an apartment in shambles, a wasteful lifestyle and a writer's block, is left hopeless after being dumped for his ineptitude. He then stumbles upon a past acquaintance who introduces him to an experimental drug that could change his life forever. The intriguing proposition of the story centers around this pharmaceutical experiment that optimizes brain usage to 100% from the meager 20% that we normally use. The problem, that we soon discover, is that supply is limited..... and restricted.Eddie (Bradley Cooper)'s attempts to write a novel go in vain and his inability to push himself to seek refinement is evident with his apartment, his relationship with his otherwise focused girlfriend and his dependent finances. At such a juncture, he stumbles upon his ex- brother-in-law who introduces an experimental designer drug that enhances brain functionality to harness all its potential. As he is then confronted by his landlord's wife who yaks at him for the pending rent, Eddie chooses an intelligent escape by taking one of the pills and then, whatever he has seen, heard, read or experienced in his life, is available to him as reference. Knowledge acquisition is rapid and so is its retention. Eddie soon discovers that he can achieve the impossible like Bruce Almighty and as greed takes over, he seeks to exploit the financial markets to make some astronomical gains. Overnight success draws inquisitive eyes of the ambitious and Eddie would need to maintain a low profile if he doesn't want to expose his secret to his phenomenal analytical abilities. Veteran investor Carl Loon (Robert De Niro) employs Eddie and gives him the incredible opportunity to make it to the big league in a very short time. Just when it all seems to be going his way, Eddie realizes that the pills have an adverse effect on his health and without a regular intake, he would almost lose his life. To add to that, he is pursued by a goon who now knows the secret to his supreme abilities and demands more pills for himself.There is always some danger lurking around the corner in Limitless. Even though, the idea of an intelligence enhancing medication seems like the ultimate strength, one always feels restless and is aware of some form of imminent threat. It just seems too good to be true and that is primarily what grips you through this well paced screenplay.The film looks great with the camera speeding through the streets and the stunning views of New York city. The mood resembles that of Neil Burger's previous film, 'The Illusionist' and this one is equally intriguing, if not more. The background score is well suited to the film's pulsating situations.The beautiful Abbie Cornish plays the tense situations quite well and in confrontational scenes with Cooper, she emerges strong. Robert De Niro gets a Michael Douglas type role where he seems to enjoy throwing his power around. Good to see him threatening people around him because that is what he does best..... Bradley Cooper took complete advantage of the opportunity where he can play a definitive lead and he is quite convincing both as the struggling author and the coolest man in town with higher intelligence.Director Neil Burger keeps the momentum going while keeping us glued with suspense, action and twists. A novel idea is simplified in his execution and he makes it easy to absorb it as a reality right from the beginning. He does avoid superficial scenarios and unnecessary drama and chooses to portray the hardships that Eddie encounters while he possesses such power. Limitless entertains with the possibilities and the consequences of uncontrollable powers. However, in the end, it is no 'Inception' in story telling or concept and if you're in with unreal expectations, it will surely disappoint but due credit must be given to Neil Burger for a good execution of the concept that even in the end, doesn't fall flat on its face.8.081 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Fun and Original Science-fiction Thriller,"This movie doesn't exactly go deep with either the moral or thematic implications of super intelligence. Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain.Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.There are one or two moments that strain credulity, (I'm thinking, particularly, of the one-eyed thug who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn with his gun) but I think every good story has a few of those.The camera tricks and visual effects used to externalize what's going on in the main character's head are also a lot of fun. Good performances by all the actors.If you yearn for science fiction movies and thrillers that you can actually believe from moment to moment and haven't seen 10 times before, then I'd recommend this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Limitless in intrigue and excitement at breakneck pacing,"You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, or at least that's what authors tell us. Well motion picture directors would want you to not judge their films by the trailers or posters. Limitless is one of the few recent films to deny the misconceptions from its efficient marketing.It's sold as Bradley Cooper gets smart drug fix from Robert De Niro then must defeat him through a series of cat and mouse games. In actuality Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling writer/slob who acquires a drug called NZT-48, a pill that allows him to recall everything from the briefest of encounters. In minutes he is transformed from a guy no one could believe has a book deal to a man no one can do without. Doors open, too many doors really. Eddie's problem solving solutions end up fanning the flames of questions around him, and before long it seems that everyone in the city is after him. The intricate dynamics that weave this trail of lies is the best since Match Point (2005).Cooper's performance totally shocked me. He's able to go from panicked addict to conversationalist genius and back without losing the support of the audience. With no key player for Eddie to confide in or take along for the journey, the supporting performances are little more than plot points. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro don't have nearly as much range to showcase in this screenplay. However with a little change, Anna Friel's one scene could have been expanded into something with more drama and likely give Limitless the emotional impact needed for some to take it seriously.Enough cannot be said for how amazingly brisk and refreshing the production comes across. Nearly every scene has at least some artistic appeal. This is one of the more attractive films I've seen using the Red digital cameras and I have to give the colorist some praise for the warm palette used to show the influence of NZT-48. Thanks to the mind-altering plot, Limitless is one of the few movies where extravagant transitions make sense.Limitless is indicative of a minor subgenre that sprang up around the dawn of the current millennium; I call this the genre of self-discovery. Examples of these films include Fight Club and The Beach and more examples can be found in Asian cinema (where I also believe Limitless drew inspiration for art direction). The primary goal of these metaphysical pictures is to delve into what makes us tick. Limitless asks the viewer to exam what's holding each of us back from being the perfect versions of ourselves, and by stories end this viewer certainly felt inspired.I can see room to complain when it comes to the way Limitless approaches relationships. Remember, I'm seeing this as a specialty film about inner exploration and as such I'm allowing for some leeway in how director Neil Burger is able to keep the pace going while focusing almost exclusively on Eddie. Still, I would have appreciated one scene showing how his limitless knowledge afforded him relationship-handling tact.Limitless has such a breathtaking pace that you aren't going to find the time needed to nitpick. Some of the action at movie's end is resolved with little plausibility, but it's too much fun to attack. At least the title of Limitless offers some truth in advertising.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
His Intelligence Has Its Limits,"A pill can make you smart is indeed an interesting concept but what is more interesting is the directing. It's not an ordinary thriller movie. The director gave a lot of style in this movie to make it more exciting. It definitely works and the movie is limitlessly entertaining. There are some plot holes that the filmmakers doesn't intend to fix it but still it's worth watching.The movie is of course about an intellectual pill. It's intriguing to know what's the side effects of it. Well, it's quite fun to know what's going to happened to the protagonist but the movie's smartness isn't very limitless. There are massive plot holes in here. There are also some confusion in this.If there is something limitless in here then it's the entertainment quality. Neil Burger gave a lot of style and ridiculousness in this film. The editing was quite fast and fun. The zooming in through places is amazing. The soundtrack and the music score does perfectly fit in every scene. The performances were good. Bradley Cooper is an entertaining actor but he had some weaknesses in serious scenes like crying or being scared. Robert De Niro only shows up in times but you know him, he is just being himself and there is nothing wrong with that.Overall the movie is ridiculously fun. The movie is no cliché, it's all unique by so many reasons including the trippy, vertigo, and zooming in style. It's intriguing, it's fast, and it's smart at times. ""Limitless"" is another movie that has merits that ignore the flaws. It's just a non-stop entertaining solid flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Intriguing concept, mediocre film","I was really looking forward to this movie. It has so much potential: an intriguing and clever concept, superb actors, decent script, good direction, sensational visual effects and editing, so what happened? I can't help but feel there was a great story driven film in here at one time during development. However, somehow studio executives -- no doubt pandering to the teenage boy demographic -- just had to add in all the predictable car chases and shoot-em-up gratuitous action. In the end this action was irritatingly distracting from the very captivating storyline that I kept on wishing they would come back to - i.e what happens when one has unlimited cognitive capacity. This is the same flaw that marred Christopher Nolan's otherwise fascinating story in Inception.Note to studios and filmmakers why can't you be bold enough to just stick with the STORY? You're squandering these great concepts. Not every film needs to be an action/adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Limitless,"I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi films.The tension was akin to any good crime drama but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. Why didn't I hear of this book? Anyways, Eddie(Bradley Cooper) is trying to meet a deadline after breaking it off with the love of his life(Abbie Cornish),and is on a downward spiral. He runs into an ex-brother-in-law who appears to be a druggie, but is actually involved in designer drug production, and is ensnared in a plot that leads him from the Russian Mafia to Wall Street. The science behind this movie is very believable and I applaud the producers for being brave enough to bringing it to the screen",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'LIMITLESS' definitely has limits but still entertaining.,"'LIMITLESS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Bradley Cooper has came a long way from TV's 'ALIAS'. Here he headlines his first major motion picture, taking over a role once filled by Shia LaBeouf (who backed out of the film after hurting his arm in an automobile accident). A film with Robert De Niro playing a supporting player! As a whole the movie is entertaining but nothing great and Cooper's leading man performance is adequate but not spectacular. I think he's better in ensemble pieces like 'THE HANGOVER' and 'THE A-TEAM'. The film tells the story of a down on his luck writer who takes a secret drug which enhances the level his brain is able to function at, making him 'super smart'. It's directed by Neil Burger and written by Leslie Dixon (based on the book 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn).Cooper plays Eddie Morra, a New York City writer who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, who has also recently been seen co-starring in 'SUCKER PUNCH'). He's struggling to meet a deadline for a book he's been contracted to write when he stumbles upon his ex brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) who offers him a free sample of an unknown pharmaceutical drug called NZT. The drug provides him the ability to use a hundred percent of his brain's full capacity, as opposed to the supposed normal twenty percent, and makes him super confident. When he comes across a full stash of the drug he begins succeeding at everything he had always dreamed of. Then the side effects kick in and he discovers there are others after the drug as well that will stop at no cost to get a hold of it.The movie has an interesting premise and is played out at an amusing pace but it's full of holes and moral detachment. Without giving away too much I'll just say that if you stop to think about many details in the story they don't really make sense. There's also several things the main character does in the film that are highly morally questionable yet they're portrayed as if they're heroic actions. I also think Cooper isn't quite cut out to carry a film like this and makes the character even a little less likable. With all it's flaws the movie is still somewhat interesting and intriguing and definitely entertaining. It's a mixed bag but worth the watch.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Stylish, Fun Film To Watch","A stylish movie with an interesting premise that delivers more than it fails.Bradley Cooper, as ""Eddie Mora,"" was good in the lead and actually all the characters in the film were interesting. That includes the villains were credibly menacing.Anyone who has been hooked on any kind of pill can relate to this film. The pill in this story, however, is different from anything anyone's heard of....and intriguing. You can't help but wonder if you would be tempted to take it yourself.Co-starring with Cooper and his magic pill is the style of the film. It's very stylish and looks great on Blu-Ray. If you're into visuals, this is a good movie to check out. The same goes for fans of suspense.I found this very entertaining and a film I would watch again. Yeah, the ending is a little contrived but, overall, it's a fun movie to watch.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So much potential wasted here, but so much fun it excuses it","Limitless is based by a book of the same name and any problems I have with the film are due to the translation of book to film. Primarily, it's clear that the book is written in the first person as their is an ongoing narration throughout the film of the main character commenting on events and giving exposition - which does the job in telling the story effectively, combined with the visuals (which are amazing), it does become irritating and at times unnecessary.My main problem with the film, however, is directly linked to why I liked it so much. Due to being based on a long book that would take hours and hours of reading, the story gets condensed and sped up, so plot points fly by one after the other and no time is wasted on anything useless which keeps it fast paced and engaging. However, this also means that problems and events that should have had more time get roughly 10 minutes to begin and conclude, downplaying their significance somewhat. Problems that seem dire get dealt with very quickly, seemingly with no side effects. The plot also lacks an overriding goal - a destination, it seems as if Eddie (Bradley Cooper) just takes things as they come rather than have an overall game plan, and it leaves you a bit dissatisfied in places as it feels it lacks direction, where in the book it would be more spread out and natural. OK, bad's out the way - now the good! The film is very well written; the script is very tight and has clearly been cut down for efficiency yet still natural and the acting is brilliant also. All characters are very convincing and Bradley Cooper's intelligent Eddie is so entertaining, convincing and endearing that you eventually love the character and rejoice every time he has to explain anything to the normal humans.Some of the action scenes are a bit naff, but otherwise very well done, but besides Bradley Cooper's performance, I'd say the main prize goes to the director - Neil Burger. My hat goes off to him for his visual imagination - his transitions between different locations are the best I've ever seen in a film and it really encapsulates Eddie's disorientation when he blacks out on and off. The effects used to illustrate the effects of the drug are also brilliant; sometimes you forget the voice over and just get lost in the special effects - such as the one in the trailer when the letters fall from the ceiling. The only thing I would complain about is the fact that he often uses extreme close ups excessively and it gets a bit distracting, but nothing compared to how compelling this film was. It was clever, but not genius, it was thrilling, but not mind blowing - it was just a lot of fun. Definitely worth seeing if you're an aspiring director or just a person with eyes in their face.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic well done Bravo,"I was skeptical at first about this movie, which is why I didn't go see it the week that it came out. I just figured it was all too obvious what would happen and to be honest some of that did happen yet they did the expected so well that it really didn't seem to make a big difference that I saw it coming a mile off. Which made the things that you didn't expect even better. I enjoyed this movie so much that I would do the unthinkable that I've done only once in all of my years, and that is pay to see it again at the theater.

"Thrills, spills and pills","Neil Burger's 'Limitless' is a clever dumb film, which is surprisingly entertaining. It has thrills, spills and pills.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a quotidian New York writer. He lives in a decrepit downtown shack, and hasn't written a word in his 'new' book for longer than he remembers. He can't articulate what his book is supposed to be about, but that doesn't stop his delusional grandeur.One day, Eddie bumps into his ex-brother-in-law. They exchange some obsequious patter, before the ex sees Eddie for what he is: a bum. Pitying him, the ex offers him a pill that will change his life forever.Don't ask me how the pill works. Don't even ask the filmmakers. Just know that it does work. The pill enables Eddie to access 100% of his brain, instead of the customary 20%. Random trivia subconsciously stored long ago can now be instantly recalled. Eddie's potential is potentially limitless.We see many examples (the most enjoyable bits) of what these $800 pills can do. Eddie writes his book in four days, extemporises at the piano in three, and learns to speak several languages. He's now the smartest person in the world (implied, not asserted). It's not long before he makes the obvious connection to money. He schmoozes his way into a top energy firm, under the supervision of Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).Being the great bastion of solicitude that it is, Hollywood takes its responsibility of highlighting the ills of drug abuse – even one that gives the user genuine powers – seriously. The pill lasts only a few hours, and addiction causes grotesque side-effects.It gets a bit far-fetched when others start taking the pill, and the penultimate scene (which could have been the ending, but thank goodness it wasn't) is profoundly awful. I won't even hint at what it includes; I want you to shriek in disbelief as I did. Absurdity abounds, but it's not a fault because it's within context. Smart dialogue covers up many of the contrivances, and De Niro does more here than he has done for years: he acts without mugging.www.scottishreview.net",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fairly good, and original...","LIMITLESS has the advantage of telling a fairly unusual story in a way that seems fresh and compelling, although there are serious problems with the narrative throughout. In essence it tells of an ordinary man - a struggling writer in New York - who comes into contact with an extraordinary drug that allows him to use 100% of his brain, rather than the 20% that the ordinary person supposedly uses.It's a story of rags to riches with a sting in the tail: like all drugs, this one is incredibly addictive and boasts some serious withdrawal symptoms to boot. Still, I particularly enjoyed watching the central character engage with the financial market, and use his new-found skills to make himself an almost overnight success.The story is enlivened by some cool special effects, particularly the endless zoom shot which whizzes through the streets and locales in a way which fizzes with energy (a shame then that it eventually becomes repetitive after it's used too much). The introduction of some Russian gangsters add some decent thriller aspects to the narrative, although certain sequences feel completely out of place (the subway fight, based around viewings of Bruce Lee flicks on TV, feels like something straight from the Thai martial arts flick CHOCOLATE). Bradley Cooper has never been a first choice for me as an actor, but he acquits himself pretty well here and De Niro is very good, as always.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A clever film that plays out the possibilities of its simple mind-expanding premise,"Limitless (2011)A sharp, twisting, wishful film, well done and intriguing. If you can throw this in with other mind-bending fantasy films with tinges of sci-fi reality like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Everlasting Mind"" or ""Momento"" you'll see both its strengths and intentions and maybe how it falls a little short of those rather startling and full-blooded films.The idea here is simple--a pill makes you use your brain to its full capacity, so you can learn and perform at astonishing levels. But this also wears you down physically and chemically, so that you not only get hooked on increasing doses but start to have side effects. But when you are on the pills, you do things that the rest of the world notices.So our leading man played by Bradley Cooper (normally a secondary actor) takes it on. What layers it up is the reasonable idea that you can't keep this kind of power to yourself, and some people will go to incredible extremes to have and control this power. If this sounds a bit like heroin--or maybe some kind of heroin/ecstasy/cocaine mixture that gives you the best of everything without killing you first--it should. The parallels to all kinds of illegal drugs are everywhere, promising one thing and leading to another.There are some very nice filming techniques going on here--some tracking shots that go on for blocks in fast motion (probably contrived with CGI), some brief distortions (when the drug kicks in), and lots of careful use of filters on the lens (the world takes on a saturated golden hue when under the influence, and is otherwise believably gray). All of this sucks you in, consciously or otherwise. And the events take you one step to the next.It's a little weird that this is all slightly un-affecting in the end, especially at the very end, when there is one last shift of trajectory that is sudden and a bit unconvincing. I didn't quite feel for the leading character so much as I was interested. One problem might actually be over-explaining the situation, and the main reason for this is voice-over narration, a lot of it. The main character keeps coming in to explain things that we kind of already knew, and certainly sensed. Or would have figured out a few minutes later, and when we get to that next scene and see what he has just explained, it's a bit dull. It's basically like repeating himself repeatedly. See? It's not necessary.But remove the narration, or just chill out a bit and go with the flow, and you have a really good movie, pure entertainment with enough angles to keep it sailing.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What a surprise!,"I got the privileged to go to an advance screening of Limitless with A Q and a with screenwriter Lesley Dixon at my school tonight. I came in with very low expectations due to the horrible advertising but came out with a big smile and a feeling of satisfaction. The movie is very unique in every aspect. The dialog is comparable to The Social Network in intricacy and craftsmanship, the acting was great (not Oscar worthy but got the job done very well), Music/Sound was very enjoyable and unique, the cinematography/color palate was great but the editing stood out the most and will definitely be nominated for an Oscar. With the screenwriter having more freedom than most writers these days as well as her producing input, it aloud the movie to be well crafted and tastefully done rather than a Hollywood crap flick. It is definitely the best movie of the year so far, which isn't really saying much, but hopefully it sets the bar for even better films to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Writer's Block: Two Forms,"LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns. The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper attempting to break away from his guy roles in road show movies) is a wannabe writer - a man who has been attempting to write a novel for years but has not achieved one word on a page. He lives off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who finally gives up on his mess of a life. Eddie moves into a filthy flat and he takes on the appearance of a street person until he encounters his ex-wife's (Anna Friel) brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who gives Eddie a pill called NZT, a medication that is purportedly able to make the brain use 100% of its capacity (fragments of memory, encountered headlines, books slightly read etc all become immediately available to the 'patient'). Eddie, seeing his life going down the toilet, takes the pill and suddenly becomes multilingual, able to figure out number sequences at the gambling table, not only start but finish his novel, etc: in other words, a genius - for the 24 hour duration of the pill's effect. His changed life introduces him to, of course, the stock market where he makes it so big that he garners the attention of major player Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro) - along with the people involved with the now murdered Vernon who want the drug back: evil Gennady (Andrew Howard) and his thugs (Eddie Fernandez and Ray Siegle) a strange 'man in a tan coat' (Tomas Arana) et al. Eddie struggles through the transition, sells his novel, wins Lindy back, and some years later is running for New York Senator on his way to the Presidency of the United States. And that of course leads to the messy ending that began the film.Based on the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, the screenplay (full of holes perhaps due to the same writer's block as the main character's) is by Leslie Dixon and the film is directed by Neil Burger, a man with some creative ideas who concentrates on gimmicks more than plot and character development. And it does have some dazzling visual effects sequences, courtesy of Joe Willems, cinematographer and Connie Brink, Special Effects Coordinator. It is an obvious attempt to compete with the fast action films that make so much box office money, but it is flimsy and may be better off in the DVD category - a category in which it landed early for obvious reasons.Grady Harp",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A ""What if ....""  movie without much reasoning","What if you take a pill that allows you to use 100% of your brain? Of course, you could become an excellent writer and why not make some money with the stock market. Old dreams of the average American man ... This movie makes for one hour and some minutes spectators dream to change their lives just eating a pill. And this is the marketing idea behind the movie: a pleasant escape from reality, mixed with a soft thriller. It's a pity that it ends there ... Scientifically speaking is not the percentage of your brain that you use that makes you smarter but is more a matter of the number of interconnections. The same I think is for the movies: is not only the original idea that makes them smart but also the number of interconnections with the reality and the truth.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing story.,"This is creative storytelling. This is the kind of movie that you watch and just get lost in the story, you get so enamored with everything that is happening that once it's over you start researching.It's honestly the kind of movie that when I watch it makes me want to be a better person, to strive for more, and it does it in a way that is fresh and that feels great. I will say that there are a few moments that semi-date it (primarily the CGI moments) but aside from that the story is just riveting and enthralling.It would go on my list as a must watch for anyone that wants to write, produce, etc. It's just phenomenal. Will definitely watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Fast Paced and Fun Thriller, That is Bound to Keep Your Heart Racing","With a remarkable energy, tension, and purely entertaining sense of nature, Limitless takes full advantage of its smart concept with just enough for you to believe in it. Bradley Cooper provides a good performance as always, with Robert De Niro and others providing mostly solid ones as well. The film starts a bit formulaic like, but it overcomes its tropes to become something truly original as it evolves into the complex sci-fi thriller you see until the very end. The cinematography is nothing too impressive for the most part, but it does have glimpses at some unique shots throughout. The script seems average for an adaptation point of view, but seems to coalign quite nicely in its now given form. In the end, Limitless is not perfect, but a certainly wise and entertaining thriller that is bound to keep your attention and your heart racing all throughout its runtime.

"Starts out really great, then it's just a mediocre thriller","I guess the script follows the book it is based on and the producers were shy about improving on the source material. Visually they did a great job, but the story turns into a no-brainer after the first act.Limitless starts out very well though I must admit while I am fed up with the ""struggling writer"" cliché - a clearly over-represented population in movies. Our Faustian hero could have been anything, from lacklustre student to small-business entrepreneur, it doesn't matter. The main point is about using drugs to enhance your capabilities, to raise above the fray, to ""become successful"", to realise oneself... and what is the trade-off, the after effects? Obviously those points are too philosophical in this story, the side-effects are vaguely used as a plot turn and then the ending simply rushes a solution to forget about it. So to me it is a major failure not to set the story inside a dystopian/noir context. What further cheapens the fine Faustian premise is the ""criminal"" subplot. Hero decides to make a lot of money for his big projects so he just goes to borrow money from some shabby thug. That is really clever. And he just forgets to pay him back, and then his big project is to become a drug-addicted President with the brains to change the world.One thing is sure, the writers didn't have NZT at their disposal.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wasn't interested in the movie until I actually watched it. Phenomenal.,"Limitless is one of those movies I was really interested to see, until I read the synopsis. Wow a pill that allows you to use 100% of your brain.....LAME! It was with some hesitation that I rented the film but the next two hours I was entranced by a movie that is impeccable. Everything about the film sings, the characters, the acting, the plot all expertly crafted, guiding the audience through an incredible rags-to-riches story that is far more entertaining than the cliché might seem.Eddie Mora ( Bradley Cooper) is a writer, well he wants to be one anyway. He has a book deal but just can't seem to get over his writer's block, or organize his apartment, or pay the rent, or keep his girlfriend, or do anything else constructive with his life. He's not a total failure but is one step away from becoming one. All of that changes when he bumps into his shady ex-brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) who happens to have the answer to all his creative problems. When Mora takes one little pill, everything changes. His thoughts become clearer, everything he ever half-read is remembered, cataloged, and ready for use in his now perfectly running mind. He becomes motivated, he knows what to do and how to do it, the possibilities for him become Limitless, especially after he joins forces with energy mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).I know, I know, it still sounds lame, but trust me, it isn't. Much like Zodiac (not The Zodiac which sucks big time) Limitless is a great film, mostly because it is made so well made, which elevates the subject matter to a whole other level. The drug isn't perfect, Eddie Mora's life becomes filled with intrigue, danger, mystery and murder and his newly found intelligence is both the cause and the cure. Check out Limitless, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Intriguing premise and Bradley Cooper,"Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is on a NYC balcony about to jump. He tells the audience that he has a 4 digit IQ but he missed something. The movie flashes back. Eddie is a blocked writer with a book contract. His girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) is tired of him and dumps him. He runs into ex-brother-in-law Vernon Gant. Vernon is with a pharmaceutical company and gives him an experimental drug. It activates all of the brain. When Eddie takes it, the effects are impressive and he writes tons of pages. The next day, he tries to get more from Vernon but he finds Vernon killed. Eddie discovers Vernon's stash. He finishes his book, learns everything, makes a killing in the market, and reconnects with Lindy and his ex-wife Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). His success draws the attention of business mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).Director Neil Burger is using a lot of visual magic to emulate the effect. He's using blue to simulate the dull everyday world. I don't really like the cold artificial feel to the movie. Also I don't like the movie getting bog down with a business deal. The movie loses tension as it keeps going back to it. There are lots that I do like about the movie. I like Bradley Cooper although I don't necessarily like his character and I don't really like his narration. I find the premise very intriguing. I just wish this was a better movie where I could root for the character and be invested in the story more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thrilling ride,"I've seen this film twice and loved it even more the second time. I absolutely adored the opening sequence as it gives you some idea of the speed of the journey you know you're going to take. Yes there are small holes in the plot, and questions you may ask, but the very nature of the film is not based on real life so who cares? Bradley Cooper is brilliant, and very engaging to watch, The direction and cinematography of the film are its major selling point, because as the story develops, the colour and clarity of the film become brighter. Bradley delivers his lines faster and faster, and Robert De Niro gives the film that little bit of extra credibility, and has been cast in the perfect role. It's a fun, exciting story, with a great idea behind it, and enough eye candy to suit all the women out there. THOSE EYES !!!! As for the men, they'll appreciate the slightly sci-fi wrapping, and the fight scenes, but above all the comedic lines that flow along nicely with the pace of the movie. Brilliant entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually stunning but undone by flaws in plot,"There is something a little Twilight Zone-ish about the plot involving a drug which allows full access to memories, enhanced learning and seemingly impossibly powerful abilities to do anything humanly possible, but has a fixed life and potentially fatal side effects. This film uses special effects which are stunningly clever and often a little nauseating and the story line is full of clever twists and turns because it is concentrating on what really may happen if such an event occurred. From that perspective it is excellent.But there are flaws in such a plot line which only partially developed the side effects themes, and, at points in the plot simply kicked them into touch as they got in the way of a good yarn. To taste the side effects is one thing but to suddenly ask us to believe they have been removed and not replaced by other side effects is simply spoiling what could have been a totally excellent film. Continuity is a little careless at times too.As it is the film is still worth watching and enjoying although I believe it could have been even better in more subtle hands. The acting is pretty good all around and the script is better than average for the genre.Six out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's really funny and satisfied the desire in our mind.What I learned from the movie is that never lose hope and trust yourself.

be prepared to hate the ending - but I won't spoil it,"Bradley Cooper is ""Limitless"" in this 2011 film, also starring Robert DeNiro and Abbie Comish.Cooper plays a loser would-be writer, Eddie Morra, who has a book contract but can't seem to write. In the beginning of the film, we see his girlfriend (Comish) leaving him, after which he runs into his drug-dealing ex-brother-in-law on the street. His brother-in-law claims to be working for a pharmaceutical company now and has gone legit, and has a new drug he gives Eddie to try out. Eddie does, and finds that he is able to completely clean his mess of an apartment, write his book, and mine information in his mind he didn't know he had. After one pill, he wants a stash of them.Morra soon learns there is a downside to this mysterious drug, called NZT, including being stalked by his loan shark, who steals one of the pills from Eddie and wants more.Really fascinating film with good performances by the leads. The ending, though, was a major letdown in a way, almost as if it was rushed. I think, however, that much is left up to the audience.Some people who reviewed this movie on IMDb didn't care for the message, but I think the message really comes from how one interprets the ending.I can't really say much more without spoilers -- it's a film ripe for discussion, it's fun, it's entertaining, Cooper is great eye candy, and it brings up some interesting questions. We don't use our whole brain, but what if we could? Will we ever be able to become transhuman? Should we? It's an old thought, demonstrated in this newish movie. I don't think NZT is the answer.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

His reason was the movie should focus on the comprehension of human brain not the memory. I think he got the point. How the brain connect the existed information to generate solutions to the problems would be a more logical approach to the whole story.

Interesting concept but it felt that it could have been a lot more.,"Reviewed July 2011It vaguely reminded me of Groundhog Day at some level. It taps into everybody's dream of being super smart and skipping the lengthy process of learning and having an answer to everything.A lazy unmotivated and just got dumped Eddie comes across a pill that can make him very smart and suddenly his life changes for good. But to sustain it, he needs regular supply of the pills and he is not the only one looking for them and those who are, are willing to go to any lengths to get their hands on them.Bradley Cooper lands a solo star role and does a decent job at it. Robert DeNiro is present only to beef up the openings had Bradley not clicked, anyone could've done DeNiro's role. Seeing Abbie Cornish for the first time, she was terrific especially in the initial breakup scene.The plot as it's title tries to take the premise to explore limitless options but ends up going in circles for a little while. A movie can either be a thriller or a mystery, the one that tries to be both needs exceptional handling or might end up in mediocrity. This one falls a little to the latter. Moving on to positive aspects of the movie, it had exceptional presentation, apt performances but a little confused direction with an end that left a lot to be desired.It is still an entertaining thriller for most part of it, which definitely could've been a lot more.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Conceptually original, but somehow incomplete.","Scientifically, we are known to use between 10-20 % of our brains. However, the who's who in neurochemistry believes this to be a myth. As humans, we supposedly use 100% of brain, but at different times. Then again, that last line would be in obvious reference to the most intelligent of humans. But imagine what it would be like if we could use 100% our brain all the time.Edward Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a down and out writer having failed to meet a deadline in handing in his new book. Worse, Eddie can't find the words to get his book started. On the verge of becoming a 'nobody', Eddie bumps into Vernon Grant, a drug dealer and brother of his ex-wife. Out of goodwill, Vernon offers Eddie an experiential drug called NZT48, claiming it has the ability for humans to harness 100% of the brain's capacity. With nothing to loose, Eddie consumes the pill and within a minute, receives an extra boost to his sensory perceptions. With NZT taking immediate effect, everything becomes absolutely clear to Eddie. From enhanced intelligence to boosted confidence, Eddie is a new man with an alter ego; A highly intelligent superhero of sorts, whose forte lies in 'brain over brawn'. Not only does he publish his book, Eddie ventures into the financial world of stocks and shares and becomes rich at an unbelievable pace. Soon enough, Eddie's blazing pace catches the eye of financial mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). Although Loon is skeptical about Eddie's origins, he employs the latter rather than have to face competition from a rising Wall Street comet.But as it seems, everything has a price. Eddie soon finds himself in a world of trouble. Not only is NZT addictive, withdrawal from the drug is potentially lethal. Eddie also learns that he is not the only person to benefit from this drug. Furthermore, having found Vernon murdered, Eddie walks away with a stash of NZT, only to become a target for multiple assassins.When Bradley Cooper is not hung over from a bachelor party, he is a straight up action junkie or a drama king. This film is ample proof that Cooper is a multifaceted actor. This is also a Bradley Cooper film from beginning to end and will serve as a visual treat for all his female fans. Then there is DeNiro doing what he does best. Having recently cut a niche for himself in comedy, DeNiro is back as the steely eyed nemesis with ulterior motives. As far as acting goes, I have nothing more to report. OK, maybe a quick mention to Abbie Cornish as Eddie's on-off-on girlfriend and Johnny Whitworth as Vernon. All else are forgettable.Based on Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"", the concept here is ground breaking. Adapting from this book, Leslie Dixon's screenplay is intriguing for the most part. The script is visually enhanced by mind bending cinematography, some of which include fish-eye images and extensive zooming; Kudos to director Neil Burger for this technical finesse. As a sci-fi thriller with traces of a cloak and dagger feel, Limitless is mostly entertaining and oozes with style, thanks to Cooper's on-screen charisma. Yes, but I also said the screenplay is intriguing for the most part. There is a lot of effort put in to give this movie the look and feel it has and this is evident from start to finish. Somehow, all that effort seems rushed towards the end. The screenplay takes a beating as well. As such, the last 20 minutes seems clichéd and contrived. For lack of better words, I would call it a signature Hollywood ending.If you don't mind the tapered final act, some unanswerable questions and the notion that drugs can make us virtually invincible, then this is quite an entertaining movie with an equally interesting concept.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ultimately limited and disappointed,"Limitless could have been a great story that highlights addiction in our society. Addiction to pharmaceuticals and to power. Here is a guy like a lot of people in our society, supposedly down and out who then is given a drug that makes him smarter. What does he do with it, well what every man in this capitalistic society would do-he finds a way to make lots of money. The story does a good job of making you feel his addiction which I guess is because of some decent acting. The problem is the ending of the movie. Everyone who has become addicted to this drug is faced with the consequences except for the principle character. This is a mistake. There are always consequences when you are addicted to something whether it be drugs or power. There are always consequences when your actions are nothing but selfish. The movie should have had the guts to show that.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apologies to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"Unfortunately, Hollywood's original ideas ran out before the 2nd millennium did and so we are assaulted with remakes of ""The Dukes of Hazard"" and ""The Smurfs"". With this Bradley Cooper star vehicle at least Hollywood is cribbing from a 16th century classic producing a better-living-through-chemistry retelling of the legend of Faust. In this version Satan is Big Pharma who have, for reasons only understandable to the writers, have produced a miracle smartypants drug that they are withholding from the public. Our loser protagonist gets hold of it and all hell breaks loose. On the drug, he does all manner of immoral acts: seducing his landlady, leading a business merger, playing the stock market and running for New York state Senator. Along the way, he wears some nice suits and gets to mistreat Robert DeNiro who deserves so much better than the film. The film raises some serious ethical concerns, primarily, is Eddie Morra supposed to be the good guy of the piece? Is he any less guilty than those presented as antagonists? If you can get around your moral qualms, the film presents some enjoyable effortless genius fantasies although some make absolute no sense – how does having a ""four digit IQ"" make you able to do a lot of sit-ups and win fistfights? Some attractive characters and funky camera work do help to distract if not genuinely entertain. In short, pick a film that will make you smarter.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Fun and Original Science-fiction Thriller,"This movie doesn't exactly go deep with either the moral or thematic implications of super intelligence. Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain. Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.There are one or two moments that strain credulity, (I'm thinking, particularly, of the one-eyed thug who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn with his gun) but I think every good story has a few of those.The camera tricks and visual effects used to externalize what's going on in the main character's head are also a lot of fun. Good performances by all the actors.If you yearn for science fiction movies and thrillers that you can actually believe from moment to moment and haven't seen 10 times before, then I'd recommend this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Unlimited Awesomeness,"I was expecting to see some boring movie, but boy was I wrong. A lot of my friends wanted to see this, and I had no idea this movie even existed (I don't watch TV).Right off the bat, the film opens much in the same vein as Kick-Ass, where we see a skyscraper and someone standing up on top of it: this time being our main protagonist Edward Mora. He's contemplating on jumping during an inner monologue as a bunch of thugs are trying to break into his apartment.Of course, we go into a flashback, seeing a down-on-our-luck Bradley Cooper being a loser and drinking and throwing up on his boss. His hot girlfriend breaks up with him, giving us some exposition on how she got the job as an editor. Edward himself is trying to write a book, but he's suffering from writer's block.Immediately he runs into the brother of his previous marriage, Verne. He claims to quit drug dealing, but it turns out he has a new kind of drug that accesses a hundred percent of your brain. Edward resists, but Verne passes him the drug anyway. With nothing going for him, Edward downs the pill and tests out the ability with his landlord's wife who constantly nags at him for not paying his rent. When the drug takes effect, Edward access points where he absorbed knowledge, mentions her law school studies, and sleeps with her. Soon he's cleaning his apartment, finishes his book, and the next day the effects wear off.Without giving the rest of the movie away, Edward gets a huge supply of the drug and people are after him. Normally I don't like this kind of story, where someone possesses something no one else has and there's these bad guys chasing them for some reason, but here it works. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, and halfway through I realized it was telling a STORY and a good one at that.Bradley Cooper does an excellent job here. I hear that originally Shia Labitch was supposed to play this part originally, but he had to bow out due to a motorcycle accident. Thank God. I think Bradley Cooper was the perfect choice for the film, because he's believable. I also have to mention Robert De Niro, who's... well, Robert De Niro but it's great to see him in this movie anyway. He plays this big tycoon that Edward has to schmooze and every one of those scenes were riveting. Excellent writing there.With a fantastic script, a capable director, and wonderful acting, I could only sum up this movie as brilliant. So far, this one is in my top 10 for 2011. The year is early, but the bar has been set this year. I sure hope the rest of the films live up to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting and entertaining thriller,"Eddie is a loser aspiring writer who just got dumped by his girlfriend. He runs into the brother of his ex-wife, with whom he was married for a few hours. This guy used to be a drug dealer but now is involved with legitimate pharmaceuticals, so he says. He offers a sample to Eddie of a drug he's come up with that is unlike anything. And sure enough, when Eddie takes it, all his neurons are activated and his brains functions at 100%. He writes a chapter for his book that impresses his editor and just functions at a very high level.The next day Eddie visits the guy for some more drugs but he's beat up. After he returns from running some errands for him, he finds the guy shot and the place a mess. Someone was looking for something. He calls the cops and figures perhaps he can find the stash of drug.

He starts investing and makes a lot of money very fast. But he needs more to really make it big. He loans money from a loan shark and becomes a millionaire. His skill catches the attention and gets an interview with the biggest hedge fund boss around, played by De Niro. He wants Eddie to work on the biggest takeover he's got planned. But things don't turn right. The other company's CEO falls ill.When Eddie is off drugs he obviously can't perform at a high level and he gets into some state where he loses track of time and doesn't know how he got to places.

A realistic warning movie; and largely an one-man show,"Usually I am not very much into sci-fi movies, especially if full of technical, medical etc sophisticated terms, reasonings and inventions. Luckily to me, Limitless is, in fact, a crime thriller where the specific drug is mainly triggering ""down-to-earth"" events and relationship changes. However, it is no drug movie either - the main emphasis is on other issues than drug trafficking or miserable life of addicts.Director Neil Burger has splendidly exploited the values of the book (The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn) as well as contemporary technical opportunities, but the real star/gem is Bradley Cooper whose character changes are performed in a great and trustworthy manner. The always talented Robert De Niro plus two pleasant actresses Abbie Cornish and Anna Friel provide additional value to the movie.

"An original and intriguing story idea, a good movie","I liked this a lot. An original story idea following a yummy Bradley Cooper as Eddie; an aspiring author who overcomes his writers block with the aid of a new drug that unlocks the full potential of his brain. NZT allows him to recall everything he has ever read, seen or heard, learn a language in a day, and comprehend complex equations. He also forges into a partnership with a powerful businessman (Robert DeNiro) while suffering side effects and trying to evade the bad guys, intent on getting his stash.Considering the top billing DeNiro was kind of a non-issue here, he has a very small role. I liked the scene in the park where 'Lindy' -the girlfriend escapes the bad guys via NZT, running skills and the sharp blade of a skate.I did have a few problems with some of the ending scenes being kinda silly, such as the easily accessible ""safe house"" with the breakable windows allowing the bad guys to get in. Still, a good movie. I would love a few of these pills. I would love to be able to access more of my brain, have more energy, learn a language, figure stuff out. 7/12/15",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Drugs Are Good Mmmkay,"Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is standing on a penthouse balcony with killers losing in on him and he's about to throw himself off. We'll clearly come back to this scene later. We flash back to Eddie as a scruffy loser who can't write and leeches off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) to get by. Everything changes when he takes drug given to him by his ex-wife's brother Vernon. NZT-48 is a brain enhancing drug that improves reflexes, memory, concentration and heightens his senses and makes the camera lose its blue filter. Buzzing on the drug, he cleans up his apartment and gets to work writing his book all through the rest of the night. The following morning he is back to normal but now has large chunk of his book written.Eddie goes to Vernon's apartment to get more of the drug. He seems oblivious to fact that Vernon looks rough and roughed-up. Vernon knows he's after more NZT-48 but first he make Eddie go a few errands for him. When Eddie gets back Vernon is dead with a bullet in his brain and the apartment has been ransacked. He calls the police to report the murder then desperately hunts for the drug . Luckily Eddie finds a large stash of the drug with a pile of money and pockets both as the police arrive.We then get a montage of Eddie being smart, competent and popular, hanging with around loose women in exotic locations and driving fast cars. He wants to be rich and powerful and can't make money fast enough so he turns to a dodgy Russian moneylender ( I thought the drug was supposed you smart). With that money he really starts getting into his stride, making large amounts on the stock-market. This brings to him to attention of rich powerful people, such as Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) the boss of a energy company who is really impressed with Eddie's ideas and arranges another meeting the following day ( I wonder if his humourless no-nonsense persona is a side effect of growing up with that hilarious name).Eddie starts seeing the downside of NZT-48 – his supply is starting to run low and he getting withdrawal symptoms and he hasn't even found out who makes it. He has blackouts where he may have killed a woman. He blows it big time at his meeting with Van Loon. The Russian moneylender has also got a taste for the drug ( thanks to Eddie forgetting to pay him his money – that must the 'Smart' drug at work again) and he's on Eddie's back for more. Whoever killed Vernon is now after him too. And the blue filter is back on the cameraI did enjoy watching this film but it didn't really go anywhere that was too surprising and the ending was just a cheat. For someone who is apparently limitless his ambition seem so restrained and conventional. It seems that drug turns off the part of the brain that stops people being arrogant megalomaniacs. The mention of the ""humans only use 10% of their brain"" nonsense is just a lot of rubbish and really wasn't needed for the plot all. Google is a good friend to writers doing research and a terrible foe to all those that just can't be bothered. Bradley Cooper was okay as Eddie but then I didn't like Eddie as either arrogant selfish genius or a self-pitying loser. Robert De Niro was great especially the scene where he's giving Eddie a real dressing down. Anna Friel is in the film as Eddie's ex-wife Melissa which is really not a big part. She does okay with what she given to do.Rating 6/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bradley Cooper lives up to his Limitless potential as its star,"Since it's been a couple of weeks that I watched this movie, here are my thoughts: Bradley Cooper has now come into his own among compelling movie stars with this, his first film in which he's the whole show. He plays an aspiring novelist who has writer's block. That is, until his former brother-in-law provides him with a drug that helps him functions all parts of his brain. So Cooper does lots of things to the point of him skipping through time and being way over his head when some troubling revelations of his doings come up...Though quite entertaining, some of the logic lapses near the end. Still, with such fine supporting turns from, among others, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel, and the one and only Robert De Niro, not to mention some trippy camera shots, Limitless is a quite entertaining for the 90 or so minutes that pass.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Smarter than Expected!,"Limitless is actually a very smart thriller with an unusual plot and an interesting premise. For the most part, the filmmakers actually made good use of the unusual plot and made a good, interesting film out of it. I liked the fact that this film was not filmed in the traditional sense. What I mean by that is this film had various camera angles not usually seen in movies and a tight narration that is hard to come upon.This film is about a author who is in a downturn but when he discovers a drug that unlocks full use of the brain, his life immediately starts to get better. But after he meets a big, power-wielding broker, it seems there may be consequences after all....This film is not known for it's cast. In fact, the only brand name stars are Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro. Cooper, starting to play in more dramatic roles, is really convincing here. De Niro actually had one of his better roles in the past decade. He brought back a shade of his pre-2000 form.Overall, this is a conceptual film that actually works and actually made money at the box office. I guess audiences were looking for a smart,original film. Well, they definitely got one here. This film features drama and thrilling moments here. There is even a few action scenes which may satisfy some people. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best movies in recent years,"Limitless is a fairly realistic superpower movie, which is why it stuck a chord with me. While I like to see amazing and unnatural things occur in movies, part of me isn't a fan of supernatural/magic stuff. Even Iron Man, which based the ""supernatural powers"" of Tony Stark on science and technology was a little ridiculous. Something like NZT-48 could probably be made using today's technology, although it clearly wouldn't be quite as awesome.Anyway, Limitless was an enjoyable ride from the very start of the movie to the very end. As some other reviewers have said, the concept of the Limitless storyline was fascinating but the execution was a bit flawed in some areas. The last chunk of the movie had some unnatural-feeling plot moves that probably could have been left out. This is why the movie isn't a 10 in my book, but I can gloss over some of the movies ""mistakes"" because the overall package was still great.There are some really trippy areas, specifically the parts where the camera ""walks"" dozens of blocks across New York City, that drew me into the awesome perspective of Eddie Morra (the main character)on NZT-48 too. I thought that this added, not detracted, from the overall ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Fun,"Though not perfect, and a bit of waste of an interesting concept that put to better use could have been a far more wide reaching sci-fi about the power of human consciousness and ambition in a society without limits, Limitless is a perfectly enjoyable thriller. Bradley Cooper makes for a charismatic star, the visual tricks employed by director Neil Burger are flashy bordering on trippy, and the supporting cast all do reasonable jobs. The dialogue however, is very clichéd, especially when Cooper is on ezt and talks as though he googled, ""how to sound clever"" The result is the kind of thing a gang of pretentious teenage boys might blurt out before being mocked incessantly for sounding pretentious, and kills the illusion that Eddie is as smart as the film thinks he is. There are also various issues with the people that follow the main character, as they seem to pick and choose when to threaten him, and when to simply wait in plain view. The whole film is oddly weightless, it left no emotional impact and I didn't particularly care about any of the characters, Coopers charisma and my need to see the next twist were all that kept me watching. Overall, a good, fun thriller, but one that could have used a slightly stupider premise, as the smart one it uses is utterly wasted",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Oh, the lost opportunities...","Good premise, decent characters, an enjoyable movie, sloppy plot holes and a script that loses itself somewhere along the way. But ah well, you all knew this.Why is it that every time a movie is made with the theme 'average guy suddenly becomes extraordinary' and I'm like 'that would be sooo cool', the script consummates his powers in the most cliché-like and uncreative scenarios? He might be super-smart, all-powerful, able to read other's minds, a superhero etc. or can get some strange tool like a universal remote control or an invisibility cloak or WHATEVER... but what does he do?- he uses all this to pick up chicks and resolve his petty household issues. This is the 'Bruce Almighty syndrome'- the guy was literally ALLMIGHTY and he used his powers to become a local TV celebrity and to enlarge his girlfriend's boobs.In this particular case, the situation is somewhat better; yet still. Is playing the stock-market and running for senator really the best thing one with a limitless mind can do? How about SCIENCE? I mean it's the first thing on one's mind as far as super-smart is concerned. Wasn't this guy interested in giving the 'Millenium Prize Problems' or the 'Theory of everything' a shot? How about trying to cure cancer or AIDS? When you literally have one of the greatest intellects in history you just shouldn't waste your time on being a goddamn senator... I just find it surprising the script doesn't even think of such a possibility instead focuses on the guy impressing some chick in a club by speaking French.

"Concept is fantastic, but execution is flawed.","Limitless tells the story of a disorganized, poor, wannabe-writer loser Bradley Cooper who stumbles upon a drug that makes him super-smart. Suddenly, he can brilliantly achieve any task with lightning speed.The movie is based on a book, and the entire idea is excellent. You should see Limitless if only for the cool ways it promotes being focused on increasing your mental abilities, and the perks that come with intelligence. Bradley Cooper does some stupendous acting in the main role, the visual and audio direction is awesome, with great special FX. The movie's first third or so is very good overall.However, after that the movie stumbles repeatedly. The movie's creators/book author prove unequal to the task of writing an uber-genius's thoughts and actions plausibly. Nor can they break out of the mold of action-movie templates and clichés. As a result, and in order to keep the story going, they put the protagonist into trouble that is completely incompatible with his intelligence - which is not only proclaimed, but explicitly shown via various effects of it. They try to write this guy as genius, but unfortunately, he is a genius only when it suits the plot. When the writers need to insert your standard action villain, or other obstacles - the hero's genius conveniently disappears.To sum up: definitely worth seeing for the concept alone, but by no means the masterpiece it could have been. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining,"The movie is about Edward Morra who is suffering from a writer's block and has not been able to put one word to paper for a book contract he signed. Perchance, he is introduced to a new drug that opens up the limits of his mind. His misadventures take him through expected channels of fantasy, murder, pursuit and survival.The movie has many loose ends, especially on the murders that happen. It struggles at times to move forward logically from a scene to the next, but you will be willing to excuse the lapse as the story-line brings in the next twist of events. Bradley carries the movie on his shoulders pretty well, but it is a disappointment to see the talent of Robert DeNiro wasted in the movie. DeNiro does justice to the role given to him, but when you put an actor of his caliber in a movie, you expect more. The only scene where he inspired was close to the climax when he is Eddie's office. Personally, I liked the Russian antagonist, played by Englishman Andrew Howard, more impressive that the rest of the cast.With no real villains in it, but everyone dealing with a negative identity of their own, the movie does well to keep you entertained.7/10 - probably I may have given it an 8, if DeNiro's talent was better managed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An Intelligent Thriller,"A writer (Bradley Cooper) discovers a top-secret drug which bestows him with super human abilities.While I have questioned Bradley Cooper's acting ability, this film is a showcase for his range.

His ability to smoothly transition between schlepp and genius was flawless, and with a little help from a hairstylist he was able to look both parts.The very concept of this film is one that has intrigued me for a long time, at least since I encountered ""Star Trek""'s Data as a teenager.

Pleasantly Surprised,"I realize the full release for this film is 2 days away, so this review can't go into any specifics or great detail (don't want to give anything away). Walking into the theater, I didn't have any lofty expectations. There's a delicate balance with adding futuristic technology and/or sci-fi to a modern day setting. Many movies take it to a level so unrealistic it just gets silly and ruins the plot (e.g. Eagle Eye). However, Limitless focuses more on the characters and theme to carry the film. Bradley Cooper is very convincing in the beginning as the ""before"" version of himself, and you find yourself routing for him in an old fashioned good vs evil way, without him being the perfect prince charming type. Each character has the ""everday person"" layers which keeps the movie grounded enough to watch it as if it was really possible to be in those situations. In the end, you'll be asking yourself just that, ""What would I do in that situation?"" There's a couple holes left open in the theory of ""the pill"" and with what could/would really happen if it was real life, but I guess that would be expected in a movie about a fictional technology.Overall, Recommended - A good 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun and creativity don't come without a few minor kinks,"Amidst the sea of remakes, reboots, sequels, and prequels it's refreshing to see Hollywood produce something wholly original. Limitless is the story of Eddie Morra, a down on his luck writer whose career is going nowhere. Things change when he discovers a drug which enhances the brain immensely, unlocking the other 80% that we don't even have access to. He uses his enhanced intelligence to make money off of the stock market which causes him to get lots of attention from big-shot corporate investors. Morra slowly uncovers a whole line of corruption within the world he has gotten himself involved in, getting himself in over his head and having to deal with a lot more than he bargained for. It's a twisty, complex, and thrilling adventure that could have gone sour quickly, but it is actually surprisingly decent.This is a movie you pretty much go into totally blind. There's no previous work for you to base the film on other than the book, but there's never any knowing if the film will be faithful to the book at all. The film isn't the work of some big time director that one can always expect good things from. It's an original film from the director of The Illusionist and one or two other recognizable titles. So, of course, going in I had my skepticism, seeing how this film could easily just be another dumb thriller that lacks any creativity. But, much to my surprise, it wasn't. It's actually very entertaining and very unique in its substance and style. It tells a story that is excellent at its core, but has a few kinks, making it a tad rough around the edges. A little more effort in tightening up the story could have gone a long way for the film, but its nothing that detracts from the overall impact of the film. Really it is just small absurdities and unrealistic elements that sometimes stretch the film's already thin logic. However, there is enough to hold on to that the film is still plenty entertaining.Limitless finds a good balance between substance and style. It tells its complicated story but maintains a slick atmosphere that makes the film a lot of fun. It's well shot and the cinematography is excellent. Lighting is used heavily, giving the film a wash of bleakness at first, but after Morra takes the brain enhancing pill everything grows brighter. There are a lot of visual quirks that are used to illustrate Morra's enhanced brain. Stylish direction and clever edits give the film a great design and excellent overall style. The entire visual style of the film is just one smart choice after another, giving life and image to something that is going on in our protagonists brain. To do this in writing is easier because a book is a gateway straight into the mind of a character. On film it is more difficult to make it informative as well as interesting, but Limitless pulls it off very well.This film isn't perfect but it is certainly one of the better action suspense thrillers to come out recently. This sub genre is something that produces a lot of pretentious and over zealous trash, but Limitless rises slightly above all that and becomes one of those films worth mentioning. I don't know that I will be talking about Limitless years or even months down the line, but it is a fun watch and a solid film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Limitless, slightly Limited","The film centres around a hapless writer Edward Morra who is struggling to write his book, the publishers is slowly getting impatient and no matter how hard e tries the words just don't seem to be coming his way. On top of that his girlfriend Lindy has decided enough is enough. Then a chance encounter with his ex brother in law Vernon leads him to start taking a pill. One that will change his life forever.The idea for the story is that by taking a pill you can use all the synapses of the brain rather than the 20 % we can utilise now but like most drugs there are side effects.The film force feeds you all you need to know in small snippets of visual aids and also a narrative from Bradley Cooper ( Edward ). This means you do not have to think to much about what is going on, instead you watch you listen and enjoy his journey.The pacing is good and you never lose interest or get confused about what is happening, its all there in bite size chunks for you to ingest. The film has drug abuse overtones although these are subtle they are apparent and one scene highlights this. However this is not a film that wants you to pass judgement or think to much, what you get is a popcorn flick with an IQ above average.... barely.There are many flaws with the story telling that at times leave you questioning certain actions of characters, the good news is that the pacing of the film means you don't get much time to think them through as you are now focused on the next scene and the next e.t.cThe performances are pretty good Bradley Cooper plays a different role from his usual romcom affair but as usual the focus on his baby blues take precedent. DeNiro has little to do except play the tough corporate achiever. Abbie Cornish who plays Eddie's GF is pretty expressionless but solid nevertheless. Anna Friel was rather underused as was Thomas Arana ( did he speak ). Andrew Howard who plays an eastern European money lender and all round bad guy hams it up and pulls it off rather well but overall everyone knows there part and does what is asked.The things you will enjoy about this film is the pacing and the overall concept and lets not forget this is a concept film. It does not delve deep into the human psyche nor does it open your eyes to something great. What it does do is provide 90 Min's of sharp entertainment combined with a bit of action and decent cinematography.The things you may dislike is the lack of depth and the force fed storyline although I can see for many that this will be a bonus.I've given it a 7, I was entertained and it was a polished popcorn flick with a little more depth than most. Its not going to upset anyone or make you jump and applaud so just sit back and enjoy the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Though not perfect, it dazzles thanks to Cooper, and a stylish visual tone.","Truth be told, as I was writing this review, I was kind of drawing a blank of what to open with. Such may also be the case of an early dilemma of the lead character from my latest viewing, Limitless.Bradley Cooper plays Edward Morra, a New York writer who has hit a road block. Upon a chance meeting with an ex family member, he's given a mysterious pill (NZT, as it's called) that allows its user the brain activity of a super computer. Coming across a secret stash of the drug, Edward uses it to climb a long rope line of international business, placing him in the spotlight, both a good and a bad thing. Good, because it ensures him a huge fortune, celebrity, and his relationship with his girlfriend (Played by Abbie Cornish), but bad because it places him in the sight of criminals who seek to use the drug for their own foul purposes.To say that Limitless is perfect would be untrue, but it never claims to be. For what it is, it succeeds. It establishes a tone, is able to thrill and charm despite a sometimes uneven narrative, and really makes a lot from its ideas. Not everything in the screenplay is fully fleshed out, but the ambition behind the premise helps it rise above that.And as someone who's normally not a big fan of Bradley Cooper, I couldn't imagine him not doing this role. He's able to utilize a distinctive sense of charisma when need be, but also able to tone it down when dealing with stronger moments within the film. He's surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including co-stars Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro, and he blends with them nicely, making the most out of every situation.I also must make note of director Neil Burger's visual style. It kind of struck me like Michael Mann if he'd adopted the visual approach of Terry Gilliam. The editing really puts a lively pace into the film, and the special effects add a clever sense of atmosphere. Special mention has to go out to DP Jo Willems. Aside from the trippy, kinetic zoom-throughs of local environments, he shoots scenes where Edward isn't under the effects of the drug with a dark tint, but films scenes where Edward IS under the effects with a broad, bright color spectrum, adding an effective visual depth to a solid piece of popcorn entertainment......and if that's what you're looking for, then I give Limitless my recommendation with *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Super noisy.,"From start to stop this is the noisiest film. Occasionally there are a few known pieces of music from classical masters. Yet, for the most part, it is obscure pieces of music overwhelming the dialog. And what is with the inappropriate rap? Occasionally there is a spot where they still play jingles or extremely loud sounds of glass breaking or footstep noises.If you can get over the noisy background, the premise is pretty good. I would not want to presume to tell the producers how to improve this film, but it is too much like those soundbite documentaries where they do not complete a thought before moving on to the next thought.The basic story is Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) a going nowhere would-be writer who stumbles into a situation where he obtains a substance that allows him to utilize parts of his brain that were previously unreachable. Now we are off and running. Where is the substance coming from and are there any side effects?

The only suspense is the vain hope that the movie will get better. It never does.I love good stories and great films and quality acting. This film contains none of those elements.

Bradley Cooper is great, bringing his natural style into a half-failed author that goes through many stages of transformation after finding a way to unlock the full mental capacity of the brain.Add to that De Niro as a tough businessman and a career opportunity for the protagonist, and a scary, somewhat over-the-top Andrew Howard as the bad guy. The result is an excellent mix of clever dialogue and ""smart"" action thanks to the newfound limitless brain capacity. But the best thing is the way you'll get into the movie, if you allow yourself that. It's almost like you get a sense of ""this is doable!"" and afterwards you'll probably feel like taking a memory course and start organizing your life!What I also like is the main characters upcoming sense of a higher purpose. Life and potential should not be wasted, seems to be the message that director Neil Burger wants to send us.Let's not forget the soundtrack! The OST is perfect, with Ash Grunwald's ""Walking"" and The Black Keys ""Howlin' for you"" as highlights.

Great Story Line,Great story line and overall acting. Appreciated the visuals this movie incorporated without doing too much. One of my favorite movies. I specifically enjoyed the colorless to colorful transitions the director incorporated. The idea of this movie created more life in the mind of the viewer for endless possibilities. Light humor provided some smooth scene transitions. The movie creates an image in the mind of the viewer that definitely lasts. Watching this you never become lost in the storyline and the plot is very understandable so it allows for great flowing. The actors do great jobs of portraying their roles and even the extras seem involved in each scene they are incorporated into. I give it a 8/10 because its doesn't seem to be a timeless movie.

Inconsistent but very fun,"I went into this film expecting nothing. After watching ""I am Number Four"" I really expected the worst. I was pleasantly surprised. It has flaws, but it's a very fun ride. It's implausible, but it makes you think. I chose this movie because De Niro was in it, and I thought, ""If De Niro did it, it can't be all bad."" Brad Cooper plays a desperate slacker who's about to crash and burn. Then a drug dealer acquaintance offers him an untested drug that will help him. The movie is a little long, but Cooper's character runs through a maze of women, addiction, loan sharks, and various scenarios with charisma before climaxing into a violent confrontation with the loan shark, who wants more of the drug, and De Niro. It's a great roller coaster, and De Niro's big shot Donald Trumplike character makes it top notch. There are some scenes where you're wondering how things tie in, and there's the standard jab at the sleazy lawyer, but in the end you just don't mind. This one is worth the ten spot.

"A very good thriller, ruined by the ending","Limitless is somehow similar to two other movies i watched: Deja Vu and The Adjustment Bureau. All of these movies are pretty good, but they are ruined by a quick, non-explain, Hollywood-y, happy ending. (If you watched any of these movies, you know what i am talking about.) If you haven't watched any of these movies i can tell you that Limitless is a pretty good thriller that makes you feel thrilled, what a thriller should do. Using the urban legend of humans not using 100% of their brain and a pill that can do so, the story is pretty good, but as again, the ending isn't so.

"""Limitless"" takes such a great idea for a motion picture and does not do a single interesting, thought-provocative, or exciting thing with it","If Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"" is anything at all like ""Limitless,"" the feature-length movie directed by Neil Burger that was adapted from it, then I can hardly fathom why anybody thought it was worth making into a motion picture. And if they were going to adapt it, the filmmakers should have developed the courage to rework and rethink the material and turn it into the sort of story that it should have been.The excitement before seeing ""Limitless"" only enhanced my disappointment in it. It's such a great idea for a movie! What would it be really like if a human being could access the full potential of their brain's capacity? Scholars have debated for years, but the general consensus is that even the smartest of people can only utilize somewhere between 10-20% of their mental power. So, according to ""Limitless"" and the screenplay written by Leslie Dixon, what would happen if some bum novelist (Bradley Cooper) got a hold of some pills that allowed him to use all of his mind at the same time? Who can say, but what the movie demonstrates is the most subliminal and uninteresting details. When he takes the pill, Mr. Cooper's vision turns into a yellowish glow, he smiles a whole lot more often, speaks a lot of mumbo jumbo, slicks back his hair, has sex with the landlord's wife, writes a novel in a few days, contends with a loanshark who later gets hungry for the pills, and goes to Wall Street.How anticlimactic.At a certain point, things almost start to look up for ""Limitless"" in what later turns out to be one of the lamest plot twists in recent movie history. For a second, we're lead to believe that slicked-up Mr. Cooper might have gotten involved in some kind of a murder scheme.Well, that plot never goes any further than anything else in the movie. In other words, nowhere at all.Limply directed by Mr. Burger, ""Limitless"" is full of nonsensical gibberish, cheap visual gimmicks, and a couple of hamhanded action scenes between Mr. Cooper and the loanshark, who is stereotypically portrayed by Welsh actor Andrew Howard. The cast shows some talent, including Robert De Niro who looks tired and bored throughout the picture, but there is no energy in ""Limitless."" It takes such an incredibly interesting premise with so many open doors (so many that frankly, to make a movie this dull out of it regardless of budget restraints is inexcusable) and yet it does not do a single interesting, thought-provoking, or exciting thing at all with it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Coneversely the good looking Abbie Cornish, playing his girlfriend, doesn't get to to put across visible emotions as his fiancé does. Robert De Niro is cast as the great old Wall Street moguls, different form the criminal type he played other times but he certainly gets to prove believable. On the whole LIMITLESS, which never sermonizes on drugs and the morality of drug created intelligence, is a fresh and well-written thriller.

Limitless thrill! Limitless fun!,"Based on the novel ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn, Limitless is an American thriller film about an aspiring author Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper) whose life changes in a couple of minutes when an old friend introduces him to NZT, a new pharmaceutical drug which allows him to access full potential of his brain. Everything Eddie has heard, read or seen suddenly becomes available and organized to him, making him the smartest and most active person in the world. Soon, he rises to the top of the financial world and draws the attention of the business tycoon Carl Van loon, who sees him as a tool to make billions, and invites him to help broker the biggest merger in the corporate history. After consuming NZT for some time, he begins to realize the hazards and what it has done to other consumers. Addicted to NZT, he finds himself trapped among mysterious strangers, a vicious gangster and an intense police investigation.The story revolves around how he fights them to keep his dwindling stash of NZT whose intake has now become necessary for his survival.The ending of the movie was very smooth leaving no open threads. Neil Burger(Director) has used various visual effects and camera angles to illustrate the effects of this powerful drug, the most interesting of which was fractal zoom used multiple times in the movie. Cooper very gracefully played the roles of both the super-active and the lazy, thus adding life to the character of Eddie. The plot of the movie unfolded respecting the temporal sequence of events. The movie is shot in a modern set-up. The composition was very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superb surprise,"This film was a fantastic surprise. I watched it without knowing anything about it and it was spectacular. It was visually astounding and the plot was superb.Reminding me slightly of Trainspotting, the film follows Eddie Morra, a down on his luck man suffering from major writers block. He bumps into his ex-wife's brother, who offers him a drug which changes his world forever. It begins with a scene from the middle of the film, whereby Eddie is standing on the edge of a building with people trying to hammer down the door behind him. It's a brilliant technique as it makes you wonder what has happened to him to build up to this point. The film just continues to get better and better.The soundtrack and score were so well tuned (pun intended) to the film and the colours and the production of the film were outstanding and the camera shots were used to their maximum potential. The most dazzling were the shots that zoomed through the city, first used in the opening sequence and then again to show the progression of Eddie's drug-fuelled day and how the world would seem to him. The acting talent was brilliant and Bradley Cooper was never an actor that I thought highly of, he was always just an 'ok' actor. This film showed his maximum potential and he portrayed Eddie spot-on. Robert De Niro was on form and special mention must go to Johnny Whitworth, who was fantastic. There are some obvious plot flaws, such as Eddie not being searched by the police after he has raided Vernon's flat for his drugs, however this did not undo the film at all for me; I really didn't want it to end.All in all a great (if unexpected) watch perfect for those times when you can't quite decide what it is you want to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Brilliant!,In my opinion limitless is a fast paced edge of your seat action thriller that leaves you wanting more and more. The concept of a drug that would let you use 100% of your mind compared to the average humans 20% is intriguing and exciting. I have never seen anything quite like it this film takes you on a ride limitless is so fast paced you won't even find time to blink. The film has good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The tension was the same of as any good action move but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. You could guess what was going to happen next it could have been anything that's why you don't want to take your eyes of the screen because one minute Eddie is hanging around with Russian drug dealers and the next is a million in his hi-tech apartment.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not limitless with mediocrity!,"I give you fair warning before you continue reading; I just took a verbal pill called UPP (Unlimited Pun Power) which can enhance pun memory to 100 percent, instead of the mere 20 percent we punners use. So there will be no pun limit in this review! Before you stray away, I must state that I am joking. I included that ""pillacious"" entry because that is the main premise of the flick ""Limitless"". It stars Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morra, a down-on-his-luck struggling writer who runs into his ex- brother law who introduces Eddie to a limitless memory pill that is able to use 100 percent of brain power. Morra, Morra, Morra how do you like it? How do you like it? Even though that sounded more like an Andrea True Connection, the real connection that Eddie has with the drug is precisely to want more of it. The top-secret pill, called NZT, is Eddie's meal ticket to break into the brokerage business and rise to the top; which is what precisely happens. I will not divulge any more info on where the NZT leads Eddie to, but I will say that situations get incredibly zany when a Russian mobster also gets his hands on the pill among other messy situations; so zany in fact that the movie starts losing its semi-validity because of it. And that is where Director Neil Burger got a bit fried in cooking up ""Limitless""; however, Burger was king in a few scenes in helming the movie, especially the scenes in displaying the power of NZT in Eddie. As far as the ""Limitless"" scribe goes, unfortunately I do have to prescribe a dose of authenticity to Leslie Dixon's cluttered screenplay. Bradley Cooper shows he can carry a movie as best as he can with his strong leading performance as Eddie Morra; and it was fortunate that Bradley did not overdose with ""over- the-top"" thespian antics in his work in ""Limitless"". Robert DeNiro's supporting work as a CEO executive who recruits Morra for a merger was a bit bland and needed a few uppers. But who am I to criticize the great Robert DeNiro! And Abbie Cornish was very much underutilized as Morra's on-and-off girlfriend Lindy. So yea, my critical bag is mixed when it comes to my ""Limitless"" reactions. But if you can stand the few highs and several lows of this movie, then I think you might be ready to pop in ""Limitless"" to your system. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie with versatile diversity.,"LIMITLESS I really like limitless the movie because its about action and drama. The movie talk's about Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a disheveled unemployed writer. He has a contract to write a book but is more talk than action. No matter how hard he tries, He just can't summon the inspiration to write a single word. That all changes when an old friend wanders back into Eddie life and give him a mysterious pill that enables the user to access 100 percent of his brain abilities. With the help of the mysterious pill Eddie becomes a financial wizard but it also puts him in a new world with lots of dangers.Limitless is an American thriller film directed by Neil Burger and starring Bradley cooper, Abbie Cornish, and Robert de Niro. The lead actor Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" Robert de niro has also performed incredibly giving the movie a new dimension. Abbie Cornish also performed well by adding a romantic aspect to the movie.Eddie (Bradley Cooper)'s attempts to write a novel and his inability to push himself to seek refinement is evident with his apartment, his relationship with his otherwise focused girlfriend and his dependent finances. At such a juncture, he stumbles upon his ex- brother-in-law who introduces an experimental designer drug that enhances brain functionality to harness all its potential. As his landlord's wife who yaks at him for the pending rent then confronts him, Eddie chooses an intelligent escape by taking one of the pills and then, whatever he has seen, heard, read or experienced in his life, is available to him as reference. Knowledge acquisition is rapid and so is its retention. Eddie soon discovers that he can achieve the impossible like Bruce Almighty and as greed takes over, he seeks to exploit the financial markets to make some astronomical gains. Overnight success draws inquisitive eyes of the ambitious and Eddie would need to maintain a low profile if he doesn't want to expose his secret to his phenomenal analytical abilities. Veteran investor Carl Loon (Robert De Niro) employs Eddie and gives him the incredible opportunity to make it to the big league in a very short time. Just when it all seems to be going his way, Eddie realizes that the pills have an adverse effect on his health and without a regular intake; he would almost lose his life. To add to that, he is pursued by a goon who now knows the secret to his supreme abilities and demands more pills for himself.I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi f A pill can make you smart is indeed an interesting concept but what is more interesting is the directing. It's not an ordinary thriller movie. The director gave a lot of style in this movie to make it more exciting. It definitely works and the movie is limitlessly entertaining. There are some plot holes that the filmmakers doesn't intend to fix it but still it's worth watching.In short, The movie is of course about an intellectual pill. It's intriguing to know what's the side effects of it. Well, it's quite fun to know what's going to happened to the protagonist but the movie's smartness isn't very limitless. There are massive plot holes in here. There are also some confusion in this. If there is something limitless in here then it's the entertainment quality. Neil Burger gave a lot of style and ridiculousness in this film. The editing was quite fast and fun. The zooming in through places is amazing. The soundtrack and the music score does perfectly fit in every scene. The performances were good. Bradley Cooper is an entertaining actor but he had some weaknesses in serious scenes like crying or being scared. Robert De Niro only shows up in times but you know him, he is just being himself and there is nothing wrong with that. Overall the movie is ridiculously fun. The movie is no cliché, it's all unique by so many reasons including the trippy, vertigo, and zooming in style. It's intriguing, it's fast, and it's smart at times. ""Limitless"" is another movie that has merits that ignore the flaws. It's just a non-stop entertaining solid flick.ilms.If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend it for kids from above 15 years old. Form my point of view this is a exciting and inspirational movie ever directed and made. This is the great thriller movie.

"Crystal Clear, Except when it's not","Greetings again from the darkness. First, I absolutely love this premise. The idea that, by taking a pill, we can simultaneously access all parts of our brain and process information at hyper-speed is fascinating, and a terrific idea for a movie. As it turns out, that terrific premise loses much luster when the center of action is a egomaniacal, smirking doofus played by a strutting Bradley Cooper.The set-up portion of the film is fairly interesting. Cooper plays a stone-walled loser of a writer whose career-minded girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) wisely dumps him as he offers up very little in self-defense. A seemingly random street meet of his ex-brother in law leads Cooper to a whole new world brought on by the magic of NZT. He quickly realizes he can recall every detail he has ever seen or read and he process information quickly and clearly. He finishes his book and learns multiple languages, plays the piano, etc etc.The film takes a wrong turn when he realizes his ability comes in handy in the stock market, as well as blackjack. But obviously if you were in this situation, the first thing you would do is contact a Russian loan shark and take out a giant loan ... and then forget to pay it back. What? You wouldn't? Well then, don't expect to have a movie made about your life.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) brings a wonderful visual touch to Cooper's mind and an awesome telescoping zoom rush through the streets of NYC. That was actually my favorite part of the film.The film misses quite a few opportunities to be as smart as Cooper's character is supposed to be. Either the Russian loan shark or the ultra-rich businessman played by Robert DeNiro could have led to Faustian themes that would have provided endless opportunities. Instead, we don't even get a real battle of wits between the parties. Quite a disappointment.Overall, the film is entertaining enough, but a letdown over what should have been. Watching Cooper strut and DeNiro sleepwalk are not enough for me as a movie goer.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

what if you found a drug that allowed you to use 100% of your brain?,"It seems there are fewer watchable movies made every year, and the good ones usually don't get much hype. I had to stumble over 'Limitless' on the internet and didn't know it existed until a few months ago. The premise instantly intrigued me, but I was leery of a serious film starring Bradley Cooper, someone I had only seen in a few comedies (Wedding crashers, The hangover). It only took a couple minutes of watching to realize he was going to be fine, in fact he was very good in the role that required him switching from 'on' to 'off' the drug. Limitless is an exhilarating thrill ride of a movie that has everything the modern (or classic)movie viewer could want; a fascinating premise, outstanding visuals and cinematography, solid acting and plenty of action. This is great entertainment, and though you might not want to think too much about the plot, it doesn't matter because you won't have time anyway because it moves too fast.Eddie Morra (Cooper) is burned-out writer, a slob and a loser, who just got dumped by his girl when he runs into an old acquaintance who claims to be working in the pharmaceutical industry (though he is a former drug dealer) and has an experimental drug that Eddie ends up sampling. Eddie finds that while on the drug he can remember everything he has ever seen or read and immediately he start finding ways to profit from it as it seems he not only has amazing abilities of recall, he also has super-human energy. His whole personality is transformed and he begins making powerful new friends and uses his skill for huge gains on the financial markets to the point it draws the attention of market kingpin Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro)and soon Eddie is Van Loon's secret weapon in a massive upcoming merger...but things start getting twisted.Director Neil Burger does a tremendous job with all the interconnected story threads, and there are many: Eddie has only a limited amount of the drug and keeping himself 'on' is paramount, there are side-effects that may be fatal, there are other people using the drug and they will literally kill to supply themselves, the drug can cause blackouts and Eddie may have committed heinous crimes he doesn't remember, Eddie's new personality draws his old girlfriend back to him and she too ends up caught up in this web. Through all this Eddie also has too produce results for Van Loon and keep himself supplied with the drug.The rest you have to watch for yourself as there is so much going on in this film and it absolutely flies by, as I said, don't think about it too much -it's just a movie, and the ending seems a little tacked-on, but you can supply the deeper meaning and morals yourself, but give it a try...I don't recommend many contemporary films, but 'Limitless' is so absorbing and wildly entertaining I feel I can't hardly miss by saying CATCH THIS ONE! -and like me maybe your only problem will be how this gem slipped through the cracks with so little publicity...while films like 'Django Unchained' receive unwarranted Oscar attention, all 'Limitless' does is entertain!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bradley Cooper is a capable front-man.,"Limitless is Bradley Cooper's first crack at a leading role. He pulls it off as a head strong, cocky man, on the upward slope after coming in to contact with a drug that releases 100% of his brain's ability. The drug is the captivating yet corrupt attraction, with Cooper's freshly obtained confidence and comatose knowledge being something we'd love to experience. Blah's (Cooper) rapid ascent has its setbacks though. Juggling a relationship with unchecked intelligence, a crazed Russian on his case and a stock exchange job under Robert De Niro threatens to engulf a simple plot. Instead, director Neil Burger manages to unravel it neatly by soundly crossing them over. The script is direct, aided by Cooper's voice-over and the plot's enhanced by firm acting. Unlocking the brain's full power could take us to places unimaginable. Thankfully a realistic approach is taken to avoid doubt amongst its viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

good!,"Limitless, was released in 2011, directed by Neil Burger and starring Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro. It has a fast paced story and action scenes which gives us an electrifying feeling. In addition, it has a solid story line which supports the fast pacing of the film in a logical way.The movie starts in an old, messy room which is in the poor area of China Town in New York, where one poor looking man, Eddie, played by Bradley Cooper, is writing a novel but it seems to be going badly. While he is out grocery shopping, he runs into his ex-wife's brother Vernon who gives him some pills which he thinks are just drugs. But after taking a pill he finds that the pills improve his cognitive functions and rapidly speed up his ability to write. With the effect of the pills in place he finishes writing the novel in a single day. As he had been a poor, unknown writer for a long time, he becomes addicted to the pills and the improvements they bring. However, he finds that cannot afford more of them. In order to steal more pills, he uses his existing stock to increase his ability and carry out a daring plan.A major feature of the film is the way in which it connects us with the protagonist and his plight, as we have all at one time or another metaphorically been that writer stuck and unable to progress. The camera work of the film uses a style similar to that of hand camera home films where it keeps wobbling around, like in a documentary. This is complimented by the story's intense pacing, and is shown with lots of scenes passing rapidly to coincide with Eddie's thought processes. This keeps us on the edge of our seats all through the movie. Despite the large amount of information being shown, the film expresses it clearly through Eddie's narration and special effects. So, even though it's not a racing movie or a violent thriller movie, we feel a sense of speed.It's an uncommon tale that is unlikely to take place around us, yet still it draws us into the story with its strong, fascinating and intelligent story devices. If you are sick of your daily routine, this movie is guaranteed to give you the perfect electrifying experience in 100 minutes.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Review: Limitless,"What if one little pill could change your life by bringing about wealth, power, and all else you've ever wanted? What would you give up for this miracle? Money? Family? Control? An idea has been around for ages that we only use 10% of our brains while the other 90% stores old reruns of That 70s Show. Much has been fantasized about what one could achieve if they could only tap into this unknown potential from incontestable intelligence to psychic abilities to Heroes-esque super powers. While this myth has been widely debunked, Limitless (based off of the novel The Dark Fields) embraces this fantasy in a very grounded way. Supposing that a street drug can light up one's remaining synapses, a user can access all they've ever read, heard, and experienced for a few hours like an overpowered Adderall Eddie (Bradley Cooper of The Hangover, Alias) is a grungy writer who can't write, pay the rent, or get his life in order. Then the night before he is due to turn in his first draft of his still mere idea of a novel, he runs into his sketchy ex-brother-in-law-drug-dealer-other-dashes who offers him a taste of a brain enhancing designer drug. Suddenly, Eddie finishes his draft, gets a haircut, and turns life around with such fluidity that even he still can't comprehend what just happened in the past 8 hours. Needless to say, he needs more. More leads to wealth as he plays the stock market and leads to fame as his book is unbelievably brilliant and confidence as this corner dweller now has the intellect and brawn to own the room. But there are consequences from taking and withdrawing from this drug leaving him addled with blackouts, headaches, and maybe an STD. Throw in some baddies and a corporate monolith run by Robert De Niro seeking Eddie's financial ""scheme"", well, then, things suddenly take a turn for the worst.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) takes us through this stream of consciousness in a style similar to David Fincher crossed with Tony Scott; capturing Eddie's fluid perception of handling complex situations with unnatural ease. A hit or miss for most audiences will be the narration throughout the film, though. While apropos with the protagonist being a writer suffering from clairvoyance, the omniscient first person is hard to accept.It would also be interesting to see the alternate endings supposedly filmed as the one chosen has ""test screening audience vote"" written all over it.Limitless is an interesting take on an old idea that feeds on ""what ifs"". This thriller may have not possessed the substance it aimed for, but it's still an entertaining 100 mins of substance-abuse.3 Handsome Smirks out of 5www.MovieFloss.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Limitlessly possible?,"Bradley Cooper really surprised me in this movie. He plays a character that is different than his mainstream role of the good looking, but funny guy. He convinced me that he had brains, which are usually missing from a great deal of his other roles. Good job, Mr. Cooper.This movie's plot is pretty intriguing, and its possibility really excites the audience. But the plot has so many holes, that it does not take a genius to offer alternate ways to respond to the various crisis in the movie. The visual effects and color alterations effectively take the audience into ""an alternate state of mind"", which really adds to the plot of the movie. Over all, this movie is worth watching because it is visually and intellectually enjoyable. However, the plot and writing could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Both entertaining and deep,"Fantastic stories may be created for amusement (and now most of them are) but some of them do bear certain ideas apart form being a kind of entertainment. For example ""Surrogates"" is an excellent science fiction thriller and at the same time provides us with some IMHO very worthy thoughts and conclusions. The same can be said about ""Gattaca"" which is highly up-to-date though it was produced in 1997.Limitless (at first) seems to be an entertainment movie only but the final scenes go far beyond the scale of the previous events and turn the story into something more. Into something which can prove Limitless.A young man called Eddie Morra is (pretends to be) a writer. Naturally he has some book project in his head, naturally the project is one of genius, and he needs a mere trifle: some inspiration to put it down on paper. Every day he says to himself he is just having a little relax, and tomorrow (next Monday at the latest) he will write a masterpiece.

"A thrilling ride with a slight crash, but well executed","If humans can only access 20 percent of their brains normally and 100 percent while on NZT, the ""Limitless"" drug of choice, then I would say screenwriter Leslie Dixon and director Neil Burger probably access somewhere around 70 percent of their creative power with regards to bringing Alan Glynn's novel to the big screen. All far-fetched concept stories have their side effects, but the true winners avoid the crash. ""Limitless"" takes its audience on a thrill ride through the realm of possibility and gleefully entertains, but some sobering second-act elements kill off a bit of the joy.Bradley Cooper ascends to full-fledged leading man status as Eddie Morra, a disheveled writer stuck in a rut who receives a little round miracle from an old acquaintance. This pill multiplies brain function exponentially, increasing his capacity for knowledge and the speed with which he acquires it. He can learn entire languages within hours, problem-solve instantaneously, recall long-discarded insignificant details from his memory and even finishes his book in the first night. But as we all learned in D.A.R.E., all drug use has its consequences.Eddie's consequent meteoric rise to wealth, prestige and even fame is a fun time. He even scores his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) back. Although the degree to which he outsmarts and impresses everyone is a total joke from a believability perspective, between Burger, Dixon and Cooper, we get a hard sell. The script paces well and uses narration effectively to help us enter Eddie's head and Burger employs a great deal of visual techniques — even if excessive at times — to mimic the effects of the drug, not unlike Darren Aronofsky's work on ""Requiem for a Dream,"" just less stomach-churning.Burger and cinematographer Jo Willems change exposure levels, color brightness and countless other techniques to create a distinction between when Eddie is on versus off NZT so that we feel that transition with him to an extent. Cooper as an actor fully captures that for us as well. I suppose if there's anything he learned to do well from ""The Hangover,"" it was act convincingly hung over or experiencing withdrawal.Truthfully, Cooper's the show here. Although they have scenes of influence, Cornish and Robert De Niro (as a business bigwig who employs Eddie to orchestrate a merger) have little bearing on the story. At one point it seem Cornish's Lindy will emerge as a prominent character, but this surprisingly subsides.Muddling matters more are the varying forces of antagonism in the film: a lender who gets hooked on the drug who keeps coming after Eddie, a man following him and of course the nasty side effects of the drug that Eddie soon uncovers. Things are not as intricately connected as we're inclined to believe, which is mostly what derails the film in the end. The other factor would be a total lack of a realistic message, or any message for that matter.Serving as executive producer, Cooper shows a flare for the business here. He's put the right pieces in place to make a fun concept movie work in addition to finding a leading role that fits his abilities. The film's better-than-expected box-office business also suggests he's growing quite popular.

Hyper-Kinetic Thriller That's Intriguing But Has A Flawed Logic,Author Eddie Morra is suffering writer's block . Meeting drug dealer Vernon Gant he tries out a new synthetic drug NZT which increases Eddie's mental powers . Wanting another supply of NZT Eddie turns up at Vernon's flat and finds him deadDirector Neil Burger knows how to grab an audience and pull them in to a movie . LIMITLESS has one of the most hypnotic in your face mindbending openings I've seen in a film for a very long time . The editing by Tracy Adams and Naomi Geraghty along with the cinematography by Jo Williems and most effectively the grunge cum techno hypno beat all conspire to make the audience think they'll be watching a truly unforgettable film . Manipulative visual film making ? Possible . Owes a lot to Danny Boyle and David Fincher ? Certainly . Will the film be able to sustain these great early sequences ? Well we are talking Hollywood movies here aren't we ?From a continuity point of view LIMITLESS is slightly guilty of if not cheating then certainly being guilty of being vague as to the power of NZT . Supposedly it increases IQ to unimaginable potential where Eddie effectively knows everything . This is nonsensical to say the least . IQ merely means you posses a high level of intelligence which can be tested by standardised tests . Certainly someone with a very high IQ would be good at things such as science but that's entirely different from possessing knowledge but as the story progresses Eddie seems to continually know everything . Intelligence is different from intellect which is something screenwriter Leslie Dixon seems to have euphemistically mixed upNone of this really matters in the first half because as I've said the language of cinema on a visual level is done so very well and it's easy to forgive any minor flaws if it's to set up a great story . I did mention Danny Boyle and the most vocal problem with a Boyle film is that the second half can't sustain the momentum of the first half and we see the same problem with Neil Burger . The rather mundane plot then focuses on some mobsters wanting to get their hands on NZT from Eddie and they won't stop at anything . As everyone has complained about this certainly a film of two halves and I agree,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could've been a lot better with this premise!,"I liked the idea of a drug that makes your entire brain work. Though, i'd rather make it just a tiny part because with all, if we'd use all of our brain, we could probably move buildings and stuff... Or so they say.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I think it would've been way better if the entire thing was taken more seriously. I mean, the guy makes more mistakes than any regular guy probably would. And he's doing it while he's on this drug. For instance, this is just a tiny ---------------SPOILER---------------, don't you think that a guy as smart as he is when he's on that drug would make sure that the door of his sanctuary, where he wants no one to be able to break in, are made of steel?! There is also the part where he drives very fast and risky which i highly doubt a guy this smart would do, and so on........ This movie should have never been an action movie. This was supposed to be some crazy, super intelligent film written by Charlie Kaufman or someone such. Than it would be great i think. I mean, i never read the novel so i don't know if the movie is much different, but if it's not, even though it's highly entertaining, that would mean that the plot is really waisted.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Bradley Cooper was all right, i guess. I just couldn't escape the impression that he was uninterested. As weird and stupid as that might sound, that was just the impression i had. An Robert De Niro was... Well, what to say?

Such a Great Movie,"Limitless is by far one of my favorite movies just because of how intense the film is. You are always wondering what will happen next and what will happen with Eddie Morra and his adventure with this pill. This pill that Morra takes let's him use the other 80% of our brain that we supposedly never get to use. It makes you extremely intelligent to the point where you can do anything. I love adventure and action so this movie suits me. It was really interesting how they brought science into the film with the pill and how to find a way where all people could use it. The only down part to this movie would be that this pill is very unrealistic and is almost impossible to be done. The acting was phenomenal to say the least. I felt like I was in the movie trying to find out how people could live off the pill. Some people say that the movie is too unrealistic because if someone's IQ shot up that high, they could get sick or die. To me, it is a movie, not real life, and it was great.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cooper has no Limit,"Limitless, directed by Neil Burger (The Illusionist) and adapted from a novel by Alan Glyn, is a story of a 30 something failed writer played by the annoyingly handsome Bradley Cooper (A-Team). Going nowhere fast with his life, dumped by his longtime girlfriend, happens to bump into an old friend who introduces him to a drug that can unlock the brains full potential. Unfortunately for our hero all this power comes with a price, without the drug you are back worse than where you were when you started. Tracked by a group of killers Cooper's character must find out more of this drugs shadowy origin.We start with Cooper on a sky scraper (I have a theme here). He is about to jump off. End it all, and in true Hollywood fashion we are then thrown back to where it all began.If I was to sum the movie up in a comparison, it is like Crank meets Wall Street meets the smack my b**ch up video (Prodigy). It was very silly in parts which I quite enjoy in films. We can't always see things that make us ponder the essence of our existence. One scene where desperate for the drug Cooper sucks up the blood of a dead villain just made me groan with despair. In fact the final twenty minutes were pointless and didn't really need to be in the final cut.Bradley Cooper I generally like but some of his natural charm he showed in The Hangover and A Team didn't seem to be apparent here. Robert De Niro's role in this movie almost felt like a cameo, apart from one good classic De Niro monologue he didn't have a great impact on the show. The directors use an infinite zoom type shot which was very clever, I haven't seen that done very much before and did give a sense of despair when Coopers character is starting to lose time on the drug. Unfortunately this clever shot is used far too often and ended up making me feel sick and have to turn away from the screen.All in all Limitless is fun. Nothing special, but fun. A nice concept that makes you wonder how many high fliers are using such an enhancement to achieve almost non human goals. It is never going to win an Oscar, but hey, who cares fun is good sometimes!!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ending really let's it down,"I have very conflicting views on this film. Up until the end I had the film sitting at a 8/10, it had good action scenes and really had me on the edge of my seat. But I just don't see the point in the ending, there was so many different, more interesting ways it could have gone and it went for a really lazy, uninteresting one which lets it down so much.
I went into this with the idea that this is going to be a massive thinker, something that is going to make me really question everything and that's not the case at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I expected more from this film.
The love interest played a real back seat in the film and in all honesty it could have done without, because when it circled back to her or them as a couple I didn't care at all.Positives: acting was great, plot had me hooked in for the majority of the film and cinematography and editing was also great.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is a movie you see and inspires you to be somewhat of a better person. I'm not advising people to do drugs by any means.

Top Notch Entertainment,"Limitless is an Action/Thriller film Directed by Neil Burger (same guy that brought us The illusionist, 2006). This film is about a writer who discovers a top-secret drug which gives him super human abilities. Its Starring Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel, John Whitworth, Robert John Burke & Tomas Arana.#FACT: This film is based on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn.SLIDER'S REVIEW:Watching the trailer was exciting enough to get me psyched to watch this film. The plot looked fresh & fun plus the feeling of going on a journey with a man with no limits is intriguing. The front man Bradley Cooper has been a knockout in his recent performances like Hangover & A Team so I was not expecting any less.Everything I expected this film is to be is exactly what it was – Top End Entertainment. The moment it started I was engaged till the end. This had a original story feel to it and, it doesn't go too deep that you gets lost in questions like how's this drug even possible. It even tries to makes you believe the story is real. It doesn't even beat around the bush it just goes straight to the good stuff. Our main character Eddie starts off as a writer who then goes into other business areas but the longer he was taking these pills for the bigger his problems became. We go into a world of super intelligence that you won't want to come out of. The longer it went on for the more interesting it became. I for one wouldn't mind a part 2.This film manages to mix in a few genres that kept on surprising. I just didn't know what else they could throw in. The effects used merge into this film perfectly because they found a way to show us what the main character was feeling and how it was happening to him. It didn't get in the way it just looked really cool.From the good guys to the bad ones, everybody acted superbly in their roles. Bradley Cooper does a sensational job as Eddie Morra. His character transforms in a blink of an eye (literally) and he becomes this superhuman that was just awesome to watch. This is a journey of self-discovery that just has to be seen (Makes you imagine what super YOU could be like). I liked Robert De Niro character Carl Van Loon, he played this intimidating straight talking businessman who role was taken seriously. Abbie Cornish stars as Eddies Girlfriend Lindy, she also does a great job on screen. I liked it when her character was backed up against the corner and had only one choice. Anna Friel plays Melissa, her character brought a sense of realness to this storyline. She was an aftermath that we didn't know about and was surprising to see.#FACT: Shia LaBeouf was supposed to star as Eddie Morra but had to give away his role due to a car accident where he injured his arm.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Perhaps the last great cinematic achievement before wokeness destroyed movies.,"After reading some of the ego driven hair splitting reviews here, I had to shine a light on many of the the most pompous and overly picky and meaningless whines regarding a cinematic achievement such as this one. The acting is extraordinary. Go ahead, find one instance of sub-par acting in the film, I'll wait. The cinematography is excellent. Of course, there are no sweeping fake cgi panoramic shots for the mouth breathing imbeciles to drool over. And now let's talk about the dialogue. This was no simple feat of reading lines and going through the motions. Limitless has some of the most complex and well rounded dialogue in movie history. Considering the subject manner, it should! What a tremendous feat of achievement. Just because you want to insert your crappy little indifferences of story opinion doesn't take away from the pure quality at work. If you weren't entertained, then the movie deserves an 8 - for you! For all other intents and purposes, the only suitable ratings left are a 9 or a 10.

A simple Faustian tale,"The premise of the film is simple, what if by taking a magic pill you could increase your brains ability to the extent that you become a genius at whatever you put your mind too?This has been explored in a lot of movies in various different ways and follows the simple German folklore tale of Faust a man who makes a deal with Mephistopheles (the Devil) to gain access to the divine knowledge, once the pact is made his soul is damned for eternity.That is where this film falls down, although the set up is good and the characters and acting interesting it doesn't really explore anything with any real depth. The moral ambiguities of this gift or the repercussions of using it for either personal gain or to the benefit of mankind are never really thought of or considered. They appear as passing thoughts with no reflection or comment.You do get to see different types of people take the drug to explore how different people would use it, but this opportunity is lost really as the contrasts are broadly drawn and quickly stepped over.The central character seems to be rather one dimensional even with his gift and strands to the narrative are simply left open or unresolved.Having said all that, if you shut down your active mind and just look at the beautiful people and don't go looking to deep into the story what passes is a couple of hours of good fun, with some neat camera techniques, amazing visuals and an interesting premise that will get you thinking, if not really exploring the potential of the source material to the full itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Neil Burger explores in depth the theory of using 100% of the brain and dives into a techno-thriller that starts full of potential and gets lost between the line,"Released in 2011, Without Limits was directed by Neil Burger, a director who takes as his direction the script by Leslie Dixon, a text that in turn is inspired by the novel by Alan Glynn, a metalinguistic narrative about Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a New York writer who is at the worst moment of his young life. His partner, Lindy (Abbie Cornish) left him, tired of the failed life project of a man who cannot manage anything that concerns his existence. He has already received an advance, but he needs to finish the book that has a deadline and still doesn't have a single page of story. Between the despair and oppression of his bitter situation, he wanders into bars and walks the streets like an abandoned being, relegated to the likely tragic outcome of his filthy existence, shabby clothes and limited hygiene. His apartment, not to mention, rented and with late payments, a dirty hole that looks like a representation of the sewer that has become his psychological dimension. In short, Eddie is the antithesis of the American way of life.One day, after sitting in front of the computer and thinking about what he would write to deliver to his publisher, Eddie decides to go for a walk and meets Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth), his ex-brother-in-law who is involved in a project that will change his life forever. He offers the outdated Eddie a pill called NZT-48, a synthetic substance in the experimental phase that performs the miracle described in the opening paragraph of this reflection. The drug increases concentration and performance and Eddie awakens to a new moment in his life. He seems to be able to step outside of himself and observe himself in multiple roles, sharpened memories, absurd articulation of ideas in front of others, in a wave of gigantic euphoria, represented by Jo Willems' photography direction, together with Patrizia von Brandenstein's production design, sectors focused on establishing the notable contrast between the character with and without drug use. Everything is very bright, there are long visual effects shots crossing small passages, demonstrating the transformative abilities of the substance in Eddie Morra's body.Like everything that comes easily, dramatically, there is a price to pay. And if we're talking about films, a type of narrative that will obviously present conflicts, Eddie's life will begin to reflect the seemingly two-way ease. Contraindications begin to appear and each time the now successful Eddie finds himself without the pill, the world seems to fall apart. Paul Leonard-Morgan's musical direction becomes heavier, the visual texture becomes greenish like slime again and everything seems to fall apart. It's a path of no return and we follow this entire journey with apprehension. His writing career is abandoned, now focusing on the stock market. The character writes a book later, but before that his focus is on making money. Carl von Loon (Robert De Niro), a powerful millionaire known for his gigantic corporate mergers, gets in touch and establishes a contractual relationship with Eddie, who has now won back his partner and appears to be an exemplary man. From a bankrupt man immersed in a vulgar inert existence, he becomes a kind of superman of the information age. His mutation, however, does not bring anything favorable other than fueling his personal desires. There is no bigger project for Eddie. He just wants to stop being one of the losers.Problems, however, continue to haunt him: the loan shark he takes out a loan for, a murdered socialite, last seen with the young man on meteoric media rise, among other knots that Eddie needs to untie until the end of the narrative. He will need to unify cognition with physical skills to defeat the enemies that begin to be part of his daily path. Without the pills, however, she knows she will not achieve victory in this battle that involves other people interested in the drug, as well as the events of the recent past that cannot be buried so easily, even for those who have a lot of money. Almost endless chases follow the character until the end, complete with a lot of blood and violence, in a narrative that reflects the search of certain human beings to be something far beyond what the notion of humanity allows. In the nootropic culture of Limitless, to be successful in capitalist dynamics, it is necessary to adhere to synthetics to overcome the challenges. Being ""normal"" and acting with natural attributes means losing your place in the queue that doesn't move, rolls over, and to make matters worse, there aren't enough spaces for everyone.Perhaps the film fails a little in driving the plot in its final moments through unbridled action with some common mistakes of the genre and a resolution that is difficult to swallow at a certain point. Still, it's an engaging plot, with beautiful shots in a well-done montage, mainly simulating a sequence shot through the protagonist's mind. The old trick of starting with a key scene going back in history continues to work, involving us in the plot. Just like the voice over, which despite being didactic at times, here works as a complement to reasoning. The performances also help, giving the story even more rhythm, even without being a great actor, Bradley Cooper is likeable and defends his character with strength. The actor avoids comedies and romances that are not very challenging and performs his best individual work to date. Going from a man who is not self-confident, with messy hair and an unshaven beard, to another who is the exact opposite of the previous one, extremely well dressed and with a meticulously sloppy beard, Cooper brings the exact density to the protagonist, adding vitality and humor. Refined that transform Eddie Morra into an extremely unstable man, and therefore believable in our eyes.But he makes no mistake. The film is not looking to give moral lessons, punishing its protagonist for the controversial choice he made. Politically incorrect is the main asset of the screenplay by Leslie Dixon (""Hairspray""), adapted from the book of the same name by Alan Glynn. He introduces us to a world where the smartest always win, whether through ""dirty"" measures or not. Dixon's New York is embedded with loan sharks, drug dealers and undercover maniacs amid a workaholic population. Eddie Morra wants to be like them. But he lacks ambition. Nothing that NZT can't solve. His laziness and lack of inspiration are then replaced by an unusual disposition, as well as an incredible speed of thought. Money arrives and along with it, satisfaction, which in ""Limitless"" has nothing to do with a gift. Morra is not one of those romantic idealists who would give up any amount of money for freedom of thought. But he also doesn't become a psychopath who does everything to support his addiction and maintain his financial and professional status. There is a minimum ethical limit to the protagonist's personality that transforms him into someone uniquely charismatic.The feeling that we can do anything is interesting and at the same time dangerous. As the title of the film says, Eddie completely loses his sense of limits, of right or wrong, of possibilities. He wants more and more and as his girlfriend Lindy warns: ""it's not you anymore."" The drug doesn't just make you smarter. She loses her sense of danger. Forget shyness, fear, fears. Focus on something and think about how to achieve it. It is, therefore, quite understandable that Eddie ends up on the stock exchanges, negotiating with the pope of the financial world: Carl Van Loon, played by Robert De Niro. The game of ethical values and the way the film presents them may be questionable, but we cannot deny that we have a well-made production. The use of numerous off-takes helps us get to know this man better and everything he is going through. The side effects felt demonstrate the script's care in bringing some scientific basis to an insane idea, which in the hands of any other less competent professionals could turn into something deplorable. If the final social criticism also brings a suitable closure to the film, the police plot is fragile and predictable. The protagonist's relationships with his girlfriend Lindy and his new partner Carl Van Lonn are poorly developed, wasting the enormous potential of the cast in question.The production by Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"") explores in depth the theory of using 100% of the brain and dives into a techno-thriller that starts full of potential and gets lost between the lines, the drug that Eddie uses makes him become the best of yourself, becoming unbeatable, but little by little the way in which other users of the drug emerge, makes Eddie's 'powers' trivialized little by little, then the film plays with the side effects and dangers of using this drug unknown, but its potential becomes less and less explored, focusing the plot more on what Eddie does and making us lose the sense of when he is under the influence of the medication and when he is not.Overall, the direction makes the film a pleasant pastime, with quick editing and quick thinking, just like its protagonist. The filmmaker opts for more tortuous and complex paths, full of innovative and surprising plans, but not all of them successful. If in some cases he manages to convey all the mental tension (or complete lack thereof) of the protagonist, in others he exaggerates, using techniques that would be better used in television advertisements. The scene in which Morra finally writes his book at the desk in his apartment, while letters fall from the ceiling and scatter around the room, is in regrettable bad taste, in addition to the initial sequence looking more like the opening of a soap opera. But better the boldness than the lack of it. With all this, ""Limitless"" confirms itself as one of the most pleasant surprises of the year of 2011.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Insanely stupid,"Truly putrid thriller starring the ""sexiest man alive"" Bradley Cooper. The dude can't act worth a crap, but even if he could, he couldn't save the film from such an enormously stupid screenplay. It's about a dunderhead (Cooper) who is given a magic clear pill by his ex-brother-in-law that allows him to use his full brain capacity. The pill makes him so smart that he's able to play the stock market and get rich quick - of course, he's so smart that the way he gets funding to play the stock market is by borrowing from the Russian mafia. Because that's what smart people would do. Later in the film, Cooper's girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, whose career should be going much better than it is - she stars in two of the worst films of the year, this and Sucker Punch) takes the pill and decides to use an eight year old girl with ice skates as a weapon. The thing is, the writers of this film (and the original novel; this was based on a friggin' novel!) are so dumb they don't have any clue how a smart person would think, so they just come up with whatever is in their dumbass heads and put it in the movie.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"LimitlessUntil now, the only magic pill that a writer could take to gain fame and fortune was a sleeping pill...and plenty of 'em.Fortunately, the scribe in this thriller has discovered medication that can augment his intelligence without decreasing his existence.Already suffering writer's block, Eddie's (Bradley Cooper) despair doubles when his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) dumps him.His luck turns, however, when his ex-brother-in-law introduces him to an experimental drug that can boost brain function.Blessed with brilliance, but addled by addiction, Eddie finds himself in bed with a Russian gangster and a Wall Street wizard (Robert DeNiro).With his stash depleting, and withdrawal not an option, Eddie must use his remaining high to mastermind a plan.With a capable cast, sweeping cinematography and stimulating script, Limitless is a slick, cerebral supposition.However, if humans really could use 100% of their brains than reality TV ratings would be in trouble.

Waste of philosophic and scientific potential in this stylish action-thriller,"''Limitless'' is an entertaining science-fiction movie based upon the theory that humans are only using ten percent of their brain and the question what might happen if we were able to access more or all parts of our brain efficiently. Instead of focusing on the scientific and philosophic thoughts behind this concept, ''Limitless'' wastes a lot of potential as it limits itself to being an entertaining action- thriller with a debatable ending and moral.The story focuses on the life of Eddie Morra. In the beginning, he seems to be a naive loser who never gets anything done and gets dumped by his girlfriend. When he starts taking a drug offered to him by a shady acquaintance, his life seems to change for the better as Eddie Morra becomes a popular writer, makes a lot of money on the stock market and becomes friends with a group of careless jet- setters. Soon, his addiction to the drug starts having negative impacts on himself and people around him as he gets tracked down by other addicts, competitors and loan sharks. In addition to this, he starts having blackouts and severe pain at times. He even gets involved in a murder case where he can't remember whether he killed the victim or not because of the drug. As he tries to find out more about the nootropic NZT-48, he realizes that a lot of addicts got sick or died of it either because of overdosing it or because they tried to stop taking it.At this point, the movie could have taken a more thoughtful approach to elaborate on the horrors of drug addiction and its side effects. Instead, we get to see a lot of chasing passages, conspirative manipulations and murder scenes leading to a morally debatable ending that is explained very weakly. Overall, you get an entertaining, fast-paced and well done action-thriller but the story wastes its scientific potential midway through the movie and lacks inspiration in the second half.From that point of view, I like the very similar ''Lucy'' by Luc Besson much better because it keeps asking philosophic and scientific questions and has a thought-provoking ending. People probably preferred ''Limitless'' because it glorifies the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle and because it's easier to understand. In the end, I can recommend ''Limitless'' if you are looking for an entertaining action-thriller with solid actresses and actors and a stylish production. If you are looking for something which is both entertaining and intellectual, I would rather recommend Luc Besson's ''Lucy''.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A great movie up until the last twenty minutes,"Limitless is a kind of movie I like. Deadbeat unmotivated Schlub finds a way to go from rags to riches, in this film thanks to discovery of a pill which makes his brain operate on the highest level, which ofcourse brings its own problems...I love the set-up and idea of the film, Bradley Cooper and Robert Deniro are both great. Although unrealistic (no brain could be that fast at reading, picking up languages etc) it's still enjoyable to see.I really like the concept and most of the execution that much I'd give it a ten if not for the stereotypical Eastern European gangster (couldn't work out if he was comedic relief or not at the start) and also the ending.

Remember what the Dormouse said > Feed your head,"This was inexplicably recommended to me by one of my movie-expert friends, an expert who I think doesn't watch any films older than brand new. If there's a next time I'll make sure I'll tell him my opinion on this one and that The Wizard Of Oz is one of my favourite smart films, he may have heard of that one.Bradley Cooper plays a loser who gets to pop a mind-expanding pill that changes his life; as in one pill makes you larger, one pill makes you small blah. It's all slickly and sickly handled, Cooper begins his rise to wealth and power on the back of a limited amount of the drug, whilst brutal gangsters and other assorted thuggish users are out to nobble him for his stash. It's an engrossing plot for the most part with only a couple of gross-out bits – didn't see the slurpy bit coming with the Russian gangster, but didn't want to either. Cooper puts in his usual sterling performance as the main man and he's in almost every scene. As with all fantasies you're forced to take a number of plot turns for granted and follow the relative outcome algorithms along to the end, either to the end of the film or more likely to the end of the supply of drugs. At least the spice on Frank Herbert's science-fictional Dune set ten thousand years in the future was inexhaustible! But as with all things, the ending comes and with it the only twist possible: however if you're not prescient reference the result of Paul Muad'dib's junkie experience on Dune.

No idea what it was about, what kind of movie it was, hadn't even seen any trailers. Only seen the poster.And now that I have seen it, I am sitting here thinking 'was that really it?' This movie was somewhat disappointing to me. Sure, it had a great enough storyline, but there was way too much nonsense being shown in various shots and moving camera-styles.Despite having a fairly interesting enough plot, there were times when the movie was limping at a slow pace and it was bordering on being unbearable.

Some nice touches in this Sci-Fi/Thriller...,"When I read about the concept behind this film I must say I was quite intrigued; a pill that could allow access to the parts of the brain we don't use? Who could resist? Well it didn't play at my local cinema and so after quite a long wait it finally appeared in the TV listings this week. It had received a bit of a mixed response from the critics but I thought I'd take the plunge anyway. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary.Eddie Morra is a struggling writer; he has a contract to write a book but is struggling to find inspiration and motivation. By chance he meets his ex-wife's brother, Vernon, a former drug dealer; he gives him a pill that changes his life. It's called NZT and it enables him to think faster than ever; he finishes his book in double quick time. When the effects wear off he decides he has to get more. He goes to see Vernon who he finds dead. Searching his apartment he discovers his stash and steals it. Now he can take it every day he soon realises that writing isn't for him; stocks and shares are the future. Having had some meteoric success in the stock market, he is now in the spotlight of the big boys. Enter Carl Van Loon, a very successful businessman who takes Eddie under his wing. As a side note, Eddie at this point also gets his girlfriend, Lindy, back. About to broker a major deal; Eddie discovers a disturbing side-effect of the drug I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Illegal Drugs Division) will have me banged up for possession.A very well made film with some neat CGI and camera work which is used to try and illustrate the effect of the drug on Eddie. I also liked the narration; it gave an insight into his thought processes as events unfolded around him. Decent performances all round; Bradley Cooper did a good job as Eddie Morra, Robert De Niro was great (as ever), although never really stretched as Carl Van Loon and Abbie Cornish was decent, if underused, as Lindy. Andrew Howard did a good job as the Russian moneylender Gennady and there was a nice little part for Anna Friel as Eddie's ex-wife Melissa.Quite a slick production with some nice touches; not all of them worked, but it's still a perfectly watchable Sci-Fi/Thriller. As I've already said, I did enjoy some of the camera trickery used to illustrate the effect of the drug, in particular the tunnel-like pan straight into the screen, which worked particularly well. There were a few aspects of the plot that didn't quite work for me, but over all it's still pretty enjoyable Recommended.My score: 7.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 103,342 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 69/100 (based on 180 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 (based on 84,511 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The price of perfection,"Based on the novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn, Limitless has been gaining glowing reviews from different publications, like Empire, Time Out and Spill.com. But to me it is a film that a win for style over substance.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling writer suffering from writer's block and girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) broke up with him. His ex-brother-in-law Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth) sees him on the streets of Manhattan and offers him special drug, NZT. NZT increases a person's intelligence and makes them use 100% of their brain. Eddie starts taking it, finishing his book in four days and starts playing the stock market, making a massive fortune. He gets to work for a powerful businessman, Carl Von Loon (Robert De Niro) but slowly Eddie becomes more addicted the drug, suffering side-effects like confusion and memory loss and gets in deep with Russian gangsters and running into trouble with business rivals and the police.Neil Burger certainly made a great effort to make what could have been an internal story into a visual experience. One element of his direction that worked was showing before any takes NZT the world is shot with a drab grey filter and afterwards the world is bright, a symbol of the potential a person can fulfil. There are visual tricks like letters raining from the ceiling or seeing numbers ceiling like on a old airport message broad. But some moments are very trippy whether it was a small thing like seeing many hands or showing the passage of time and location using a mirror scene like the White Spites music video for Seven Nation Army. Some of the scenes showing the negative effects of the drugs and the withdrawal symptoms felt like Burger was trying to make a mainstream Requiem for a Dream. Overall there is not much in the actual plot and the film was disengaging. Some events felt like their were skipped over which I sure were possibly were looked at more detail in the novel. Spill.com claimed that Limitless was a lot like Fight Club: but I think it's a long way from matching that film.Cooper's character joked to his two bodyguards never wear the same suit: this is not The Matrix, I certainly agree with that statement. There is also a scene when Cornish is clashed over a ice rink and basically I thought how could anyone do that on shoes without falling over: there is also another plothole that scene took play in around April, when most outdoor ice rinks in New York are only open in the winter.The acting is fine throughout the film: it is good to see that at least Robert De Niro is trying to fine a decent film (compared to Little Fockers). Bradley Cooper was perfectly fine as the lead and he will get more leading roles. But his character was nihilistic, a character who used his new gifts for himself to make money and sleep with woman. It could be argued that would be how a person would really act if they had developed this level of intelligence but it made it hard to make an audience sympathise. Andrew Howard who played the Russian Gangster Gennady looked to me very much like cross between Jason Statham and the computer game character Niko Belic. Sadly many of the female characters just disappeared off the screen.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Living End,"Bradley Cooper's character does not evoke much sympathy in the first act, but that is probably the point, he's a rather tiresome nobody, suddenly transformed by the wonder drug that he acquires from his brother-in-law (isn't it always the way). Neil Burger crafts a pacey, good looking film from Leslie Dixon's screenplay from Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"" stimulating some interesting questions in the viewer, as the best films do. It's an interesting idea, played out with great style and high energy. Cooper's narration is well handled, managing not to annoy, allowing us to concentrate on the action. There are some dizzying visuals that are highly effective, adding to a feeling of freshness. The main characters are all engaging, with good support from Robert de Niro (not stretched), Abbie Cornish, Andrew Howard, and the very watchable Anna Friel. There are perhaps a couple of minor gripes - for one thing, there's a feeling of rampant wish fulfilment about some of the sequences which, even in a fantasy film, seems a bit of a stretch. Also, as any writer knows, blank page syndrome in the very literal way it appears here, is utter nonsense. If you are sitting in front of a blank page in the past clichéd way that Cooper's Eddie Morra does here, you are not a writer, but again, maybe that was the point. This film is well worth seeing, meanwhile, I'm off to the pharmacy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A well made intriguing sci-fi movie,"You get tagged along in the movie and go where the hero goes. That's the movie plot in one line. It is a very pacey movie but the good things you get to ride along, so many things so good in this movie i can't believe i didn't watch this movie long time ago.Bradley Cooper, one word for his acting, WOW. So from the trailer you know, the movie basically spins around him, so no surprises there. He has done a exceptional job in this. From the premise you see him standing at the edge of terrace and looking like a weirdo on the street his characterisation was just perfect. If not for anything you can watch this movie just for him.The other characters in the movie, they come and disappear just like lightning. That's not just a metaphor for sudden appearance, they are so powerful as well. The first guy who introduces the pill, perfect. Robert De Niro, i don't think this guy even knew they were filming it, he was just being himself and so awesome in what he does. The money lending asshole, very cool. Every character is given a thoughtful screen space and they mark their stand in that scene and no traces of them after that.Now that is a positive for the character, but slight negative for the movie. At times i began to wonder should it have to Robert De Niro, would it make a difference if someone else was in that scene? Probably not, he was good, but again in the bigger scheme of things he was just being a douche bag in trying to make Bradley his bitch, so anyone with a grumpy attitude as that could have played and i still would have watched it.I don't want to be nitpick, but for the Bradley cooper the guy he is shown, i just couldn't accept he knows everything from all over. Yes, some facts were OK, but striking a conversation with every human being possible, i just cannot agree. In the beginning you get the weird camera angle which was disturbing enough, but when they bring it again, i felt a bit like getting sucked in and irritated me. Maybe the director wanted a first person camera angle, but that was not a selling point and could have avoided. Also the movie just ended, i mean literally it was just the director had a call from his home and decided to end the movie. It just snapped and the movie closed. For a movie that was being so realistic and detailed as it is, a clichéd ending was not acceptable at all. I was really disappointed and the explanations given by Cooper on the sidewalk was total bullshit. The movie should have ended with Cooper stranded on the terrace and making the audience guess what could have he done, now that would have been awesome. In the end movie actually advocates taking pills to enhance your memory which is not a good message for kids. I know kids are not dumb enough to follow a movie's advice, but still a responsible media platform such a movie shouldn't promote such a messageNevertheless, i was throughly enjoyed towards the entire movie sans the ending and i would believe everyone would have a good time as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As good as the trailers portray,"Love films in this genre, that makes you question reality, what if theory, Bradley Cooper does good job as portraying the main character don't think he quite pulled off as (matt Damon Bourne identity). The movie is fast paced from the start, & keeps you gripped throughout.The only flaw I found was De Neros character, not convinced he was a big business CEO type person but for the time he is in the movie doesn't really matter. Was disappointed with the the quick ending as leaves you wanting more. If you like films like EagleEye, The Net Etc, then this film is definitely for you.

"Visually exhilarating and well acted, yet I felt it missed the mark to make it a really thought-provoking and substantial film.","Visually exhilarating and well acted, yet I felt it missed the mark to make it a really thought-provoking and substantial film. The idea behind Limitless is simple and in itself extremely intriguing. What if there was a pill you could take that would make you capable of anything without feeling any kind of negative emotions like stress or anxiety, would you take it without knowing the full consequences? Pretty cool idea right and one of those questions that could be debated over for hours and Limitless does a decent job with the overall premise but I felt it didn't quite go far enough into the morality and the humanity of taking such a pill and focused instead too much on the entertaining aspects such as paranoia, making tons of money, being witty and charming, etc.Bradley Cooper stars as Eddie Morra, a failure of a writer, recently dumped, and insanely depressed, who surprisingly runs into an old friend who gives him this special pill, NZT, that can access the remaining parts of your brain that lay dormant. This essentially is all you need to know (unfortunately the trailers pretty much tell you most of the film anyway) in order to understand what is going on. He starts to write, succeed with women, make millions, etc. all the while taking the pill, that is until some of his prior bad decisions as well as side effects of the pill start showing up.The direction, done by Neil Bruger (One of his past films is The Illusionist, if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it), is very well done, making Limitless one of the more visually, psychologically compelling films I've seen. He captures the feeling of the pill very well on screen and really excels as a director during a lot of the fast paced sequences. Leslie Dixon wrote the screenplay and deserves a lot of credit because it is mainly a dialogue driven film, however it is probably fair to assume that all of the credit goes to Alan Glynn who wrote the novel which this based on. However, where she faults is with the overall story itself. She at times seems like she can't figure out if she wants to write a film about the drug and what you can do with the drug, or the consequences of taking such a drug and the moral and human issues that come along with it. Dixon does succeed however with her dialogue, which is fast, witty, always entertaining, and who better to deliver than Bradley Cooper.Cooper is excellent as Eddie Morra and if there was any doubt that he could lead a film he's wiped it all away with this. He plays both sides of the character very well, the failure and the successful side and shows that he can not only do the comedy, fast talking, witty character that we all know he can do, but he can also pull off the dramatic side as well. As for DeNiro, he only shows up so that an older audience will go to see it. He plays a pretty important role, but not one that needs the acting chops of someone like Robert DeNiro (however maybe this is just more proof that he's slipping and is losing what he once was). Abbie Cornish also shows up as Eddie Morra's girlfriend throughout the movie, and is one of the character's I wish would have been present more on screen, mainly to help with what I thought was the only fault of the entire film.What Limitless lacks is the debate between what would people do if there was a drug that could help you accomplish your wildest dreams. The idea of a drug being able to do that is never really discussed nor is the idea of addiction, what it means for people around you, all the things that are usually brought up in a drug film. And what a better film to discuss these questions than with a story about a drug that makes you and your ideas, excuse the obvious use of the title but, limitless. What an awesome question of humanity, what if you could be perfect? How much time would you hesitate to try the pill, what would you do to get more, etc? Some of these questions are briefly touched upon and answered but not to the depth that they deserve. Instead the film aims to please the masses, with entertaining yet mentally boring action and dialogue. To make matters slightly worse, the ending doesn't help. Your left with a couple of pretty big questions and it leaves you hanging. However, I did like the ending and always will take a film that ends unconventionally and you wanting more than one that wraps everything up nicely and sends you on your way. It's one of those endings where as soon as the credits role your left discussing what you think happened, which in my book is a success. If you can get people talking about your film, and not just what scene they liked the best, or what song was in it, but a real conversation about the story, that is a huge accomplishment and one I hope to see more film makers try to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A wasted opportunity of a film that doesn't develop the right way,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningScruffy looking out of work writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) takes his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) giving him the boot as the final straw in his life heading down the pan. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, his old brother in law hands him a new designer drug that allegedly has the power to enhance his abilities to their fullest. Regarding it cynically at first, Eddie takes it and finds it to be as true as he was told it was. Living his life to the max, Eddie sees a chance to commercialise on his discovery with Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) a powerful businessman who sees potential. But when the not so lovely side effects kick in, Eddie finds his world thrust into turmoil.Hollywood is a place where original ideas are running increasingly scarce in the recession era, where only re-makes and sequels to age old franchise films appear to be springing up. So it's always encouraging, in one way or another, for a film like Limitless to spring up, with producers taking a gamble on a new idea that could work wonders. So it's all the more upsetting when the result is something so far fetched, confused and implausible, a film that saunters around without much direction and fails to develop into a film as a whole. It's slick and glossy enough, and the zooming camera moments would give a ride at Alton Towers a run for it's money. But there's really not much more to it than this, with give or take lead performances from Cooper and De Niro, who takes an eternity to make his presence in the film but still fails to give it any extra weight or gravitas, and an enhanced sense that it's on to something special when really it's anything but. **",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Philosophy on Screen,"This is one of those great movies, like Groundhog Day, that thoroughly exhausts its concept from every conceivable angle. Most films are a bait and switch. They put it up to get you in the seat and then they're suddenly focusing on the dude's dad in the hospital or something. What captures me is how we can experience philosophy on screen vs being told about it. The idea that there is another you, that can achieve all those impossible things you want to do, and that it is attainable, creates an active viewing experience impossible to not go into deep rabbit holes of self-reflection. By virtue of free will, that you can be you, right now. It's as if the comic book hero is literally we the audience. It is never telling you what it's about, even with a voiceover directly telling you, the film is still forcing you to experience the agony of him achieving godhood, while we are still us. Because let's face it. This is the appeal of the psychopath, and why they are so desirable for people to aspire to, is being inhuman in a human world gives them a great advantage. All the pill does is turn people into psychopaths. It removes all inhibition and turns them into the capitalist machines that find their angles to ascend. This is why it's just money, sex, and power; until people are trying to kill and backstab him, and... the pill bails them out. The ONE achilles heel of the psychopath, is the lack of foresight collapsing their whole empires-- the pill is the psychopath that worked out all its kinks. Most fascinating is that of the girl he was with before all this, being this precious gemstone he must hold onto at all costs... this is the beautiful archetype of the Sophia on screen, as in she represented his purity before his power, before creation. The early love before success being the only real thing--we see this time and time again in art. Is it possible not to feel that in ones own life too? Before Pandora's Box. Before creation. So this is the most beautiful thing he can keep, despite his masculine power fantasies coming true before his eyes, is the girl that was with him first. The funny thing--he lets her take the pill too. He shares the godhood with the Sophia, which is the ultimate power fantasy, we fallen creatures bringing god upon our endeavors to participate. And she sort of just takes it or leaves it. The pill is amazing to her, but not important. The funny thing is that the movie does not blowback. He achieves Luciferean, Nietszchean rule, and skips the part of MacBeth's beheading. It's not here in the confines of the story but I think it's there along the edges. What is on screen is thematically outrageously indulgent. The pill is Bitcoin. The early Bitcoin holders, spending a few hundred dollars and coming out as billionaires. Remember. In the capitalism, he only has this edge briefly. He was just the first, the movie constantly reminds us someone else has found it too. It's inevitable that everyone in the world will be equalized with this godhood in time, which will return him as the loser that he was in the beginning.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But everybody forgets this certainty is limited by his own intelligence. So what could be a real ""super-intelligence"" ?

Cooper: Back Again and Again,"""Limitless"" is only concerned about one thing and that is being really really cool. This is one of the only movies that has come out recently that has successfully ran with a cool idea by avoiding throwing in all sorts of unnecessary nonsense. The script is well written by Leslie Dixon based off of the novel ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn, Bradly Cooper (""The A-Team"", ""The Hangover"") was well casted, and Director Neil Burger raps it together into smart entertaining fun. Cooper plays a man named Eddie Mora who is an aspiring failure of a writer. He has just gotten dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish ""Sucker Punch"") and doesn't know where to turn. This leads him to a chance encounter with his ex-wife Melissa's (Anna Friel, ""Goal"") brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth, ""3:10 to Yuma"") who is known for being involved in the drug game. After a brief meeting, Morra is given a sample of a new drug called NZT-48 that is supposed to open up his brain allowing him to use his full brain capacity increasing his focus and intellect. At first he is very skeptical, however, he is curious and knows that he needs to do something to get out of his downwardly spiraling existence. Needless to say he takes the pill opening up a world of achievement, greed, and danger that is limitless. His life is back on track as he gets his girlfriend Lindy back and is becoming a multi-millionaire, however, isn't there always a drawback? Yes there is as Morra gets more and more involved, his health is at risk and he becomes a marked man.Eddie Morra was a character perfectly crafted for Bradley Cooper. Cooper is looked at as a hotshot, rugged, talented alluring actor mixing comedy, action and drama within his roles. Without Cooper ""Limitless"" would lose its charismatic vibe and would not be nearly as good. The film itself is very captivating and doe not have a dull moment. It achieves this with consistent nonstop strings of entertaining sequences meshed together with exquisite film editing. Film editing is used in a number of ways in order to visually represent distinctions within the human mind. It explicitly distinguishes between full awareness of an opened eyed individual and the foggy state of a closed eyed individual. Depressing, nonsense drama is avoided in the film as well differentiating the film from a stereotypical movie about a junkie. Also, what makes a movie like this better? Cast a seasoned actor like Robert De Niro as a big-time businessman.First of all many viewers may say that the story has been told before, however, this does not affect the movie. One problem that the film does have is failing to fully explain the role of certain characters. Some characters are overlooked very quickly and as the movie turns towards new developments most evident with Robert John Burke's character Pierce. Also, Abbie Cornish's casting as Morra's girlfriend Lindy was not the best choice leading to a very average performance. Yes she does what she is meant to do, however her portrayal is very one-dimensional and ultimately unimportant.The basic outline of ""Limitless's"" plot has been seen before, however, this is not just another movie about a junkie who discovers power and is in danger of losing it. Cooper's charm keeps Morra coming back again and again as he finds the answers to his limitless potential. It is movies like this that define the entertainment of cinema, however, the art of the movie's film editing may be commended as well at the Oscars.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Limitless (2011) - A Drug that Has Mental Focus Powers? Count Me In!,"After becoming a household name in the highly successful movie, ""The Hangover"", Bradely Cooper delivers the performance of a lifetime in one of the best movies of the year. ""Limitless"" stars Cooper as a troubled writer who discovers a top-secret drug which allows him to have natural super human abilities with mental focus. Throughout the movie, he discovers to see things that no other human being has seen. He starts having big money, beautiful women, and giant success. But then the drug brings some side effects, and has to deal with a Wall Street power broker, portrayed by Robert De Niro. Bradely Cooper is just phenomenal in this movie, and I hope he deserves total Oscar consideration for a performance that required a lot of skill, charm, charisma, and smart timing. Abbie Cornish was quite well-acted in this movie, as Cooper's in-and-out girlfriend. Robert De Niro is just timeless in this movie, and he's like one of the best cinema actors you expect to see in a movie. Leslie Dixon has created a well-deserving script that's both well-written and well-accomplished. Also, the cinematography is fast-paced in such a brilliant way, the editing is quite great, the music is non-stop perfection, and the effects are like no other.

A drug for people who wanted to me more anal retentive.,"Limitless is directed by Neil Burger and adapted to screenplay by Leslie Dixon from The Dark Fields written by Alan Glynn. It stars Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro. Music is by Paul Leonard-Morgan and cinematography by Jo Willems. Plot has Cooper has a struggling writer who upon discovering a top-secret drug, finds he has enhanced his brain usage by 80%. All well and good in the beginning as his stock rises considerably and he's suddenly the in demand man, both at work and play. But success comes at a cost, and now he has others interested in the drug tooBonkers daft of course, but still a good time to be had with it if you can forgive the gaping plot holes, the cretinous decisions made by Cooper's protagonist and a sleepy last third. Film looks real nice courtesy of Willems sci-fi alike saturated tints, while Burger shows some style with visual flourishes and nifty camera zooms. Cooper makes for a solid protagonist, and it's good to see De Niro at least showing not all his best form has deserted him. But Cornish as the girlfriend is badly underused, and Anna Friel serves only as a cameo plot device. Screenplay is a touch bold, with its morally dubious bent, but again this only leads to disappointment as the film begins to feel like an overplayed record that winds down to a finale that's rather tepid. After being asked to wait and wonder how this is going to pan out for Cooper, it just isn't the fanfare/thrill/cheek that the best parts of the film promised.It's good fun when it's on form and a decent enough night in as a rental, but it uses only 1% of its brain whilst hardly troubling your own grey matter. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best film ever,I have seen this movie more you can imagine. why? Here is an explanation. One of the reasons which involved my watching this film was how human brains can amazingly work with simple one tablet of drug. How much amazing things can be created. And if it exist in real life how great stuff could be done. But... Every great breakthrough has its own drawbacks. Not everyone wants it to use for good purpose. So in this movie you could deeply think of good and bad sides of drugs like making your brains work 100%. Of course all these action movies has its own love stories which makes film sweeter.

"Pills , Thrills and Bellyaches",Just read on the Did You Know section that Shia LaBoeuf almost had the lead role in this. Praise be for that injury as Bradley Cooper was perfect for the lead role. Admittedley it does not have much competition but Limitless is one of the best movies released in 2011. Pitched predominantly as a thriller it also is humorous and satirical. I loved the simple but effective camera shots simulating the effect of popping the pills ( the speeded up street journey and letters falling on screen) and the soundtrack was spot on.De Niro plays second fiddle here and in an underplayed performance he could have been subbed by any number of 50 something actors. Make no mistake it is Coopers movie. Segments of Limitless reminded me of The Game and The Dead Zone and i admired the slightly ambiguous ending. Just what will Eddie Morra do with all that power?

Neil Burger has done it again!,"Honestly, the only reason I don't give this movie ten stars is because it does have loops, as so many people will hone in on and criticize, so it's obviously not a 'perfect' movie.That being said, I loved it. For once I didn't see the ending to a movie coming. Not because it was some unpredictable twist ending, but because I was too encapsulated in the movie to care. The same thing happened to me with Neil Burger's The Illusionist, but this movie isn't a love story like The Illusionist was. It was very, very beautifully directed, though the zooming thing was a bit much to handle at times, but worst case, you close your eyes because you really won't miss anything but a really cool effect. I don't really want to spoil any of the really neat aspects, because I really liked them when I saw them and I don't want any of you expecting them.The plot had holes, as I'm sure plenty of people will point out, but when I was watching it, I didn't really care. I cared about the characters, and the story. As I said before, I didn't feel the need to contradict anything or look for contradictions or critique and nitpick because the story was interesting and so beautifully portrayed, both by the cinematography and by the acting. It mostly center around Bradley Cooper, and usually when movies only have one real main character it's very dangerous, but Cooper pulls off handling the spotlight perfectly and his character is so well written that you care for him, even though I couldn't personally relate to him (I've never been a drug addict turned super genius and I doubt many of you can say the same).I went into the movie expecting a fun movie that would be enjoyable, but have holes and was generally just overdone, and I came out shocked at how much I loved it. It's honestly the best movie I've seen all year.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An entertaining wonder drug based hit,"(61%) A very watchable popcorn thriller with neat direction, good production values, a degree of bite, fine support, and a strong leading performance from Bradley Cooper. The premise is implemented well even if the script wants to get absolutely every last drop of use it possibly can out of it. There's a clear warning about drugs that runs through, but you would be hard pushed to call this a valid morality tale which in the balance of play is a good thing. This despite being far from great is certainly worth a look for its sheer style and was at least partly worthy of the massive attention it had ladled upon it upon its release.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fun, but leaves something to be desired","I remember several years ago when Lucy came out that people were saying that Limitless was a more enjoyable spin on the whole idea of using 100% of your brain. I do have to commend this movie that it only mentions how little of our brain's potential we use, and doesn't spend time pretending this is based on real science. The pill might as well be magic for all the time they spend explaining it. This is a film that understands what it is, while Lucy was trying too hard to be a more serious film, which just made it seem dumber. I like the idea of someone who uses smarts to get ahead in business and simply make more money. That's the reality of what we all would do with this kind of power, so it makes sense. There was still one of those scenes in this movie of the hero using his brain-power to win a fight, which was kind of stupid, but at least that wasn't his main focus, and he didn't become some super-smart vigilante.I think where Limitless falls short of being a high-quality film, is in the story structure. While I like the setup, and I think Bradley Cooper is a good actor for this role, it felt like the plot didn't go anywhere. Worse than that, it set up a lot of things that it never pays off at the end. It's almost like the filmmakers forgot that they started some of these subplots, so they never remembered to get back to them and explain to the audience what happened. I think the biggest frustration I had (with regards to the lack of follow-through) was the fact that they establish he has a master plan to work on, but then we are never clued in on what that might be. The conclusion suggests what his idea might have entailed, but since we didn't see him preparing for this outcome, it feels like the biggest deus ex machina imaginable. I still enjoyed Limitless as a refreshing take on some common sci-fi tropes, and I can see the potential for a TV series that some executive also saw. It's not a great film, but it is a fun one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
On-limits,"A pounding and indeed relentless up-to-the-minute thriller with its own unique insight into the burn-out behind high-fliers in the finance world; apparently it's all due to a new, unofficially available pill which frees the mind. For Bradley Cooper's schmucky-loser, it becomes a life-changing revelation, making him immediately brilliant in business, an expert in self-defence and of course, a hit with the ladies. Cue lots of directorial devices, such as deep-perspective tracking shots, cut-up scenes and interspersing dialogue. It's a good premise for a sci-fi thriller and the first hour is great as Cooper embarks on his rags to riches trip, discovering the potency of the drug in his everyday life.Unfortunately, it gets too silly from there on as he gets involved with a Slavic gangster who wants in on the act taking the last third into sub-Terminator territory with too much violence and gore and letting down the promise of what had gone before.Cooper is good in what is basically a split-personality role, half strung-out waster, half suited and booted fast-talking whizz-kid. Robert DeNiro does his usual professional job as the biggest shark in the pool, reining in any Pacino-like excess and playing it straight. More could have been made of the slightly underwritten female parts which reaches some sort of nadir when Cooper's wife pops a pill to become Sigourney Weaver long enough to escape the bad guy in a tight spot.In the final reckoning, if the writer and director had avoided the predilection for mindless violence, a modern-day parable about the excesses of capitalism albeit mixed up with a sci-fi and thriller ethos was within reach, but it really let itself down by pandering to the body-count requirement of teenagers who I guess put bums on seats.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not sure which I prefer. The movie is well done based on an original core concept, a decent script and acting. It is easy to see why it was adapted and expanded.Apart from the base story though, which is in and of itself a little ridiculous, Limitless is a routine adventure flick.

Limitless review by Ruben Scherrer,"The plot is based on a not very well-known novel by Alan Glynn called 'The Dark Fields'. It's about a writer who meets his ex-wife's brother who then gives him a pill. He doesn't know what the effect of the pill will be. Because of the drug his brain power improves to 100% and so he becomes probably the most intelligent man in the world. As you can imagine, it gets really exciting and thrilling for him but he also gets into trouble with his new ability.This film is really absorbing and progresses at an extremely fast tempo. The actor Bradley Cooper in the main role does it well but I don't think he could really identify with the role of a super intelligent banker and writer. There is a new special effect that is really special and one I've never seen before: it's a kind of twisting zoom that goes on for a long time without any hesitation. I really liked this effect and how it was used in the movie.In conclusion, I enjoyed and would like to watch more movies by Neil Burger. Finally, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes modern action or sci-fi movies because it has a nice story and some really fascinating new video effects. Good work!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is the ability of the mind is limitless?,"It has a pill to help us become smart, I think we will buy it. Most people think we need smart to succeed, but maybe it's not true. We need more ability to have big success and how to has it? You can see those in this movie: Self-discipline, clear goal, and knowing how to finish.This movie is exploiting a new aspect of sci-fi, pill is representative of something important with ourselves. Maybe is money, relationship, knowledge, or smart,... The Best scene for me in this movie is when the first time the main character drinks a pill. He starts clearing his room and realized his room is terrible to live in. So maybe just good action too has success it's not only bad day to has a bad result.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Im starting to take a liking to Bradley Cooper!,"An original script is what i have been craving Hollyweird to produce for quite sometime. In ""Limitless"" they have succeeded. Bradley Cooper who i have been taking a real shine too ever since first seeing him in "" The Wedding Crashers"" plays starving author Eddie Morra who whilst taking a walk in between his bouts with writer's block bumps into his ex-brother in law they go for a drink together to do some catching up. After listening to Eddies troubling world he slides over a small baggy containing one pill as to which he advises Eddie that if taken instead of the normal 20% of his brain any human being normally uses on any given day he will in fact be able to use all 100% of it. Eddie leaves the bar looking at the pill and figures what has he got to lose and downs it. Before we know it Eddie has changed from a derelict to Albert Einstein in the midst of his Landlord's evil girlfriend virtually laying into him verbally. He totally feels awake and renewed and smart as a whip. This leads us down the path with him as his life takes an incredible upswing. Just remember though what comes up must also come down. Several people from different types of employment are now chasing Eddie for this wonder drug. I thought this was a breath if fresh air as like i said earlier in this review that Hollyweird in my eyes had grown into a stalemate of sorts. Director Neil Burger who last brought us 2006's "" The Illusionist "" regroups himself to give us this ever so excellent thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Limitless: A Parable of Our Society,"¨You know how they say we can only access 20% of our brain? This lets you access all of it.¨ When Limitless begins you might confuse this film with another Hangover sequel, but unlike in those movies Bradley Cooper takes a pill to enhance his life not forget about what happened last night. This pill has the opposite effect on his life, instead of getting hungover, he gets smarter. This action thriller has a very interesting premise: a drug has been discovered that allows you to use your brain to a hundred percent of its capacity. Not many people know about the existence of this pill, but Cooper's character has been fortunate enough to get his hands on it and therefore takes advantage of the situation. The advantages don't come without risks however and that is how the plot develops and traps us. The film is narrated in first person in order to let us know everything that is going on. The movie isn't flawless either, the first minutes of the film are very self explanatory and leave no room for us to wonder and figure out what is happening. The beginning serves as a fifteen minute introduction to the story and we can't help but notice this is taken from a novel. Leslie Dixon (Mrs. Doubtfire) actually adapted the film from Alan Glynn's novel ¨The Dark Fields.¨ The beginning seems taken straight out from the novel and it doesn't really work in the film, but once we get past the introduction the action and thrills begin. I'm not a huge fan of having a narrator letting us know everything that is going on with the story, and in this film the opening sequence suffers from this. Neil Burger (The Illusionist and The Lucky Ones) however brings the movie back to the right direction and lets the rest of the plot play out nicely.Bradley Cooper is Eddie Morra, a writer who has just worked out a deal with a publisher but can't come out with the inspiration to write his novel. He has long hair, a hippy style, his apartment is a mess, and his life seems to be going nowhere. Eddie Morra is the sort of person no one expects anything from. Even his girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), gives him the keys to his apartment back and decides to end their relationship. Eddie is a mess, but his life is about to change when he accidentally runs into his ex brother in law, Vernon (Johnny Whitworth), who happens to have a pill that will change his life. Eddie is reluctant at first, but he doesn't have anything to lose so he decides to try it. The effects of the NZT pill are almost immediate; Eddie begins to remember things that have been locked up in his unconsciousness. He can remember anything he's ever read, heard about, or seen. Suddenly he gets inspired to write, fix his room, and tighten up, his whole life changes in one day thanks to the pill. The next morning he is back to his old self but he decides to contact Vernon in order to buy more NZT's. Once he gets to his apartment he finds Vernon dead and the entire room is a mess. He discovers where the pills are and takes them. Now with the pills, Eddie's life takes a drastic change. He becomes successful and begins making a lot of money in the financial industry. An important businessman, Carl Van Loon (Robert de Niro), takes an interest in him and wants his services. However, Eddie discovers there are some side effects to NZT, and some very dangerous people are also after the pill.Limitless has plenty of action and thrills to keep you hooked. Bradley Cooper is also great as the lead role. Andrew Howard and Tomas Arana play the villains who are mysteriously after the NZT pills. The movie has a sort of strange feel to it at times; for moments it seems as if we the viewer have taken the pills as we experience everything in shaky bright and fuzzy colors. There is plenty of suspense and at times it's hard to know where the movie is going, but it really works well and ties nicely at the end. Limitless does present a moral dilemma as we see how the pill enhances Eddie's life, but at the same time it barely kills him due to the strong side effects. As a society we have grown to rely on different kinds of pills that enhance our mind and bodies without even considering the side effects and dependence these pharmaceutical drugs are having on us. I think that Neil Burger presents these issues very well in this story that serves as a parable for what our society is turning into in its strive for perfection. I really enjoyed this thriller although it has a couple of flaws here and there, but it still is worth watching thanks to Bradley Cooper's leading performance.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Almost Limitless,"Limitless, in a nutshell, is the story of a struggling writer/slacker who stumbles upon a drug that causes him use his brain to its full thinking potential- and like any other drug, he has to deal with the consequences that come from over-use and the dangers of the black market.As a whole, the best word to describe this movie would be unique- although the ""super-human"" concept has been used over and over again in the creative circuit, this story puts a new twist and spin on this idea that sparks a retrospective glance of the drug-fueled cultural revolution of the 60s- the idea that there is some kind of drug out there that unlocks your true potential.Not only is the story quite unique, but the filming style is in a world of its own, with the bizarre fractals and endless zooming sequences making you feel that you are almost on a drug yourself.The writing style and acting in this movie is superb- Bradley Cooper does a superb job narrating the story and acting the main part, and Robert DeNiro reprises his arguably overused (with good reason), but well-fitting role of a corporate elitist who doesn't give a damn. The story as a whole, however, is where Limitless seems to not work as a pun.The story is somewhat slow to get started, and though excitement and wonder follow once things get started, the movie takes the direction of going through a few different story arcs that really seem as though they could have been written better. The ending, although one that ties all the loose-ends, fails to offer the satisfaction that the story arcs seem to be building towards throughout the movie. Whether or not this was intended as a further metaphoric example of drug culture is arguable at best, but the fact remains that I left the theater wanting something a little more.All in all, Limitless is like a roller-coaster ride- it is fast, fun, exciting and unique, but this roller-coaster had potential to have been better-designed and executed. None-the-less, it was a great ride, and a it's a definite recommendation if you are looking for a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Nutshell Review: Limitless,"The film is based on a sexy premise of having the ability to unlock the full potential of one's brain matter, and think about it, the sheer mental prowess available to be tapped on to maximize benefits in almost everything you do. Would you do whatever it takes to have this at your disposal, even if it means becoming a drug junkie, addicted to a clear pill and of course addicted to the feeling of superiority that comes along with the turf?For Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a chance encounter with a drug pushing brother in law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) meant an opportunity to go for broke with the offer of a pill that can dramatically change one's life for the better. Soon Eddie finds himself being able to think clearly, plan multiple steps ahead in what he wants to achieve out of life, from financial stability to getting his relationship with Lindy (Abbie Cornish) back on track, to just about possessing that Midas touch to being successful, recognized, and earning the kind of respect from his peers that his sad little existence never thought was remotely possible.But the best things in life don't come easy, and Limitless is in two minds to being a cautionary tale about drug abuse and the over reliance of medication to get through one's day, or being adamant against that to promote that pill popping is indeed a wondrous shortcut to all things beautiful. In fact it walked on ambiguity for the most parts, though the engaging narrative by Leslie Dixon adapting Alan Glynn's novel keeps that at the back of your mind as you follow the adventures of Eddie Morra making it through obstacles every step of the way, especially when he so decides to build a nest egg before his supply goes out.Director Neil Burger fused a number of special effects to the film, whose editing between the trippy scenes and the real world was flawlessly mesmerizing, as you can imagine just how addictive it could actually be if it was to be presented in an IMAX 3D format, right from the opening credits scene. What turned out to be slightly weak was the presentation of the side effects of NZT-48, which was the losing track of time through multiple encounters with self, since it didn't employ the best use of visual effects to portray just that, and having the narrative conveniently forget and to switch focus to certain death, probably sounded a death knell that this was a subplot best left abandoned, rather than to exploit the limitations of a sustained use or abuse of a shady substance.Bradley Cooper is slowly but surely turning into a major leading star who will probably be able to soon marquee a film on his own. He plays the writer turned suave Wall Street raider with aplomb, and portrays both the zeros about being an addict, and the better versions of his character convincingly, being a man who on one hand builds up a wealth of knowledge and analytical skills through his unfair advantage, and on the other still shows a certain vulnerability stemming from being overly confident with an air of invincibility. Adversary comes in the form of a tycoon in Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), whose power and threats do not suffer fools, and De Niro still shows he's got it in him to play a nasty badass after a string of comedic appearances. The best scene in the film, hands down, belongs to the repartee between Eddie and Carl in the final act, at least up until the abrupt mention of a deus ex machina type revelation that exalts the merits of a continued succumbing to an addiction.The story does take some unexpected turn of events to keep things fresh rather than to make Eddie Morra a one man Superman, and it builds on his conscience to break his cycle and to do the right thing. Sometimes it's easier said than done especially if what's wrong actually becomes a necessary evil and a crutch to continue sustaining a lifestyle of one's choosing. A little bit dark in treatment, but still recommended fare.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Intriguing Film, Intriguing Performances","I really loved Bradley Cooper in this film. Not to sound too shallow, but his gorgeous blue eyes were the perfect prop for lighting up the screen when his character was ""high.""

But his performances in those films were memorable, too! He has a special quality that allows him to make fun of himself even as he is delivering believable performances.

So yeah the premise is kinda cool, but the thing is, although the movie starts out engaging it starts to get dull later on. The movie is simply generic for the most part and really predictable. The direction is also very unimaginative and nothing all that cool happens. Although the movie revolves around a genius for the most part. Maybe it tries to go in a realistic approach but it was still pretty darn dull. I liked the fast pacing of this movie but there are sacrifices since the movie goes from one point to another point without hardly explaining and the characters are not very developed as well.

Robert De Niro's character was good but could have been played by many other actors. De Niro's a legend and did a good job, but nothing special. The storyline was pretty cool and it kept you guessing throughout and didn't drag at all. Visually it was quite powerful and helped you get inside the world of Cooper's character.

Has its limits.,"Limitless stars Bradley Cooper who is virtually in every scene. This is a fast paced and entertaining semi- thriller. It involves the upside of a wonder drug who gives him limitless knowledge. This premise allows Cooper to showcase his new found skills which is fun to watch. This also leads him to money magnate Deniro. Besides Deniro the other support actors are not examined that well but do enough to support Coopers function in the movie. The key to the film is to not look too closely at the plot holes. Credibility is largely forsaken for entertainment and Cooper does well in basically a one man show.

Coopers character has a choice to make and he might not be the most likable character, but you can still care for him. Because after all he's acting and behaving like a human. And even someone who knows it all or has abilities others don't have, does not act always as smart as he is capable of. Plus: What fun would it be, if our main actor would be completely flawless?

Bradley Cooper's knack for slipping from cocksure to self-assured is a delight to watch. His performance, the kinetic energy of the direction by Neil Burger, and a looming sense of dread over the physical and mental toll taken by operating at such a high pitch of efficiency buoy the proceedings along.

A fun time if you don't take it too seriously.,"We've all thought about it (or maybe only us fatties and losers). What if there was a pill that could alter your entire universe, allow you to learn ANYTHING you wanted or be whatever you wanted to be? Adderall? Perhaps, but not to the level of this concoction. Neil Burger's Limitless (2011) tells the story of Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a pathetic, dried out writer who acquires the newest pharmaceutical, NZT. This revolutionary drug allows him to recall anything he has ever learned and soak in as much new knowledge as possible. What could go wrong, right? Wrong! Once word gets around that Eddie has the untested drug, he must do anything he can to hide his stash, for if he stops taking the pill, serious side effects will occur. The movie definitely owns up to its potential as an entertaining thriller, although I would have really enjoyed seeing this concept with a more psychological tweak. This is a fun, fun movie to watch, especially for people who have actually taken drugs (not that I have, I'm just sayin'), but it's no Inception, folks. In fact, you might enjoy this movie more if you just sit back and turn off your brain for 105 minutes. Over-analyzing will just take the fun out of it. Sure, the writing is a bit illogical, but one can't exactly perfect a strong fact-based narrative for a product that doesn't actually exist. Where this movie really tries to excel is in its visual style. It's all, like, zing, zing, zing when we get a glimpse of Eddie's point of view! Quick-cuts, very trippy, but also a little bit tacky. I'd describe its look as being what straightedge people assume tripping is like. Imaginative little chumps, they are! Limitless: A fun time if you don't take it too seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love it!,"I watched Limitless at the theater in 2011 and anticipated its TV release, prompting me to revisit it. While I recalled most of the plot, some elements eluded my memory. Nonetheless, my second viewing was as enjoyable as the first.The film's premise is intriguing-a pill enhancing brain function on an extraordinary scale. It turns you into a highly intelligent individual, akin to possessing mental superpowers, granting the capacity to achieve anything; your potential becomes limitless.The cinematography and effects are commendable, perfectly complementing the surreal atmosphere of a story centered around a revolutionary drug.Throughout the narrative, the plot unfolds unpredictably with ample suspense, though there are some plot holes. Yet, when considering the entirety, the film's positive aspects outweigh the negatives.The performances, particularly by Robert De Niro, are excellent. However, it's Bradley Cooper who truly stands out with an impressive portrayal. This role marked a shift in how I perceive him-an actor capable of handling more intricate roles beyond the usual comedic or romantic genres.In conclusion, Limitless is highly entertaining and offers a captivating cinematic experience-a truly enjoyable ride!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a vastly over rated stinker !!!,"This must be like one of the most ridiculous films I have seen with gaping plot holes, suspension of belief and all notwithstandingI can understand that scriptwriters have to take liberties with the script to get the film going, set the pace right, make the story interesting and so onbut there is a limit and frankly this steaming pile of dog-turd strained my credulityUnlike low-budget, 'leave-your-brain-at-home', C-grade flicks which you watch with low expectations, this film has no such excuse. The fact that this is a mega budget movie with big movie stars (Bradley Cooper, for god's sake) and has a 71% rating on rotten tomatoes seriously leads me to question the direction in which Hollywood movies are headedThis is a supposedly intelligent movie with novel and interesting premisea super drug which enhances the mental abilities of anybody who pops itsounds good??? Let's talk about the most stupid plot holes which I have arranged in descending order (most stupid coming first and so on)1) The whole point of the drug is that whoever stops taking it falls sick and eventually dies, which is presumably the reason the drug dealer himself does not take it and become a business tycoon, president or somebodyso much is made out of its side effects throughout the filmhowever at the end of the movie, our hero has shrugged off the habit quite easily and still retained his mental super-abilitiesvery convenient huhand he explains this off in such a matter of fact manner, which De Niro accepts without question 2) The hero is not shown to be especially sharp or intelligentin fact he is a failure and a loser, who claims to be a writer, but has been unable to write a single wordyet he figures out something that the other users could not (including his extremely smart ex-wife)that if he eats on time, he can control the side effects of the drug 3) Bradley explains in a voice-over that he has forked out several million dollars for personal security – hiring professional bodyguards, renting a fortress like apartment with latest technology etc to keep away from the Russian thugsthe smug smile on his face (visible only to the audience) when he finalises the deal for the multimillion dollar apartment suggests that he has bested his opponentshowever in the climax of the movie, they bust in with utmost easeand before that they bump off his freakishly huge professional bodyguardswhat is the point of investing so much in personal security if a band of thugs can get too you without breaking a sweat??? 4) The thing about the hero sipping on the thug's blood to get back his super abilities really cracked me upcome onwhen you inject a drug, it gets diluted across your entire blood streamhow does he get the full benefit just by sipping on a little blood??? 5) Why would a guy with enhanced mental abilities, a super smart person borrow money from a dangerous gangster and then forget to pay it backand which retarded person grabs a pill from a relative stranger's hand and pops it without considering the potential harm??? Yet that is exactly what the Russian gangster does 6) At the end of the movie, De Niro (for some inexplicable reason) wants Cooper to work for him, presumably for his artificially enhanced mental abilitieshe reveals that he now owns the company that produced the drugbut in that case, why would Niro want to hire a guy who is a natural loser like Cooper and difficult to controlwon't a naturally genius and successful businessman like Niro have several super-smart guys already working for him, who can be enhanced with the drugor what is to prevent Niro from taking the drug himself and trying to become President of the United States??? His sudden and inexplicable switch from good guy to guy with negative shades, for no valid reasons, is difficult to digest 7) I figure that if I had a finite supply of the mind-enhancing drug, the thing to do would be to crank out a dozen or more best sellers before the supply runs outand then release them one at a timethis would rake in the millions by way of royalties and make me famousno super smart person would play the money market game to get rich as that would raise a thousand questionsI know that you are supposed to ignore small things and not think too much while watching a moviebut this entire film is an excellent example of deus ex machine (a plot device to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem suddenly and abruptly, with the contrived intervention of some new, unexpected eventfrequently used when the writer has ""painted himself into a corner"")the acting and other aspects are adequate, but I could not pay much attention to anything else as I was too incredulous with the ludicrous storyline",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Life is Limitless,"This is an exceptional sci-fi thriller that has excellent acting, a great plot and hold your attention to the end. The end is a very interesting outcome of events and very unexpected as well. The actors are exceptional and very beautiful and handsome if I say so myself. The script writers did a awesome job and the CGI is very very good. I've watched many movies and this is a keeper. I own this movie and will watch it many many times, because every time you see a little more than the last time. It's a very exciting movie and full of twist interns that you wouldn't expect especially the death of one of his ex-wife's brothers. No spoiler alert in this review!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Showcase For Bradley Cooper,"This one is really good and holds up after ten years. Based on a Novel, Limitless, is a thriller about the quest to expand the parameters of the human brain. Bradley Cooper is perfect for this role. Robert DeNiro and Abbie Cornish are great in supporting roles. The movie is engaging and thrilling. It is well scripted and well Directed. NYC is a secondary character in this great one. It was the basis for a series and a book by Jim Kwik on the topic of expanding our abilities. This is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The cause and effects of Crystal Meth....in pill form.,"In a role completely opposite of ""The Hangover,"" dashing Bradley Cooper is a down-and-out, aspiring ""writer"" seemingly caught in the most serious funk of his entire life. All that changes, when he stumbles upon his ex brother-in-law - a successful hustler of sorts, introducing Cooper to a life-changing event - all contained inside a small Zip lock bag.The clear, innocent-looking pill that costs an outrageous $800 a pop turns Cooper into a literal, mental dynamo...all in 30 seconds. Suddenly, everything is in sharp focus and the ability to remember and learn virtually everything becomes possible to him. He wastes no time reversing his bad luck and soon has the world at his feet...not to mention the thugs who want their stolen ""dope"" back.Robert De Niro's small role is rather insignificant, in this movie. But, its Cooper who finally realizes he must make a choice for the better, and actually improves the drug itself. This movie is a fun, roller-coaster ride through the bright and dark side of drug addiction. Yet, it is still a sensationalized example of exactly what Pharmaceutical grade Methamphetamine can do to your energy levels and brain function. The morale of this story? If man made it...it will always KILL YOU.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great concept, safe execution","With a such an interesting concept, Limitless had potential to run away as an all star movie, but instead it falls a little bit flat and it is safe and easy to watch. It ends up being more of a summer blockbuster or a Michael Bay-esque style movie rather then something extremely thought provoking. By no means is this a bad thing but you'll be disappointed if you wanted more of a backstory on the drug. Everything in this movie happens quickly and nearly all at once and there isn't time for questions to be answered. I also think the movie gets to be full of itself and suffers from the awareness syndrome. Overall Limitless is a good movie, it's more of your typical cliche action/thriller then anything else but with good acting and a surprisingly good ending, it's still very much enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
if you could take a magic pill to...,"This is the one with bradley coper, not the one with one of the many hemsworths. Great premise...what if you could take a pill that gets your brain going faster? And you could see solutions to help you in any situation? Like athletes say, no gain without pain. So there must be a down side. At first, the side effects are no big deal, but later on...
this seems to be about addiction, power, greed. Things an addict says, like when eddie says he can stop taking it as soon as his life is turned around. Just like a gambler. And the business deal he has put together is falling apart. How is this rated PG13 ? So many drugs, violence, blood, they must have made just enough cuts to avoid the R. It's well done. I would have liked to have seen more special effects, maybe what eddie sees or experiences. But I guess it's more about the story than the special effects. Directed by neil burger.

limitless,"Limitless (based on the novel ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn) is directed by Neil Burger and starring Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish, and Robert De Niro.""Why is that the moment your life exceeds your wildest dreams, the knife appears to your back? I will never let them (knives) to touch me"". The film starts with these lines. It's a story of a man with four digits IQ but initially an ordinary book writer Edward ""Eddie"" Morra (Bradley Cooper), do not have any story to write, waiting for an idea but still have a pretty girlfriend Lindy. So story starts in flashback where he met brother of his ex-wife who insisted him to take a drug , a stimulating drug which allow people to access 100% of their brain's power(as it is said that we, a normal human use only 20% of his brain power. dkexplorer.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

SciFi v Action,"The concept underpinning Limitless has universal appeal. What if we could make maximum use of those unused portions of the brain we rarely call upon? Unsurprisingly the idea has attracted movie-makers periodically, for decades. In 1996 for instance Jon Turteltaub, made the pretty successful Phenomenon with John Travolta, which, whilst utilising the same basic premise as Limitless, eschewed the thriller aspects almost completely, concentrating on creating a romantic drama. In Luc Besson's Lucy, the sci fi prospects of the intelligence gain are amped up to what I reckon, were ridiculous levels. It becomes unsurprisingly very much an excessive, special effects driven extravaganza.Limitless treads more middle ground. In my opinion it succeeds better in the first half, where Bradley Cooper's Eddie acquires the NZT and we see him on a number of occasions literally metamorphose before our eyes. I like the way director Neil Burger achieves this effect without a deluge of special effects; instead relying on Cooper's acting skills and smarts, upping the tempo and content of spoken dialogue and the use of filters to alter the lighting, along with changes in music and sound effects. Cooper needs special praise here. His performance does much to convince us of the drug's possible benefits to humanity.Somewhere along the production planning though, it was decided by the studio, to turn the movie into an action thriller. As such, it's not a bad one, although it embraces plenty of familiar tropes ( violent Russian hoods, greedy corporations etc.) and relies on some pretty banal plot contrivances to change the movie's tone and direction. Seriously, nothing could convince me, that the new Renaissance Eddie would deliberately seek out a Russian loan shark to obtain more seed money and later forget to pay him back on time. Stuff like this and the arriving police not searching Eddie after he calls in a homicide, make us realise how an up till then smart movie, is suddenly being dumbed down, perhaps in an effort to win over the multi-plex crowds.The conclusion is simply pure Hollywood and I have to say that while I overall liked both movies and found them entertaining, Phenomenon had a much more, sober, realistic finish than Limitless.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well executed concept.,"It's obvious that when I first watched the movie, I enjoyed it way too much more then second or third time or so. Sometimes I wonder does that happen because of the factors I don't know or what. Still from what I have rated it tells us how much I have liked the movie. Although I would like to put light on, the general myth in which even Einstein believed that we don't use cent percent of our brains. Furthermore, avoiding that and looking at entertainment type and level and given concept even if untrue this movie is phenomenal.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The on screen effects while being at terrace of building and looking through pathway passing along streets, along with event recall after taking a NZT, are tremendous. If you are on certain drug that helps you act superiorly in some way - you can totally relate to it.Tone: Movie is set in tone where a person using 20 percent of his brain starts using hundred percent of his brain. It is a thriller executed nicely. You stay glued to your seat.Acting: Acting is average.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pleasantly surprised as it happens!,"I wasn't holding out too much hope for the film after reading some of the reviews posted on IMDb, as it happened it wasn't the crock of sh*t some people have made this flick out to be. Granted it's no Oscar winner but the story for most parts zips along just fine and the premise is interesting if a slightly used one. I think the one complaint I have and I think I'm not alone on this point, is the ending or lack of it was a bit of a let down. In my opinion if time goes quickly when you're watching a movie then it can't be all that bad and for me time did go fast just like the character in one of the better movie releases of late.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great concept, but the story has its limits",I liked the concept of the movie. A pill that can unlock limitless possibilities of mind... amazing thought..

This enables him to pick up his broken life and take it to new heights. However he soon discovers that something so amazing cannot come without a price. What was particularly interesting to see how different one's life can be if one can utilise the full potential of one's brain. This movie makes this point very well.

With help from the drug he begins to turn his life around and everything he has ever wanted is now in reach... but the problem is he only has a limited supply and he is not the only one who knows about it.I enjoyed this film, Bradley Cooper played his part extremely well, and Robert De Niro was also on point as his high profile boss.

A fun cinematic experience,"Alright, so the movie bases it's ""Limitless pill"" device on the age old myth that we only use 10% of our brain. If you're willing to look past that aspect of the movie, I think there's a lot of fun to be had here.Bradley Cooper plays Eddie, a writer who by the beginning of the movie has fallen into a depression, his apartment is a mess, he struggling to pay his bills, and his future is looking bleak. That's when we're introduced to the mysterious, fascinating character from Eddie's past who personally gives him the pill that changes Eddie's life.Abbie Cornish, playing opposite Bradley Cooper as Lindy, does an outstanding job throughout the many serious, tense scenes the movie places her in. She plays a fascinating character motivation for Eddie and has a well rounded, interesting character development.Robert De Niro also has a major role in this film as Carl Van Loon, a New York City bigshot with more power than he knows what to do with.While the majority of the movie is fun, gripping and all plays very well into the general theme of the film it is not without it's moments that tend to feel like a drag, often in the second act. That complaint is outweighed by the rest of the film, and I would still certainly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun, mysterious thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Limitless is Decent even though Limited,"Limitless is a Bradley Cooper vehicle that spends its time with interesting high energy cinematography, editing and directing. But I felt the story left more of a central question to the viewer rather than answers to the overall plot.The plot of the movie is that this down on his luck writer named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) just got dumped by his girlfriend and surprise, surprise has writer's block on his recent book that he is writing. By sheer coincidence he meets his ex-brother-in-law who happens to be a supplier of a new drug street-named NZT, and this essentially grants him the power of super enhanced focus and the ability to learn information at an astonishing pace. One thing leads to another and he gets in trouble with the mob, his work and his personal life.Now the pieces I think really worked in this film are the interestingly high paced production values of the film, I think it's engaging but I believe that someone will find it very uninteresting, subjectively speaking of course. Another thing I enjoyed was the performances, I thought Bradley Cooper does show he has charisma and charm that can carry a film and of course Robert De Niro is just Robert De Niro.My problems in the film come from inconsistencies in the overall plot of the film. There are some plot holes, but I think this film is enjoyable enough to skim past them. I also dislike the typical Hollywood ending this film gives which really just leaves more questions than answers. Also I swear Bradley Cooper gets laid in like every 3 scenes which is more nitpicking because it is Bradley Cooper, but still.But my whole mind throughout the film was asking me would I do the drug even knowing the side effects of it, and I say hell yeah, but seriously that really is the central question the film leaves you with.Overall I think it's a fun little popcorn flick if your bored, I think if you watch it with low expectations the film will be better than you expect it to be. I'm going to give it a solid 7/10 because I did enjoy myself watching it, even though I don't think it will be for everybody.-The Critical Warhead",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Limitless story line very familiar,"While I found this movie extremely entertaining, the story line to a small degree resembles an episode from the old Outer Limits TV Series titled Expanding Human. The story line was that a group of professors and students at a college were experimenting with an experimental new drug that enhanced both the mind and the body. It allowed one of the professor's, Skip Homier, after taking the drug, to become this hulking strong man with super strength and intelligence. The opening teaser of the episode shows this hulking figure slowly walking down a college hallway in the middle of the night and ripping a steal door off its hinges and then choking the night watchmen while he holds him two feet off the floor.

"Liked it, but it could've been better","This film had a really cool premise, great actors, some interesting action scenes, but when it was over, I felt like it could have been a little stronger. The premise is that a man gets a drug that allows him to take full control of his brain, since we only use about 20% of our brain's actual power. So he basically knows everything, he can also go back into his mind and remember anything that happened to him in the past. The acting is great, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Abbie Cornish were all good. The action was entertaining and the visuals were minimal but very well handled. However, since it has such great things about it, the film just didn't have the punch that I was expecting.

aintnocool,"I browsed the comments here, and only found 10% of them that are shocked by the purpose of the movie. Telling you it promotes the use of drugs would make me a conservative bigot. If i tell you the elites using of occultism to reach the same power as the pills, it will make me a lunatic mystic. It seems in now way curious for most of the audience that the movie is portraying humanity as pathetic in its normal condition, and twisted on his unlimited condition - sure the potential depicted is all about intellect, power, money, security, paranoia, and even killing, lying, forgering, cheating in the sake of ultimate power.

Movie after movie, depicting each one multiple murders, gratuitous violence, the art of faking and the permanent necessity of lying, Hollywood teaches its audience a new way to be cool : * smart -but talking with 500 words top, * megalomaniac -yourself is everything, * competitional -the other is nothing, * materialist -never see the why,the where,the essence (ans so on) All those things said, the choice of De Niro named ""Van"" something and as a mentor of Mora is plainly representing the deal made by old aristocracy to the uneducated newcomers that plunge into it (ie Clinton, Carter, and some other son of farmers that will learn how to rule the world without ascendancy). As I read it here in the comments, this a Faustian pact, and nobody could be better than De Niro who incarnated Louis Cyphre in Angel Heart.

"Highly engaging, worth the watch!","I went to see this movie with no expectations, and not knowing what it was about, which I rarely do and found it thoroughly enjoyable.The storyline takes a couple minutes before the action starts but from 5 minutes in, I was captivated. It plays into the human desire of wanting to be highly intelligent, knowledgeable and in turn successful. This movie exposes you to both the positives and negatives that come with great intelligence and great success, as you see contrasting characters, all experiencing higher intelligence than usual but this is not in depth, and you only really get a feel for Bradley Cooper's experience.For some parts of the movie, it feels as though, Bradley Cooper is the only actor in this movie, as it focuses primarily on him as he thrives and struggles with the dilemma on super intelligence, and his quest to get the pill which grants him this.

One magical pill and he finishes his book in a few days. The next thing you know he is picking stocks. The initial premise is that we has a powerful memory etc. He has no background in the financial world so for me that didn't make sense to me. The acting was fine by Cooper. I am a big Deniro fan but I think he came in and did some scenes for a few days and that was it. The movie is entertaining but as most these days will you remember it a few weeks later.

"""It can look to be too much stuffed with ideas but the thrill is still too much.""","Bradley cooper shines as a struggling author in the film. My only reason to see the film was this guy. The film also provides a plot which has endless possibilities. Eddie is a normal guy who is struggling to do something significant in his life. Getting desperate more and more, he finds a drug which enhances the capabilities of your brain. How this drug turns his life upside down in a proper cosine wave format is what the entire film is about. I know it sounds rubbish, normal sci-fi. But there are certain things which make the film a little bit interesting and make itself worthy for at least one time watch. First of all the effects are good, innovative and something which is not too star war types but which we can perceive visually in a good aesthetic manner. Bradley cooper himself has done amazing in his role as a struggling person. The narrative pattern of the film is also binding, where cooper himself narrates his life. I still think that in this way the audience gets more interested. Apart from these good parts, I felt like the information was too much in the short span of the film. Many details of the novel would have been tried to stuff into the screenplay. And not all were impressive and they just contributed towards the hurriedness and the abruptness at the same time to the film. The ending was clichéd and I was expecting something different so that also was a letdown. But in all the film is fast paced, gripping and a definite one time watch for all action lovers. There might be many action films pertaining to this sci-fi genre and this again is not too different but then again it is good in its own way and stands apart from others in the bucket.MESSAGE: ""Life is worth taking risk""VERDICT: ""One time watch""",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Fun Flick,"The movie ""Limitless"" came out right when Bradley Cooper (""The Mule"") was starting to get big. I remember seeing trailers for this film but not really thinking anything of it, but over the years it's title has floated up whenever people talked about 'Fun' movies. That's what this movie is: it's fun. There are plenty of moments where it almost takes things too far and almost becomes obnoxious (there's nothing worse than a movie that thinks its smarter than it is), but for the most part this film is carried along by some innovative cinematic techniques, a solid performance by Bradley Cooper, and an overall bonkers concept. This film wont be remembered as an uber-classy thriller; if anything it'll be remembered as the pretty decent movie Cooper made before he started to really make some great career choices (""Silver Linings Playbook"", ""American Sniper"", ""A Star is Born"") and simultaneously it will be remembered as the film Robert De Niro (""Taxi Driver"") made after he started to run out of money from all of the great movies he made earlier in his career.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quite Entertaining,"Eddie Morra (Cooper) is given a new pill, NZT48, that will increase his brain power to 100% and he excels in everything. What a guy!

I can only hope that those who read this review are also at the 10% level and won't think too badly of me as I plod along. However, I do fear those readers may be above 10%. Bummer. Woe is me.This was quite entertaining. Not exactly like a comedy as one would imagine with the plot line being what it is. No, this is high drama, but does have some funny moments.I kept asking myself who is Bradley Cooper and someone said he was in THE HANGOVER. Ah, yes, that almost comedic comedy. I saw that and didn't see anything funny in there except for the Taser scenes. But, Cooper proves my point in that so-called comedians do better with drama because they have the timing for drama, not comedy. Cooper did exceptionally well in this movie. (Bob, you do know they are making THE HANGOVER 2, don't you?) I have low expectations about that, but will give it a shot.Also, Robert DeNiro (as Carl Van Loon) was excellent. I just hope his not-so-funny comedy days are over with. For me they weren't working for him. But in drama, he has few peers. And, if truth be told, he is extremely funny in dramas when he is has some funny lines to deliver in that serious way he has that produces laughter. He was great in here and I wouldn't rule out a Best Supporting Actor award. But, that's just me.Abbey Cornish (as Morra's girlfriend). Wow! Where did she come from? Absolutely beautiful and sexy. Will have to keep an eye out for her in the future. She could be the next Charlize Theron. Hmmmm..The story isn't as predictable as one might think. It has a few twists and turns and not all of them pretty. The way they did the flashbacks in the beginning was exceptional. Very good. The acting by all, the pacing, real stunts and the CGI were all right on the mark. Very entertaining.Well, that's my 10%.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Pox on the long and bad reviews,"Ignore the reviews giving under 5. They don't know how to review movies. I curse them to be forced to watch ""Super Babies"" over and over until giving 1-star to a decently made movie gives them pain. Skip the long reviews, too: this film doesn't need a long review. If you like dramas with a little kick-ass thrown in and a little escapist fantasy, this is a great film. I should probably develop my own scale for date movies and rate them accordingly. That in mind, it's not a chick-flick, but also not a pure testosterone film, though it leans more toward the guy side. De Niro's presence automatically adds at least 4 points to any film review, though you can scale that down a bit for ""Limitless"" due to his relatively short screen time. That said, his screen time for plot purposes is good.Summary: get out the popcorn and soda, or wine plus crackers and cheese and summer sausage and cuddle on the sofa for a balanced film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A good solid Mystery Thriller,"Rating-7/10Limitless a mystery thriller film is fast and fun, but with a slightly darker tone going through it as well. The plot and visuals are great and make for a film where you enjoy yourself but also not be able to predict what will happen next. I think many will love this with it's fun outline as a story and whether or not it lives up to that well, I felt it was solidly good and here below is why I felt that about it.The story as said is fast and paced well to not rush the key elements of the plot that you are needed to listen to. It is fun at times and then more mad also which mixes well together in which it is very enjoyable. The story also manages with such a big complex plot, not to be confusing and if you didn't catch every bit you would still be able to watch it anyway. Finally on the story I felt that it wasn't too dragged, you get what you predicted to see it kind of go like but they do it well and it doesn't or shouldn't bore you.Bradley Cooper is good in this, he isn't great but his job to lead the cast is fun and he acts like a bit of a player in a sense but he also acts the darker bits too. People like De Niro and Anna Friel are underused but it doesn't really make the film worse really with De Niro not seeming to fit the role very well in truth. Support is OK and to be fair I felt Cooper just has to run the show for most of the time which is OK by the end.Based on a novel it is adapted well with a basic script and some dialogue starts to just sound like there trying too hard to be smart. I loved the direction though and the entire film's artistic level is higher because of the directing. The effects used on this are well done and with a budget that isn't that that high, the effects are great and some shots also used here are so intricate and beautiful. One shot I will point out is when Cooper is stood on top of a building and the camera comes up then over him and back down to his face, done very well indeed.The film could be said as to how I said, it try's to hard to be smart and maybe even attempts to confuse the viewer just to make it seem really really smart. Not too much is bad in this but it could also be said the film is too fast and well the entire piece is, but the ending I personally felt quite rushed and as if they felt they had to speed it up, in the end it is up to you if there is any criticisms though.People who enjoy a complex story will like this and those who enjoy the kind of films where a down and out person suddenly shocks everyone with his skills, well this is definitely for you. It could be said that one part(I won't ruin it) is rather strange and things go on that if you don't understand what is happening you might get lost, this is a part that could annoy film fans. Most should enjoy this and any Cooper fan will also be pleased with his performance too I guess.Overall a 7/10 from me meaning Solidly Good, could have been rated higher but just a few little factors stop it from gaining. This is the kind of film where you can watch and be entertained for just around 105 minutes, sit back and see what happen. In fact you know what with this movie, you should be able to sit back and also just enjoy the intense story that although is never mind boggling, is still worth a watch, and I couldn't recommend it more.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brain activity to the maximum!,"To put it bluntly, the film is excellent, touching on such scientific topics as brain activity, and presenting to the viewer all this beautiful theme in the wrapper of a classic thriller, the film turned out to be wonderful, especially with such a good actor as Bradley Cooper.What is the film about - New York writer Eddie, wanting to overcome the black streak in life, takes a classified drug called NZT. The tablet brings the guy's brain to work in unreal power. This creative drug changes Eddie's whole life, in a short time he earns a lot of money, but soon begins to suffer from the ominous side effects of the drug.

"The story has been told before, but not in this way","The story has been told before, an addiction of a unknown substance that gives you special abilities, but not in this way.

A few adjustments could have made it excellent,"The premise is quite original and while the movie had potential, one can deplore a scenario that doesn't develop enough certain points when they deserved more consideration, and an ending a bit abrupt, frustrating and frankly not that well handled.Still, the plot is captivating and the different elements of the story interlink each other almost perfectly and in a very fluid manner, even if the rhythm drops a bit after the hour mark before skyrocketing in the last 15-20 minutes.But the real strength of Limitless is the cinematography: ultra dynamic, inventive, polished, a huge work having been put into the photography by adjusting lighting, colors and contrasts according to Eddie's state.

What would you do if you suddenly got really smart?,"I am pretty sure that you wouldn't do what this guy did. Anyway, it is a fun movie with an interesting premise and they even made a TV series of it, so if you like it, you could carry on having the fun.The story is about a guy who inadvertently finds a stash of mind enhancing drugs. He climbs up in the world pretty fast, so people notice and try to stop him, naturally. The way they do it and how he handles them is pretty hard to swallow, but then again, if you were really smart you wouldn't use your own person and name to become famous in stock trading. You would just make money, discreetly.The acting is OK, I would say the Bradley Cooper's acting makes the film more than the subject (or the horrible soundtrack).

Induced 'Mind Magic' or Cure from Writer's Block,"I find this movie both fascinating and at the same time limiting. It also unwittingly reflects on the questions of our mind, subconscious, creativity, abilities and what we can do with it all. I'd say that the way these notions are portrayed in the movie is more of a male view on the situation. Creativity cannot be forced and writer's blocks can be unblocked in so many other ways but by a single pill. 
Mastery, for me, lies not in taking pills to unlock our great abilities, hidden talents and enter the subconscious but by looking into ourselves, uncovering our own values, truths, talents and at the same time staying open to the world around us, staying tuned in, also using our intuition as well as logic. In a combination they are very powerful. 
On the other note, the struggles of the main protagonist, Eddie Morra, reminded me of so many writers, especially male ones, who try to solve everything by force, pills, drugs or alcohol and forget that the most powerful source is within us. They just should start using their intuition and creative side to unlock it. Having said that, I still believe it was fun to watch the movie to see how it will all end up.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Only the Quantity of NZT is the Limit.,"I first saw 'Limitless' in 2011 when it had its original run in cinemas. So, watching that film now, it somehow feels so 2010. Stylistically, I mean. There is some certain style or atmosphere in science fiction and action movies made between 2007-2012 that I can only call 2010ish. Don't ask me why I get such a feeling.'Limitless' had quite original premise upon its release, and the thing is it still feels fresh. I guess I haven't seen a movie handling similar subject matter. The things that bothered me almost nine years ago are the same ones that bother me today. Some more, some less. First, lets start with that 'we only use limited part of our brain'. The character Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) says that we can access 20% of our brain, while the well known urban myth is about 10%. As we find out, the Vernon is not the brightest guy, it is obvious that this myth was thrown in by the screenwriters to give an easy explanation to the audience (from whom large part are not very bright themselves), and also show the shallowness of the character. The second problem was the unnecessary addition of the Russian mobster to just to amp up the thrills and have some cliche edge-on-your seat action scene. The screenplay could have been little more thought out. I think I don't need to praise Bradley Cooper's ability to turn in fantastic performance as out of luck writer turned into supergenius.Neils Burger's lavish visual style manages to turn very uneven screenplay into highly entertaining, and even thought provoking film that manage to work on many levels. I liked how the colors turned brighter when Eddie Morra was on NZT, and went back to greyer tones when he was 'himself'.This film also works somewhat as a motivational video - don't tell me you didn't get the desire to clean up your apartment after finishing the movie. I did. And remember, NZT does exist. It is all in our heads. And cleaning up your apartment is good way to start turning your life better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And what would you do????,"Trust me when I say this - You have watched Limitless in one way or another in the last 20 years. The idea is not new. You have seen it before where a common man gets his hand on something which changes his world but he forgets that you have to pay for what you take (Not every movie is Alladin). What makes this move different is the execution which will earn you your money.Limitless stars Bradley Cooper as a writer whose last book wasn't a success and he hasn't written a word since then. Then he meets one of his old acquaintances and gets what's essentially a high IQ drug and everything changes. As he becomes more successful his path cross with Robert De Niro and Anna Friel. Both have their reasons to be in his life. And then there is Abbie Cornish who tries to be the ideal girlfriend. All in all, Limitless has a very decent cast who deliver what you expect (to an extent).What makes this movie different is the execution. 10 out of 10 to the writer and the Director for the treatment. The mood of the movie literally changes every time Bradley is taking his drugs. The ending is abrupt. I wish they would have paid more attention to it.All in all, Limitless is decent fun movie.

You are lured in by the awesome visual effects of the drug and can't miss one second of this movie, my eyes were instantly glues to the screen. The thought of the desire to have so much power and money and success was really what attracted me to this movie and I think it portrayed very well the want and desire for all that.

I think so,"Many directors have turned to the unraveling of the human brain, so it is not a new topic for cinematography. Neal Burger simply showed it more colorfully, thoughtfully, and on a larger scale than others. That's the secret.We all go through rough patches in our lives, when things fall apart, work is under pressure from all sides, and our personal lives regress. Eddie Morra is no exception; his life is not without cloudy moments. And at the moment when the writer is besieged by a publishing house and betrays a girl, there is an old friend with a life-saving panacea - an experimental drug NZT. The main task of the miracle pill is to recharge our brain, which by nature is set to save its resources.Here Burger shows one man from two sides - exhausted and tortured at the beginning, with questionable appearance and average mental abilities, and after a couple of days - confident, stylishly successful. At the same time, we also see how Eddie perceives the world in the beginning and closer to the finale. Being able to compare one character to another allows us to become not just a spectator, but a scientist-practitioner peeking through the slit of a test subject.The film makes you think about your life, makes you realize exactly what you want and eventually, you will find the right ways to achieve your goals.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A pill not so hard to swallow,"If you could take one tablet to make you smarter, faster, more entertaining, probably richer and maybe even sexier, would you take it?Apparently we only use 20% of our brain function, some less than others of course but imagine if you could suddenly use all of it. Everything you ever learned, read or seen, instantly at your disposal with the communication skills and confidence to match.Struggling New York writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is faced with this dilemma, not for long, as the pill is on the way down before you can say, was that FDA approved?Suddenly Morra can finish his book, start trading derivatives and complex financial instruments, whilst learning several languages and getting a hair cut.In a nicely played moving montage, it is clear he has made it or is certainly well on his way.Of course this is a movie, so the path to true success and happiness cannot run true and many scenarios are thrown in his way before the well played and slightly ambiguous denouement.If you can get through the opening nausea inducing credits, this a fun film which does not take itself too seriously. Plenty of thrills and spills and whilst dabbling in the ethical dilemma the screenplay poses, it stays firmly in the shallow end, leaving deeper waters to other films.Of course with so many illegal substances freely available in many parts of the world, the opening question is somewhat moot, the answer increasingly being, hell yeah. Of course whilst the real life upside is likely to be lessened, the downside is about the same, albeit without hit-men attempting to assassinate you in most cases.Cooper, a late replacement for an injured Shia Le Beouf, does well in his first starring role. Perhaps not a true breakout role but another solid entry into his filmography and increasing star status.The film does veer off track when the inevitable downside and side effects present themselves, few moviegoers like watching ""Junkie"" acting but the story picks up a good head of steam for a rousing send off.It is good to see De Niro back on the screen although solid, he adds little star power here. Lindy (Abbie Cornish) adds more to the proceedings as Morra's long suffering girlfriend.The violence is occasionally more than you are expecting but the transformation of a Eastern block drug dealer (Howard) is rather amusing to watch.""More finesse, I like that word, I did not know it before""SummaryGood fun with a neat concept that it is not fully utilized but provides a solid couple of hours of entertainmentEnjoyable, entertaining and confirms that Cooper might yet become a true star, even before the inevitable ""Hangover 2"" arrives.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid but Forgettable.,"Imagine if there was a drug that could make you do anything you want. Now imagine if they made a movie about it. Limitless start Bradley Cooper and is a thoroughly entertaining. The story was very interesting but it was obvious the drug would be too good to be true. Characters paths were easily predicted but I was able to sit through the entire thing, which is always a plus.Bradley Cooper has done a great job in launching his career past The Hangover. This isn't his best performance but he has natural charisma on screen and this was proof that he could handle a serious role. I will say this right now; if Limitless did not have Bradley Cooper then Silver linings Playbook would not have been as great as it was. I feel that Limitless was less of a movie but more of a test for Bradley Cooper, and in my opinion, he passed with flying colors.Cooper plays a struggling writer looking for his big break. I expected his life to go from bad to worse before he got the pill but it didn't. The movie jumped right into it and got down to business. I liked that but there still left the questions with obvious answers. Once he has the drug it is obvious he needs a large supply and fast. The plot builds up the character who supplies the drug then he gets written off. Spoiler alert, he dies, its not a big deal and any idiot with half a brain could have figured it out. The last time we see him alive his apartment is a mess and he has a bump on his head. The movie foreshadows his death and Cooper inheriting his problems that come with the drug. These problems are the Russian gangsters he gets in association with. It never made sense to me why he got involved with them, but he did and after he became a millionaire, got his girl back, had job after job opportunities, they give him a reality check and prove to be the ""bad guys"" in the movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the Russians in general, I feel like they were unnecessary. The focus on them was weird because I expected the movie to focus more on Robert De Niro. When he made his first appearance I paid extra attention because I expected the movie to get real and more intense. I was hoping it would be way more intense than camping, but it proved to be highly disappointing. The big flaw with Limitless was the lack focus on a primary antagonist. There were the Russian and De Niro, but they were both on the same level. One should have been above the other in terms of deviance and importance. There were plot holes with these characters and the movie failed to impress. The story took a few turns I did not expect but a problem in the story was solved too easily. The pill almost killed Cooper but his solution isn't to not take it anymore, it's to take it on a lesser dosage and not abuse it. That made no sense to me. How does a big problem like that just disappear? This drug had a major impact and seemed so strong and t was became regulated within a few minutes. People died from this drug and Cooper learns how to control it with a snap of the fingers? I don't think so. That is lazy writing. I don't know what I liked better, the wit of Bradley Cooper, or the way the camera works and how I felt when the drug was taking effect of Cooper. The visuals and the way the camera moves when the drug is being used made me feel like I was on it myself. The speeding thru time and sideways view on everything and the flashes were fantastic. It took me on a trip. On the other hand the pill made Cooper talk with such confidence and tenacity that only he can pull off as an actor. Overall, Limitless was a movie that is incredibly difficult to pull off. Bradley Cooper was the right choice as the lead, a few mishaps in the writing and lack of other characters hurt the movie as a whole, but it was still enjoyable. Cooper was great and he built up chemistry with De Niro and that was another big part of the success of Silver Linings Playbook. I suggest you see this movie at least once. Don't jump from your couch do see it immediately. You can see it whenever and it will gave the same impact. No matter when you see it you will forget it within a week.

"Bold & Refreshing, Bradley Cooper & Neil Burger made it intriguing and exciting.","LIMITLESS – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Limitless is refreshing, it's one of the few movies which takes you along with it and you feel that you totally understand what Eddie is going through or feeling. Heads off to Neil Burger for using two cameras for before & after effects of drugs. That was a brilliant move which made the movie more relatable and understandable. This is a story about Eddie (Bradley Cooper) finds a drug which can make his mind function 100% rather than 20% as normal human beings. Now the story is how to get benefit out of it and how to save this drug from other peoples as he is not the only one relying on it. I won't go into details how he got it or how he use it because you've to see for yourself how nicely and believably they have translated the medicinal element into the story. My top 3 moments in the movie is when Bradley Cooper have the pill for first time and 2nd when he goes to his X brother in law's house and try to find it (it was heart pumping and I wanted him to find it before police come in) and my 3rd favorite moment was when Abbie Cornish goes her home to pick the pills and gets stock by a stalker and then she has to take a pill to save her life. That was just heart pumping. Loved it. Bradley Cooper certainly stole the show with his charming, powerful performance. I loved him in Alias and was extremely upset when he died. Now watching him again on big roles is really good though I thought he came off as cocky in The Hangover & especially A-Team. He was so good in the movie that even his cranky voice didn't bother me this time. Abbie Cornish is good though I still don't know why Hollywood is fascinated by her? It's just like I can never understand fascination with Sienna Miller. Robert De Niro is good in a supporting role.

"A movie that dares you to imagine by imagining it for you in limitless visual panache and dynamism- in other words, it's one heck of an electrifying thriller","Fact- we can only access 20 per cent of our brain. Is there a solution to this, you ask?Well, yes actually, there is a pill called NZT-48 that will allow you to access all of it.Question- would you take it? OK, maybe it's a bit of a stretch to ask you to imagine the implausible without first demonstrating the ""Limitless"" possibilities it unravels, so here's an example of what it can do.Before the pill, Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a blocked writer still finding the first words of his long-overdue novel. He is unshaven, lives in a shabby rented apartment in Chinatown, and has just been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish). Post-pill, Eddie finishes his book within four days, picks up several new languages- each one within three to four hours- and builds up a two million-dollar investment portfolio on Wall Street within two weeks.Wish-fulfilment for most perhaps, but you could very well live the dream. And you know what the best part about it is? It was all you in the end. Yes, you were the one who accomplished it all, not through cheating, but on tapping on the full spectrum of your own innate cognitive abilities. Now tell me you don't want a high like that? Am I overstating it? Nope, not at all.The caveat? Well, yes there's that. It's illegal you see, non-FDA approved, and may have side effects if you change the dosage you've been taking it at too quickly. There are also dependency issues, so once you start, you can't just quit it. Other than that, you just have to deal with the saturated colours around you, the tightened focus with which you view things, and the occasional time warps where you lose time and can't quite remember what just happened right before.If you need a visual demonstration of how this all feels, well look no further than director Neil Burger's enticing 105-min advertisement here. Burger may have taken the drug himself, for he shoots in the same adrenalized manner the pill is supposed to work, using endless forward- zoom effects and 360-degree panoramic spins. Combining a music-video style with some nifty CGI, the result is something that looks and feels so energetic that it matches the hyperactivity the drug is supposed to unleash, and makes for a uniquely trippy and mesmerising experience.Burger is complemented with smart witty lines from his writer Leslie Dixon, adapting the conceptual form from Alan Glynn's ""The Dark Fields"". Many of these lines she places in Eddie's head to be conveyed through his intermittent voice-over narration- crisp, sharp and not without an intelligent sense of humour. And what better way to get your adrenaline pumping and your mind working than to introduce a little danger, and then elevating the stakes?Yup, nothing like a bit of jeopardy to demonstrate the abilities your mind has when it comes to self-preservation, protecting itself and therefore you. A Russian loan shark (Andrew Howard), a couple of murders and a Wall Street tycoon who goes by the name Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) oughta do the job- so watch as Eddie works his way out of these spots of trouble, with NZT-48 helping him to think faster and better than his enemies.To make the deal even sweeter, how about throwing in the hunk from ""The Hangover"" to play Eddie? And guess what- if you don't already know, the dude can act, very well if I may add. Utterly convincing as the down- and-out writer at first, absolutely dashing and debonair as the NZT-ed version of Eddie- Cooper makes Eddie likable every step of the way, even if his character doesn't always deserve it. For some female beauty, how about the Australian actress Abbie Cornish, who bears more than a resemblance to fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman, and looks just as hot as she did in tights and stockings in the recent ""Sucker Punch""? As a bonus, you'll also get Robert De Niro, an acting luminary who twinkles with polished menace in his supporting role here.Now come on, you have got to admit that you're definitely intrigued by this point. Here's the thing, we forgot to add the word ""fiction"" right before the second paragraph from the top. There's no such thing as NZT- 48- it's all make-believe. But don't you wish there was really something out there that could allow you to tap on the ""Limitless"" possibilities inside your own mind? Well at least for now you'll just have to contend with the best approximation of that, and it's all right here within this Neil Burger film that you'll be wishing doesn't end. Indulge and enjoy it while it lasts- yes, you'll savour every minute of it.www.moviexclusive.com",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More plot holes than gruyere cheese,"Bradley Cooper is Eddie Morra, a sloppy loser with writer's block who, thanks to his ex-brother in law gets to try a miraculous drug called NZT that allows users to tap into their mental resources to the full.In mere days (kind of too fast) Eddie turns from loser to successful writer and then trader, making truckloads of money and stepping on a few toes.The catch is that the drug causes allegedly permanent mental and physical damages, as Eddie discovers a bit late in the day. Or does he?Having established that the drug is dangerous and Eddie may be its next victim, the plot proceeds to pull the rug out from under the audience's feet.Despite the fact that all users could ""expand"" their intelligence, Eddie seems to be the only one who understood how to tame the side effects and reap only the benefits.Does that mean that every other user was too stupid despite the brain enhancement or that the side effects weren't so bad anyway? And why Eddie doesn't help his ex wife who seemed in dire need of a friend? Did he actually kill the woman he had a fling with? Why he can't remember what happened in that case but remembers easily all the other violent episodes?Anyway, some of the special effects are good and the plot moves fast and unbridled towards the dissatisfactory but entertaining conclusion.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
High Potential Film but Ultimately Feels Directionless,"I was tempted to give this film a higher rating because I do think it's better than your average flick. It's a decent thriller but I think my problem is that I can't decide which of the handful of subplots is supposed to be our primary focus. The cast does a great job, but the story seems like it's being pulled in too many directions and, by the end, I'd didn't feel like I'd gotten a satisfying enough conclusion to any of them. Bradley Cooper (THE HANGOVER films, THE A-TEAM) is given a chance to headline his own film based on a novel from Irish author Alan Glynn. Cooper is an aspiring sci-fi writer who's hit rock bottom. He can't pay his rent and his girlfriend's leaving him. He's got a book contract, but he hasn't even brought himself to write a single word. Everything's looking down until his ex-brother-in-law shows up and introduces him to miracle designer drug NZT-48. Users begin to use their brain to the full potential and it's not long before Eddie Morra (Cooper) is using his new mental mastery to play the stock market and act as a consultant for a major business merger, but not without making a few enemies.LIMITLESS feels like a bunch of miniature related stories, all focused on the character of Eddie Morra, and all rolled into one film. There's Eddie's dependence on NZT-48. If he quits it outright, he'll die like others before him. There is Eddie's involvement in the Van Loon/Atwood merger. Then there's Eddie's failing relationship with his girlfriend Lindy and his involvement with Russian mobster Gennady, who has developed a taste of his own for NZT-48 and won't let Eddie cut him off. There's enough going on here that it probably could've been developed further into a possible television series. Instead he just bounces around between subplots until the end where everything is tied up loosely. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure which story was to be the primary and assumed it was his involvement with business mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). The movie's trailers certainly seemed to paint it that way for me. Instead, the merger is just something going on in the background while Eddie deals with the ever-growing threat of Gennady (Andrew Howard) until the eventual confrontation. I would've preferred if the movie focused on Eddie's meteoric rise in the business world and how he struggles to maintain his new life while fighting to overcome the possibly fatal effects on NZT-48.I'm always a sucker for a good science fiction film, and LIMITLESS sort of falls into that category with the development of this wonder drug that unlocks your brain's potential. I'm pretty sure the belief that we only use 10% of our brains has been proved wrong already, but I was willing to ignore that since the movie's premise is so appealing. Who wouldn't want a pill that can jack your brain into overdrive, turning you into the ultimate success? I thought Cooper did a great job here, going from disorganized failure to man of the year. I wished De Niro would've had a larger role in the film, perhaps catching on to Cooper's secret early and trying to play it against him. Unfortunately, we get only a tiny bit of that in the final act of the film and it never really gets a chance to get off the ground. I've never read Glynn's ""The Dark Fields"" on which this movie was based, but the movie's made me curious enough to pick it up in the future. There was a lot of potential in this movie and, while it was a fun movie, I just thought it didn't accomplish as much as it could've.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sometimes we need support until it we form a habit!,"This is typical scifi movie about superpowers. These superpowers are what everybody is interested in, and reason why movie is good.

But we do not need it forever, because later everything becomes a habit. Like a little bird learning to fly, it only needs its parents while it's still small.

Has an obvious infantile charm which is hard to resist,"Bradley Cooper plays a struggling, apathetic writer who suddenly gets his life on track and his creativity buzzing after being introduced to a new underground drug by his shady former brother-in-law. And not only that, he also becomes brilliant with numbers and irresistibly charming. Although this may seem like a fairly ridiculous premise, it has an obvious infantile charm which, when it's handled as cleverly and playfully as in Limitless, is hard to resist. The film follows some unnecessary and genre-typical paths (with keywords such as mobsters and Wall Street), but even though it's somewhat disappointing that a man who can basically do anything decides to put his mind to deciphering the stock market, instead of going for more creative or intrinsically valuable areas, the way the film portrays our protagonist's feeling of limitless possibilities and the experiences he has while on the drug - both positive and negative - is far from disappointing. Director Neil Burger certainly captures the spirit of the story, and Bradley Cooper's determined, multi-faceted performance makes us root for him far more than his endeavours and character probably warrants. Limitless is neither watertight nor groundbreaking, but it gets a lot of fun and astute observations out of an enticing concept.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Limitless (2011),"Limitless is the kind of film that asks you, what would you do in this far fetched but entertaining situation? Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Morra, a struggling writer that has been procrastinating for months. He stumbles across his ex-brother-in-law and is eventually offered a new kind of drug. This drug allows you to access every last part of your brain, allowing you to recall things you saw years ago, and just having the drive to succeed. You only have to hear things once for you to remember it. Of course it isn't all fun and games. Morra soon finds he is skipping large parts of his day, with no idea of what happened, and when he tries to lay off the drugs he becomes immensely sick. This is a story about trying to find an easy fix to life's problems. Morra could easily finish his book if he just encouraged himself to do so. His antics spin wildly out of control, and as others latch on to his secret he becomes wrapped up in a world of money, deception, sex and even murder. Limitless really wants you to think about its premise which it does so effectively. I also enjoyed the fact it didn't try and weigh itself down with scientific ""facts"". It just gives you the idea and you can except it or not. There did seem to be a push at the end to really make this more action packed than it needed to be, but this is the kind of clever science fiction that I like. Part Twilight Zone, and part real life.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Movie That Allows You to Imagine,"In 2014 I saw an extremely similar movie to this called ""Lucy"" starring Scarlett Johansson. It was about a woman who'd accidentally taken a drug that allowed her to use 100% of her brain. In ""Limitless"" Edward ""Eddie"" Morra (Bradley Cooper) voluntarily started taking a drug called NZT that allowed him to use 100% of his brain. The pill worked almost instantly and only lasted 24 hours so he had to take one a day in order to continue using that 100%. Eddie's actual quote was, ""A tablet a day and what I could do with my day became limitless."" He used the pill for everything anyone would use it for: finished writing his book, learned to play the piano, learned new languages, got girls, and made tons of dough. The immediate foreseeable problem were:1.) What happens when he runs out of the drug?2.) What were the side effects?The movie addressed both of these problems and a couple of more.A movie like ""Limitless"" is so engaging because it allows you to imagine, ""What would I do if I had access to such a drug?"" This is a ponderable issue that's better than the ""What would you do if you were rich?"" question. Eddie was the smartest guy in the room and, wisely or not, he showed it off every chance he got. Personally, I thought such behavior would invite a lot of unwanted and hard to avoid questions, but if your I. Q. is in the quadruple digits then maybe you already have answers for them.I thought the movie was well done. It was exciting, suspenseful, and best of all it was based upon a very intriguing premise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining popcorn fodder.,"Unfortunately, Limitless is largely just another run of the mill action-thriller. Although fortunately, and ironically, it knows its limits and does reasonably well inside of those confines. He may not stray too far from convention, however Burger adds enough of his own flair behind the camera – most notably the impressive ""speedy tunnel vision"" that shows how Eddie perceives the world whilst drugged up – to keep the energy pumping and give his fourth feature film a spark that smooths out a portion of the hiccups within the screenplay, of which there are a plethora.Adapted from Alan Glynn's novel ""The Dark Fields"" (cheekily used as the title of the book Eddie writes within the movie), veteran scribe Leslie Dixon can't find an even-handed tone and as a result the final act struggles to strike a chord. It's hard to understand what Dixon had intended for the audience to feel at the completion of her amorphous story; the climax is a bizarre non-event that leaves no real resolution. She should be praised for her well-rounded protagonist, though the supporting characters are underwritten with Cornish's girlfriend nondescript at best (makes me wonder what the Aussie actress saw in the role) and De Niro's business tycoon a mere cardboard cut out.I'm not surprised that Bradley Cooper has finally appeared in a bona fide leading role. After decent supporting turns in Yes Man and He's Just Not That Into You he graduated to co-lead star in The Hangover and The A-Team, both of which were highly entertaining and garnered Cooper plenty of attention, and now he's having a stab at A-list glory. If his work in Limitless is a forecast of things to come then the man who started his career on 'Sex and the City' should be around for a while yet, as he effortlessly fills the boots of man who is both an everyday bloke and anything but. He oozes a natural charisma that makes him instantly likable and balances the humour and seriousness deftly.Cooper's appeal and Burger's directorial flourishes keep things afloat and grant Limitless a life as entertaining popcorn fodder.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly good!,"I have to admit, when I saw the trailer for this movie I though it was going to be upsetting, like so many of the generic movies are these days, where a common, fictional idea is thrown into a boring and predictable plot (think ""Universal Remote"")To my surprise, the plot remained down to earth and entertaining. It is a real good example of what happens in real life, when someone comes across something of great power (or money), and how so many people will try to screw you over to obtain it. Also, there is a great side story which reflects everyones struggles to obtain and maintain a meaningful romantic relationship with someone, and the struggles people go through to become their ultimate, ideal image of themselves; while battling with greed and moral issues.The little tiff between McCormick, De Nero, and the foreign guy was a little tacky, it was by far not one of De Nero's best performances, but it was good enough to not be distracting.Other than that, all other aspects of the movie were very good. The visuals were perfection, and there were was a new effect that I've never seen in any other film (sort of like the Hitchcock effect on speed), which was pure visual bliss.Overall, a superb movie which I believe many will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"No depth, all entertainment","Of all the Twilight Zone-like movies released this year (the other ones being ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and ""Unknown Identity"") ""Limitless"" is probably the best - which doesn't say a lot. The movie has more than its share of problems.The original premise - a loser type of guy takes a drug that enables him to grow a 4-digit IQ, which makes him successful at first, but gets him into a lot of trouble soon - is kind of intriguing. Neil Burger moves the plot along quickly, Bradley Cooper is well-cast as the guy who turns into a yuppie with a slippery Tom Cruise winner smile. And Robert De Niro plays Robert De Niro.Storywise things don't make complete sense. For all his newly gained intelligence Cooper's character does oversee some important things and makes lots of stupid mistakes. Some plot strings like a dubious murder or whole characters just seem to get forgotten about entirely, like the movie had undergone some re-writes and re-cuts.Maybe even more bothersome is the fact, that ""Limitless"" had the potential of raising some highly philosophical questions, but limits itself (no pun intended) to just a bland story of a guy using his intelligence to make lots of money. The movie's morals are rather questionable that way. It seems like we are supposed to identify with this guy, who's really just power hungry egomaniac.Somehow, you can ignore all that though, because ""Limitless"" moves along so quickly that it never falls apart completely, as it would have in the hands of someone like Michael Bay. Sure, if you want depth or at least some kind of cheap popcorn movie moral, even a lackluster film such as ""The Devil's Advocate"" does a better job.

"An exciting mystery thriller, with a loser rising to fame & fortune using super drugs","Limitless is about a loser named Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who's life is going nowhere.

But then he runs into an old friend who likes him to try a new drug that grant's access to 100% of a persons brain. Eddie is very skeptic but decides to give it a shot because he has nothing to loose. The effect of the drug is immensely powerful: Eddie finishes his manuscript in one sitting, cleans his whole house and picks up a girl in the hallway because he knows exactly what to say. But when the drug wears off, he immediately is his old self again. So he decides to look up his old friend to get some more pills, but then the story takes a turn because he founds out that his old friend has just been murdered in his apartment. It seems Eddie is not the only one interested in the powerful drugs..The story of Limitless is told in a 'mysterious thriller' way that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole 105 minutes that it runs. It is told from the perspective of Eddie so in the beginning your as clueless as he is but more information is revealed as the movie moves on. There are some nice twists on the ride and the ending is very satisfying.The effects in the movie are also nicely done. When Eddie is high on the pills, the whole movie 'lights up' by using brighter colors so the whole world looks more beautiful. The way Eddie looses track of time and no longer feels in control is also greatly done and reminds me of Requiem for a Dream.The cast also did a great job. Bradley Cooper is excellent as well as the supporting characters Robert De Niro (as the wealthy businessman Carl van Loon), Abbie Cornish (Eddie's on-off again girlfriend) and Andrew Howard as the criminal who lends Eddie money.What I didn't like from the money is that some parts of the movie feel disconnected from each other. The transition form Eddie as the no-life writer to his rise to fame goes a little to fast for me.

A Great Movie that missed satisfaction,"As a review I would start with the filming. It was great New York City all over. And that's good. Pasting the city scape into the movie was done well - as if the editor knew the city well. And I like that. Casting was OK and did not reach too far into the Toy world of greed and money, but instead used the filming to tell the story without Glitz and Glamour to prove the point of the story. Music was OK without adding pop or street crawl. It was good and basic background music that fit, as I said, OK. The writing was great as far as it went. Perhaps I just needed More !! And a sequel just may be the answer. I can't see a series erupting from this - but a sequel could move into other realms of the Sci-Fi world's movie stories. Much like Michael Caine's ""Harry"" moved through time and space - so could ""Limitless."" There was a terrible amount of holes to be filled throughout the movie as the end came near. And then the ending of the story. It was like an Aesop's Fable with someone telling you the moral of the story instead of it spinning in your own mind. That leaves too many questions, loopholes, and a scenario that yearns for a sequel just to see the final ending. It is an 'almost' great movie only lacking in answers. Everyone played their part well - from the filming, casting, crew, writers, actors, etc. Something is missing. . . And I hate to see DeNiro not finish something once he has taken the Pill of Success.I give this movie a 7 out of 10. I could see another production easily raising that much higher. But we know that won't happen in this world of Copyrights. My biggest problem (and please forgive me for this fault I have always had) is that this movie like so many other good but not great movies end too quickly without giving me satisfaction. Perhaps this should have been a Mini Series expanding on all the aspects of the characters much deeper - expanding outside of Downtown Manhattan - expanding the plot longer for each change and outcome of situations.

Good plot development,"Limitless isn't a common great circuit film, at the same time isn't a movie that offers great information or a grand moral to make people think about life or something, but it is a daring movie that shows the drugs from a different point of view.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer in creative crisis who discovers a miracle pill that can increase brain synapses and give access to all information acquired since childhood that are stored in the sub-conscious, also increasing the learning curve and the logical reasoning. So, Eddie gets out of his hole that was getting deeper and deeper to a surface of ​​success, fame, power and money. The film shows the ups and downs given by the drug, but unlike movies like Trainspotting (1996), Requien For A Dream (2000), Enter The Void (2009), among several other titles that deal with drug abuse as something extremely harmful and destructive, Limitless tries to make the reverse curve and instead of leaving us depressed as the other titles do, this one let us excited about how far the character can get.The film has a great plot development and a direction that works in all aspects. Again the edition and the soundtrack gives the hallucinogenic elements that offer the ecstasy and anguish of the character without seeming pushed or overdone. Everything in the film is used sparingly. Who would imagine that Bradley Cooper would come out from a show like Alias (2001) to become one of the new stars of this decade? Besides acting convincingly, Bradley also is the executive producer, which is surprising because it shows that besides knowing how to choose great money machines he also knows how to pick a great movie not only to act but also to produce.Limitless is undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2011 and one of the few which deserved its success, although it will probably not be remembered in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Imagine being as smart as the CSI guys at the last 5 minutes of the ep - only All. The. Time!,"Even the most brilliant and open minded among us can only utilise 20% of our brain's capacity – which explains the continued box-office success of Zack Snyder movies like Sucker Punch. When an author battling crippling writer's block named Eddie (Bradley Cooper) is introduced to an experimental drug called NZT which unlocks the remaining 80-odd he immediately begins operating at a Stephen Hawking like level of intelligence, only with the networking skills of a sports commentator and the sense of omnipotence of a young Kanye West.Cooper is dressed down to highlight just how ordinary he is (and still comes across as a solid 8.5 to my wife). In the early goings it is made clear that while he is a smart man, in the words of dozens of my report cards 'he could do better if he wasn't so easily distracted'.His book deal is in place but is in peril due to his inability to even begin putting his ideas on paper, and this lack of mental traction has caused his ex-girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) to give up on him. Once NZT falls into his hands and more importantly his bloodstream he straightens up and flies straight instantly. The confusing is child's play to Eddie and he is able to logically work towards solutions at a last 5 minutes of a CSI episode level.Only All the Time! In the days and weeks following Eddie uses his newfound powers as we all would, to gain unfair advantage and to tag unsuspecting women, most notably getting Lindy back thanks to his new get up and go attitude. He is able to master foreign languages and complicated problems in quick time, becoming a go-getting, all answering master of logic. And the guy you want to be around and have on your side.After he works his magic on the stock market and using loan shark money he turns a mere 5 figures into millions in a precious few days Eddie brings the attention of the media, which in turn brings him onto the radar of a Bill Gates via Trump type named Van Loon (Robert De Niro, low key for a change).Unfortunately Eddie's newfound renown and success bring the more nefarious attention of the opportunistic, the greasy loan shark knows something is up and it seems Eddie is being constantly followed. Upon wowing Van Loon with his first meeting he starts upping the dose to remain on top, hires a crack security team to protect him and sets researchers on the trail of replicating what is becoming a diminishing supply of smart pills, pills that seem to have unforeseen negative implications to offset their obvious pluses.Limitless might not be all that great but for a wide release film it sure is ambitious and different, something that can't honestly be said that often lately. Cooper navigates the tenuous tightrope of believability reasonably well and Abbie Cornish is already forging a solid career of her own as a credible supporting actor.After the premise is established and the major characters revealed Limitless loses its way somewhat in the middle section and contains a sequence that could best be described as bafflingly ridiculous. This is partially redeemed by a solid final third with a couple of notable sequences, the more memorable being Eddie's unsavoury thirst for knowledgeFinal Rating – 7 / 10. In the film Eddie faces the choice between remaining ever-ordinary or being momentarily awesome! The film itself might not reach those spectacular heights but at least it had a crack at glory rather than settling for the usual mediocrity.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mostly OK. Read a sample of the 2-9 star reviews to get a real idea of this film,"There are enough reviews on here already, many of which rightly say this is a (a)(mostly) well made film with (b)(mostly) good acting, but suffers from a (c)(mostly) weak plot, has (d)(mostly) unnecessary digital imagery, (e)(mostly) questionable motives (f)(mostly) confused message. The film (g)(mostly)passes the time, but (h)(mostly) we have better things to do. There are many films that address this sort of thing in a much better way, even Jumper tackles the 'what if' better than this. Immediately after seeing the film I did wonder if the usual alternative endings were tested and this was chosen because it was upbeat, despite ultimately being wholly unbelievable. The problem is, just because the main character does what he does, the drug is still available to others, perhaps especially the character played by Bobby De Nero, who would be making sure those working for him used it. This would give them the edge to bring down the main character.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Limitless' structure may be a bit atypical, but its journey is extremely entertaining.","Limitless' structure may be a bit atypical, but its journey is extremely entertaining.Bradley Cooper plays Eddie, a broke and struggling writer who spends his days staring at a computer screen without accomplishing a single written word. After being dumped by the love of his life Lindy, played by Abby Cornish for basically being a loser, Eddie runs into his Ex-Brother in law Vernon dressed in some very expensive looking designer clothes.The two decide to catch up at a bar where Vernon, feeling sorry for Eddie decides to give him a hit of the newest drug he's been peddling, NZT. NZT is apparently a drug soon to be released on the market that lets your brain work at a super human level. On NZT your deductive faculties surpass that of Sherlock Holmes and your amped learning curve allows you to learn a language simply by listening.With nothing to lose Eddie pops the pill and in one day he is able to seduce his land lord's wife and brilliantly finish a draft to his book. After experiencing life on NZT Eddie immediately comes begging for more but before he can reach some sort of deal with Vernon Eddie finds that Vernon has been put outta the picture.Searching Vernon's apartment he finds a stash of NZT and within days transforms himself into the smartest and most charismatic man on the planet. With these new powers Eddie decides he can the change entire world but needs money in order to do it. So he takes a loan with an very unscrupulous Russian loan shark and starts playing the stock market. Eddie does so well on the market that he entices the eyes one of the most powerful business men in the world, Carl Van Loon, played by Robert De Niro.The rest of the movie is a thrilling adventure with numerous character all trying extract something from Cooper, whether it's his skills on the market or his access to NZT. Cooper also has to deal with some of the territory that comes with a drug habit, including dependency and side effects.Limitless uses some very nice special effects to show the effects of NZT by playing with lens and color. When he's not on NZT the film is sucked of its color and the world becomes noticeably dimmer than the golden fast tracked life of ""NZT Eddie"". The sound design is also splendidly done as while on NZT the film focuses on singular sounds like the rotating of a bicycle wheel.The plot moves extremely fast with new characters and problems appearing one after another. This breakneck speed is fun to watch, but on the other hand, if you don't keep up you're going to be asking your friends how does ""that"" connects to ""this"". The film doesn't coddle you with character dialogue blatantly explaining every connection. Nor does it give you much room to breathe and connect every single dot, most people will have to do that after the film is finished. I watched the film twice by happenstance and thoroughly enjoyed Limitless just as much if not more the 2nd go around.Bradley Cooper is a up and coming super star and in this film you not only see that he has range but that your eyes are glued to his every move. Andrew Howard plays a really good Russian bad guy and was quiet fun to watch, even if his role leans a little stereotypical. Abbie Cornish was also fairly good. De Niro played a very good upscale businessman but I felt was under utilized. Carl Van Loon is supposed to be an intimidating veteran of the game whose experience puts him at a level capable of threatening Eddie, but he never really lives up to that role.*Filmmakers Note - When introducing a character such as De Niro that is supposed to be ""the man who owns half on New York"" don't have the first shot we see of him be a wide shot of him walking up stairs. Filmmaking 101, use low angles to give characters power, use high angless to lower power.All in all this film is a blast. Every person who's ever felt lazy and wanted to be a better version of himself - motivated, charismatic, and intelligent will love this movie. For people who've gotten there the hard way, their mindset might take issue with this film.Who this film is not for: -Neuroscientists who cringe at the saying ""we only use 10% of our brains"" who also can't get beyond the sci-finess and exaggeration of the premise (it can get a little ridiculous) -Extremely moralistic people who believe there are no short cuts in this world and that if you take drugs you don't deserve anything.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Thrilling Exploration of Potential,"This film captivates with its thrilling premise of unlocking the full capacity of the human brain. Bradley Cooper delivers a compelling performance as Eddie Morra, a struggling writer who discovers a mysterious drug that dramatically enhances his cognitive abilities. The concept of tapping into untapped potential is both intriguing and thought-provoking.The pacing keeps you engaged, with plenty of twists and turns that maintain suspense throughout. The visual effects effectively portray Eddie's heightened abilities, creating an immersive experience. Robert De Niro adds weight to the story as a powerful investor, providing a strong dynamic with Eddie.However, while the film is entertaining, it occasionally veers into predictable territory, especially in the second half. Some plot points feel rushed, and the resolution could have been more satisfying. Despite these minor flaws, it successfully combines action, drama, and a touch of science fiction, making it an enjoyable watch that prompts reflection on the limits of human potential and the price of ambition.Overall, this is a thought-provoking and exciting film that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

"Intriguing advertising campaign, dull movie","Eddie Morra is an unsuccessful writer who suffers from never-ending misfortunes. One day, he meets a drug dealer who sells him a top-secret drug which bestows him with super human abilities. And he is soon to find out that ""with the power comes great responsibility""This movie made a buzz in 2011 when it launched provocative and smart advertising campaign, which featured a guy hacking into the screens on the Time Square in New York. That was brilliant move, fresh and interesting, and it is probably the only thing which is good about this movie.It should have been called Brainless. Yes, to hope that this movie would be smart and brainpower-demanding would have been completely unreasonable. After all, from the first frames of the trailer you could guess that this is yet another pop-corn action about difficult life of people with superpowers. However, even these low expectations did not save me from brutal truth: you have to turn your brains off to watch this movie.The whole topic of the super-drug and super-powers is so over-used, that to come up with something new is virtually impossible – probably this is the reason why authors took the book ""The Dark Fields"" as their inspiration. I can only hope that the book is better than this boring, dull and silly movie. There is no intrigue; all the turns of the plots are easily foreseen. Authors try to include more characters, but this starts to look like a plaster on the gaping hole when you realise how underdeveloped and, again, brainless all the other characters are. The tricks with the camera are fun the first time you see them, but start to really annoy for the fourth-fifth time. The trick when the whole world gains colors when the characters take the pills is old as the movies about pills, but still nicely done and pleasure to watch. This, however, cannot be said about camera riding through the streets and tilting sideways from time to time.Most of the actors look like they don't understand what is going on in the movie. Abbie Cornish, who plays Lindy, looks lost all the time. It seems like actors saw the screenplay only on the film set, and were asked to improvise. I have to say though that Robert De Niro as Carl Van Loon is absolutely organic and convincing. He is not trying to impress us with his acting abilities, but he is just doing his job, calmly and impressively.It seems to me that this movie was designed for insecure people, non-achievers, humble dreamers who just want to see what the life could turn into when you get the super-pill and superpower to make your dreams come true. It is brainless popcorn movie like the third Transformers, but without Transformers and with drugs and sex. Given the fact that 2011 was rich with fantastic movie titles, I would not recommend wasting one's time on the Limitless.VERDICT: Dull and boring movie with nice advertising campaign WATCH: anything elsem-picturegoer.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An entertaining ride with delightfully disorienting visuals,"Limitless is fun. The premise is pretty ridiculous, but it's an entertaining ride with delightfully disorienting visuals.

Limitless,"""Limitless is an excellent representative of the pseudo-science fiction genre. It tells the story of a down-and-out writer who becomes a wealthy Wall Street investor thanks to brain-stimulant pills. In parallel, he learns about the side effects and faces the choice of when to stop.The director has done a great job trying to show the effects of the stimulant.The technical choices are interesting, it's as if the director is talking to us through them. The action of the pills is transmitted through the expanding screen, not a single detail escapes the viewer, we feel the stimulant in our blood, and our heart pumps it faster.At the same time, the action blends favorably with some of the measured plot characteristic of Glynn's novels. True, there were some disappointments here, too. It's odd to see the film veer from a picture about the evils of drugs to a hilarious one about a genius con man. And there aren't many truly brilliant plot decisions. Aside from the harms of drugs, it raises an important question - many people know about it, but does everyone do it? Some people think they are good on their own and don't take those pills, to me they are cuter than the main character, but when he is on a stimulant it is impossible to compete with him.The pluses of the film are Robert De Niro as a man who looks like Warren Buffett. It's nice that audiences are always happy to see this great actor on movie screens. Also a plus is the fact that this is a movie adaptation of a novel, which puts its own spin on the viewing experience. Of particular note is the progress of Bradley Cooper, who portrayed the anguish of a failed writer and an adventurous self-assured successful businessman in one film in an extremely believable way. The musical accompaniment blends perfectly with the picture and creates the right mood.The movie is excellent for a date, because it raises a lot of topics for discussion, but the film is not heavy-handed as there are no moral preaching and it gives the effect of a light movie - it refreshes, tones up and leaves a pleasant feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Very very average,"This movie didn't meet my expectations in any way.

Did he do all this stuff because he HAD to use all this new energy or he had some overall goal that was important for him? The movie fails to clarify this.Two things that were fun though. 1. Cooper is a good actor. It was fun how they used the color of his eyes to stress his ""condition"". 2. The girlfriend chasing scene where she has to take the drug to escape.

"I was blind, but now I see","I know that the idea of our mind only working on 10% is just a myth, and scientists proved that it's all 100% instead of 10. But considering the fact that this a sci-fi movie, I can forgive it. Not only that, but it's surprisingly great!The movie tells a story about Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a writer who still can't think of an idea for his book that he wants to publish. His life wasn't that good, his girlfriend broke up and at this point he's depressed. But not until his ex brother-in-law Verne gave him a NZT pill, that allows the brain work faster than ever. He could finish the book in just 4 days, get the best job in town and have a lot of friends. But there is a man in coat that wants NZT as well. I've noticed that everytime Eddie takes the pill, the world around him becomes brighter (both literally and figuratively). However, like with every other super ability, there's always consequences. In this case, most people who took NZT were either hospitalized or dead and Eddie notices that he had a sudden memory loss, thus making him worried. On one special day, when Eddie has to do an interview with Carl Van Loon, he realised that he ran out of pills. But he doesn't even know where to get more because something bad happened to Verne. Not only that, but he also heard that the police accused him of killing a woman that he slept with in a hotel, even though he doesn't remember that. I'll admit, I didn't expect this movie to be this engaging and enjoyable! The acting is brilliant. From Bradley Cooper to Robert de Niro, everyone felt like they were a part of this story, they felt so alive. It was filmed well too. We see a lot of cityscapes, since the movie is mostly set in New York (which is one of the most popular cities of the world). Even if this city is overused, it's not shown in a cliche way like showing the statue of liberty all the time, and mostly shows either business buildings or small streets. I really liked this movie!

He can't get past the first page of his book and his girlfriend and meal ticket has just walked out on him. He runs into a shady of character former brother in law on the street who turns him on to a super brain steroid. The initial results are more than promising as he writes 40 pages of his book and screws his landlady. Clearly he has to have more of this stuff.

Eddie is soon wheeling and dealing ten to twenty steps ahead of his competitors and a hot property to land in the world of big business. He is dogged however by some pretty tough cookies who want in on the miracle drug.Narrated in the first person of the protagonist Eddie (Bradley Cooper) at first is a benign though self destructive Lubowski type who morphs into a smug Wall St. wizard creep before circumstance overtakes him and blood begins to flow and the film's minimal credulity flies out the window. Cooper does a fine job of carrying the film convincingly moving from Jekyl to Hyde as he trips his brain fantastic but director Burger is intent on making him an unrepentant super hero and the sublime early visuals soon become absurd posturing on a parallel planet, Eddie's World, which like this film is as barren as the moon.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What is really an impressive characteristic, since 90% of the movies from 2011 suck at this point, really suck, and I've watched lots of them.Of course, you can't stop thinking about Phenomenon (1996) when watching Limitless (if you've had watched phenomenon), but actually, the similarities are only the ""1000 QI points"", because intelligence here is treated in a different way. It's more about ""what will I do now to get more money?"" and not like ""oh, I'm super smart, now I can't stand a relationship"". Eddie is, actually, even more brilliant!Limitless is really one of the most exciting 2011 movies I've watched. It's dynamic, and didn't let me down any of his acts. Fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting film,This film has a very interesting concept about what would happen if you took a drug that would let you use 100% of your brain. I think Bradley Cooper does a great performance as Eddie who takes the drug. I think this is a pretty good film and it's a good watch for the evening.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Off Kilter,"I like the special effect zooming scenes, but the plot was very week. Let me see, if I became super smart what would I do? I would finish my book and try to make as much money as I can. Oh yea, and I would not think of ""how do I make this drug?"" until I was in a stupid state; WTF- he had to be off the drug to think of that? There was not even the slightest hint that he would use his super intelligence to better mankind. I do not know about most people, but things like this made me think the movie to be totally stupid and child like...very ridiculous. And if someone can quintuple their money four days in a row,WHY ONE EARTH would he need to borrow $100,000? I believe he said ""quintuple every day for the last 4 days"". Let me see, starting out with $800, would that not put him right at $100,000 already? WHY! on earth would he need to borrow money from the mob. And if he did borrow it and was super smart, why would he then not repay the loan on time. (kind of stupid don't you think) This makes no sense what so ever.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of my favorite movies,"""Limitless"" sends an amazing and positive message. The message is that we all have unbelievable potential hidden within us that is just waiting to be released. But we have to learn how to harness, control and use our vast intellectual potential. The movie was suspenseful, exciting and unpredictable but in a good way. The acting was excellent and believable and the plot was intriguing and creative. The cast matched the roles perfectly and I enjoyed the sets, scenery and style of filming. I have watched this movie multiple times and enjoyed it every time. It is very hard to talk about this movie without giving away the plot so let me just leave you with this: If you like movies that are interesting, inspirational and well executed then I suggest you watch, ""Limitless.""",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good movie but had some plot problems,"I loved this movie, i think it had a very good idea behind it but there are some plot problems. overall i think it was a good movie, the idea that someone had invented a designer drug which would turn a person into a super smart brain child is a good one. the idea of a down on his luck loser writer, happens to run into an ex-brother-in-law who just happened to be a drug dealer was kinda out there but believable enough. then you have to add the element of the star always in danger, that keeps the audience wondering what was going to happen. the ending was kinda out there too, but all in all, it was a good movie to watch. i liked the idea of the movie and enjoyed it very much. it was a fun movie with a feel good ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but not Great,"The premise of Limitless is highly intriguing and the casting of Bradley Cooper in the lead role makes us hard to look away from the screen. The charismatic Cooper carries the movie on his shoulders as he inhabits his character perfectly and makes the movie a treat to watch. On receiving a mysterious drug which supposedly allows an individual to access 100 percent of his brain, Bradley Cooper's character is able to complete a novel in 4 days by taking this wonder pill. As his ambitiousness grows, he decides to use his deductive skills to make some quick money in the stock market. Even though the effects of the drug made a remarkable turnaround in his life, its side-effects were starting to show up which happened on withdrawal of the drug. The flaw in this movie is that a lot of action seems to happen at a convenient time and it seems a little unrealistic. Also, at the end we do not know the whereabouts of the people in his home. The movie was a decent one but do not have exceedingly high expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better went to sleep in (real) bed,"I saw that film till the very end. I'd better go to sleep before it starts. But I was prepared for the worse and I had some time to be spent somehow. Well, if i didn't saw it, it was exactly the same but now I'm writing this review.I think it have to be some kind of autobiography or maybe hyper autobiography if such a genre exists. The movie is made to be sold and probably it was sold well exactly like the protagonist would do. So, I'll suspect, it'll be continued: the Eddie becomes a president (of USA of course) but wants to rule the world. The drug has transformed him to some kind of alien. At the very end of part two (I don't expect there would be part three) he'll meet her father who is the drug's inventor, but remember their old farm in Alabama. A final Oedipus dialog explain everything already happened.What did disturb me? If all that should be true, the rest lacks elementary logic. The drug increases the brain power to the 100%, not more (so was at least said, but very soon forgotten), but 100% endless stupidity is like 20% stupidity and even 0,1% stupidity, it's mathematics.But what did disturb me at most was that if someone should be so clever why should (s)he use her/his abilities to make (much) money? That's a really dangerous propaganda! And amoral message to the potential audience which is, I suppose, rather young. Why didn't use the supernatural abilities to teach the others being happier and possibly cleverer?Or maybe I am just the most stupid one because I can not steal money and goods from the others?I gave it 5, because visually it was not so bad and story was fluently narrated. I'd like however that those qualities was used for something more useful, though.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining with lots of momentum,"I cant say that I would watch any other films by this director, or see any other Bradley Cooper films - but here together they make a great team, in a stunning movie. From the opening scene this film storms along like a juggernaut, never really slowing down. the directorial tricks are really impressive - especially the change in the colour palette when the drug kicks in, and the never-ending zoom shots (they are really something).

Limitless doesn't focus on the moral responsibility that comes with great power. With the exception of a few people almost all the characters are sketchy people.The directing style is cool and stylish. The choice of music is perfect for the different moods of the movie.

"the "" Magic Pill "" ..","In my line of work, I see a lot of people complaining of poor memory, low energy, inattention, poor concentration, etc.. And some of these people come to me and ask for some sort of "" pill "" to cure some or all of those symptoms, we in the medical field call such a fantasy pill, the Magic pill, that can magically treat and cure all these problems. I always reply to my clients, unfortunately, no such pill exists. the concept of this movie is just that, about that Magical pill, and what if it does exist, what would happen ?This is all I'm going to say about the plot, because I maintain the idea that giving so much about movie plots could ruin them.Let me go straight to answer the question that brought you here in the first place, should you see this movie or not ? the answer is : YES ! I highly recommend this, the execution of this "" Magic pill "" idea was brilliant here, the direction and cinematography were top notch, and I was surprised by Bradly Cooper's performance, it seems he is slowly improving and making a big name for himself in the entertainment business.I am a big fan of De niro, so it was one of the main reasons i went to see this, however, his role was relatively small here, and the real star is Cooper.the story moves in a very good pace, does not slow down or feel dull at any point. and there is also some cool action added to the mix making it a real joy.So there you go, stop reading other reviews about Limitless and just head to the theater and watch it this weekend, it is Awesome !!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

one of the better movies I've seen in a while,"I remember seeing this in theaters and really enjoyed it, unlike a lot of movies I've come to revisit this movie holds up surprisingly well. The comparison I keep making is to the extremely over rated movie ""Fight Club"" with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. However this movie is done in such a way with a far superior lead actor and directorr who get it. The premise is so simple but how they handle it you can tell a lot of thought was put into this.The lead actor is relatable. He's not trying to be cool, funny and certainly doesn't come off as obnoxious or lame. This role suits Bradley Cooper so well. I like a lot more than the Hangover movies. As the movie progresses you feel like you're him, you root for him as if it's you. You watch him grow as a person, gaining confidence which is possibly the Fight Club reference to taking command and doing it so well. I'm sure many of us would have done the same with this new found power. The bad guy in this movie is believable as well, he's not over the top but you can absolutely see someone like him as a loan shark who is capable of what he does in the movie. Robert De Niro I usually don't care for and, yes, I've seen Goodfellas and Heat (1995 with Al Pacino), he's not that great of an actor but he played his role well as a Wallstreet executive who people fear and would absolutely treat people the way he does.Why not a perfect 10? I didn't think he had anywhere near enough pills to make the last half of the movie work. In particular there was a scene where he even said to a guy when it felt like he had very few pills left that he'd be able to survive long enough after he paid the chemist to reverse engineer and make the new batch of pills. That and the fight scene in the penthouse, though it kind of worked and the actors are far from action movie stars and kung fu masters but that was the only two things I didn't care for. Either way I'd absolutely watch it again if friends were over.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It moves so fast if you stop to think you lose the game big time!,"Limitless is a well crafted scientific crime thriller with a super velocity execution. Starting from the opening titles it will grab you in to a world where natural minds status of sanity continuously collides with a supernatural mind state which is dangerously close to insanity.Eddie Morra is a broken down writer with empty bank account and a regrettable past. While he is trying to get back in track with a book deal he recently got, he struggles to come up with new ideas until he coincidently meet his ex-brother-in-law Vernon. After taking a pill given by Vernon, Eddie's life starts to change in lightning speed. The drugs accelerates Eddie's brain power and improves everything he puts his mind in to. After completing a half of his new book over night Eddie goes back to Vernon asking for another does. After finding Vernon's dead body in his apartment Eddie realize that he has become a part of a deadly game and this drug is his only savior. Armed with a full doze of drugs Eddie steps out to conquer the corporate world. With many enemies trying to grab a piece of his secret Eddie jumps up the ladder and enter new heights while playing the cat and mouse game of his life.The script of Limitless is filled with near impossible scenarios, starting from the miraculous brain performance enhancing drug. BUT the mere executions of this plot is simply worth seeing. Embedded with unique computer graphics and cinematography the movie will squeeze in to the viewers mind and drags him along the joy ride just as Eddie experience it. In one scene where Eddie goes on a total 18 hour blackout and suddenly comes back to reality, it feels as if it actually happened to you.

"Great concept, poorly executed","If the writers had really thought things through, this could have been a really good science fiction movie.However, they didn't. No matter how smart a person is, they only have so much time. Learning an entire language takes time, no matter how smart you are, for example. Learning enough to do huge multi-national business deals requires KNOWLEDGE, not just smarts. And it isn't knowledge anyone has time to get in a month or two.This was a poorly-thought-out fantasy. Could have been a really good science fiction movie if they'd spread out the timeline. Not sure why writer don't actually sit down and think a bit before writing.

Trippy,"I interpreted this movie as a warning against relying on drugs to build yourself up. When the high ends everything you built while on the drugs could come crashing down. In real life we don't often think about the repercussions of socially accepted drugs like caffeine or the number of other nootropics purported to benefit cognition in some way, but the side effects still exist. We take for granted the surge of energy until its gone and then we're worse off than when we began.This movie deserves a high score for its special effects alone and the sheer amount of action packed in. The acting is top notch with Bradley Cooper leading the charge and he exudes the perfect amount of charisma and suave arrogance to pull off his character. I especially enjoyed the scenes that would blur as the drug lost effect. They almost resemble the way streets blur on Google Earth street mode as you're travelling. So trippy and so cool.I found the concept original and I was never really bored at any point, nor was there anything that really offended me. The jet setting lifestyle of the elite is portrayed here and I found it interesting to observe the luxury real estate and vacation spots that were on show. It's fun to fantasize about the same trajectory within your own life - going from an unemployed loser barely hanging on by a thread to someone with enormous power and wealth. It's something a lot of us have probably dreamt about at one point or another.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bradley Cooper became Eddie Morra in this movie - completely bought in to the character's transformation. My only beef would be that with it's PG13 rating.

"Nice idea, crappy logic","I loved the idea. I loved the cool and sexy visuals. I thought I was going to really enjoy it as it got started and we see the effects of this wonder drug. But then the wheels fell off. This guy has discovered that he can write bestseller books in a few days. He finds that he can double his money on the stock market in a matter of hours. So, what does he do? Well of course he gets into debt with the Russian mafia. What? Why the f would he do that? Ever hear of the chessboard and the grains of wheat trick? You put one the first square, then double that on the second , and again on the third. You can't get to the last square, because there isn't that much wheat in the world. Exponential growth soon leads to astronomical numbers. This guy just needs to keep doing what he is doing for a couple of weeks and he will be the richest man on Earth. In his meeting with the bigshot financier, his friend says that he has turned 12 thousand dollars into 1.2 million in ten days. OK Well if he does that for another 20 days he will have 83 trillion dollars. Why is he going cap in hand to some wall st. guy? Lastly - there is no doubt that super intelligence would have many advantages, but being a lethal street fighter would not be one of them. Fighting is about millisecond reflexes and trained reactions that have nothing to do with conscious thought. His wonder drug would not give him such abilities. So. Terrible failure of the writers to really explore an interesting idea. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well-written and thrillingly acted.,"One of the most endearing surprises of the year. What this film does is take an original premise, and turns it on it's head in ways I never thought possible. I enjoyed this flick from the opening scenes which let's the audience(finally) to get into the main character's head and strangely enough, we end up rooting for him as his life is constantly in danger from unknown assailants and to a greater extent, himself. That's what makes the narrative arc of this film so compelling. The drug itself is simple yet detailed enough to be explained to any interested viewer. On top of that, what makes this film so refreshing is that there's no huge explosions and gratuitous sex scenes that are so prevalent in Hollywood films. In fact this film is almost an anti-Hollywood film and that in this day and age is a MAJOR plus. If you want to see a well-written and thrillingly acted film, see ""Limitless"".

Bradley Cooper is doing a mediocre performance in this action-drama-thriller-esque film. The movie, after briefly telling about some facts about how the brain works, continue on with a thin plot and a repeating story, with no interesting character development or any plot twists that keep you interested. The script is downright boring hard to believe to the slightest degree, with some few exceptions. Mediocre at best, the movie continues down a straight line that ends not only making you feel disappointed, but that you've also wasted 1 hr 49 min that you could have used to watch a meaningful or provocative movie instead. Watch it if you're looking for some entertainment, but please, don't expect either a good script or good performances from either Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro (latter which single handedly saves this movie from being utter garbage while not actually doing that good of a performance himself).Tl;dr: Expect nothing and get nothing.

Robert De Niro's presence adds some gravity to the production but there really isn't much for him to do with his character, so even he can't rescue this pretty looking failure from itself.

Fun but deceptive,"I appreciate a good motivational speech. I also appreciate the success driven ideologies North American society has taken in younger generations; I think it's a quality often overlooked.Then there are societal issues that are real life problems this movie only manages to exhibit and encourage.To begin with the movie was fun and entertaining. Nobody enjoys Bradley Cooper more than when he's a sad underdog with a soon-to-be new outlook on life. Very decent acting. Enjoyed the screenplay. Story was interesting. Robert De Niro was in it. Brought attention to the stock market and to business. What could be wrong with that?The idea that fame and fortune is ENTIRELY luck based, which it's not (entirely). The idea that dirty business is only the practice of old, old fashioned men. We all of course know it's not. Robert De Niro was made a fool. I didn't personally enjoy that. The idea that by participating in politics can somehow change the world for the better. The message of ,""If you're not extroverted you're probably too stupid to socialize"" was made apparent in the first fine minutes which is excessively offensive and harmful to a society that relies heavily on often (but not always) introverted tech. geniuses. Another message I got from this movie is, ""If you're addicted to drugs, don't worry. You can get off it as soon as you become rich.""The list goes on of how this movie could've easily been taken too seriously and a bit discouraging.There are points that I did appreciate and felt were on some level, realistic enough to relate to. There's a very fine line between illegal and legal business practice, and it's not always obvious. Politics and business are very close relatives. If you're not successful with what you thought was your calling, perhaps it's not your calling. Sometimes it takes an altered mindset to find and get what you want. Don't give up.

Limitless Potential and This is it,"""Limitless"" has a really cool premise. It is a concept that I'm sure we've all thought about before. Eddie Morra, played by Bradley Cooper, is a struggling writer. That all changes when he gets a pill that unlocks his full potential and gives him perfect recall.
