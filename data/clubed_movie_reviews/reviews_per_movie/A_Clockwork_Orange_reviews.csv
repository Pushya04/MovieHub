"Brilliant, stunning and disturbingly entertaining","Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent ""reformation"" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever.While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied.Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies.A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great Piece of Art,"I would say that the movie is really a gem of an art piece. The use of excellent imagery coupled with pretty out-of-the-place background score tells us about the uniqueness of this movie. Stanley Kubrick has really applied a lot of thought into this.The director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer's emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.Another glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and ""programmed"" to choose only good, he wasn't accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word ""Ourange"" that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.The artificiality in dialogues and sets give the movie a unique feature and enhance the grip on it. This also means that the viewer has to get more involved. This is definitely one of the best technically shot movies, another masterpiece of Kubrick like the Space Oddessey.For the uninitiated, set in near future Britain, the movie shows Malcom MacDowell as the head of a group of youngsters involved in sexual violence. Turn of the events leave the protagonist in the hands of the police. Worried by the growing number of prisoners the British Government devises a method of ""programming"" them so that they always choose the good. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic.Lastly, I would like to say that you may be compelled to leave the movie in between, but if you are watching it for art and cinematic experience, I recommend you to sit through.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
orchestra of violence,"In a dystopian world, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) leads his 3 followers in ultraviolence. Eventually, he is arrested for killing an old lady. In prison, he finds the violence in religion to be calming. He volunteers for an experimental treatment program. The treatment makes him ill when confronted with violence and sex. He is released and is confronted by the violence that he himself promoted.This is almost experimental in its examination of sex and violence in society. It is an unique surreal film. The ideas behind it may be lost to people who sees this simply as an artistic violent movie. No matter how one dissects this, Malcolm McDowell's performance is beyond reproach. He shows his great acting abilities.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I just didn't get why it's a masterpiece,I looked forward to seeing this classic for the first time but came out a bit bemused about what all the fuss was about.It was an ok film and certainly quite out there in the content and the way it was filmed but I failed to see what made it such a cult classic.Maybe its a generation thing.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A controversial and offensive masterpiece.,"Anyone looking to watch A Clockwork Orange might be wanting to revisit some of Stanley Kubrik's work and might be interested in studying this film. Those who have already seen this film tend to already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci-fi movie but for me, I approached this film recently to obtain an opinion for myself and study one of the great masters of cinema.The fact that this film was regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made (rightfully so) sparked genuine curiosity to give this flick a full viewing and while I have large issues with the film, the experience as a whole was both satisfying and a learning experience.This story centers on ""Alex"" our main protagonist and his gang of hoodlums set in a not so distant, dystopian Great Britain. The beginning portion unfolds Alex's dark and twisted soul as we watch him and his gang fight, rape, and kill. When he's eventually caught, he undergoes controversial ""treatment"" to be cured of his dark soul.I first appreciated the inmate concepts of this story and the type of questions the story attempted to raise to the audience. Furthermore, much of the psychological ideologies surrounding freedom, choice, good vs evil, and selfishness were extremely thought-provoking. It had a way of making me feel self-exploratory despite the character's complete inability to relate with (hopefully) any viewer.Performances were top notch; especially from the lead: Malcom McDowell. His performance felt so authentic there's never a single moment that feels fake or forced with his dark character. As always, Stanley Kubrick directs the hell out of this. His commanding and authoritative shooting style is apparent in every frame of the picture and he does a wonderful job at sucking the viewer into this terrible world to the point of enthrallment.While all these positives make for a great movie-going experience and when Kubrick is at the director's helm not much can go wrong, the film's biggest downfall is indeed its controversy. Disturbing subject matter in this piece is indeed vital to the essence of the story but taking off the gloves when it comes to fighting, rape, and killing (especially the rape) make this so incredibly disturbing that it's difficult to muscle through. I found that A Clockwork Orange was not only offense because of its disturbing content, it was personally offensive in so many ways. Frankly, these extremely rare and offensive movie experiences are not quite the reason I enjoy films in the first place; stories can still be thought-provoking while not morally offend and damage the viewer internally. In addition, a viewer looking to study the work of Stanley Kubrick can still experience some of cinema's greatest and transcendent experiences without feeling like their conscience has blackened.It's understandable that not everyone feels this way; just as stated before, opinions about this film are all across the board. As time has passed however, A Clockwork Orange has stood out has one of Kubrick's finest and has been adored by die-hard fans so much its fan base has grown over the years.The best advice to give is to see it for yourself. Much like all other Kubrick films, relying on anyone's opinion won't help one bit. Seeing it and deciding for yourself is the best course of action. That being said, despite it's strong artistic merit, I wouldn't recommend seeing it simply because of the morally offensive and sickening content that most don't appreciate. Overall, it's been the hardest one to review in a long time because it's not a simple: see it or don't see it. There's much more to this picture than that. If you do decide to see it though, be warned and well prepared. If not, that's probably just fine too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Stanley Kubrick's satire on crime and justice is just shy of being a great movie. It's perverse and provoking, but there's also mad genius beneath its repulsive content","One thing was certain about Stanley Kubrick: once you gave him complete control over the story of his film, you were at the mercy of his malice and onslaught. Like his science-fiction classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", his 1971 film ""A Clockwork Orange"" was and still is a film of heavy controversy and debate. Some laud the movie for its satirical and dark humor when addressing crime and punishment. Others believe it's just too dark, too nihilistic, too right wing, and brutal to be taken for art or even a good movie.What's my verdict? Well, somewhere in the middle. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but to me, it's not a masterpiece. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. I liked the middle section, but the third act just fell apart for me. Perhaps I wasn't quite ready just like I wasn't prepared for the Star Child scene in ""2001"" and wasn't sure how to take it. A second viewing might help. But one thing is for sure about ""A Clockwork Orange."" It is a brutal, disturbing, and even at times offensively off-putting madman story. But buried beneath all its exterior horrific content, there is also a sort of mad, maniacal genius that holds it together.The film is set in futuristic Europe, during a time when all the people in world seem to have gone nihilistic and pornographic without a fear or care. A young rapist named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is captured by the police after accidentally murdering his victim and becomes subject to a new sort of government test that should cure him of his evil waysbut things might go awry.The first half of ""A Clockwork Orange"" really shocked and appalled me. There were times my stomach turned around inside of me because it was so disturbing. I actually felt uncomfortable and even a little unclean sitting there watching these scenes of explicit rape and nudity and almost dance-like violence. Kubrick clearly wasn't afraid to let his expressionism free on the screen. But oddly enough, although I felt really bad watching these scenes, I also felt kind of awed for I understood that Kubrick wasn't glorifying crime, he was kind of alerting us to how many people seem to glorify it. In a way, he's alerting us to our own perverse thoughts. This is also aided by the fact that our protagonist is one of the screen's most offensive villains.The middle section of the film was not as good as the first part. When Kubrick started to satirize the justice system gone madI felt the movie became way too talky and verbose. Characters would say a whole lot of words but communicate very little point. And then the third act just became too slow for my liking and this is what ultimately cost the film a potential fourth star. Kubrick had a lot of say, but I don't think he said it with the right notes.I say notes, because Kubrick is also making majestic uses of classical music during scenes of violence and madness. Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies are used several times throughout the film in surprisingly appalling but ingenious ways. Edward Elgar's classic ""Pomp and Circumstance"" also makes a wonderful appearance in a wonderful sequence. You can say another thing about Stanley Kubrick's (and can see this also in ""2001""): he had good taste in music.Perhaps I am writing this review a little too early. Maybe ""A Clockwork Orange"" is not a film that can be properly analyzed and reviewed after a single, unprepared viewing. But I will say this about my first impression of this dark and perverse tale. It is good film-making. And the performance by Malcolm McDowell is hands-down brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The most overrated film in cinema history.,"I've seen this film three times over the years. The first time I saw it, I was completely blown away by how awful it was. Surely I was missing something, right? I mean, after all, it's considered to be not only one of the best films of the 1970's (no slouching decade) but of all time! I asked a friend of mine who was studying film in California what I was missing, and his answer was, ""Well, it's a Kubrick film, so you may have to watch it more than once."" And so, that following year, I sat down and watched this film two more times waiting for the reveal to finally wash over me. Today, I can tell you that was easily the worst piece of advice I've taken so far in my life. This film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and any ""underlying themes"" people speak of is a load of hogwash. It's just bad. Period.So, why did this film become so popular over the years? Probably because people LOVE to bow down to Kubrick as being the greatest filmmaker of all time, and nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the only movie I've seen from him that's actually good is Full Metal Jacket.Although I've never read the book, I'm sure it's much better than this film. People were a lot less likely to bandwagon books pre-Harry Potter. If a book got a lot of attention back then, it probably deserved it. My recommendation would be to read the book and not waste your time on this pretentious, illogical, downright frustrating film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My brief review of the film,"A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"amazing, the greatest villain ever, nothing has scared me more","i just saw this movie about a day ago, and it completely blew me away, namely the main character, protagonist, hero?

Alex is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you. the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is an all time masterpiece,"A Clockwork Orange (1971) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a little gang of misfits who travels the streets of England causing chaos through their random acts of violence. When they cross each other one night trying to establish a leader the direction of the gang and leader of the gang changes permanently...this movie is directed by legend Stanley Kubrick (The Shining) and stars Malcolm McDowell (Halloween), Patrick Magee (Zulu), Michael Bates (Patton), Warren Clarke (Firefox) and Adrienne Corri (Bunny Lake is Missing). This story from beginning to end is absolutely captivating. The sets are eccentric and unique. The dialogue is brilliant as the terminology is entertaining and well delivered. The acting by McDowell is all time great. One of my favorite all time performances. The circumstances throughout the film are horrifying, hilarious, intense and unpredictable all at the same time. The cinematography within the film keeps your mind turning throughout. This is an all time masterpiece that is an absolute must see and a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best movie ever made,"A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them. I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The milky bar kid,"A Clockwork Orange was always a film I wanted to watch but it was one of these films that I was too young to watch when it was initially released in British cinemas and then banned by Director Stanley Kubrick from being available in Britain. The ban remained until he died.The film became infamous for its depiction of violence and sex. It overlooked the fact that despite its initial scenes of brutality and rape, in its heart it is a dark comedy set in a futuristic Dystopian Britain.An adaptation of Anthony Burgess novel, Malcolm McDowell might be a shade too old to play the teenage delinquent Alex getting high on milk-plus which is infused with drugs and then partakes in an orgy of ultra-violence which includes beating up a vagrant, fighting with a rival gang and then speeding through the country roads where they burst into the house of a writer who gets beaten up and watches his wife get raped as Alex sings Singin in the rain.We know Alex is still at school as he lives in his parents flat and is visited the next morning by his probation officer who is concerned about his absence from school.However Alex's luck runs out. He falls out with his fellow gang members and when he breaks into another house, he kills a woman with a phallic sculpture, betrayed by his gang and caught by the police, he is sentenced to 14 years in jail.The opening part of the film would had been deemed shocking in early 1970s Britain. I doubt that level of sex and savagery would had ever been seen before in a mainstream British film.However the film becomes more of a surreal prison film once Alex ends up in jail where he joins a church group and tries to fend off advances from fellow inmates. A visiting government minister offers him a chance to take part in an experiment. Once he undertakes an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks the film becomes a black revenge comedy.Once freed from prison and rehabilitated Alex finds there is no room for him in his parents home, he gets set upon by a gang of vagrants as the tramp who he beat up in the beginning recognises Alex. His old gang members are now in the police and they torture him. Worse still he stumbles into the house of the writer who he attacked and he gets his vengeance as well. Poor Alex now cannot listen to his favourite piece of Beethoven without doing harm to himself.There is an underlying political satire of a government wanting to tackle violence in society by being draconian themselves until public opinion turns against them.The film contains a lot of slang derived from east European languages and although I mentioned he looked rather old to play the teenage Alex, Malcolm McDowell delivers an amazing performance providing a narrative with his Yorkshire tones.The film might put off some of its audience with its disturbing opening but settles in well after that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pure Kubrick,"I just watched A Clockwork Orange for the first time in more than a decade. The film is still disturbing and relevant in its depiction of violence, treatment and society as a whole. It is full of typical Kubrick elements: especially the static use of the camera and the almost painting like quality of the shots. McDowell, playing the role of his life, is still threatening and menacing. But this film definitely isn't one of my favorite Kubricks. Especially the third segment of the film (Alex returns to society) is a bit slow and would have benefited from some trimming. The second and especially the iconic first segments still hold up remarkably well. Over time, and with so many films covering the themes of the film, its significance has diminished a bit. But that still leaves a cinematic rewarding experience, especially in its first 30-40 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Boring 1970's attempt to shock,"I watched this film on its original release, I also watched it a few days ago, I was hoping that with age it may have appealed to me more, but unfortunately it failed to hold my attention now, just as it failed to hold my attention way back then. The director has chosen to use graphic sex and violence to gloss over a bad script, feeble plot and mediocre acting. This film is remembered today for all of the wrong reasons. If looking at full frontal nudity is your thing, or unrealistic violence turns you on, then this film would probably appeal, but if you like a movie to entertain or to be thought provoking, I should give it a miss.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie,"Without a doubt, my absolute favorite film of all time. I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since. I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so underappreciated (at least by ""casual"" movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything.Something that I don't think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the ""peace-loving citizens"" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language?

Controversial yet very fascinating,"I like and respect Stanley Kubrick, and feel that along with 2001, Dr Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange is one of his best films. It is probably Kubrick's most controversial film, but it is also one of his most fascinating at the same time. It is the sort of movie that you need to see more than once though, I didn't think much of it first time I love it and appreciate it much more now for what it set out to do.A Clockwork Orange is a shocking film I give you that, particularly with the rape and sadistic ultra-violence in the first half, and the scenes where Alex is being brainwashed do bring forth ambiguous messages. Still, like with the rest of Kubrick's work it is very well made, has a haunting soundtrack that fits wonderfully with the tone of the film(especially loved the use of the Beethoven), superb writing and direction from Kubrick and a compelling story that evokes thought afterword complete with a purposefully unrepentent ending. Also Malcolm McDowell is absolutely superb in what I consider the performance of his career.In conclusion, very fascinating film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An empty and unpleasant film.,"People say that this film is somehow amazing. To me it is far more about image and very light on any content. I am all for the freedom to depict unpleasant acts where appropriate and where it has some purpose to it, but I don't see any point to the vast majority of this film. The whole thing seems to be designed to appeal to base instincts through violence and sex without ever making any valid or thought provoking points about either these or any other issue. I realise it is in the top 250 list but personally I feel this film owes more to its notoriety (people thinking it was banned despite the fact it was actually willingly withdrawn by Kubrick in certain countries) than to any real merit in the film. The characters seem to me to have very little real depth and the film is just a series of scenes designed to shock and court controversy.

There are so many elements of this film that bring it together and make you totally enjoy the story. The music in the film is one such example, at times it's beautiful and at times dark and disturbing, setting the right tone for the scene. Technically this is a sci-fi film because it does take place in the future and there is the plot which involves brainwashing.

"""Without a doubt Stanley Kubrick's most disturbing and controversial film""","""A Clockwork Orange,"" directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on Anthony Burgess's novel, is a seminal work of dystopian cinema that continues to provoke discussion and debate decades after its release.Set in a near-future society, the film follows Alex DeLarge, captivatingly played by Malcolm McDowell. Alex is a charismatic yet violent delinquent whose love for ""ultraviolence"" and classical music takes viewers on a dark, surreal journey. McDowell's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, embodying the charming yet disturbing nature of his character with a magnetic presence that captivates and unsettles.Kubrick's direction is masterful, blending stark imagery with a distinctive visual style that enhances the film's unsettling themes. The use of vivid colors and striking compositions makes for a stunning aesthetic that complements the narrative's turmoil. Furthermore, the iconic soundtrack juxtaposes classical music against the horrific acts depicted, creating an almost dissonant harmony that lingers in the viewer's mind.The film's exploration of the concept of free will is profound. Through the brutal conditioning Alex undergoes as part of a government experiment designed to reform him, Kubrick raises disturbing questions about the nature of choice, the morality of societal control, and the essence of humanity itself. As Alex is stripped of his ability to choose evil, viewers are forced to contemplate whether a life without the freedom to make immoral decisions is truly a life worth living.""A Clockwork Orange"" is not merely a film; it is an experience that elicits deep emotional reactions and forces audiences to grapple with uncomfortable truths about society and human nature. Its striking visuals, memorable performances, and thought-provoking narrative make it a timeless classic in cinematic history.This film is both a landmark of artistic achievement and a chilling commentary on the duality of man.

Incredible Vision of Future Ultra-Violence,"Clockwork Orange, A (1971)**** (out of 4)Set at some point in the future, British teen Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) spends most of his time hanging with his goon friends, raping women and causing other violent harm but after he's caught he volunteers for an experimental therapy that doesn't quite work as planned. Sick, shocking, crude, violent, nauseating and vulgar are just a few of the words that many will use when describing this film but I'd call it a true piece of art that rightfully deserves its high reputation. Many people have said that a Kubrick film would never be a Kubrick film if it wasn't an ego-maniac you took his sweet time to make sure what made it to the screen was his vision and only his vision. There's something beautiful about a painter taking his time to make sure his painting has all the right colors and vibes yet if a filmmaker does this he's often criticized for it. There's no doubt in my mind that Kubrick was a mad genius and that's never more evident in this adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel. To me the greatest thing about this movie is its sick and twisted sense of humor but also the visual look of the film. It's amazing what Kubrick can do in the matter of seconds but the masterful and now legendary opening sequence only lasts a few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world of sex and murder. These two objects are never a funny thing yet Kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them and follow our ""hero"" Alex as he rapes one person after another, murders and fights only for us to eventually come to see him as the good guy and a victim. I'm sure one could make this film a very political one and many arguments have been raged about the meaning of the ending but everyone who watches the film will draw something different from it and I'm sure ones own opinion on what's done to our hero will have you seeing the ending in different ways. For me personally, the film has always been an incredibly dark comedy that works simply because the world we're watching might be set in the future but you could call it ahead of its time just like METROPOLIS was. It takes place in the future with the bizarre sets and weird culture yet at the same time the subject matter is so today that you can't help but feel you're in the middle of some nightmare. McDowell's performance is a truly great one as he perfectly plays both the psychotic Alex but also the victim. I thought some of McDowell's greatest work here comes once he's cured and can no longer tolerate violence. What's even better is the narration, which is downright superb and wonderfully used by the director with the actor perfectly delivering the lines and helping one get into the story. You'll also never hear ""Singin' in the Rain"" the same way again. Some people call the film overindulgent, which is probably is but I see this as a good thing. This just helps create this strange world and in the end it's really unlike any movie ever made and there's just something so unique in its vision that you can't help but feel this is something from the future. Kubrick's vision has never been questioned and fans could debate on which of his features has the greatest look but for my money it's this film. That's not to say this is the director's greatest film but I do think it has the great look and feel. It's certainly a very violent movie but the director gives the violence such a pleasant nature that it just seems normal and rather light. The strange music selection, crazy camera shots and overall strange tone makes it a one of a kind and that's why A CLOCKWORK ORANGE will always be a timeless work of art.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Boring, nonsense, awful and a perverted movie.","This movie is absolutely amazingly bad. Actually I love Kubrick's movies. But they usually does not tells important stories.

Other Kubrick's movies has some real revolutionary technical aspects. They change the cinema industry.This movie has some pervert and absolutely unnecessesary storyline. Awful and pointless.

Was Kubrick On Crack?,"What a waste of time!

Yikes! How can this movie be in the IMDB top 250? Be forewarned, this movie SUCKS! There is a scene in the movie where a woman is bludgeoned with a large ceramic statue of a penis, and at the end, I felt as if I'd been similarly beat.

A Clockwork Horror; of cinematic beauty.,"A Clockwork Orange was easily one of the 70s' most controversial movies and easily one of the most disturbed movies of all time; so much so that Kubrick actually withdrew the film from circulation in the UK until he passed away in 1999. That rarely happens to any film, especially to the type of film that the modern world would consider to be an astronomically important cinema-classic.A Clockwork Orange is like the forbidden fruit of British-American cinema: it's risky beyond belief but the temptation is insatiable until you take the first bite. Risky, horrific, and psychologically demented yet absolutely beautiful in its depiction of a futuristic dystopia.A film of its time, yet still completely relevant and disturbingly visceral today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Everyone is the Villain,"Many people may say that Alex was the villain of ""A Clockwork Orange"", but he's only really evil for the 1st 3rd of the film, right? Well, who really is the villain? The people who punished Alex, the people who had their vengeance upon Alex? Or is it society, itself?To me, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film in which everyone is wrong, yet everyone is right. Everyone is guilty, yet everyone is innocent. It is a chilling, emotional, disturbing, and, sometimes, quite funny look into the evils of the world itself. Everyone is villainized by Kubrick's lens, from the criminals that rape and murder victims, to the punishers of these criminals, enforcing cruel, almost torture-like methods to ""cure"" these criminals, to those who were victims of these brutal criminals, having their revenge using more harsh techniques of brutality.""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film that got me thinking and feeling.

Scary comments,"There are probably far too many comments concerning this movie already, but I'll advance one more. I'd always heard what a 'dreadful' and 'violent' movie ""Clockwork Orange"" was.  It debuted while I was still in early high school; I didn't actually see it until quite a few years later.  I do remember, incredibly, my first introduction to it in the form of a parody from ""Mad"" magazine.  Though silly, I recall the MAD spoof as being amazingly reminiscent on the whole. However, I have seen the real thing now, twice; I've read the user comments from the IMDB site.  And I have to say this:  The movie didn't particularly frighten me in regard to the rape-and-ultra-violence scenes.  Though of course quite troubling, those were inherently part of the story about a disturbed society and its even more disturbed methods of dealing with the above. What did scare me a bit were some of the comments I read.  I would have to say that any people who think this movie ""boring"" or otherwise un-stimulating, are people I want to stay very far away from.A pattern seems to emerge:  These individuals appear to regularly watch movies that are chock-full of totally gratuitous violence.  Then, having heard what a Terribly Violent film it is, they approach ""A Clockwork Orange"" in anticipation of more of the same. They are invariably disappointed -- the reason being that there is really little or no 'violence for violence's sake' in the film.  In fact, as a person who decidedly does NOT get off on movie violence, I'd say there is no more than there has to be to help get the very disturbing points of the movie across.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" could easily have been a great deal worse in that regard -- and apparently, some people are let down that it wasn't. So, to such people I suppose I'd have to say this:  If you want gratuitous, mindless, and really horrible violence, rent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or any of the dozens of other, equally insane films -- including some animated ones -- that have come out since then. But if that's the kind of thing that works for you, don't bother renting ""A Clockwork Orange"".  Violence may be the theme of this movie, but it is NOT the message.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This 50 year old film grows more and more bizarre with time,"This dystopian crime satire has been on my watchlist for 5 years now, so I finally got around to watching it on its 50th anniversary. I had seen one of the more visceral scenes in a class in college and the professor hailed it as a great film to study. I was not a film major and was only taking an elective on the subject, so certainly some of the nuance of that statement is lost on me.The film is certainly challenging. I have seen some awful things in the age of the internet and it is hard to catch me off guard, but this film had a few scenes that made me happy my wife fell asleep before it started. I was also happy that I chose to turn on subtitles beforehand. The combination of the old-timey sound quality and bizarre register of ""nadsat"" would have made it difficult to follow. I think the most redeeming quality of this film was how bizarre nadsat is. In the end, I was a bit underwhelmed compared to my expectations going in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliantly Uncompromising; Kubrick's Masterpiece,"'A Clockwork Orange' novel by Anthony Burgess has been beautifully and splendidly portrayed by Stanley Kubrick in his movie with the same name. It is a futuristic movie with Alex having the lead role, a gang-leader whose main interests are violence, rape and Beethoven.
The cinematography is brilliant, the acting superb, and the background score very much satisfying. The symmetrical and one-point perspective shots of Stanley Kubrick are on a whole new level. His photography and direction techniques are beyond comparison. The energetic Malcolm McDowell brings the character of Alex to life. At times, you hate him, at times you love him. At some point, you also feel pity for him. Malcolm's sophisticated and polite, and sometimes amusing manner is very much noticed and appreciated. The character development of Alex is very exciting and is also what makes this movie a success. The language which is used in this movie is called 'Nadsat'. It is difficult to understand this language (invented by Anthony Burgess) easily but that's what makes the movie more attractive.
Although being extremely violent and disturbing, this psychopathic thriller is absolutely a must watch for all fans of classical cinema. You should definitely watch this movie if you are looking for ""a bit of the old ultra-violence"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Messianic, Discombobulated Ideology Only Conceivable in a Distantly Distorted Future","""A Clockwork Orange"" starts at a ""Milk Bar"" where they drink ""Milk Plus."" I don't know what it's in the milk as Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) narrates the contents of it and it sounds like he's talking in a different language, but it's intoxicating nevertheless. This is their prep work. Going to the bar sets the mood and the mind. After this, the ""droogs,"" come across an old ""filthy"" man- a homeless man- who's drinking and singing away. Once Alex jams some night stick looking weapon into the hobos stomach, the hobo, goes on to preach about the state of the world and tells the gang to ""do him in"" as he rambles about the violence crisis the world is facing and its ""lawless"" lands. It was terrible acting from the hobo and terrible dialogue, or should I say, terrible preaching. This scene, as ineffective as it may be, sets the tone and basic underlying theme of the rest of the film. The government has lost control. The gang then proceeds to beat the hobo with chains and canes. This is not the end of a night out on the town. The droogs talk their way into a house and the woman opens the door. The gang quickly rushes in and bounds the husband and wife. Alex then rapes the wife as he sings ""Singin in the Rain."" The helpless husband watches in horror. The act is funny in which it's presented in satire form. The singing done by Alex during his rape almost diverts the attention of what's really happening. The goofiness of the gang and the way they talk, walk, and act becomes more funny than horrifying. This satire will muster up some laughs and the acting of Malcolm McDowell is extraordinary, but the direction of Kubrick is heinous. The supporting performances around McDowell are horrid, over the top, and uncontrolled.The major theme is when the government backs a testing program, which forces its patients to take a shot that gives them a sickening feeling as they watch horrible acts of violence against their will. This gives the patients the feeling of never wanting to resort to violence again. Alex couldn't resist women, which is the reason why he raped them. If he wanted something, it was there for the taking. Alex is tested and the treatment worked!!!! This little twist takes away the freedom to choose- even if you chose to be a rapist.Once Alex has no free will the plot thickens. It thickens so much Kubrick get's lost in what he wants to say, but he knows one thing: Alex is the only thing that's normal and Alex signifies the criminal world. The criminal world is normal? Lw-abiding citizens are distorted and abnormal? Intereting idea Kubrick. Interesting idea. The testing now forces Alex into becoming a non-offensive person. He can't chose what he wants. When aggravated he can't fight back. ""Violence is a very horrible thing. You're learning that now. Your body is learning it.""The body learns it, but the mind loses all control. To make matters worse, when he's released for being cured, he becomes homeless and finds his parents have rented out his room to a stranger. Alex is shown no support from his parents. Ah, the life of a released criminal. Society labels poor old Alex improperly even though he's been rehabilitated (You can wipe away the tears. Kubrick would appreciate that). They care more about this new son than Alex.""A Clockwork Orange"" makes the point that: when criminals are released the world changes so much that society won't allow them to conform, creating no options. Once again, this is the governments problem, you see. Alex becomes homeless and with no place to go, he wanders around. He can't go back to his old lifestyle because, once again, the government takes that right away too. Alex has no place to go because when you've been gone so long society won't allow you to conform, and since the government took his freedom of choice away; he can't make a living for himself the way he once did. Alex runs into familiar faces that now take advantage of him and since he's cured we're supposed to feel sorry for him. The victims now get their revenge. As the scope of the second act and the third act widen, Alex becomes the victim and everyone else he's ever harmed, as well as the government, have taken away his free will. Now all the innocent people are the evil-doers and bad guys that we should hate. Alex fins himself on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're the bad guys now and Alex is the good guy. ""Government is Murderer.""Once some very bad things happen to Alex it makes news when he's hospitalized. He undergoes some more treatment done by the same government in attempt to hide the public shame of the experiment gone wrong. After more experimenting with Alex' brain, we see a much different Alex than in the previous act. We see the old Alex: Unfiltered and very much the same. In the end there's no great message. There's no solution to the problems presented. It's just a glorifying look at violence and blaming the government for abusing their power and using criminals as animals to test, manipulate, and ruin. In the end, you'll get the feeling that the director wants you to be happy for Alex. Why should you be happy? Because he can now go back to his antics that we seen in the first 30 minutes as he dreams of a rape, and says, ""I've been cured, all right."" Congratulations Alex. You're cured. We're all so happy for you. Now, go out and rape somebody. Make Mr. Kubrick proud.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"""Horoshiy Malchik""  Malcolm McDowell","""He is enterprising, aggressive, outgoing, young, bold, and vicious. He'll do"" - and that's exactly whom Malcolm McDowell played in Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork orange"" (1971).It is not easy to work with a genius (and this is genius at work here, no doubt. Nobody does it like Kubrick and we will never see his like again.) No matter how many roles Malcolm McDowell has played he will be thought of and always compared to the sadistic Ludwig Van's fan, a Clockwork orange from Stanley Kubrick's timeless masterpiece. Based on Alex, McDowell was invited to play Caligula in notoriously scandalous 1979 biography of the mad Roman Emperor. Watching McDowell playing Guy Cesar Caligula, one can only imagine that the movie could've been a masterpiece  McDowell plays the same Alex who was born 2000 years ago and for three years had an access to the Absolute Power that had absolutely corrupted him. Well, as we all know, ""Caligula"" is not exactly a masterpiece but it does not make McDowell's work in the movie any less interesting.For me, though, the favorite McDowell's performance is everyman Mick Travis from Lindsay Anderson's stunning ""O Lucky Man!"" the young man with a conquering irresistible smile who just wanted to succeed.I watched ""Clockwork Orange"" a few weeks ago and thought that I would mention Malcolm McDowell. Yes, the film is the product of Kubrick's cosmic vision and inhuman talent but without McDowell it would not have been the same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Beethoven, black humour, sex, violence, they don't make 'em like this anymore! A movie milestone that still packs a punch.","Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is one movie that is talked about more than it is watched, especially in Britain where it was banned for many years. One of the most notorious and controversial movies of the 1970s (a decade which also gave us such notorious and controversial movies as  'Taxi Driver', 'Salo', 'Straw Dogs', 'Last Tango In Paris', 'In The Realm Of The Senses' and 'Last House On The Left') it still packs a punch today. Don't just watch it because of its reputation. watch it because its a damn good movie. Kubrick was on top of his form here, and in my mind it ranks with 'Dr Strangelove' and 'The Killing' as his most successful work. Purists may whine about the changes to Anthony Burgess novel, which is indisputably a modern classic, but I think Kubrick's adaptation is as good as can be expected for the era in which it was made and the constraints of cinema (even now). Malcolm McDowell is superb as Alex, a brilliant performance which he will always be remembered by. In some scenes I was reminded of his Mick from Lindsay Anderson's 'If..'. While the two movies have no real connection it's interesting to compare McDowell's performances. The rest of the cast are also very good, especially Alex's droogs (actors largely unknown outside Britain), and cult favourite Patrick Magee ('Masque Of The Red Death') in a pivotal supporting role. I also got a kick out of Aubrey Morris' Deltoid. Morris is an interesting character most familiar to me for appearing in 'The Wicker Man' and trash classic 'Lifeforce'. 'A Clockwork Orange is a movie milestone that is as great now as it ever was. I have watched in many times and it never fails to deliver. One of the very best movies of the 1970s, which means it is one of the very best movies ever made. Highly recommended viewing.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great performance from James Marcus too,as Georgie !!!!","British TV-actor James Marcus,before having a good career in television (London's burning is the best example!)was(...back in 1971)playing one of the most memorable roles in the cult film,Oscar nominated,classic Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange...in which he played with great presence and solid acting style Georgie(one of the 4 Droogs). The way he played the character was so good and very convincing that many people believed he should have won an Award nomination as best actor in a supporting role;he played very straight and gave to his character a kind of cold and nasty air,,,very different from the one in the original Anthony Burgess novel;that's why he was considered great...he was able to change it completely and give to it his own type of personality and identity! Between the 4 Droogs,Malcolm McDowell(Alex),Warren Clarke(Dim),Michael Tarn(Pete)and him,Marcus played the most nasty character,the most hated...and if the result was so good it was basically due to his particular serious and solid acting and also(which was very determinating)to his extremely deep English accent(considered by many the strongest English accent in film history!).

"psychological, entertaining, brilliant.","**gives away scenes in the movie**This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: ""What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing"" he also says ""When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence.

"""A Clockwork Orange II - An Aeon of Failure""","The ""Clockwork Orange"" treatment was actually done by putting the victim into the ""transpersonal"" of ""perinatal matrix three"" (Hell) with large doses of LSD. See hp://www.allotropic.com for definitions.Dr. Stanislav Grof replaced LSD with allotropic breathing, but, allotropic breathing has to be voluntary, unless it is forced involuntarily like by crucifixion.In the ""Clockwork Orange"" treatment the victim is forced to watch violent films while under high doses of LSD. What happens is that the victim then body switches backward and forward in time experiencing the torments of all the people in the film as real as life.In my case, it didn't stop there. I body switched into everyone I had ever seen.

aesthetic perfection and unremitting ghastly,"Alex is one of the worst delinquents you've ever seen, but his treatment is even more deterrent.  The worst punishment by the authorities of a delinquent I could think of was something like solitary confinement or lobotomy.  Until I saw this movie.  Anthony Burgess' ultra-violence (and the old 'in and out') isn't very controversial anymore if you consider the success of Fight Club and many others since Clockwork.  But the message (social problem) is still very important.  It comes in the form of moral terror and science fiction (although you might not even think it's SF after having seen it) but is the best character study I have ever seen.  The question is whose character is studied here: the authorities' or Alex'?This is definitely Malcolm McDowell's best achievement by far.  He kind of made this into his own movie.  I don't think I could ever take a look at McDowell again without seeing his incorrigible character from this film. Could anybody?I couldn't help but drop my jaw due to astonishment and admiration when I saw this film a few years ago, although I had seen it ten years before and probably never fully comprehended but remembered every detail.  It's so beautiful (neither idyllic nor romantic!) in any way.  It doesn't need gore and blood n' guts to leave a strong taste.  That is the achievement of cinematographer John Alcott (Shining, Barry Lyndon, No way out) and Kubrick's perfection.  Almost everything in this film is unforgettable: the decor of the film, the slang Alex and his collaborators use (without subtitles probably even incomprehensible), the new interpretation of famous music and the outstanding performances of the rest of the cast.Kubrick seemed to have touched a wound when he made Burgess' novel into cinema.  While I'm writing this I realise that there is a US mockumentary named Punishment Park (1971!) that has a comparable frightening message. First, Punishment Park is also banned from television (not by it's director but by US government I hear) because of its extremely disturbing imagery. Secondly it is also a denunciation of the punishment of (supposed) delinquents.  Third it is from the same era and in the not so obvious form of SF.  Well, see for yourself if it's comparable, but don't expect the brilliance of Clockwork.I think I have to conclude that this is one of three best films (2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove) by one of my favorite directors.

A Brilliant Piece of Art,"Words would not do this film enough justice. It is a masterpiece for so many reasons.First and foremost, the attention and detail with every scene and every frame of the movie is absolutely stunning. An excellent example would be the scene where the four hoodlums are in the restaurant/club after they have committed society's worst crimes. Whether it is the demeanor of the criminals, the decor of the restaurant, the patrons inside, or the dialogue, you get an understanding as to the type of director we are dealing with. This is what ""Art"" is all about: from start to finish it is relentless non-linear poetry. Something that goes beyond analysis and simply is.'A Clockwork Orange' is both profound and simple at the same time. It's indeed a social statement, a political statement, a statement on human nature, and many of those other things. Yet it does not judge or categorize its politics in neat little boxes or dichotomies - of left and right or right and wrong. It does not give thanks or offer solutions to any of those things either. That is why it is so brilliant. It simply breathes with its own breath. You watch this and easily understand why Stanley Kubrick is mentioned as one of the top 5 directors of all time. This film would have to be in the top 10 films of all time.Put this film into context (as you would all great films).

Interesting but flawed,"In England Alex and his droogs are just one of many small gangs of youths who live for thrills experienced through ultra-violence and forced in and out with girls.  Internal conflict with his droogs sees Alex abandoned at a crime scene where he is arrested.  Faced with 14 years in jail Alex tries to get involved in a new Government led initiative to rehabilitate criminals.I imagine I'm in the same boat as many users here.  I first saw Clockwork Orange many years ago on a pirate copy where the words `sound quality' and `visual sharpness' didn't play any part.  It wasn't till recently that I was able to watch it on a screen without squinting, when Kubrick's ban was lifted in the UK.  At this point I waited several years till it came to TV before revisiting it  I wanted to watch it away from media hype and make my own mind up.What I found was a film that was taking it's points from the debate that was going on at the time over treatment of criminals.  The plot is worthy and does set up a situation that becomes more relevant every year in the UK  that of violent disaffected youth.  However Kubrick doesn't look at the wider impact of society on Alex, he only looks at Alex and how he is treated now by society.  His life consists of sex and violence  all for thrills, a picture that is all too realistic.  However only in the second half does Kubrick make some strong points about the nature of people and how society can be as cruel as individuals.Most of the film is a sort of arty porn type of film.  That's not to criticise it for this, but it does feel like Kubrick is concentrating more on style rather than content.  Visually the film works well, even if some of the scenes of sexual violence I felt were more than they needed to be and it felt like it was revelling in the very things it was criticising.  However at it's heart the story is a good idea and it is told in a weird way that holds the attention.Alex's weird childlike use of made up words make it feel like he really is a teenager trying to create a world different from his parents and plenty of the images show the reality of his world.  McDowell delivers another great performance and effortlessly carries the film.  However his constant swagger could be criticised for being too much, but at the key moments of weakness he brings out Alex's fear well.  The rest of the support cast give good Orwellian authority figures or vengeful victims well.Overall this film is worth watching once simply because of the hype.  Now that it's no longer banned it will lose much of the credit it gave you when you could tell people that you'd seen it (now every school kid can rent it on video!) and may lose some critical support as a result.  McDowell is great but Kubrick works harder on his style than making clear, strong points through narrative.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
one of the masterpieces of 70's subversive cinema - Kubrick at his peak,"(from 2007): Kubrick's perfect grind-house/art-house ""tour-de-force"" (I think that term could apply here), on a big screen, is the way to go. Seeing the print emphasized the 'grind-house' aspect, as it was spotty and scratchy as s**t, but it added to the appeal of seeing it in such a lower-east-side movie theater- albeit part of a chain of theaters- and seeing it for the first time since I first saw it (probably I was 14) in full glory of the cinematic experience.Certain things always pop up again and again from seeing this work of intentionally shocking, precisely over-the-top, and garishly satirical work, and while it's not like my bible or anything, the film emphasizes as always feelings that I hold very true and reticent: that free-will, notwithstanding certain typical procedures of the law if it's wrong, should not be repressed from within (see the Chaplin scenes), at least certainly not in the indifferent, mechanical process of the Ludiviko treatment.It's not even really a futuristic world so much as, like with Brazil, is sort of environment where present-day fantasy meets reality (or as Zizek calls it, a nightmare), where one ends up feeling sympathy for a little devil like Alex because, quite simply, he has a lot more liveliness, humor and humanity in his form of evil than those of the government propogandists, scientists, or even the 'writer', in their form of self-aggrandizing, larger-scale evil. If anything, he's almost naive when compared to the big scheme of things- a boy getting the ultimate horror-show of a coming-of-age handed to him.But thinking of Slavoj Zizek again made me double check the reasoning of the ending, and how endlessly clever Kubrick could be that having seen the film countless times I only caught on this this time: that Alex, by accepting the quasi-desperate plea from Frederick to make them look good, is still subverting himself to a form of control, even if now ""recovered"" from his treatments. The ambiguousness of the ending- of if Alex may or may not return to his life of crime or change his ways- has always been paramount for me, as it's been with many of Kubrick's films, but that little catch kept me thinking as I skipped along after the movie, singing the notorious song- the only one McDowell knew by heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great masterpiece.,"This is one of the greatest movies by the very best director of all time. The first time you watch this one you might disagree, but if you give it another chance you might just realize what a great piece of art this is. And it keeps getting better and better for each time you watch it! Well the actors deliver great and unique performances (above all as Alex Delarge) and Kubrick nails every aspect of sound music and camera usage, in this unique film. The music might just be one of the greater features of this movie. Because of all the perversity and pure violence many could be offended and therefore not appreciate this work, but just give it another chance and you will see. This movie was made to offend us. A great movie, by my favorite director. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Exquisite film package with disturbing contents.,"A tyro film for Kubrick and McDowell -- perhaps a career best for both great film artists.  Tale of a dark future where people have largely traded their freedom of thought for security (should hit close to home these days).  Alex is the apotheosis of this:  he is literally turned into a machine through pharmaceutical therapy, forced to ""viddy"" scenes of rape, murder, and fascism to condition him against violence.  He also loses the ability to listen to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the ""punishment element"" or, the tragic ""weepy part"", depending on your viewpoint.  Kubrick's film is deliberately provocative, forcing us to identify with Alex although it unflinchingly shows his hideous acts and his stupidity.  Marvelous photography, direction, acting.One thing that strikes me in particular is how well Kubrick and his art men have achieved their goal of making the environments the characters inhabit reveal their emotions or tensions.  Particularly memorable are the wasted theatrical environment that is the stage for the battle with ""Billy Boy"" and his droogs and the cramped, ""futuristic"" apartment Alex shares with his parents.  It's crammed with smiley faced sunflowers and psychedelic wallpaper, every bit the degraded vision of the flower child generation brought with a push into comfortable middle age.  Doctors and clinics are sterilized white, their plastic gloves and needles marking out their own self-conscious state of superiority and objectivity.  And the final section of the film brings Alex through a succession of locations, ending up depositing him back ""Home"" for his suicidal attempted finale.  Place and situation are thus shown to be very important or ""conditioning"" of the individual's actions, for although Alex seems to be a ""hero"" or ""active"" character, he is in fact only clever in that he can master many different situations (the streets, prison, clinics) by adapting himself to his present circumstances and surroundings, whatever they may be.  This places him, in the final situations, as the pawn of situations and people outside his control.Striking, unforgettable, infinitely rewatchable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My Personal Kubrick Favorite!,"Stanley Kubrick is back! And he brings with him another controversial albeit delightful movie. In the 1960's, he directed two genuine masterpieces in 1964's Dr. Strangelove and 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both were fascinating movies that had something to say-usually things that stirred the pot. In 1972, his most controversial movie of all was released titled A Clockwork Orange. I absolutely loved this film and I am not ashamed to admit it. I loved the film's take on a bleak, dystopian future reminiscent of a fascist society. I loved the characters in the film despite their ultra-violence. I loved the music and the use of Beethoven and Rossini. Just every little thing about this film can be called a masterpiece. There were people who despised this film because of it use of violence. The kind of violence displayed in the movie was something that was very, very rare in 1972. Even in today's standards, this film is violent. Maybe it even glorifies it, but its hard to say.This film centers around a young man named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) who is a leader of a violent gang and to put it quite bluntly, a sadistic rapist. He is very violent to everyone, including his own gang members. One day, he murders a lonely old woman and is sent to prison for the crime. Whilst in prison, he hears of a program which would allow him to get back on the streets. This program is a form of aversion therapy-which would create goodness in him. He agrees to this controversial program and is released from prison after the procedure. Back on the streets, Alex finds it very hard to live a good life especially with all the violence he had a hand in creating.One of the things I admire about Kubrick is how he doesn't rely on a huge cast and he is always trying to find fresh talent to work with. In this case, Malcolm McDowell is the newcomer here. I'm not really familiar with his works, but he does an impressive job in this film. He plays Alex as a very tortured individual who feels violence is necessary to make him feel happy. He also has a huge knack for sex-whether consensual or not. But towards the end after the aversion therapy, it's kind of hard not to feel bad for Alex. He wants to lead a good life, but his criminal past comes back to haunt him and there is really nothing he can do. Patrick Magee does a good job as Mr. Alexander, one of the victims of Alex's crimes. I also liked the use of the English vocabulary. This film has a very weird dialect, but it's delightful to listen to.So you must be wondering what does this title stand for? Well, it has to do with one of the controversial topics in the movie. He goes under this psychology treatment under the totalitarian government to stop his immoral behavior. However, Alex is more or a less a robot after this treatment. This is one of the programs being instituted by the government to ensure total control over its citizens. To be a clockwork orange means you are an organic being on the outside, but on the inside you're just a machine. Kubrick himself called this movie a satire on such psychological programs. Nonetheless, this scene in the movie was a very hard scene to watch. It was well-done, but watching Alex break down to scenes of Nazi Germany was very intense.Speaking of intense, most of the violence in this film is displayed at such high intensity. Some of the violence was even too much for me, and I have a very strong stomach. But the violence is necessary to show because its part of Alex's daily life. Kubrick took advantage of a changing studio system to insert this violence in his movie. He would not have been able to make the film as it is ten years earlier. But there are some crazy scenes to watch. The beginning of the movie has a crazy fight scene between Alex's gang and a rival gang. Alex and his buddies were beating the rival gang just for fun and showing no mercy. A very hard scene to watch is when Alex broke into Mr. Alexander's house and raped his wife. There was also an interesting scene where it shows Alex having sex with two women in fast-motion. It's not hard to see why this movie caused controversy. It's a very bloody, violent movie and I'm glad Kubrick didn't do any foolish edits to the film.Music plays a big factor in the film. Early on, we understand Alex loves Beethoven. His ninth symphony is used throughout the film to great effect. Many of the fight scenes are set to the music of Beethoven or Rossini. Just like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick used music to speak to the audience. As with 2001, some of the music speaks louder than words. Also, this film brought an interest of Beethoven to me. He is a very good artist from the classical era.A Clockwork Orange is a violent, brooding movie set in futuristic England and despite all of the controversy surrounding it, it is a very unique film. It is also one of my all-time favorites. It is fascinating to see how people or even nations were affected by the movie. Upon its release, this film was actually banned in the United Kingdom. They didn't get to see it for the first time until maybe fifteen years ago. Once again, Kubrick gave us another movie to challenge our minds and thoughts. He is a very meticulous director, but his efforts are worth it. Based on a popular novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is a must-see as a visually-impressive futuristic movie about a man whose life is made out of violence. But that will be changed.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"This is a rewarding experience, o my brothers..","A Clockwork Orange is a revolutionary motion picture. It was surely a very controversial piece of work back in the seventies and I can see how it would still be just as chilling if released today. I have not read the novel, but the film is extremely powerful and stands, to this day, as one of the best motion pictures of all time. Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director and, with a capable cast and some Beethoven tunes, he effectively turns A Clockwork Orange into a timeless work of art. The film is not watered down, nor is it for everyone. For those who can appreciate it, though, A Clockwork Orange is a true masterpiece that does not disappoint.Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) is a young man intent on getting his way. In the undated future of England, he and his three ""droogs""  one of the many strange words he uses; this one referring to friends or cohorts  go out at night and terrorize to get what they need. The boys are content with drinking drugged milk at the Korova Milk Bar, beating up hobos, and raping innocent women in their own homes. They lie, cheat, and steal to get what they need. And they don't feel badly about it. Unfortunately for Alex, our humble narrator and lover of classical music, he's in for a little change. After being set up by his fed up buds, he is arrested for murder, sentenced to fourteen years, and he's scheming all the while to get out of it. When he hears of an experimental treatment that guarantees to ""cure"" him of his violent tendencies and secure him as a free citizen, he jumps at the chance. However, things do not go exactly as planned.Malcolm McDowell  who is extremely underrated  provides an extraordinary performance as Alex. He is hilarious, terrifying, and pitiful at the same time. This could not have been an easy character to portray. Alex is a delinquent: a murdering, thieving, violent rapist. However, McDowell's performance makes him extremely likable. In the end, it's so easy to root for Alex. It would have been easy to make the character detestable, but the way in which the film develops and the way he is portrayed, Alex is our hero and friend.As disturbing as the film is said to be, it is that much more hilarious. I was not expecting to laugh out loud at such things as I found myself laughing at. This is essentially a black comedy more than a drama. A Clockwork Orange makes many points regarding society and government, but it does so in a way that is completely satirical. Most of the laughs come from Alex's narration and the utter ridiculousness of some scenes. In one scene, Alex attacks a woman with what looks like a ceramic penis. There is also a scene in which, while reading the Bible, Alex imagines himself in certain Biblical scenes. This includes the boy being fed grapes by topless girls that he refers to as his ""wife's handmaidens."" There are sex scenes at double speed, rape scenes set to songs such as 'Singin' in the Rain', etc. It is stylishly violent, bitingly satirical, and nothing short of entertaining throughout its entirety.The film raises many questions regarding the infringement of rights. Is it moral to ""dehumanize"" a person by ridding them of violent tendencies? Is reforming criminals, cleaning up the prisons, and making the streets safer really worth tampering with a person's free choice by forcing them to change themselves and their beliefs? Is this a right that the government has? Is what's ""best for society"" necessarily the best thing for the individual? These are all questions which the audience may draw their own answers. Although no such ""treatment"" exists today, it is easy to see that the film may not be far off from the direction society is moving toward. Alex was a despicable human being, but didn't he have the freedom to be that? However you want to look at it, A Clockwork Orange examines this, implying that free choice is essentially what makes a person who they are.A Clockwork Orange was released in 1971, over thirty-five years ago. The amazing thing is that it is not, in any way, dated. The film has a timeless feel. It looks good for being as old as it is. It has also stood the test of time, becoming a classic in the eyes of many. This is definitely a rewarding film experience. A Clockwork Orange may be a little rough and some may consider it graphic, but the themes are relevant to every culture in any time. This is a great film that will surely endure for years to come.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A daring cult masterpiece,"I first saw A Clockwork Orange armed only with my knowledge of the novel and the film's notorious reputation as an ultra-violent controversial film. Now I have come to know this movie as one of the most surreal and masterful films of all time. It has plenty of philosophical content, an intriguing story, a wonderful performance by Malcolm McDowell and a great variety of unforgettable moments created by the images and the music of the film. This is Stanley Kubrick's best film ever, having more human substance to it than 2001: A Space Odyssey and more fun (even if it is dark) than any of his other films (except for Dr. Strangelove). This 70s cult classic has definitely earned its place in film history and will hopefully continue to entertain future audiences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

O My Brothers...,"I've only seen this film once, and once was enough. I would certainly agree that it's well-made, and of course has Kubrick's Midas Touch all over it, but like ""Schindler's List"", the movie is just too disturbing to give repeated viewings. I'm sure there were many who had grave reservations when it came out in the 1970's about whether or not some of the film's projections would come true, and in today's world it looks downright prophetic! I may sound like a weakling, but for this movie was just one long horror show. I'm not talking about the type of horror that causes you to scream, but rather the horror of seeing just how possible the terrible images before you eyes could come true. You know, like ""The horror"" mentioned by Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"" (Not about his waistline). From the beginning slow drawback of Alex's face to the closing line, I was in a cold sweat.

My Favorite Film of All Time,"I was 14 years old in 8th grade when I found this amazing film that would change my perspective on movies for my whole life. Before I saw this movie I had only seen the kid movies I had watched when I was a baby or the comedies that I would watch with my dad. I had not gone out of my way to watch any older movies that people had considered classics. I discovered this movie funny enough through the Tenacious D movie. They had an ""A Clockwork Orange"" movie reference within the film that my dad pointed out to me and not knowing what that was I googled it and discovered the film. Just by watching little clips of the movie on YouTube I was immediately in love with the genius cinematography of it all. I then for Christmas received a $25 gift card for Xbox and I spent $20 of it on ""A Clockwork Orange"". From start to finish of the film I experienced so much and absolutely loved everything about it. The movie is absolutely flawless in my eyes and I feel the same amount of joy watching it for the 100th time just as I did watching it for the 1st time. This was the movie to open the gate for me to going back and watching some older films or more serious films and realizing that Drama films are not just boring films that parents like to watch. I am forever thankful for this film for this exact reason and as I know this was not much of a review and more of just a dumb life story I still feel all Bias aside that this movie is pure genius and very much worth a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Possibly the worst movie of all time,I am actually a kubrick fan. I loved the book too. The movie however is terrible. Words cannot begin to express how much I hate this movie. From the terrible zoom lens shots to the shoddy production design and bad photography. The script misses key elements from the book. Characters disappear without a trace and one of the defining scenes where Alex plies some old ladies with alcohol in exchange for an alibi is inexplicably absent from the movie. It is mysoginistic trash. The book describes the sexy costume the girl wears who is to be a temptation to Alex after his conditioning and Kubrick uses the opportunity to show yet another pair of bare breasts. A scene where a young girl has been kidnapped by a gang is replaced with an unnecessary rape scene. Every woman is a victim in this movie. This is definately one for women haters.

Genre-defying outrageous literary work,"Stanley Kubrick wow! This film is extreme, that's what the first few scenes said to me. It's off-the-rails scenes work to create the appropriate shock value in the audience. And those scenes truly work, it provokes the audience, willing them to think about what they just witness. It makes you reflect. This is film. It gives you a glimpse to another view and sometimes that view depends on how you perceive the film. A Clockwork Orange is vividly original as a a film (I'm aware it's a book). This is more of a movie that you sit back and think about it and perhaps rewatch again one more time because you can't really wrap your head around everything in this film. It definitely challenges the limits of film. Yet, I think it works well as a stand-alone entertainment and perhaps you'll get a better idea to Kubrick's vision.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful and underrated,"This movie is pure art, The dialogue is poetic, sarcastic, funny, dramatic, and can be nauseating to some. This film cannot be placed in one genre of movie because it can almost fit into any, sci fi, drama, comedy, suspense, musical etc and it would please any viewer. Overall i think its funny yet retains a classical and poetic essence. The music is of course of the famous Beethoven and is interwoven so well with the plot, you could think they were made for each other. The plot is simple yet wonderful, the actors play their characters so well its unbelievable. Some find the graphic rape scenes and dialogue revolting but its a masterpiece of violence, music and acting. 10 out of 10 is fully earned and should be within the top 10 i feel, because masterpieces don't come along every day, all though it may not be as good as the book to some, it's still a great movie to all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Could be Kubrick's Best Film (Easily His Most Famous),"Young Alex DeLarge (Malcolm MacDowell) rapes, murders and listens to Beethoven. When his gang turns against him, he is caught by the police and sent to prison. From there, he undergoes a treatment to cure his violent urges. Will it work?Casting: I think the cast was perfect, and this is Malcolm MacDowell's most recognizable role. Watching ""Clockwork Orange"" tends to lead to the debate of what's Kubrick's best film, as he has made so many classics. Many would say ""2001"", but this film puts up a good fight. But you really never hear people debate their favorite Malcolm film role, because it's invariably going to be this one, I think.Imagery: Kubrick uses vibrant colors and some odd images. The milk bar is especially unusual, and sexual imagery appears all over in even the most ordinary of places. The cat house? A sign that says ""home""? Very unusual stuff. The strong Christ imagery? Intense. From my recollection of the book, it was never this extreme and we have Kubrick to thank for such a radical interpretation of futuristic England.Music: Obviously, Beethoven's 9th plays a key role in this and it's worked in well. But also, the synthesized music fits (such as in the record store). I don't know if it makes you think of the future, but it certainly makes you think this is a very foreign place from the world we know today (yet, the lessons and morals here are just as important).Some discussions could be attached to this film -- is it right to limit a man's choices, even if the choices eliminated are bad? In real life, is it okay to chemically castrate rapists rather than have them make their own choices? Is human nature defined by free choice, or are we predisposed? There is lots of room for discussion of these and other topics.If you haven't seen this, see it. I don't recall anyone ever leaving this film unchanged. It tends to be more easily accepted by men than women, for some reason, and I've been hesitant to recommend it to women. Some have said they ""don't get it"" and others can't get past the rape scene (which is disturbing, but serves to drive the point home). But then again, I had a female professor who had us read the book (I had already read it at that point). So, who knows. Really, this film is the very definition of morality, freedom and the nihilistic future we're heading towards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A cinematic pleasure for any cinephile to experience!,"As time goes by, I'll always appreciate my Grade 10 English class (1984-85), taught by Mr. Terry. Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later. It hasn't aged or dated a day.Most cinematic observers felt the book unfilmable. Director Kubrick's adaptations work so well, particularly this, '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining' (even though Stephen King would fervently disagree about the latter) because he, as he did with 'Dr. Strangelove', can so easily both find unforgettable visual metaphors for his ideas and so handily combine humour (an under-recognized trait of his, much more readily associated with say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock) with these heavy and daunting philosophical and intellectual volleys. In the wrong hands (particularly a Stanley Kramer, or his ilk), this could have failed miserably, like typical cinematic treatments of Ayn Rand novels. But this worked triumphantly, and heartily exemplifies one of the greatest directors ever at the apex of his craftsmanship. No self-respecting cinephile can avoid this movie, and I heartily recommend you to read the novel as well, though Kubrick nails it so effectively, reading the novel isn't necessary in the slightest for the film to be enjoyed.One of the many 'gamechanger' films of Kubrick's storied and remarkable career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
about the movie: Clockwork Orange,"Clockwork orange is an impressive movie. I didn't enjoy the first scenes because this type of movies isn't my favorite, but then I understand the principal reason of it, which in my opinion it is a critical observation to government. The first actor was wonderful, he represents to a sick person who likes doing bad things, and he doesn't realize that is wrong. Some scenes are very strong because they show a lot of violence and terrible crime done by a group of teenagers. I think that the family of Alex is a typical family of United States, because they don't mind their son, when he kill the woman and he went to jail, they rented his bedroom to other man and he became like a son to these people. The mother always had a terrible personal aspect, she wore her hair with horrible colors, and the father was a person without character. That government was an excellent example of one in our days where they thought only in its image. They failed when they wanted to correct the Alex's thoughts with their particular methods and the solution was and is always to give money to the victims after they make mistakes. My favorite part of movie was when Alex met with ""his friends"" and they tried to kill him, and also the rest of the scenes when he met with his victims.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

34 Years Old and Still Going Strong,"""A Clockwork Orange"" never fails to polarize its audience. It seems that the viewer ship of this film either loves it or loathes it. Some (I among them) salivate over Kubrick's complete mastery of the film medium while others want to burn the film as morally dubious at best and repugnant at worst. The criticisms I hear most often leveled at the film concern the fact that Kubrick has us sympathizing with a young punk whose favorite pastime is violence (any kind, including beatings, rapes, bludgeonings and stabbings). I do agree that we sympathize with Alex, the film's main character, but I disagree that this is to the film's detriment. The movie, like the book on which it is based, is told essentially in first person. Alex narrates the film, and we never see an event occur that Alex himself is not present to witness. Even the mise-en-scene of the film (the distorted angles, stylized sets, use of slow and fast motion, etc.) lend the film a subjectivity and reminds the audience that it is seeing events unfold through a perspective other than its own.I think anyone with a shred of humanity will sympathize with Alex; I think that's the movie's point. Alex treats others as if they are animals, and we are repelled by it. Then, when the state treats him as if he is just another animal, why should we not be just as repelled? In some ways, the questions this film poses can have practical applications to the ongoing debate over the death penalty. Does recoiling at the idea of putting someone to death mean that we condone the crimes he or she committed to have that sentence brought against them in the first place?I want to save my last comment for Malcolm McDowell's unimprovable performance. I can't imagine anyone playing Alex better than he does. He's got the perfect blend of charm, charisma and menace that this character needs. His performance is comedic and scary at the same time. It's a shame that he didn't receive more recognition for this film when it was released.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Real horrorshow all around, oh my brothers.","""It's funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen.""It is very important that you look at this film today to try and imagine yourself back 30 years in a state of England when The Clockwork Orange came out. No wonder it was banned for 27 years. A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of extreme violence and rape.Kubrick challenges you, the worst part of you to be turned on, not to be turned on..to feel aroused, to not feel aroused, to feel sickened, to laugh and to a point to take it seriously (or not take it seriously) and then finding the weak spot and slicing in. This masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of filmmaking that demands the viewer to actually think and lodge in a part of your-- somewhere between your heart and your head.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Brilliant, Startling, and Unforgettable Film","I became an instant Kubrick fan once I saw 2001, and I became even more hooked when i saw Dr. Strangelove. A Clockwork Orange solidified my belief that Kubrick is bar none the greatest director ever. This truly unique sci-fi film remains the most disturbing movie I have seen, and it's 35 years old.The fact that this film lost Best Picture to The French Connection puzzles me and yet, at the same time, doesn't surprise me. The Academy could never reward such a daring film as this, especially a science fiction film. 35 years later, this movie would still warrant a hard R rating, if not a near NC-17. The way that Kubrick puts the violence in the film like it's no big deal is really scary and disturbing, which makes the movie marvelous.The cinematography and editing of this picture are truly mind-blowing. From the opening image of the anti-hero, Alex, staring down the camera, to the eerie ending shot, you cannot keep your eyes off of the screen. The way the film was shot remains cutting edge to this day, and you'd be amazed at how long the takes are and how mind-blowing the cinematography is. And one could never forget the sex scene, basically a motion blur, to the William Tell Overture. The use of slow-motion was also used perfectly, a breath of fresh air in a time where it is used sloppily and for no reason.The direction is like none other. The rape scenes are unflinchingly done, and the sporadic and flashy style (rendered cliché by films such as Saw) makes for some of the triipiest scenes on film. Kubrick did wonders with the camera and made for an insane trip, with a startling message of violence in our youth and the effects of a government experiment. One must watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate it.What really, really makes the film so incredible is Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of Alex, a young delinquent who entertains himself with violence and rape, is truly one of the greatest performances on film. His nasty sneer and devilish performance is flawless. You can see the way he holds back a grin when he says he's going into jail for murder, and during the treatment scenes, his delight turning to utter shock is unforgettably real. He makes the film what it is: a classic.As much as I have gushed about the movie, it is definitely not for the faint of heart. The rape scenes get very out of control, and the subject matter is incredibly disturbing. However, if you keep an open mind and aren't a stupid teenager who will watch it for some T & A, you'll realize how amazing of a film this is, and how well it holds up after three and a half decades.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Clockwork Orange wouldn't be the same without Malcolm McDowell!,"To say this movie is strange is an understatement. The level of violence committed makes one think about the world around them, wondering if we can truly forgive such horrible acts.With that said, Malcolm McDowell provides a performance that launched an iconic, legendary career most actors would kill for. As Alex, the film gives you a first person perspective, with Malcolm McDowell, as Alex, providing narration during the film, seeming to give you an inside look into his mind as the events unfold on film.This is a movie that should be on EVERYBODY'S required viewing list. It's one I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It was a better read than a movie,"I recently read the masterpiece of a novel A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess.  After completing the novel, I immediately went out and bought two others by him.  Needless to say, I was excited to see the film version of this wonderful book.  However, once I saw it, I was a little disappointed. The rapes, which were a very small, almost insignificant part of the book were graphically shown in excruciating detail, to the point where it's just plain disgusting. I can also now never again think of a horse race when I hear the William Tell Overture (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean.).  Also, the movie seemed to move along very slowly.  It took every excruciating detail from the book, and some of these things were better expressed in words.  I don't know... A Clockwork Orange is kind of a hard read with the dialect.  I recommend that if you're going to read the book, see the movie first.  It helps out a lot.  Otherwise, stay away from this one.  Just my take on it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Good movie -- as a result of the brilliant source material,"The first time that I watched A Clockwork Orange as an adult old enough to understand it, I really loved it. Then I read the book, and I loved the movie a little bit less. It is a great movie when it follows the source material, but the Kubrick-i-zation of A Clockwork Orange makes it merely good. This is because Kubrick adds all kinds of ridiculous style to the movie, as well as the occasional bad joke. It's worth a watch, and the humor mostly works. However, it's not the masterpiece that Kubrick's thralls insist it is.A Clockwork Orange covers a lot of themes. Mostly, it deals with modern society's utter ineptitude when it comes to managing and eliminating violent crime. Society tries brutal punishment while psychoanalyzing psychopaths. Nothing seems to work. Both of these extremes are shown in a darkly humorous manner in A Clockwork Orange. Although it is a ""comedy"", there isn't any point in A Clockwork Orange that is laugh-out-loud funny. The humor comes from the absurdity of it all. A Clockwork Orange has the same sense of humor as Dr. Strangelove -- portraying everyone as either evil, dogmatic, or stupid, interested only in themselves, and not humanity as a whole. The politicians and cops in A Clockwork Orange don't care about finding real solutions that make society better. They care only about applying band-aids, and phony solutions that look good. Like Dr. Strangelove, the story feels like a great big sick joke, but with a strong message behind it.Malcolm McDowell does give a great performance as Alex, the ""humble narrator"". Alex is a total sociopath, and he narrates the violent events of the story with a stoic indifference. When the violent tables get turned on him in the movie, McDowell perfectly plays the phony victim that Alex becomes. The one problem that I have with McDowell though is that he is too old for the part, but perhaps that was inevitable since a more faithful portrayal would have been too disturbing for the studio. Unfortunately, McDowell gives the only real good performance in this movie.My biggest problem with this movie is with some of the absurdities that Kubrick introduced. For starters, the style throughout the movie is absolutely ludicrous. Old sci-fi movies about ""the future"" are notorious for having a bad sense of fashion, but this movie really takes the cake. In A Clockwork Orange, ""the future"" looks like somebody's gaudiest '70s nightmare taken to an extreme. Interiors of houses are full of blindingly bright colors and crazy artwork. Every other woman has brightly colored hair. Alex and his droogs wear tight white clothing with derby hats. Maybe in the early '70s this looked edgy. Now, it looks stupid.Another problem with the movie is that it was just too far ahead of its time. It isn't Kubrick's fault -- it is just the reality of making a movie based on an incredibly violent and sexual book. Even now, in 2012, the public would have a hard time accepting a perfectly faithful translation of Anthony Burgess's masterpiece. But because of this, a lot of the content falls flat. For instance, a scene in the book where Alex rapes a couple of young girls becomes a scene in the movie where Alex has consensual sex with a couple of women. The book scene illustrates what a horrible monster Alex is. The movie scene is just pointless soft core porn. (No I don't think that the movie should have portrayed that scene faithfully -- it should have just been left out). I am probably one of the few people on Earth who thinks that the movie isn't disturbing enough and, the violence, not visceral enough. If you think that I am crazy, watch the Goodfellas scene where Joe Pesci stabs the guy in the trunk of the car. In the 40 years since ACO was made, it is startling how much more realistic movie violence has become.I still own the movie, and this is one that I can definitely recommend. To me, the book is a 10, and the movie translation is a 7. Given how horrible the majority of book-to-movie translations are, I'd consider that a win. With that said, I think that this movie, more than any other, would benefit tremendously from a remake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
sympathy for a rapist? I don't think so,"Imagine a movie where you're asked to identify with a pedophile, sympathize with him, even. Suppose that the whole film was mostly graphic scenes of beating and raping children..the sadist is singing during the torture.What's wrong? Having trouble with that idea? Good. So am I.Any point the film attempts to make gets drowned out with nothing but violence from beginning to end. Oh, but the film is about so much more, like the ""controversial"" theme, which asks you to focus on the bizarre idea that some psychopath losing his freedom to choose for himself is much more oppressive than the torture he's inflicted on his victims, who have lost a far more profound sense of freedom? Having trouble seeing such a movie as ""art""? It's okay if the victims are adult women, though, right? Or how about a film where we argue over the rights of a KKK criminal who ""accidentally"" killed someone? Do you get it now? Know anyone who thinks criminals should be allowed to continue their violence because it's uh..free will, man? There is no such thing as absolute free will in any society anyway.This film was like any other exploitative film. It's all been done before.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Most Dangerous Films Ever Made,"All of this can be said of ""A Clockwork Orange"": controversial in all possible ways, shocking, jaw dropping, wild yet beautiful, artistic, elucidative, cinematically impressive, unique. Stanley Kubrick reveals the world as it is, horrible things we do not want to see melded with a disturbing sense of humor. Here's an striking film that dares us to watch, disturb our senses and perceptions, and in the end most of us we'll be failing in seeing what one of the greatest directors of all time tried to say to us about a violent futuristic society that reflect many problems of all the forms of societies in all the times, past, present and future.It is a dangerous film because it challenges its viewers to open their eyes to violent acts presented in a almost jolly, pleasurable way (of course, the ones who are committing acts like beating a old man and raping his wife to the sound of 'Singin' in the Rain') and most people will probably think Kubrick is a sadistic man for filming such things. Not the case! Here's a director aware of its time, who probably saw how things were running down in the world like extreme violence, bad politics, totalitarianism, moral failure of society and decided to make his own statement on the issue (not only he, in fact, this is based on Anthony Burgess book). We see this ultraviolence in the film as a distant future but now, many years later, things haven't changed much and there'll always some twaddler out there to blame amoral behavior in society because of films like these which leads me to another aspect of why this is a really dangerous film.It is the most misinterpreted film of all time, hailed by the wrong reasons (and most of the time by the wrong kind of viewers, the ones who love Alex mannerisms and violence), and the wrong kinds of ideologies who are led to believe Alex is a hero, the government is the oppressive system that institues wrong forms of rehabilitation and all. I can't be a hypocrite, I also got the wrong idea of what this film is about several times, always believing that this was some sort of morality tale about not doing to others what you wouldn't wish was done to you. It's way more than this.The paradox is amazing since we have the most dubious character ever created on film, greatly played by Malcolm McDowell. You can hate Alex DeLarge, you can like him and you might have mixed feelings about his way of seeing the world, using complicated expressions to express himself or express violence, hatred, and we also have the ""corrected"" Alex, the one sent to a drug experiment where he started to hate everything he liked in his previous rebel life: violence, sex crimes, and he can't even listen to Beethoven anymore without feeling sick.Some films have not the obligation to answer our questions or to lead us into some one path or the other; they're exist to be watched, to be debated, to make us think about new perspectives on a provoking and controversial theme. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a mandatory film for those who dare to see how powerful movies are and how cinema is powerful, visceral, contradictory, an wonderful media at its highest best status: being art and a deep look into a reality, much more than just entertainment.

"Thought-provoking, with a sharp and dark sense of humor...","The first thing that struck me, after watching this movie a couple of days ago, is how thoroughly modern it still looks. Unlike many of its contemporaries, A Clockwork Orange can't be considered as ""dated"", and all those issues it addresses are as urgent today as they were five decades ago. How many other movies - from the early '70s - can actually make such a statement? Beware, this movie is not an easy one to digest, to absorb, to analyse, we can't be able to fully understand the genius behind it. I believe the film maker wants to target the ineffective and inhumane methods, too often contrived by our governments, to suppress the criminal behavior, asking what kind of sacrifices we are willing to make to live in relative security, regardless of the cost. Another important factor, highlighted in the plot, is the trickiness about wondering whether the removal of free will can destroy an individual's essential humanity. Then, there's the soundtrack - the music here keeps the viewers glued to the screen, with an alienating sense of anxiety perpetrated by a masterful mix of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, The William Tell Overture an Singin' in the Rain - is there anything else I need to add? Oh yes, those eyes - Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his eyes are a perfect fit with the purpose of the whole movie. A dark and gloomy atmosphere, a dystopian scenario, a storyline deeply disturbing and provocative, a gritty and terrifying background, with several scenes of unprecedented violence: all of this collected inside a masterpiece, signed by Stanley Kubrick.

"Fierce, disturbing, thought-provoking satire.","Stanley Kubrick takes an allegedly unfilmable novel by Anthony Burgess and transforms it into one of the great masterpieces of cinema. What, exactly, is A Clockwork Orange? A sci-fi social study? A fiercely thought-provoking and disturbing black comedy? A prescient warning of where society is headed? A criticism of how the law deals with crime and criminals? The list could go on and on, for the film could indeed be described as many things. But whichever way one chooses to approach the film, one thing is certain: it is without doubt one of the most uncompromisingly challenging examinations of the many faces of violence ever made. Where lies the attraction of violence, what are the consequences of violence, is there a solution to violence? It would be easy to expect a glib and sentimental answer to such questions, perhaps some comfortable conclusion that even the most evil of individuals is good at heart. But A Clockwork Orange avoids sentimentality and glibness and comfortable conclusions. This is a chilling film which points out that a solution to one evil is very often the evolution of another.In a dystopian society of the very near future, youths calling themselves Droogs gets their kicks out of sadistic crime. One gang led by the clever but thoroughly nasty Alex (Malcolm McDowell) entertain themselves by assaulting an old tramp, breaking into a home and beating the man of the house before raping his wife, and driving like hooligans around country lanes, forcing other drivers off the road. One evening Alex forces his way into the house of a single woman and attacks her with a gigantic phallic ornament, eventually killing her by smashing the pot penis over her head. But Alex is actually captured for this particular offence and sentenced to 14 years in a rehabilitation institution. Here, Alex learns to survive by faking sincerity and repentance. However, he learns of a radical new treatment for violent criminals, a controversial method of therapy in which the subject is put through a rigorous series of experiments that ultimately suppress their desire to act criminally. Sensing a chance of early release, Alex facetiously volunteers to undergo the treatment. But when the therapy is over, he finds that he has lost more than his violent tendencies  even his basic human thought processes, his ability to make moral choices, have been taken away too.McDowell gives a career-best performance as the sadistic narrator, terrifying in the film's horrific first half and oddly pitiable in the more philosophical second. His character is the fulcrum upon which the whole film depends  if his character doesn't work, then neither does the movie. Happily the actor passes with flying colours. Kubrick shoots each scene with characteristic meticulousness, generating horror when he wants horror, comedy when he wants comedy, and thought when he wants thought. The film's many images and philosophies resonate long afterwards, mainly due to the way Kubrick works them into our mind. A Clockwork Orange has a reputation for extreme violence (having been withdrawn by Kubrick himself for over twenty five years), but it is a more implied kind of violence rather than the visceral blood-spattering common to recent films. Much of what makes this film so disturbing takes place off screen, often in the viewer's own mind. It is a film to challenge our way of thinking, and as such a wonderfully provocative and worthwhile piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Really messed up...,"There's no doubt that Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors to ever live. I love the psychological aspects in his films like The Shining and Eyes Wode Shut but A Clockwork Orange left me feeling in a way I haven't felt before.A Clockwork Orange follows Alex, the leader of his gang of ""droogs"" that commit acts of ultra-violence for fun. One day he gets imprisoned and decides to go for an experimental program that will shorten his sentence however it doesn't go as planned.This is easily of the most messed up films I've seen but it's also one of the best. Stanley Kubrick is a unique storyteller and A Clockwork Orange really stands out to me. I know how controversial this film was back in the 70's and rightfully so. The depiction of sex and violence is as shocking as ever to this day and I wasn't able to shrug them off because of how disturbing the portrayal of those scenes are. Kubrick has a strong eye for visuals and has many beautiful shots that bring a rush of different emotions whether that's disgust, shock or excitement. What I really love is how the film uses its background score. I haven't seen a film use soothing music like classical in line with horrific visuals. The electronic feel that Wendy Carlos brings to the soundtrack is riveting and creates a creepy atmosphere to those scenes.Kubrick's script is fascinating in a lot of ways. The style of dialogue is interesting to listen to and helps bring you into this film's view of England. Among the disturbing factors, there is a surprising amount of dark humour that comes along with it. It's undeniable how fantastic Malcolm McDowell is as Alex DeLarge. His portrayal of Alex is absolutely haunting and layered with many subtleties. Alex is one of the most interesting protagonists I've seen and Kubrick did such a brilliant job fleshing him out. What's most interesting though is what Kubrick tries to say with A Clockwork Orange. From its depiction of youth stems an intriguing look into good and evil, society, reformation, free will and so much more.This film can be judged from its controversial content alone but it's the commentary A Clockwork Orange provides that makes it engrossing.

It is a clear critic to a society where the powerful people use his power for personal benefits, and how this people have no merits to get high positions in the system.The brutal methods from society to get well behavior human beings are not effective.

It is definitely not black and white and one can't help but question what is the solution to juvenile delinquents? Who says what rehab should be?I prefer more wholesome or less gruesome films that are thought provoking versus something of this flavour.

I Hate This Movie,"Bad Story, Bad Behavior, Bad Scenes ... Usually, before watching any movie I look up IMDb to see its rating and viewers' comments on it. I did the same before seeing the Clockwork Orange. It said, mostly, yes, violence, yes, the main hero's a monster, but what a masterpiece! It seemed to deserve its place in the first 50 in the IMDb rating... Then I watched the film. And I believe it is one of the most disgusting films I ever saw. It is no doubt intended to be full of hidden significance, the grotesque manner in which characters speaks, move, dress, live. This is supposed to be ""new and frighteningly surrealistic"", a ""sharp, futuristic social satire"". The viewer is probably supposed to be saturated with disgust to the point that he/she realizes, oh my God, that's us! That's the worst part of a person in modern society. Suppose, however, that you don't go along with this idea. What do you see then? You see an empty film. It is filled with violence that serves to get the oh-so-new idea of a social satire through. Because, you see, without it the viewer won't understand. He won't understand the idea of mixing English with misused and twisted Russian words. He won't understand that the Music line is supposed to be thought-provoking and not just stupid: ah, Beethoven and the Nazi, Beauty and the Beast, whatever. This film is two wasted hours of your life. After having watched it, you get the awful feeling you've been taken for an idiot.

This is art.,"As far as I am concerned, A Clockwork Orange is one of the greatest films ever made. With this 'work of art', Stanley Kubrick elevated cinema to the level of Michelangelo's art.At the boundary between pornography and art, it is the so-called 'sexual depiction' that hinders or complicates the evaluation of a film.In this respect, A Clockwork Orange, unlike The Realm of the Senses, does not appear at first glance to be significantly sexually explicit.However, despite being a hypersexual and incendiary coalition of images, the film itself appears elegant thanks to the perfectionism of the script, make-up, Beethoven's music, interiors and furnishings, futuristic furniture and production design. And it is sculpted to perfection by the technique and imagination of the entire film crew. This is also due to the zoom-outs and extreme filming techniques.A Clockwork Orange is both pornographic and artistic, but never vulgar.Nevertheless, the film seems grossly underrated when compared to the work of Charles Chaplin and Jean-Luc Godard.Moreover, despite the fact that a film is not a masterpiece without great performances by its performers, there are hardly any 'weepers' or 'sentimental performers' in this film.This is Kubrick's perfect self-defence, creating the stereotype that 'films are for directors'.Sighingly vivid, beautiful, sometimes violent, sometimes maddening, this 136-minute film feels like stepping into a photographic exhibition.It is a visual demonstration of Kubrick's great sense of photography.

"Kubrick's brilliant, darkly-funny, subversive masterpiece","Kubrick's brilliant, darkly-funny, subversive masterpiece.Set in the UK in the then-present-time but with some futuristic elements to it, a young man, Alex (played by Malcolm McDowell), is the Beethoven-loving leader of a gang of hedonistic, immoral thugs. They beat up people for fun, fight with other gangs, sexually assault women, break into houses and generally terrorise average citizens without any feeling. Then one day, Alex kills one of their victims and is immediately caught by the Police. He is sent to prison for 14 years. In prison he learns of a Pavlov-like experiment to rehabilitate and reprogram incarcerated criminals...Searingly brilliant. Master director Stanley Kubrick pulls out all the stops in adapting Anthony Burgess' weird, fantastical, thought- provoking and dark novel to the silver screen. While the subject matter is dark, the approach is quite light and funny, resulting in a morbidly humorous movie. Quite Pythonesque at times in its inanity and dark humour.Not just comedic, there is drama aplenty and many themes at play. There's a wonderfully subversive element to the movie - the government is shown to be a bunch of incompetent nanny-state morons (though we already knew that...), authority figures in general are shown to be out of touch with reality and, on a minor note, we see who tend to become policemen... There's also a theme of free-will vs conditioned response.Or you could just view it purely as entertainment and enjoy it anyway. It works on many different levels.An excellent score contributes to the feel of the movie - Kubrick uses it well to set the mood for the scenes. It contributes particularly well to making dark moments much lighter.There's also the attention to detail we expect from Kubrick, complete with an Easter Egg or two.

Singin' In The Rain!,"Strangely (and scarily) enough the song ""Singin' In th Rain"" was temporarily stuck in my head. You'd understand why after watching this film. A Clockwork Orange is an early Stanley Kubrick work and keeps with his bizarre filmatic perspective.In some of the more shocking scenes of violence (even for today much less for 1971) the audience follows the horrid acts of a bunch of hoodlums in a strange fantasy world. The portrayed date of the film is subject to debate, possessing many of the conveniences of today yet a setting that seems altogether remote and distant in time. Irregardless, A Clockwork Orange focuses on one individual in particular, 'Alex' de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his exploits of society in order to satiate his teenage darkly desires. The film starts off with an almost abandonment or anarchy to life, a take or do-as-you-please philosophy (hedonism in short).We watch as the misguided youth commits all sorts of atrocities at his every whim. He then undergoes a metamorphosis where he is no longer the ""afflictor"" but the afflicted. And in perhaps one of more ironic injustices of a comedic sort, Alex becomes a mistaken hero who further continues to exploit society, not with his vices, but this time with his false virtues. Society is the victim of its own system in producing miscreants who later become ill-gotten champions.

Delightfully Dark and Disturbingly Deep,"Few films in history have better succeeded in portraying the absolute worst elements of humanity than Stanley Kubrick's disturbing masterpiece, a nose-dive into the sadistic violence of youth and the inhuman lengths that government society go to in order to craft their perfect world. Clockwork Orange raises important themes surrounding good and evil, coupled with deeply perturbing imagery which is utterly absorbing to the viewer. By no means easy viewing but with an important message, this brilliantly made piece of film shows its audience that the world can be a truly haunting and horrible place, leaving you with an uncertain feeling in your stomach and must be seen to truly be believed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Clockwork Orange (1971),"All I can say is that it's one of the most craziest, weirdest, deepest and probably the most contradicting movies I've ever seen.A pure psychological study on the character and the society.And yes, it was hypnotic as well, it did felt like a fever dream.

Quick review (best movie ever),A clockwork orange is one of the greatest films of all time every scene worthy of an art gallery. Kubrick certainly knows how to make perfection which comes at know surprise considering his background in photography. a clockwork was a perfect adaptation to Anthony burgesse brutal yet spectacular novel. It manages to pulls off that slow but intriguing pase a strategy that has been used by the greatest directors of each generation such as Quentin Tarantino to Martin Scorsese. Overall i would strongly recommend a clockwork orange to anyone who can appreciate a film of such quality that has aged better than most films from the 90s,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest Movie Ever Made!,A Clockwork Orange is the greatest movie ever made. It is Stanley Kubrick's best film. A Clockwork Orange and The Shinning are both awesome movies but i have to go with A Clockwork Orange. This movies is disturbing and mean but for some reason watching I had a smile on my face because it is so good. This movie will keep you guessing until the end. The strong rape part you should skip because it goes on forever. That part is still haunting me and IT WILL HAUNT YOU! from the first twenty seconds I knew the movie was going to be the greatest movie ever made. My parents had to stop watching it but I watched it over and over again. Stanley Kubrick is a mastermind and will be remembered for all his films. The Shinning is also one of the greatest movies ever made. I told my friends about the movie and they don't even want to think about it. The acting was great. I can't believe this didn't win best picture. I thought the Malcolm McDowell should have been nomatied but oh well. A clockwork Orange is so crazy i watched it three times in one night and the movie is like two and half hours long. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! I don't recommend it for all but all the guys who want to see boobs and violence watch this movie,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
insanity,"The plot is course, that future England is ruled by gangs. Alex deLarge(Malcolm McDowell) and his ""droogs"" go around committing ""ultra-violence"" and raping women. One night, after murdering a woman with a giant phallic statue, Alex's droogs knock him out and leave him for the police. The police use him in the ""Ludovico treatment"", in which they lid-lock him and make him watch documentaries of concentration camps while he is drugged to get sick, so that he will associate violence with becoming ill. But when he gets out of jail, it has disastrous consequences for him.First of all, we need to remember that a common motif in Stanley Kubrick's movies is insanity. We might jump to say that Alex is insane. But we need to realize that he is a product of this society that created him, and he grew up in the slums, so we shouldn't expect him to be a ""model citizen"". Moreover, after the police arrested him, they don't look at why he was committing ultra-violence; their solution is to mentally castrate him. So really, the government is insane in this case.And what does the title mean? Well, a clock is man-made, and an orange is natural. Humans, including Alex, are also natural. But after they put him through the Ludovico treatment, he can only obey them. In effect, he becomes like a machine...a sort of clock. What about Alex's name? I read somewhere that it could be a combination. The word ""a"" in Greek means ""without"", and ""lex"" in Latin means ""law"", so his name could suggest ""lawless"".What about some of the movie's other aspects? Alex's false eyelash makes him look asymmetrical, as if to say that something about him isn't right. Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), whose wife Alex rapes, is confined to a wheelchair (like Dr. Strangelove?), and after Alex is cured of being ultra-violent, Mr. Alexander becomes as sadistic as Alex used to be. Alex is one of Beethoven's biggest fans. We view Beethoven as a great composer (and he certainly was), but in a drawing of him, he looks almost insane. Alex at one point thinks about Jesus, and during the Ludovico treatment, he has several wires all over his head, and they suggest a crown of thorns.There are so many messages that one can read into ""A Clockwork Orange"". As one of Kubrick's many masterpieces, it shows him to be one of the greatest directors of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hilarious Black Comedy,"If ever there was an over-rated Kubrick film, for my money, ""Clockwork Orange"" is probably it. I may be unfairly judging it because so many things since its initial release from any number of films glorifying violence to similarly themed bloody satires like ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Fight Club"" to the pop phenomenon of gangster-rap have repeated the same message. What I prefer to do is view the film as I think it should be, a brilliant black comedy.There is maddening genius on display here amongst the anarchy in Kubrick's film adaptation of the controversial novel. From the quasi-futuristic set designs to the hilarious speech of the characters to the outlandish costumes, ""Clockwork Orange"" presents a future that doesn't seem that far-fetched, so we the viewer develop a certain familiar comfort level with the oddly off kilter surroundings we find ourselves in. The culture of fear it presents where elderly citizens and an incompetent government cower to roving bands of ultra-violent hooligans isn't that far removed from say, oh, I don't know, present day France or even America in some ways.What makes the film go down so well despite some of its shocking depictions of rape, violence, and torture, is that it never preaches to the viewer. Yes, there is something to be said about a culture of fear in an over-developed nation leading to an erosion of civil liberties and a totalitarian government parading as democracy....but let's face it, this film is in it more for the laughs (the facial expressions on Malcolm McDowell and Patrick Magee are especially uproarious), as its closing scenes will tell. Alex, was cured, alright, but we the viewers may never be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the most over-rated films ever,"I really do not see the great appeal of the movie version of ""A Clockwork Orange"".  I have never read the book, but I bet many others have not either. It seems to me that a lot of people who urge other watchers of the film to ignore the violent parts and to concentrate on the storyline -- it seems that they themselves miss the point of the movie.  The book is apparently different, but the film makes no moral claims as to the character Alex, other than the weak assertion that he is evil.  As the last shot shows, Alex in the movie has not been changed by the therapy, nor by those who attempt revenge on him.  This doesn't seem too profound to me, and I am glad a much greater film, ""The French Connection"", which makes no attempts (and therefore doesn't fail in its attempt) at moralizing, beat out ""A Clockwork Orange"" for Best Picture.  Please, people -- if you're going to say stuff like, ""BEST FILM EVER. PERIOD,"" then at least pick a film that has a pulse. ""A Clockwork Orange"" utilizes those classic Kubrick-style wide-angle shots that are wonderful for the eye, but which also lack ""feeling"".  In other words, they worked very well in the sterile atmosphere of ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" but did not work so well in the human world of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Another thing:  what's up with that scene in which Alex and his Droogs are riding through the country in their car?  Those are some pretty cheesy effects -- the use of an obviously stationary car in front of a moving picture, to give the entirely unrealistic effect of a moving car.  And the drunkard in the second scene on the street:  could he be any more of a caricature, waving his bottle in his hand wildly, while slumped against pavement and singing an old diddy?  Sometime I will read the book, so Kubrick's sometimes amateurish adaptation will be cleansed from my memory.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An interesting movie,"A Clockwork Orange is a really interesting movie, which handles a great argument and a skill in the concept that allows great variety of opinions. For my case especially, it is a movie that shows of certain form the need that many young people have to be the center of attention, happening over whom it is and without importing the consequences that this carries. It is something that happens frequently to ours around and that finally turns into big problems of which it is very difficult to go out or where really already there is no solution, where the persons who realize these activities end with their lives. In addition the form like the friends they can influence so much on our lives and that in many cases we do thousands of things for belonging to a group or for being recognized and valued. Really it is not a movie that could please all the persons, besides the fact that it is something strangely and probably be necessary to see it a few times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Every time you're influenced bye the mass media and they can affect your way of act with the social environments.

A film for half-baked sociologists.,"The tale of a violent man (a boy in the book) and societies attempt to reform him.Never before has so much junk been written about a low budget movie that fails on so many fronts. You can read quite a bit of this cheap sociologist gobbledegook  in the reviews that surround this one - in case you doubt my word!Let us start with a few facts for a change: The film was made on the ultra cheap. Look at the lack of extras or expensive sets (all filming took place in real locations). Look at the cheap TV lighting. Look at the amount of hand held camera work. Warner Brothers didn't really want to make this movie, but Kubrick told them it would make pots of money and that won them over - in this he was right!(To quote a Clash lyric: ""They wear smart suits. And think it's funny. Turning rebellion in to money..."")Alex is living in a society we don't really see (in the movie at least). So how can we judge ""society values?"" Is Alex a one-off or common?  This is a society that sells penis-shaped ice-lollies to children so it must be a bit sick in the head, but no attempt is made to give the movie on-the-ground context.Set in the future is it? Well it is a future that looks a lot like the year it was made right down to the trousers and haircuts. Maybe the future looks a lot like 1972!I look for films to do two main things: To educate or to entertain. Clockwork Orange does neither. Many scenes are quite revolting - and bizarrely they are even found revolting by some of the  people who rate the movie highly!I went to a rough house school that housed real football hooligans, rapists and sociopaths. Let me tell you now, they didn't like classical music or have the ability to explain their actions in clear language to anybody. Several were too stupid to even form sentences.Having experienced/suffered the real thing why would I prefer to listen to the version of a highly protected/highly privileged  middle class man (Kubrick) who - in success - chose to live his life behind barbed wire, protected by big dogs and shotguns?I can stand rape and violence if it has a point to it, but here it doesn't. I am not surprised the original ""rape victim"" quit the movie, who would want to be portrayed on screen like that? Being held down and stripped, while someone with a bad comb-across tries to worm a hand held camera between your legs?I don't attack Anthony Burgess's book (which I have read) because I think that is a valid exercise in literature. Not that it is that good or that original. Even AB admitted that the use of slang was borrowed from elsewhere.I hate this film and the reasons that it was made. I also hate the people that make excuses for them. They should all be ashamed of themselves. Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Clockwork Orange is one of the most disturbing, yet lovable films ever created.","Brutal violence, vicious rape, cold-blooded murder, sadistic revenge; Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic A Clockwork Orange has it all. Few films are as successfully disturbing yet sensational as this timeless feat of cinematic vision. It is impossible to watch A Clockwork Orange without having a deep, emotional response; whether it is disgust, shock or amazement.Malcolm McDowell played the title character Alexander DeLarge, a sadistic, nihilistic youth who, along with his three droogs, runs rampant in an unfettered spree of violence, rape and robbery. Mr. McDowell's performance is amazing, successfully portraying a character you initially despise, but by the film's final moments, you truly sympathize with and care for. The tremendous acting is accompanied by a riveting story, based on a terrifying, yet beautiful adaptation of Anthony Burgess' 1962 satiric, futuristic novel of the same name.The main theme of the story revolves around the topic of free-will and good vs. evil. The main character, Alex, is boundless in evil and chaos. When Alex is eventually captured and imprisoned, he volunteers for a controversial new government sponsored program called the The Ludovico Technique. Alex endures one of the most traumatizing procedures ever shown on film; indeed, it is difficult to watch Alex go through it, even knowing the trauma he has inflicted on others. In effect, he is injected with an experimental serum, bound in a straight-jacket, fastened to a seat in a movie theater and has his eyes pried open with metal clamps. He is then forced to view reel after reel of ultra-violent film footage, from gang rape to Nazi extremism. Alex would normally enjoy these types of films, in fact, Alex is quoted in the movie as saying, ""I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow."" The serum administered to Alex induced an acute feeling of nausea, thus, he was being conditioned much in the same way as Pavlov's drooling dogs. Whenever confronted by feelings of lust or violence, Alex experiences the overwhelming nauseous feeling, thus preventing him from acting on the violent feelings. Upon completion of the treatment, Alex is released back into the world where he encounters many of his former victims, who take advantage of the now defenseless Alex.One of the most striking aspects of A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's dazzling use of a classical score to accompany the many violent scenes. In fact, one of the most controversial moments in film history is the scene where Alex and his droogs break into an older couple's home, beat the husband, tie him up and force him to watch while Alex beats and rapes the wife, all while dancing and singing the classic song, ""Singing in the Rain."" The contrast of violence and classical music has been acclaimed by critics around the world, and brings about an ironic twist in the movie.If you've never seen A Clockwork Orange, do yourself a favor and rent it today. You will be amazed and astounded by the music, philosophy, acting, characters, and story of this timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Stanley Kubrick is a master at directing, and here is his best film. Malcolm McDowell is excellent as Alex, giving one of my favorite character performances.

"Genius, two thumbs up!!","This film is probably the best ever made. Its superb use of music, scenery and wardrobe is one of the great highlights of modern cinema. The exploration of human psychology as much as the moral implications of free will are quintessential in Kubrick's work. Kubrick has the amusing particularity that at the end of his films, one feels like in a state of ecstasy, awaiting something else to happen. They seem to end in a ""To be continued"" mood, which leaves the viewer with profound philosophical questions. The topic of insanity which constantly arises in Kubrick's films, is nowhere best treated that in this work of art, clearly the greatest achievement by any director, dead or alive(maybe in the same rank as Fellini, Chaplin, Truffaut and the great European masters).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I can't decide if it was written by a horny 12-year-old boy or a brilliant storyteller.,"People always say it's impossible not to have an overt opinion on this film100% negative or 100% positivedue to the supposed graphic content. I'm sorry to break the norm, but I really fail to see it as horrid, disgusting cinema, and I also fail to see it as a brilliant masterpiece. In some ways, I just find A Clockwork Orange an average movie that was very well directed.The first hour or so seems to have been written by a teenage boy just starting to go through puberty. I fail to see anything mature whatsoever in parading infinite numbers of topless women across screen. It just seems a whole lot like a middle-aged manKubrick and/or Burgessfantasizing about all the sex he wished he could have. The prevalent penis imagery is borderline self-parody. It's something you see in American Pie and laugh at, not something you watch in ""fine cinema"" and give deep thought to. The entire first hour of A Clockwork Orange honestly had me laughing out loud because I can't understand how this could be taken as mature whatsoever.This is why I failed to find anything about A Clockwork Orange even mildly perverse or upsetting. The rape scenes are all generic rape scenes that seem to happen in EVERY last 70s movie, and not one of them went into graphic detail. A Clockwork Orange didn't do anything ""perverse"" that hundreds of other movies hadn't done before it. If anything, I found the supposed sexual perversity to be very mild, even for its time. As I said, parading nude women around and having a prevalent penis aesthetic is just downright humorous when you think about it, not gruesome. It doesn't rub your face in the dirt of humanity, it's worthy of a grin.The violent content is even less perverse. I don't even remember any of the hyped-up violent content whatsoever. A few old men get hit with a clubthat's literally it. There is no more blood than Star Wars (rated PG), and when there is blood it looks so unrealistic it was laughable, not disturbing. There is NOTHING even mildly violent in A Clockwork Orange at all. How did this get falsely labeled as one of the most violent films of all time? Honestly, how? If it had been made today, it would easily get a PG or PG-13 without any protest. Compared to any and every R-rated movie I've seen this year, A Clockwork Orange looks downright family friendly. If you have not seen A Clockwork Orange, take my word: this is not even a mildly violent film. At all.The directing is godlike. I see no need to elaborate further, because people have done so in every single review on here. I will say, however, that, as well-done as the surrealist imagery is, it sometimes gets silly quick. More than once during the film I felt like I was watching Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory gone terribly wrong, and with less creativity. While it's fun to look at, there is nothing original about the imagery by any means. I found a lot of it bland and predictable.But despite all that, the one major flaw I have with A Clockwork Orange is the pathetic liner storyline. A Clockwork Orange only gets boring a few times because Kubrick's directing and use of music is so great, but that can't make up for the hollow story. Alex himself is basically a one-dimensional idea that gets thrown around into a predicable formula according to the idealistic plot. I'm not saying I disagree with Burgess's ideology in any wayI don'tbut that doesn't make the story any less hollow and unimaginative. It always annoys me like none other when an author can think of some of the most original details for a story (like the milk bar and the slang), but the story itself is painfully unoriginal. It's the same problem most surrealist fiction suffers from, and it's still a problem here.So, do I have anything positive to say whatsoever? Not really, except that A Clockwork Orange is still enjoyable purely at the entertainment level. Though I just trashed most every aspect of it, I did have a lot of fun. It's certainly nothing special, but it's not bad either. If you don't take it as a ultra-serious, die-hard-classic, then you may have as much fun watching it as you had watching your favorite Disney movie as a kid.

"""No time for the ol' in-out, love, I just came to read the meter.""","Stanley Kubricks' extremely potent adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novel stars the great Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge, a violent troublemaker in a futuristic Britain who leads a gang of ""Droogs"". When his gang betrays him one night, he is caught by the police and sent to prison. There, he learns of a cutting-edge experiment to program criminals to loathe violence and be physically sickened by it. After going through the experiment, Alex is pronounced ""cured"", and is released back into the regular world, but his journey is far from over.Benefiting from some very colorful and quotable dialogue, arresting production design, an incredible assortment of music (utilizing haunting original music by Wendy Carlos and compositions ranging from Beethovens' 9th Symphony to ""Singin' in the Rain""), and a superior British cast, ""A Clockwork Orange"" remains one of Kubricks' most striking works. It's a very sharp satire that makes the viewer think about such things as society's attempts to deal with criminals, and the crafty and cunning ways of politicians and their attempts to stay in power. Although, as one can imagine, it was simply TOO potent for some viewers to stomach in 1971; even today, it remains pretty powerful. It even originally got an X rating back then, and was later edited down to receive an R.McDowell is simply fantastic as this hoodlum-turned-victim, and his constant narration is often very amusing.

In brief bits you can see Steven Berkoff as a cop, and David Prowse as Julian, Mr. Alexanders' houseboy.Although it is pretty commonplace now to save most of a films' credits for the final minutes of a movie, Kubrick was ahead of the game there, as he just dives right into the action with a closeup on McDowell.""A Clockwork Orange"" is great stuff from beginning to end.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This is a very interesting movie.,"Malcolm McDowell (Mr. Magoo) ""Alex DeLarge"" the young man,  supposed to be fifteen years old,  according to the book, speaking Nadsat as slang (Russified  English) is the key character in the movie.  He is the leader of a gang of four juvenile delinquents.  It appears that they are extremely bored. They committed heinous crimes.  He went to prison and decided to go though ""aversion therapy,"" in order to get released earlier,  and after the therapy he  becomes excessively passive.  After being used by an anti-government group which caused him to try to commit suicide, and much criticism in the press he is restored back to what he was. Watching both processes is very interesting. The first time I watched this movie, is somewhat historical in our household.  My husband and I were vacationing abroad and we found ourselves with nothing to do on Saturday night than to go to a movie. My husband had already watched A Clockwork Orange.   Well, the censors in the country that will remain   nameless decided to add little black balls to covering the genitals and breasts of the naked women in the movie. Those little black balls kept jumping up and down during the ""Billy Boy"" scene. The entire theater was laughing and we all got severely distracted.  We have a good laugh every time we remember those scenes and the jumping black balls!My favorite scenes: Alex and his sexy eye lashes in one eye only. Alex singing ""Singing in the Rain."" As I understand McDowell improvised that scene, Mr. Kubrick liked it so much that he had to go all over to get the license for the ""Singing in the Rain"" to be part of the movie.  The Minister of the Interior hand feeding Alex after he has been cured (back to normal) with Alex milking the act for all the fun he can get out of it. My favorite quotes: Alex: "" Oh bliss!

Satire of Modern Society's Criminal Policy,"I enjoy A Clockwork Orange because it is very well done and the scenes brim with satire.  Having read many reviews, I think people often miss the point of the film's satire, at least my interpretation of it.The movie is a satire about how the mixture of politics and the ideology of `political correctness' fails to recognize the existence of and to understand the nature of evil and, as a result, fails to deal with it appropriately.  The lesson is that evil exists and it must be dealt with forcefully and effectively.  What is being satirized IS today's society.The main character is an evil person and the government had the chance to lock him away forever (or to actually reform his psychology), but instead he only received a 14 year sentence.  Then the government believed that evil criminals could be physically conditioned against violence and that the effects would be permanent.  The movie's ending, `I was cured all right', suggests that a person's mindset will eventually triumph over conditioning. The main character got out of jail and he still had an evil mindset.The end result is that the government invested energy in ineffective treatments (unproductive prison time, brainwashing) that it thought would be effective and ended up releasing a criminal onto the streets for political reasons, just like today's system.  After all, the Clockwork Orange government needed space for political prisoners (today's consensual `criminals'-drug offenders, prostitutes, etc) and had to find a way to release the true criminals.  In fact, the government went so far as to knowingly turn thugs into policemen.  (Is that similar to giving criminals free tuition at colleges while their victims pay for it with tax dollars? This happened in Massachusetts.)  If the movie isn't a satire of our modern system where child molesters are released from `correctional facilities' only to later rape and murder children, what is it?  The politically correct view denies the existence of evil.  It holds that criminals are victims of bad family situations and unfortunate upbringings.  Since criminals cannot help themselves, political correctness holds that we shouldn't punish them too hard but should try to be more understanding and tolerant of them.The movie is horrifying because that anyone could be so senselessly evil is horrifying.  My reading of the satire's take home message is that society must uncompromisingly protect itself against evil and that reforming criminals requires the prisons to figure out how to convince them to sincerely choose to want to be moral.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Clockwork Orange and Society,"I am not one of Kubrick's greatest fans but i respect people that serve art from an original perspective. Movies like clockwork orange are like free passport to immortality and i think that the director is succeeded in this particular matter. If we take artistic expression from a holistic and historical approach we will realize that art travels through time, but the masterpieces that will remain forever are the ones that manage to gather many subfields of art to the same melting pot giving a pure example of harmony. Cinema has that ability, a great director is able to combine photography, painting, literature, philosophy and music under the same roof. The percentage of deep knowledge in each subfield of art will increase the possibility of creating a masterpiece. In the particular movie the director proves that he is a great composer and a real scholar as he manages to express his deep knowledge in matters of social norms and instinctual struggle. The human behavior which is governed by dark powers that work underneath our consciousness is a basic issue that is pointed in the particular film. Even under captivity and under authoritative rules we are managing only to cover up and fix the surface and the expression of every behavior,the real cause of our behavior is something that we cannot easily understand. Law and punishment stands as a regulator and a barrier in order for such behaviors to remain in the dark. Such behaviors are purely unethical and cannot secure social stability.All rules have created in order to prevent the species from extinction.In clockwork orange obey on rules is something abstract, the starring character which is brilliant on the particular film but also in many others that i had the chance to see him loves violence and expresses his self in a way that only animals do and governed by a primitive behavior. In every society, persons like him are a threat and have to be punished in order to secure the safety of the whole. Although the extinction of the particular behavior has its own risks, a non aggressive person in a high competitive society is the weakest one and really soon the fittest gets him down if we want to use the words of Charles Darwin. Kubrick realizes the whole condition and creates it on the film,in some cases the major interest of art is to depict and describe a political or social condition by identifying itself with the particular condition or staying against it. In clockwork orange the director is describing everything with the most clear and realistic way without interfere with the judgment of the viewer. For some people the neutral perspective is wrong,for some others not, although the final judgment and the creation of emotions is based on millions of people so the wright or wrong does not fits here. Finally i would strongly reccomnet a masterpiece like that in a matter of a cultural and stylistic expression, the movie in a way depicts the whole fashion and the trends of the time with many psychedelic art elements that come along with the outbreak of drug culture in art and everyday life.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good But Overrated,This was my first Stanley Kubrik movie and since he is considered as one of the greatest directors ever and a clockwork orange is considered as one of his best movies I had very high expectations. But i have to say I am really disappointed. its not that its a bad movie but its nowhere near great as its accolades suggest. I know some people doesn't like this movie because of its violence but it doesn't really bother me. The main problem with this film is it's screenplay especially the last act which is very lazy screen writing in my opinion. Though the film does have a good theme: free will and psychological conditioning of human mind lack of better screenplay ruins the movie from achieving greatness. On the positive side lead actor Malcolm McDowell has done a great job. The film does have really interesting background music which i liked. Overall its a good movie that you should watch (if you re comfortable with violence) but don't expect it to leave you awestruck.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The more I see the less I like,"I already liked this movie more. Maybe it's the times or my age, but in fact they are those films that the more I watch the less I like. It's not that the film is bad, because it has a lot of memorable scenes, as well as the whole wave and music is something very specific, but nevertheless, it turns out to be too violent and even the film's message is confusing. I still give it a positive rating, because I think it's a unique film.I think the film's problem is really the violence, not only physical but also psychological. It's from start to finish, and it gives me the feeling that the film wants to make the viewer angry with what they're seeing, and it actually succeeds, because seeing the way the main character is punished ends up not being very interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Unlikeable Characters and Very Creepy,and This is Considered One of the Greatest Movies of all Time,","A Clockwork Orange is a very strange and creepy movie with a storyline that is very simple to understand but the dialog is very strange.I found it very hard to believe this movie was made by Stanley Kubrick,a director who previously wrote and directed 2001 and Dr. Strangelove,two outstanding movies,and then he brings us this messy movie filled with some very detailed violence and crime that is very hard to get out of your head,I wont be able to hear Gene Kelly sing Singin'in the Rain the same way again.Howver,i'm still giving this movie a six because the cinematography was very impressive,and although I did not like Alex as a person one bit,Malcolm McDowell did do a fantastic job at playing this creepy and messed up character.The first thirty minutes of this movie are almost unbearable,but once Alex gets what he deserves it gets more enjoyable.I understand why this movie is popular,but it just wasn't really a movie for me.After committing a series of crimes with his friends as they have nothing else to do,Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is sentenced to fourteen years in prison and takes a test developed by the government to solve his problem.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Dated,"Story takes place in the future. It's about Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his ""droggs"" (friends) who go about and rape, rob and kill people just for kicks. Alex is caught and goes through a sadistic form of therapy to cure his violent impulses. It works...or does it?This was considered a masterpiece in 1971. It was pretty strong stuff (the original rating was X in the US and it was banned completely in Britain) and introduced the term ""ultraviolence"" into our language. I loved it all the times I saw it in the 1980s (at least 7 times). I did think it was sexist (notice the decor at the bar) but found the ideas and themes fascinating.Seen now it's very dated. The violence in it is not even remotely shocking anymore and the ideas and ultimate message in the film (which totally changes the ending of the book) are old hat by now. To put in bluntly the film bores me now. It is extremely well made by Kubrick (the sequence with the ""William Tell Overture"" was great and how can you resist Beethoeven?) and powerfully acted (McDowell was just perfect) but it drags and I'm more bored than anything by it now. Perhaps I saw it too much in the 80s...I'm giving it a 7--for its time it was very powerful...sadly, it just doesn't hold up.And I know I'm going to hear from those Kubrick fanatics who thinks everything he did was genius (even ""The Shining""). Let the attacks begin!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Overbaked and overrated,"The fact that this film is still held in such high regard is surely one of the greatest mysteries in cinema.For the record, I love the book. It would be easy, then, to dismiss my disliking of the film as being no more than that I preferred my own vision of the story upon reading it. Alas, my reasons for not liking the film go far beyond this.Firstly, and perhaps most significantly, I do not like Malcolm McDowell's reading of Alex at all. I find him tacky, annoying and not in the least fearsome. To be fair, Burgess wrote the infuriatingly tacky lingo that Alex uses in his relentless narration throughout the film, but I don't remember him describing Alex as an annoying, whiney Northerner.It is not just the performance of Alex's character that misses the mark for me. Almost everyone in the film seems to think they're in an episode of Monty Python. Yes, I know it's meant to be satirical, but it's more parodical than anything. We're not laughing with it, we're laughing at it. You could be forgiven for assuming that every actor here thinks they're in a stage production and that we won't understand their character unless they shout and overact their way through each scene.The production design is possibly an even greater crime. Rather than looking futuristic, the whole film looks so stuck in the '60s that I can't help but be completely detached from the action. The colour is overwhelming and the lighting only serves to enhance the feeling that this is a cheap TV movie, not a ""classic"" Warner production.Don't even get me started about the cheesy, electronic renderings of Beethoven that plague almost every scene. What on earth were they thinking? Surely they knew that by using ""state-of-the-art"" synthesisers they were condemning the film to being out of date within five years. To begin with the music is mildly amusing. Soon it becomes tedious. Then downright annoying, like everything else in the film.Quite simply, I just cannot take this film seriously. It has no impact whatsoever. Part of the film's longevity in the minds of moviegoers is said to be the controversy and the powerful, disturbing tone of the movie. Frankly, I found Bambi more disturbing, and a damn sight less tedious.On that note, let me not forget how long, slow paced and drawn out every single scene is. By the 90 minute mark the film has gone past boring into something completely new. Needless to say, when the film finally ends, you'll find yourself struggling to resist the urge to follow Alex in jumping straight out the nearest window.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A bit of the old...ultraviolence...,"""Oh? And what's so stinking about it?""Well, according to my fellow reviewers, it glorifies violence (especially towards women,) it's too weird, the language is too hard to understand, it doesn't stick close enough to the book, it's misogynistic, it's too long and boring, the main character is unlikable and it's just stupid!Is it?This happens to be my favorite film ever and I have seen a lot of movies. I was twelve when I first watched A Clockwork Orange. I heard it was violent and there were boobs and (being a psychotic, hormonal pre-teen) I instantly wanted to watch it. The film blew my mind!This film depicts ""graphic horrors"" but are they any worse than the horrors depicted in Schindler's List? Is it ok when a serious film (based on a true story) shows deplorable violence but not when a weird artsy film does it?Is it really too weird for your taste? It's significantly less weird than Donnie Darko (which many people enjoy.) The language isn't any harder to understand than Shakespeare. As with Shakespeare, you should be able to figure it out in context. If you can't, read a book!Speaking of the book, the book is centered around (much) younger people and much younger victims. It would be fairly impossible to depict the book in a screen format without somebody going to jail. The only reason people EVER bring up the book is because the ending is different (and they hate that.) Sorry that the book ends on a happier note but not every film needs to have a Hollywood ending. Hopefully you're open minded enough to agree to that statement.If the film was truly misogynistic, it would depict women in a much more negative sense. Just because the women in the film are naked a lot and bad things happen to them, that doesn't instantly make it misogynistic. If it was actually misogynistic, the women would be depicted as dumb. They're not.If you can't handle watching a movie for less than two and a half hours, steer clear of Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather and don't even try to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's not that long and it's not boring if you actually try to pay attention to it. Sorry it's not Transformers 3.The main character is meant to be a monster. A lot of characters are. You know, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. If you can't find that Alex's zest for life isn't fun or at least entertaining enough to drive the film then don't bother watching (again) Lawrence of Arabia or (again) The Godfather. The main characters in those films are essentially villains as well. Don't bother with Bonnie and Clyde either.If you find this movie stupid...I feel sorry for you. This film is actually insanely smart, even to the point where it's a high camp, overly melodramatic (and purposefully so) black comedy (which most people don't seem to understand.) If you find this film stupid, perhaps it is you that is...So, why is it my favorite film? Imagine my surprise when I watched something that changed my life when all I wanted was blood and nudity. That's how powerful this film is. It took a crazy, weirdo (me) and changed my mindset. I am still a crazy weirdo but I learned to control myself and channel my negative thoughts into positive actions because of this movie.The plot is basic but becomes complex. A terrible kid named Alex (McDowell) goes out with his friends nightly and strikes terror in people's hearts by committing crimes against society. What happens next will throw you for a loop!The cinematography is nothing short of masterful. It's the equivalent of watching The Mona Lisa move. The acting is superbly over the top (which is part of the fun.) The message is STRONG and is more ""happy"" than you may initially think. There's a reason an X-Rated film that people hate on and find so controversial was nominated for Oscars and is still on AFI's and IMDB's Top 100 list.Don't listen to the naysayers! Bring your attention, your open mind and a strong stomach. It's violent, long and weird but it's not much worse than many other films you've no doubt seen. It may just change your life or at the very least, get your Id out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A triumph in artistic vision and poetic meaning,"I'm still very young in my film career, but as far as it stands now, A Clockwork Orange is the best example to me of what a live action film can accomplish.  It sets standards that haven't been touched ever since.  The film establishes a rhythmic style carried through the whole film.  The director is as the top of his form, Stanley Kubrick, the only live action director I call a genius anymore.  In wake of most people not understanding the complexity of its art, I'm still after over a dozen viewings in awe of his achievement (and Burgesse's...I'm a huge fan of the novel as well.)  We have entertainment, beauty, direction, music, choreography, acting, writing , ideas, and all together art working in unison throughout this incredibly fast paced two hour movie.  I lost faith in Hollywood for the most part. There is a very small margin of art being produced (or having been produced for that matter) but A Clockwork Orange (and the philosophical-poetic virtuoso 2001) reaffirms that watching the movies is worth sifting through all this popcorn trash and finding life affirming beauty and art.  Let us rejoice in the glory that is A Clockwork Orange bellowing in the face of all that is tyrannical, commercial, exploitative, dumb, pretentious, meaningless waste.

Explicit savagery as implicit satire,"Delinquent youth in the not-so-distant future of Britain is captured after a bout of rape and murder and becomes part of a rehabilitation experiment set up by the government; changed, presumably for the better, he's sent back to the streets, possibly unprepared for what awaits him. Cannily-made apocalypse-comedy from writer-director Stanley Kubrick, who is often very sly regarding his position on this material (he's a tricky filmmaker who doesn't at all mind changing the rules on his audience, playing them for a fool in the process). Kubrick, who is as much the star here as leading actor Malcolm McDowell, is alternately decadent, dazzling, pretentious and juvenile (some of his technical gimmicks and sexual jabs aren't as pointed as they're meant to be). The film doesn't attempt to solve the sometimes confounding cinematic connection between (and the curious lure of) violence and sex--and I'm not a big fan of the queasy mixed with the satirically sensational--yet after a few reels of this stuff, you're ready for Kubrick to change gears (and, in the third act, he does). Adapted from the cult book by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick lets the meaning of the story's title slip away within this medium--yet nothing is carelessly done, out of reach or out of bounds for Kubrick. He's meticulously menacing, and those who respond gleefully to the film are most likely subjects he would have eventually studied. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
State of mind,"I tried to watch this a couple of years ago - I couldn't. I just couldn't, because what I saw in the first minutes was too much for me. Now while some say that the violence is so over the top and dated it does nothing anymore to the viewer nowadays, I have to strongly disagree. The interviews on the disc are quite nice and the audio commentary is revealing quite a few things, as is the very in-depth look into Malcolm McDowell (with Q&A and other stuff).So after 10-15 minutes I had to stop - and everyone kept telling me, that there would be some redemption for all that mayhem. And in a way they were right - though also wrong. Especially considering the real ending to the book. And while I have not yet read that, the extras told me about it. But while you may feel blue about that, the movie could not have ended any other way. And Kubrick again is able to manipulate his audience, making them feel stuff (which incidentally they should not like at all - most of the things they are feeling - and maybe even feel a bit of guilt).It's also nice to hear, that Kubrick was open to ideas. And that he obviously had a conscience, which is something many thought he had not - especially watching this movie. So there are a few moments that were improvised but there were of course everything staged - and one of the biggest things is the sexual component in the movie - which has a big part combined with all the violence. There is too much sexual objects and hints - one might say it was kind of foreboding ... but then again, it seems to be human nature overall, so he just took something that was there and ran with it.There's so much to depict here - set design, framing/cinematography, dialog, mood, acting ... you could write about so many things, that all culminate in a great movie - if you can stomach to watch it of course",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It Disappoints me...,Recently saw A Clockwork Orange and I have to say I was disappointed in the end..I understand its art and all but to be a thriller it lacks the pace and perhaps the same movie within 100 minutes could have made a better impact on me..I had heard so much about it and a classic and all but seriously except Malcom Mcdowell's intriguing and terrific acting and vague imagery I cant write home anything else.For me its highly overrated.. Stanley Kubrick's other films like the shining and full metal jacket just enthralled me and the most important thing missing as per me in Clockwork is the thrill I suppose but i quite liked the ending..PS: Read the book it ll clarify more doubts and at least make u understand the meaning of the title..,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Meet one of the most deviant characters in cinema history,"I read somewhere that the late Stanley Kubrick was reputed to be against conventional and repressive forms of establishment.If that was so, then I believe that he potently expressed it in ""A Clockwork Orange.""Based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, the film introduces us to one of the most violent, amoral and deviant characters in cinema history---Alexander (but of all the film characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, whom I've encountered so far, he's the only one who has registered so strongly in my mind;and Malcolm McDowell's realistic and complex portrayal has greatly helped in making that happen).I can't forget the opening shot where, while we begin to hear his introductory voice-over narration, we see Alex, together with his fellow ""droogies,"" sitting idly on the floor and staring sharply at us, as the camera slowly pulls back and then we notice marble (or is it wax?) figures in strangely provocative poses.It serves both as an invitation and a warning:we're invited to take a peek into a ""new friend's"" visionary milieu, but then be prepared for the consequences.At first, one can't help but be disgusted at the atrocities---devilish and whimsical at best---that Alex and his gang have committed (they maul an old and sick beggar, involve themselves in a violent gang fight, barge into a quiet household, tie up the couple, torture the man and rape the woman).Alex even disdains his family and entices women (total strangers to him) into sex as if he were asking them for a dance in a party (and this might be so, if one is to have his own ""reading"" of the outrageous scene where Alex does sex with two pretty ladies in fast motion and to the tune of Rossini's ""Overture to Wilhelm Tell"").Such kind of ""rebellious"" attitude of Alex may strike one as being done out of youthful capriciousness---at best, a mere show just to satisfy some self-serving ends;nowhere is to be found any justifiable or rational basis at all.But not until the film reaches its critical point where Alex murders (with the use of a ""phallic"" furniture) a woman (who's fascinated with cats) when the latter aggressively refuses his advances does one start to rethink his/her thoughts.You have to see for yourself how Kubrick manipulates the narrative from this point on for the viewers to have a ""change of attitude"" toward Alex.After that, one can already make sense of Alex' ""rebellious"" attitude, for the conflict has become clear:it's Alex vs. all the conventional and (as it turns out) dubious forms of establishment---family, government, mass media, education and state.They have laid down the standards on how one must think, feel and act within a given system, but once it is achieved, they are at a loss as to what to make of the individual---to have a firm grip on him or to leave him out in the open---leading them in the end to play the game according to the rules set by the individual himself.And in Alex' case, as the state's program of reforming criminals and producing pliant citizens will be put to shame because of the former's failed suicide, the people concerned are now willing to fall on their knees before Alex---let Alex be what he is.""Now, I was finally cured"" has become a classic line.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The State captures one and tries to 'reform' him...using some quite disturbing techniques. Perhaps this film is about human nature and whether it can be changed or not.This film has many images that will stick with you forever-the sequence where the anti-hero discovers religion; the scene where the State tries to 'reform' the anti-hero, and some of the bizarre art featured in it-like the statues of the ladies in a bar, or the giant rocking gonad.A disturbing yet funny movie about bad eggs and 'remedies' for them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Vicious Socio-Political Satire That's Witty & Disturbing In Equal Doses!,"One of the most controversial, violent & disturbing films ever made, A Clockwork Orange is a meticulously crafted, ingeniously narrated & brilliantly performed cinema from Stanley Kubrick that presents the demanding perfectionist in sublime form as he blends violence, erotica, humour & classical compositions into one tightly structured & highly gripping sci-fi comedy to offer his biting take on morality, psychology & the importance of free will.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of A Clockwork Orange is set in the future Britain and follows Alex DeLarge; a delinquent youngster who leads a small gang of thugs, and covers his crime spree with his droogs, his subsequent capture by the police & his time in prison where he learns of an experimental aversion therapy which, if he manages to pass, will get him back on the streets but not everything during his rehabilitation goes the way he expected.Written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, A Clockwork Orange makes its intentions very clear within its opening moments that it isn't going to be an easy sit for its audience as just one evening of 'ultra-violence' perpetrated by Alex & his droogs is enough to scar many but this sadistic nature of the depicted violence exists for a reason and plays a vital role in the story's outcome for Kubrick here aims to critique the bigger problem than the evilness of an individual.Just like any other Kubrick film, A Clockwork Orange is a work of painstaking craftsmanship that presents the filmmaker in complete control of his craft. Although his vision of the future Britain may not be entirely convincing but some of its elements are much in tune with where the current society seems to be heading. Production design team come up with set pieces that brim with sexual undertones while the excessive use of white colour is one of Kubrick's own trademarks.Cinematography is inventive, influential & effectively carried out for the camera makes very efficient use of its bright colour palette, lighting, shadows, fluid movements & close-ups to capture the unfolding drama and encapsulates the whole picture with an otherworldly feel. Despite clocking in at 136 minutes, its pacing is never an issue. Plus, the seamless manner in which the already existing classical compositions are fused with its disturbing images is certainly amongst the film's most spectacular aspects.Coming to the acting department, A Clockwork Orange is pretty much a one-man show as Malcolm McDowell steals every moment with a charismatic but equally maniacal rendition of his character and his screen presence is so magnetic that it makes Alex DeLarge one of the most fascinating antiheroes to surface in cinema history. Although the performances by everyone, including McDowell may seem overly theatrical, it eventually works out in favour of the picture for it adds a sardonic element in an already bizarre narrative.On an overall scale, A Clockwork Orange has aged tremendously well over the years and only gets more rewarding on every subsequent viewing. Frightening & witty in equal doses, controversial on the grounds of its violent imagery yet an eye-opener when it comes to the subject of morality, this socio-political satire remains as relevant today as it was during its time of release and its critical take on mental conditioning that aims to control an individual by removing his or her ability to choose transcends the realms of psychology itself. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

What is the point of this movie? Sedition,"This was a shocking movie 34 years ago. FYI-it's no longer 34 years ago. Just thought y'all should know that.

It is supposed to cheer and encourage any young man to throw over the old farty bastards and establish a new order. And now we have the Clintons, and their hippie camp-followers . This was the movie which was supposed to set Malcolm McDowell's career on a high flight into the stratosphere. I find that a serious bad thing, because Malcolm didn't make it as a star. Malcolm is a genuine star, with acting qualities we all recognize. This movie really shocked me and caused mental damage-because I didn't have the mental discipline, or artistic maturity to absorb it. Oh well. I was a teenager and I will survive. This is a gigantically artistic movie for its time. It is elegant in its editing.

The actors are really, really bad - and even though the main character plays a villain, he seems more like a sissy retarded wimp. All I can remember from this so called ""movie"" is pain... I suffered through it all the time. I would rather get whipped 100 times than watch this horrible piece of s**t ever again. People ONLY love it because of it's satire of society, which makes no sense. For someone who knows how you actually make a movie, this is a joke. I can actually tell you about the ONLY time I watched it - it was when I was studying the art of film making. In class, the teacher told us we should watch it. Afterwards, our teacher said she actually likes the movie (like most people unfortunately do), but still, she told us this is NOT HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE. That says it all. And just for the record - this is the only movie that have actually managed to make me feel like a brainless weirdo who should go and bite my hands off, while I dance like a idiot.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The epitome of all 'art house' cinema.,"If A Clockwork Orange was a painting, today it would stand alone as a masterpiece, the jewel of Stanley Kubricks impressive crown, its value incalculable.After watching a film like ACO all preceding and subsequent viewings of movies (with the exception of a rare few) pale into significance and are easily forgotten compared to this engrossing, visually stunning, intelligent, shocking, darkly humorous, grand movie that it is. Forget this film in a hurry you will not. >From the perplexing opening scenes to the time the credits role the film grabs you by the ears (and eyes!) and doesn't let go.ACO is surely Kubricks defining masterpiece. The Background score is incredible (Beethoven anyone?), Malcolm McDowell is unbelievable and given his performance you can see why Kubrick said he wouldn't go ahead with the film if he couldn't get his signature.

We're finally doing that one,"Yep, here we go. The big one. My all-time favourite. It also just so happens to be its 50th anniversary this year, and what better way to give me hope for a better year than a dystopian film about an incompetent government?To be honest though, I don't think I, or anyone, can really tell you exactly why a certain film is their favourite, at least not if they've seen anything else that they can barely find a flaw in. It's just a case of ""because it is"" for me. There are other films I can find hardly anything wrong with - I mean, the last one I reviewed for example - but none of them come up to the same pedestal as this one.There's no other film I talk about as much to people to give them an idea of my tastes, no other film that better exemplifies a director at their absolute peak, and no other film that I cosplayed as the protagonist of for Halloween (not yet anyway), and to an extent, I can tell you why.I can tell you that Malcolm McDowell (and pretty much everyone else in it) has never been more perfectly cast, that the dialogue is hilarious and just weird enough to be interesting without being off-putting, that near every shot is beautifully framed and so memorable, that it's maybe the best example of a perfect three act structure I can think of, that the world is creepy and well realised, that the story manages to work with so many interesting themes and be political, psychological, and philosophical all at once, and that the soundtrack is nothing short of amazing......but ultimately, it's my favourite film of all time just because something about it clicks with me unlike anything else, and the same is probably true for your favourite film as well.The only thing I could maybe raise an eyebrow at is the few lines that sound a bit too on the nose, but other than that, it is Kubrick's masterpiece in my opinion, and just film in general's masterpiece.So viddy it, and viddy it well, my droogs :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Kubrick Classic,"A bleak version of Britain's near future where gang violence and crime is an everyday occurrence, a time and place where Alex, the protagonist of this movie played by Malcom MacDowell, feels right at home as a leader of a gang spending their time with acts of sexual violence and other criminal activities. This movie is raw, violent and wildly entertaining with it's characters, story, shots, set pieces and Kubrick's direction. One of the best movies to ever come out of Britain and a gem from the golden age of independent movie directors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The work of an Evil Genius,"If you watch this to gain extra depth from your discerning mind and senses, the more disturbing it becomes. Even though the violence is stylized, comical, choreographed and phony, the movie's theme is more repugnant than most Avant Gaurde and Noir film makers could even fathom making. This film, although groundbreaking in its shameless and willful ambition, has some flaws. The flaws are artistic choices that are meant to convey an idea while a few other flaws are just poor craftsmanship. The acting is quite uneven in some areas. The set designs, background settings along with inappropriate wide angle camera shots, for me, detract from the personal focal points required for me to get personally involved and connected. Most everything in Clockwork Orange looks too post 60's modern from the home decors, artwork, and some other set designs. It is highly unlikely that middle aged people will sport funky futuristic furniture and art in their home, especially in England. What's more off-putting was some of the dialogue and kitschy usage of British youth slang. And I think this turned off many viewers as well. I am convinced that Stanley Kubrick was a genuinely evil man. Whether or not one agrees with this charge is not important to me, but after I begin to make a compelling argument against this film from a moral standpoint, you may consider it. To begin, our protagonist and (Humble Narrator)is a sadistic villain, who, without any rationale or excuse, commits heinous crimes without giving any personal reasons for doing so. As we follow Alex and his gang of Droogs on this voyeuristic rampage we witness their assaults on innocent victims, both young and old. There aren't any social or anarchist purposes for doing so. They do it just for kicks. This fuels their rebellious spirit, and somehow we are supposed to admire them.As our Humble Alex gets arrested and sent to prison, we witness the process of rehabilitation through punishment and 'Aversion Therapy'. Once Alex pays the price and does his time he is chosen to be a guinea pig for a new experiment by a renowned psychiatrist. Alex goes through the grueling process through being administered of drugs and subjected to watching non-stop screen violence. Alex is cured, or reformed rather. He is sent out into the real world again for a second chance.This is the fatal moralistic flaw of the film and why I think the message is seriously wrong. While Alex is being confronted with hostility he gets ill and queasy when trying to fight off his temptations for revenge and self-defense. This is not necessarily the benefit he needs, but rather the benefit to society for those that had the misfortune of being in his presence. What we see is that Alex has not fundamentally changed in his character. He is still the dastardly menace he always was inside. The difference is that he has been conditioned to feel physically bad when giving into temptation. I'm not sure if this Scientific medical programming of the mind works as it is shown here, but if it is then we are faced with another controversial topic. The story reveals that as we are supposed to be appalled by violence and brutality it is even worse to nip the problem in the bud by sacrificing a sick person's natural instincts. This is a bad message. It is also an anti-establishment message. This movie has been lauded by many art house and cinema majors. I believe that these people imbue too much profundity and meaning into a film than doesn't exactly deserve much notoriety. Sure, Kubrick was a die-hard perfectionist who was dedicated to his craft. He was a true artist. And that is why I give this film 7 out of 10 stars. The effort, dedication, meticulous camera work and effective angles make for an effective movie. But it is what I call a really well made 'bad movie'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The most dangerous film ever made,"No matter how much you hear about this film, you can never prepare yourself for how you would react when you see it.The plot is simple. Little Alex (Mcdowell) is a dangerous threat to society. He gets captured. And with this, Burgess and Kubrick simply show why criminals should never be rehabilitated and why a healthy society needs violence and crime.To see this film is an exhilarating, alarming, shocking, disturbing, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, entertaining, uncomfortable, erotic, illustrious, spectacular, theatrical, surrealistic, realistic, horrific experience that no other film can ever match, but will try to match.From the opening scene where you see our stretch- eyed anti- hero and the wide open white space of the ""Karova milk bar"" you know you are going to witness something you never knew could exist.This film has so many influential and iconic elements, where can we begin to explain.The acting: Mcdowell is simply spectacular as Alex. His eye, his stare, his voice, his face, his nature, everything is just brilliant. I think his performance was more powerful than Kubrick could ever have imagined. In a few words- his iconic performance is over the top, restrained and a lot of fun. The rest of the cast is perfect, they just add the right amount of energy to make their performances adequate and to make McDowell shine for the star he is in this particular film.The directing: Kubrick is nothing short of one of Hollywood's greatest film directors and here we have yet another Kubrick masterpiece that proves it. He is the only director who truly knows how to capture the dark side of human nature with simple filming techniques.The set design: Futuristic retro minimalism has never looked better. This film is one big interior fantasy with everything from metallic wall papers, egg chairs, stainless steel and glass tables, furniture and walls accentuated with strong purples, blues, reds, yellows, metallics and just plain white.The score: A Haunting, beautiful, mysterious, exiting and complex noise. It suits the film so well that it feels like an extra character on every scene.This film is not for the faint hearted, not for the unintelligent and not for the self righteous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Orange you Glad?,"I know I'm going to be stepping on some cinephile toes with this rating. It should be no surprise to them, Stanley Kubrick is a controversial director. With films like ""The Shining"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" people either love them or hate them. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is probably his most divisive of his filmography.Despite the review being lower than most, I don't hate the film. I think it has some good things going for it. The premise is interesting enough that I want to read the book the film is based on. I like the bizarre 70's British version of a suppressive government. The idea of taking a despicable human and then having him brainwashed to make him averse to evil, is a clever concept.In execution, it is hard to watch. It is difficult to have a film without a central protagonist to root for. In typical Kubrick fashion, there are a lot of long takes. There is also a ton of nudity, and a fair amount of what they deem as ""ultra-violence"".

BRILLIANT!!! But read the book first if you want to understand it the first time through,"Okay, so many of the 10-star reviewers said they didn't like this movie the first time they watched it, but that they loved after repeated rewatchings. I'm telling you, if you want to understand it and LOVE it the first time through, read the book first! It's one of the best books of all time (just like the movie is one of the best movies of all time), and you'll get a head start on sorting out all the themes.Then watch the movie. See what Kubrick lends to Burgess's masterpiece. See the juxtaposition of classical music (actually much of it is from the Romantic Era, not the Classical Era) against ultra violence. See Malcolm McDowell's amazing act (and the amazing acting of pretty much everyone else in the cast). See his amazing turnaround(s), and marvel at the most disturbing happy ending of all times. Then leave the movie screen, unable to think of ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""William Tell Overture"" in the same way ever again.I won't go into great details to explain the plot, as you can find it on other reviews in this site. However, I will go on a bit farther to name random thinks I loved. Firstly: ""Singing in the Rain"" was more appropriate and more effective in this movie than it was in its own movie. Secondly, the humiliation scene was simply amazing, and very sad. Thirdly, the scene where ALex leaves his parents' house after they gave his room to a tenant made me cry and cry and cry and cry. Fourthly, the threesome played to the ""William Tell Overture"" is the BEST bit of fast motion in a movie. . . EVER!! Fifthly, everything else in the movie was amazing.Yes, so read the book first, and then watch the movie, and you'll enjoy them both immensely. Read the book also if you want to know the meaning of ""A Clockwork Orange"", because the movie never really explains it. Oh, and look past the violence and sex. My parents refused to watch it because of it, my sister walked out after the first ten minutes, and my brother wasn't able to see past it. But I was, and I marveled at what I found underneath. This isn't a light entertainment film, nor is it a glorification of violence. But to see that, you need a brain--scratch that, a functional brain that isn't allergic to a good workout.

"A thoughtful and stylish film, although deeply troubling.","Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was no stranger to controversy.  Even though most of his efforts were highly praised by critics everywhere, films like PATHS OF GLORY, LOLITA, and DR. STRANGELOVE rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. The same can be said about his 1971 film, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which received huge critical acclaim despite the fact that it is without a doubt the most notorious title in his filmography.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is indeed an excellent picture, but it's not hard to see why it has earned such a sordid reputation.Watching A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is like immersing yourself in a barbaric, futuristic nightmare.  The cops are corrupt, the government is increasingly intrusive, and the kids are getting their jollies from raping, robbing, and rumbling.  In other words, it's just like today--only much more surreal.Kubrick's vision of a violent, sadistic future is uniquely disturbing. Rather than showing the chaotic, digitized, robotized, post- or near-apocalyptic future that we're all used to seeing in other sci-fi movies, Kubrick opts for a colorful, vibrant, and unfittingly serene landscape.  The interiors are darkly lit and uncomfortably roomy, the furniture is gaudy and abstract, and the architecture is almost Escher-like in its complexity.  This sort of `neo-apocalyptic' setting is most likely what makes the film all the more alarming, since we as viewers are not accustomed to seeing such primitive acts of violence and barbarism atop a vibrant, modern-art backdrop.  Even the graphically violent scenes are orchestrated in an upbeat and dance-like fashion, such as the scene wherein Alex and his droogs sexually assault a woman to the tune of ""Singin' in the Rain"".The messages in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE are equally troubling.  The film clearly stresses the importance of the human right to a free will, but it also makes clear the problems that come along with such a right--namely, that given the choice, many people will choose to be hateful and vicious, simply because they can be.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE also seems to suggest that there is no hope for dangerous individuals such as Alex; that those who lack a conscience now will lack a conscience forever, regardless of what happens to them--a troubling message indeed.Though much of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is overtly shocking, it is still a relatively humble film.  It is evident that Kubrick had a lot to say with this movie, but rather than deliberately blurt his ideas at the viewer to get his point across, he wisely chose to implement the tiniest of subtleties in order to convey his messages.  This is what makes A CLOCKWORK ORANGE stay fresh and interesting, even with repeat viewings.  It is one of those films where no matter how many times one sees it, he will always pick up on something new.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

So disgusting I am amazed it ever made to the top 250!,"Usually, before watching any movie I look up IMDb to see its rating and viewers' comments on it. I did the same before seeing the Clockwork Orange. It said, mostly, yes, violence, yes, the main hero's a monster, but what a masterpiece! It seemed to deserve its place in the first 50 in the IMDb rating... Then I watched the film. And I believe it is one of the most disgusting films I ever saw. It is no doubt intended to be full of hidden significance, the grotesque manner in which characters speaks, move, dress, live. This is supposed to be ""new and frighteningly surrealistic"", a ""sharp, futuristic social satire"". The viewer is probably supposed to be saturated with disgust to the point that he/she realizes, oh my God, that's us! That's the worst part of a person in modern society, bla-bla-bla. Suppose, however, that you don't go along with this idea. What do you see then? You see an empty film. It is filled with violence that serves to get the oh-so-new idea of a social satire through. Because, you see, without it the viewer won't understand. He won't understand the idea of mixing English with misused and twisted Russian words. He won't understand that the Music line is supposed to be thought-provoking and not just stupid: ah, Beethoven and the Nazi, Beauty and the Beast, whatever. This film is two wasted hours of your life. After having watched it, you get the awful feeling you've been taken for an idiot.

Rings true to the very core,"This controversial film is been called out for a variety of reasons here and elsewhere. Its vision has been questioned, its adherence to Burgess' source material has been ridiculed, and its sex/violence has been called gratuitous, among many other things. One reviewer here states that ""art is the antithesis of violence"".I couldn't disagree more. To me, art is the expression of inner truth. Inner truth is singular to the individual, yet universal to a world that discards its own pretensions and value judgments in a sincere attempt to cathect. In general, the presentation of such art in our world is shaded, subtly and otherwise, by the artist's sense of gain/loss and right/wrong that is dictated by the outer world's expectations.In Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", there is no such shading - Alex's world is strikingly white-hot in its brilliance and in its pin-spot focus. This film presents its world simply as it is, as well as the characters who inhabit it. Episodes of sex, violence, tenderness, delusion, and manipulation are shown as clear-as-light, deep-focus images of the continuous whole. There is nothing false here - nothing. And accordingly, the impact of the film rips to the core of the viewer's own sense of inner truth.To quote the shopworn phrase, they don't make movies like this any more, and even for its time, this film stands out as a staggering accomplishment.Let it take you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Might as well be Kubrick's finest,"Malcolm McDowall's Alex is easily one of the best leads ever to make it to celluloid, he's truly a thing to see. Alex is just right, the right mannerisms, the right tone of voice, the right expressions. They say no movie can compete with a person's imagination. They are wrong. I've read the book, but this interpretation of it is better than I could ever imagine. Just the inspired narration already gives you the idea that you're watching something brilliant. A lot of the genius to this movie is in the way the violence is handled. Innocent people get beaten up all the time, and Kubrick manages to make it look really beautiful. The classical music is a great touch as well. I watch Kubrick movies mainly for the stories that are always well-developed and the cinematography, but the actors steal this movie. Not that Kubrick's efforts are any less remarkable though. I'm running out of hyperboles, but this is a marvellous work, one of Kubrick's true masterpieces.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Indelibly Remarkable even till this date.,"From the first frame till the last one, 'A Clockwork Orange' is intriguing, thought-provoking, meticulous and brilliant, like most other Kubrick films. The screenplay, cinematography (colourful & exquisitely photographed), set-design (very modern for its time), acting, background score - every aspect is almost flawless.The story is a dark satire on a futuristic world, where they try to eradicate violence by conditioning criminals to abhor violence and sex by watching gory movies. Their (criminals') morals remain the same, but they just can't indulge in violence anymore; they become defenseless. The movie gives rise to so many topics of discussion, and you can debate all day long on the different themes it explores. Ultimately, the primary theme - if a human is stripped of his own choice of good and evil, he simply becomes mechanical, like 'clockwork'.Alex DeLarge, the ""humble narrator"", the anti- hero, is one of the most important and fascinating characters in English Cinema.The story, and its adaptation, is much ahead of its time. The liberties Kubrick takes in the field of violence and sex (in 1971) are quite commendable. No wonder it caused such a stir during the time of its release. Even after so many years, the movie can be enjoyed completely - it speaks so much about violence, youth agitation, gangs, criminal reforms, politics, etc., which are relevant even today.Final Word - 'A Clockwork Orange' remains indelibly remarkable even till this date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
... a hugely original and stylish film that is compelling and very shocking.,"A Clockwork Orange is a powerful and disturbing film that never seems to even attempt to condemn the violence it shows. It is extremely stylish in its look and sound with outrageous costumes and sets and a sinister electronic soundtrack often based on works of Beethoven. Malcolm MacDowell gives an extraordinary performance as Alex, the film's protagonist. For the first half of the film Alex is cold and unfeeling but once he has been imprisoned and given a shocking new conditioning therapy, he becomes a sympathetic character, someone whose life has been destroyed by a cruel justice system. The scene in which Alex goes back to his home after his release and is thrown out by his parents is actually quite moving as you really feel for the character however cruel and heartless he has been earlier in the film. The scene in which Alex is actually given the conditioning therapy and forced to watch scenes of extreme violence is one of the most terrifying and disturbing scenes ever made. Kubrick injects A Clockwork Orange with moments of very dark humour throughout. This adds to the shocking nature of the violence as most scenes of violence are actually played for laughs, however sick they are. The only bad thing about Kubrick's film is that he changes the ending from the original one in Anthony Burgess' novel. The original gives the message that the only thing that will reform a criminal is if he wants to change himself. Kubrick seems to be saying that someone like Alex cannot change at all and the evil inside him is always there. Overall,a hugely original and stylish film that is compelling and very shocking. A Clockwork Orange will not be to everyone's taste but watch it with an open mind and you will see what is possibly one of the best films of the last 30 years.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best Kubrick work I've seen so far,"The movie goes on strong in all of its scenes and sequences. From the quirky and mysterious opening, to the utterly crazy first chapter of the story, to the explicit depiction of forced brainwashing, to the 'full circle' final chapter and the conspiracy theory ending. The movie is a great work for me because it can make me feel two different types of attitude towards Alex. At first I was utterly disgusted by what he and his gang do in their spare time on the first chapter. But then when the 'full circle' revenge is exacted by the cripple, I was kind of sorry for him to have endured such atrocities. But then the feeling return back to normal when the conversation with the psychiatrist happens. The acting is okay in overall.

A bit of the ol' ...,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Stanley Kubrick only made 11 feature films, and there have been arguments made for all 11 to be considered cinematic classics. This one must surely be included with Spartacus, Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and The Shining as films that are safe and secure in movie history. Based on the novella from Anthony Burgess, the focus on Alex makes this an extremely uncomfortable film to watch, even 41 years after original release.Malcolm McDowell is just terrific as Alex, the sadistic, remorseless, psychotic leader of a pack of hoodlums who terrorize innocents just for the sake of doing so. To emphasize Alex's distorted view of society, Kubrick utilizes a wide-angle lens to show us his Point of View. There is much commentary in the film and most of it is quite obvious. One of the least discussed is the interaction of Alex and his ""droogs"". When they tire of his relentless power-mongering and the lack of big scores from all of their criminal activity, we see how young thugs would handle such a situation.There is also much criticism directed at the British government and the world of psychiatry, especially mind-control. Kubrick obviously had extreme views on these topics as he went off-track from the source material to make his points. The idea of moral choice being the distinguishing factor of a man could be debated, but seems logical when contrasted with the anti-violence rehabilitation system favored by the minister.There are some fascinating visuals with the milk-plus bar, the artwork and wide-angle lens ... especially when focused on Patrick Magee's face during the rape scene. Also, the use of Ludwig van Beethoven to put Alex in the mood for ""ultra-violence"", and then his subsequent song and dance to ""Singin in the Rain"", show what the other side of music can mean to those not quite right in the head.The film received four Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, though sadly, McDowell was not recognized. While there is much in the film that is difficult to watch, the brilliance of the material, script, acting and directing are a treat for movie lovers.

Kubrick's weird sense of humor,"We could spend hours talking about Kubrick's social satire, but we all know the truth. The real reason we all love ""A Clockwork Orange"" is that it's an over-the-top, ill-mannered, pitch-black, trippy comedy that makes fun of totally unfunny subjects. You won't laugh for a second, but will feel your Gulliver's right sagittal stratum gloating instead. Combine this with the stylish visuals, the nonsensical slang, and the iconic use of classical music, and you have one of Kubrick's best (and most misunderstood) films.Tonally and thematically, it's surprisingly close to ""Full Metal Jacket"". Both make fun of tragic events, both highlight the dangers of dehumanization and psychological conditioning as weapons of a corrupted system, both accept the savage nature of human beings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not bad but way too overrated,"This film was by no means bad. It just isn't great as everyone  says. Why are these teen's are whatever they are beating/raping people? They have no motive. They're not poor. they live in a futuristic society without a gov't but that's no motive. And who and why are there cops if there's no gov't? There are so many plotholes in this movie it made me lose any enjoyment. So if there's all these plotholes, then how is this a masterpiece? Cause it's violent and has naked chicks and has one memorable scene(the film/cure scene)? The directing isn't great either. Kubrick definitely improves drastically later on and becomes a phenominal director, but this proves his amaturety at this point. Everything just has a corny look to it. I couldn't take any of it seriously. It was too tedious. This is the kind of movie I'd want to be dark and serious and disturbing. And the cheeze-ball music makes it even more rediculous. The last complaint is the horrible representation of a futuristic society. Some scenes look less futurstic than today's look and other's have an obviously fake futuristic atmosphere. OVerall, this movie is just....stupid is the only word. Not bad. Just stupid. Had it been done in the past ten years by Kubrick, I think this movie could've had much more merit and deserve to be overrated.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

read the book...,"Kubrick got it all wrong.  the main problems with the movie were the tempo, the art direction, and most of all Kubrick's twisted obsessions and interpretations.  He may have been bound into the futuristic sixties-mod style, but it does not fit the book or subject matter.  The movie drags on and on and on at a snails pace, completely against the flow of action in the book.  And then there's Kubrick's own personal perversion.  He, if you've seen moer of his work, loves nudes.  everywhere you look in this movie there's nude paintings, and statues, and various impressionistic nudes and classical nudes and marble nude statues which pour drugged milk from the nipples.  though i am not opposed to nudity in various forms, it completely destroyed the purpose and mood and theme and everything that was good about the book.  and it was all so clean!  anyway, the movie hit rock bottom for me when instead of accidently killing an old woman with a small statue(like in the book), he crushed her head with a giant ceramic penis.  I cant tell you how the end was, i couldn't watch it all the way through and had to shut it off, i was that disgusted.  just read the book, dont bother with this horrible interpretation.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Yes, It Certainly Is One Of The Most Essential Pieces Of Cinema. The Amount Of Influence and Power ""A Clockwork Orange"" Has Had On The World Is Truly ""Majestical""","Controversy is a popular aspect in the world of art, people flock to see something that is seen to be offensive or shocking in one form or another. This goes for the infamous A Clockwork Orange, famously known for being one of the most controversial films of all-time. I would say it lives up to its title, especially when you look at it from the perspective of a viewer in '71. A Clockwork Orange still holds up today as being a frighteningly disturbing portrait of a ruthless mind. Though not quite as graphic as one might expect, the film holds no bars on its disturbingly genuine nature and shocking content, though all of this is a primary factor of the film's moral. A Clockwork Orange is neither exploitive, nor degrading because all the content is in equilibrium with the importance and startling impact of the film.Adapted from Anthony Burgess' novel, A Clockwork Orange follows the futuristic story of the foul, repulsive and oddly intelligent sickening screwball Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of ""droogs"". They prowl the nights with their disgusting habits of terror and take out their undesirable temperament on the unsuspecting public. Alex eventually gets arrested and put upon a scientific rehabilitation program which is supposed to make the degenerates of society ""normal people"" and eventually making it impossible for Alex to commit any kind of wrongdoing. The experiment does not quite go according to plan for the young hoodlum.For a film of such fierce, challenging, depressing and wildly vivid nature there is still so much wonder and beauty to be found from it. The sheer magnitude of the film's unparallelled intelligence, entertainment value and ingenuity is something that will grasp even the most easily offended or unpredictable of viewers. Whether you like or dislike A Clockwork Orange remains to be seen (yes, it is certainly a film that does not appeal to all tastes) because you will undoubtedly respect for many reasons.The audacious title, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is quite possibly the finest film-title ever imagined, it helps you understand the film and primarily represents the ""controlled mechanism for maintaining society"". Ultimately, Alex becomes artificial on the outside, while still being perverted at heart. The number of morals and ethics discussed throughout the film is something that deserves the utmost appreciation of the literature essays the novel and film receives in schools around the world. Violence is an emblem of human nature, yet it is something that should be restrained and compressed through self-control. The film shows how even the most cruel and vile of human beings still have humane rudiments. The film goes into studying youth frustration, the rebellion in youth, individuality, philosophy, the breeding of control, , society ranks, conformity, realising one's problems, being ""somebody"" rather than ""something"", freedom (being reborn/revitalised) and how violence breeds violence. The film gives such a wonderful message and also morals for its viewers, yet sadly it is one that has been cruelly misinterpreted by the more immature viewers. The film's final line sums up a lot about what I have mentioned above in the notoriously clear, resounding and extraordinary image.Legendary director Stanley Kubrick gives a visionary adaptation from page to screen, giving the film a versatile and unique quality. The use of colourful and techno set-pieces creates the mad-world, which is so close to our own. There are so many tiny details the film holds, everything from the astonishingly unforgettable makeup to the masterful facial expressions from Malcolm McDowell all help to create a timeless experience in visceral film-making. The adaptable use of poetic slang makes you apart of the gang experience, putting you into the shoes of the one of the ultimate anti-heroes. It is poetry brimming with a glorious elegance and harsh boldness. The use of quirky dark comedy is hysterical and at the same time bewildering helping to make the viewing even more immersive. The editing it magnificently displayed through a graceful use of slow-motion and fast-forward scenes, the film's bare style is truly stunning. Malcolm McDowell's performance is one of the greatest character performances of all-time, Kubrick's casting decision is beyond perfect offering an actor the role of a lifetime.Some people have accused this vivid spectacle of a social commentary of being self-absorbed or aching mass attention. I don't see A Clockwork Orange as that, rather it's quite the opposite, it gives people a discussion point and a discussion point that questions one's own views. A Clockwork Orange asks the viewer for their own opinion and their own conclusion for a story that is so surreal, yet, still being so sincere about the society we live in.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ultra Brilliance,"The future never looked so much like 1971 than in A Clockwork Orange and that could be a problem if you saw the film in 1971 but looking at it in 2004, the past starts to look the same as the future because both seem worlds away.A Clockwork Orange is one of my favorite books and one of my favorite films. I like the artificiality of the language in Anthony Burgess' book and I like the artificiality of the sets and the costumes in Stanley Kubrick's film.  The fact that Malcolm McDowell is way too old for the role is just another example of the artifice.  But McDowell is perfectly mischievous and you can't imagine anyone else as Alex.The violence is operatically sinister and exhilarating and that can cause problems for satirically challenged viewers.  But irony is the most interesting and effective way to tackle the subject of violenceIt is well known that Burgess' last chapter was left out of the American book version and out of Kubrick's film and that, without that chapter, the author's point was lost.  Burgess believed that a clockwork orange did not exist, meaning that man is not destined to be either wholly good or wholly evil because of control of god or the state - because free will exists. Since the film ends with evil Alex made `good' by the state, and thus being `cured, alright' he is a clockwork orange and that was not the message that the author meant to convey.  But it is a powerfully memorable ending to an amazing film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Good movie, but too complex for this type of movie.","They say Stanley Kubrick has always been ahead of his time, and considering the age of this movie, that is probably true, this is a very a sharp critical movie, still it contains a high amount of social realism though, it's a twisted movie that is very hard to sit through, but leaves you thinking.Alexander De Large and his gang is a product of a numb society, for fun they entertain themself with violent acts towards whomever crosses their way, Alex is the leader of the gang, the others go in his path and does what he wants, one day though two of them objects and wants to be equal, Alex doesn't agree and starts a fight, after that things go back to normal, Alex in charge, but his gang is no longer his friends. He is betrayed and is sent to a prison, to get out early he volunteers for a program that is supposed to help him out of his violent path.Kubrick has always had a very experimental style, and even though this mvoie is hard to watch, it's still very powerfull and have a very realistic (even though the movie itself is portrayed unrealistic and fantasy alike). The movie spends a lot of time on the act of violence, and Kubrick's morale point of view is never in doubt, but then again, it always appears to be in doubt, because i dont think that i ever managed to figure out completely what the meaning was with the plot, just as i thought i was on a straight path, understanding everything, the movie turns and goes in the opposite direction, it's definetely a complex movie, that for full understanding has to be watched more than once, problem also is that it's hard to sit through, Kubrick uses the soundtrack perfectly, especially in the start, Beethoven is nearly constantly playing, but as soon as Alex is arrested, it stops. And from here it only plays occasionally as he gets cured, but in the end the path comes back to hunt him, together with the music.Of course this is Kubrick's movie, his directing habits shines through in all his movies, because he is a genius, and a true master, this movie is very powerfull, but i think also maybe too complex. Kubrick has his own style and his own way of saying it, i think not all will understand this movie, but the ones that do will think it's a masterpiece, this movie will divide the audience, some will understand it and think it's brilliant, another large group will think it's jibberish, and then there'll be the ones still trying to figure out how all the puzzles fits together, the movie is very symbolic, colors and music displays a lot of the meaning of the movie. In one remarkable scene in the start we see Alex and his gang attacking an elderly man sitting in a tunnel, as Alex and his gangs walks in their shadows grow long down towards the old homeless man, i think this specific scene tells a lot about what the initiave with the movie is, it's a symbolic movie. Which is also one of the reasons why i believe it has to be watched more than once for full understanding.Another thing that is interesting in this movie is the special use of the language, it's obvious that Kubrick was thinking in a futuristic style while taping the movie, the language is unique and gives the movie a weird touch, though interesting, the movie is very experimental as other Kubrick movies, it does seem like he is trying to look into the future and predict the future of a numb society.Malcolm McDowell is Alexander De Large, and he fills out this complex and interesting character very well, he is the only of the chracters that shines through, all the others pretty much fades to the background, perhaps because the story doesn't stop at them long, there are many supporting characters playing various roles and they all appear in different parts of the movie for a little while.The movies strength is definetely the directing and storyline, Kubrick dared to check chances, a movie like this nobody else could have made at this time, he is unique and that's what shines through in this movie, this experimental director has created a movie that will and should never be forgotten, because it's a landmark in cinematic history. However, to me it doesn't stand as the masterpiece of all time, mainly becuase it's too complex, and at times too long, but the complicated way it's directed is what makes it hard to understand, so for me it's both a strength and a weakness, strength because it's unique and original and it will stay in your thoughts for a good while, weak because it's very hard to absorbe and understand, and it's almost definate that it has to be watched more than once for full understanding, something that isn't always a good thing, especially considering that it isn't an easy movie to sit through.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

An 10 rating easy.,"Yes, the underlying message is answered: Can a criminal (or truly evil person), (who genuinely enjoys his evil deeds); be made into a decent person, fit to mix in with society, via being programmed to experience suffering whenever an evil deed is contemplated?? The evil deeds here are (fundamentally) rape & murder (without the possibility of even the slightest hint of remorse.)That aside;This is a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. Yes, it's contains anmple ugly graphic violence. His direction is genius. The way he plans/stages scenes, is so impactful. It's truly surreal.I don't know anybody who is a big Malcom McDowell fan, (me included), but his narration (and spoken words) throughout the movie are always mesmerizing. And here's an interesting point about the English: Their mastery over the English language. Even though the main character is a murderous teenage thug, who despises education as much as he does authority; his application of the English language is nevertheless, not just poetic at times, but astonishingly proper & frequently, pleasing to the ears. My wife commented on it so many years ago. McDowell, had not merely the role of a lifetime, but it's a performance that transcends many famous names among those within his trade. Talk about perfect casting, this is a prime example.The movie moves well. It covers many years and does so seamlessly.This circles back to Kubrick's direction. McDowell's hypnotic performance is facilitated by Kubrick's sets, lighting, camera angles, and so much more. A movie of real 'atmosphere'. Some of this is cultural perhaps, but I'd be surprised if most Brits didn't agree with my assessment. Many scenes define the word 'engrossing'. Actually, all things considered, this is truly an epically great film.We've owned it on blu ray because of the excellence of Kubrick's unique directing style and McDowell's performance. We venture a viewing once every few years.Not one of wife's favorite movies because of the horrible violence, but she does agree it's difficult to stop watching once you've started. It really holds one captive.Compared to others in the Kubrick collection, including; The Shining, Lolita, Full Metal Jacket & Barry Lyndon, I rate 'A Clockwork Orange' number 1.I HIGHLY recommend.Bob R.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Lacks dept on the main character and realism on choreographs,"I watched this movie the first time years ago, before having read the book, and I thought it was good.
Now, years after, I had forgot quite a lot about the movie and I read the book without the influence of the movie.
Now I've seen the movie again, and I can see how much is lacking. Is not a bad movie, Kubrick's cinematography is always interesting, and the movie actually has every part or scene from the book, so is not a totally bad adaptation, and the story is told whole and quite faithfully.
Still I felt like it lacks emphasis in very important aspects of the original story, which shows how violent and hateful is Alex and really hardcore violence though the whole story, but not gratuitous, violence is as important as any other character in this case.
This movie is from 1971, so I totally understand the violence being a bit lowered, still, the choreographs look quite silly and fake, and in my opinion makes the hole thing look more ridiculous than shocking. Using better angles and lighting could have help achieving better and more realistic results on this matter.
Then, the initial part where Alex hangs out with his gang and we see how vicious, skilled in violence and smart he is, and how dominant he is with them and also with his family is totally lost in the movie, which makes the character's dept and the whole sense of conflict on the audience on if the ""treatment"" he receives is absolutely unnecessary. Here he's almost a nice guy.
Also I felt it was overacted a lot of times, acting wasn't great in my opinion.
Then, and this is totally my taste, the psychedelic atmosphere Kubrick's version has is not completely to my liking or how I imagined it while reading, but still a fair point to experiment by the director and it's undoubtedly interesting.
Good movie over all but in the end, it falls short in depth of the characters (the main mostly) and a bit overacted, but the story is there and it has a visual twist from the director to make it feel fresh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Greatest Book Adaptation Ever,"In 1971 Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt the cult novella A Clockwork Orange. Stanley was no stranger to controversy (he adapted the novel Lolita back in 1962), but the firestorm associated with this film would make Lolita look like a Disney film by comparison. The film takes place in a futuristic England and centers around Alex DeLarge, a psychopathic teenager who leads a gang of thugs and rapists. He and his ""droog"" (friends) speak in a special slang called Nadsat, which was invented by the author of the book. Alex is played by Malcolm McDowell. To get an idea how good he was in this role, check out the rest of his work. Nearly every role he played after this had roots in this villain (especially Caligula). He also was the first person in a Kubrick film to use the maniacal stare that Stanley transfered to Nicholson in ""The Shining"" and Vincent D'Onofrio in ""Full Metal Jacket.""In typical Kubrick fashion, the film leaves all endings and assumptions to the viewer. In fact, even the genre of the film is subjective. For some, it is a thriller that follows one sociopath's voyage through the criminal justice system. For others, it is a morality play that questions just how far the government can go. I see it as a dark comedy that tackles both of the aforementioned subjects. Kubrick blends the genres in a way that had not been done before and has not been seen since. When it was released it was considered disturbing because of its depictions of violence and rape. The truly disturbing feature of the film is that it can make you laugh at these heinous crimes. You'll laugh your head off then be ashamed of yourself.It will take multiple viewings to comprehend the genius of this film, but it's the only film that I've ever had to watch more than once that is immensely entertaining upon first viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

However, I suspect if one lives in an inner city or ghetto area of many large cities one may be able to relate more to the chain of events.The film is a tad predictable, hence no higher than seven stars from me. Nonetheless, the plot does suggest a horrible place for society to end up at in the event social fabric disintegrates and a virtual law of the jungle prevails.Only for the politically aware and socially conscious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A provocative and polemic Kubrick work with outstanding acting by McDowell,"In the Britain of the near future , a sadistic punk leads a gang on nightly rape and murder sprees. As a prime misfit , Alex with his gang wearing white garments and top hats and riding in a sport car. The killer and his band carrying out rampage and destruction , they're determined to wipe out vagrants , wealthy people and executing panic and ravage at homes where assault , rape and mistreat inhabitants . Then he is captured and becomes the subject of a grim experiment to eradicate his violent tendences in this extraordinary rendition based on the homonymous novel.

The Breakthrough Presentation of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange For The Millions Who Were Not Allowed To See It Until Now!A scathing satire on a society in the not so distant future with awesome performance by Malcolm McDowell as the outlandish, fierce and funny psychopath . Dealing with the disturbing adventures of a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. The picture turns out to be an exhilarating experience with many memorable and unsettling sequences , including a rape conducted while assailant McDowell belts ¨Singing in the rain¨. This interesting story contains irony , suspense , grisly killlings , lots of violence while our starring executing a criminal spree , and along the way submitted to Ludovico experiment before the final takes a slight twist . Resulting to be a vivid adaptation of Anthony Burguess's controversial novel that was too strong for some to stomach in 1971 and it remains potent nowadays . The Clockwork Orange's visuals clashed head-on with the European rigid moral , similarly other films at the time, and resulting in submitting these thorny pictures on the moral principles and being heavily censored. That's why censors wished to clamp down on any kind of erotic images , extreme violence , nudism or subversive ideas. Today , it has rating R edited from X rating. Surprisingly, however, ¨Clockwork Orange¨ premiered uncensored at a long-running versiion at a Catholic film festival , the "" Seminci"" in Valladolid, located in one of Spain's most conservative cities .It displays colorful and glimmer cinematography in color-scope by John Scott. Even by today's standards, it would be good, provided someone cared to restore brightly colour , perfect editing , and natural sound . The motion picture was competently directed by the great Stanley Kubrick . His film debut was Fear and desire (1953) , not very successful Kubrick movie , belonging to his early period when he made black and white , low budgeted flicks as the Film Noir : ""Killer's Kiss"" , ""The Killing"" and continuing with one of the best wartime pictures : ""Paths of Glory"" produced and played by Kirk Douglas .

s%#t-sandwich,"Anthony Burgess wrote a wonderful novel. In fact, it is one of my favorites. This movie is such an awful misrepresentation of that book that I have to choke back vomit whenever it is mentioned.

Astonishing,Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess novel is so well done as a satire against British Socialism in the 1960s. Well ahead of its time. Striking parallel to what's happening in US today. All the violence and lawlessness with no penalty to the youth for misdeeds Or very light penalties.

A missunderstood movie and an equally misunderstood man,"This movie is not intended to congratulate criminals, or encourage violent crimes in anyway. It's intent was to show that we have to make our decisions ourself, no other human-being can. The main reason why it is misunderstood is because it excludes the 21st chapter that is in the book. This chapter tells of Alex's redemption, and his need to settle down. Alex wrong. Plain and simple, Anthony Burgess would never condone rape, for his wife was raped. But Alex realizes this at the end when he can think for himself and a ""treatment"", as it were, was not thinking for him. In other words, if you had a disability would you want someone taking care of you constantly, always making a fuss. No it's disconcerting, as humans we want to learn for ourself and be self-sufficient. That's what this is about. Alex got his punishment in jail, and out of jail, but in the end the human brain prevailed and he recognized the err of his ways. I strongly suggest to anyone confused after the movie to go read the book. This will help you to understand the reasoning of it being taken from Alex's perspective. In closing I would like give my condolences to Christiane Kubrick on the loss of her husband. He was a genius and his legacy is left in films like this one.

Kubrick at his best,"I was nervous and skeptical going into this film. I don't have a strong stomach for sexual assault and violence in films. But, at the recommendation of my Film Studies teacher, I took the plunge and entered the bleak, ultra-violent world of Alex Delarge.What a plunge it was. Everything about this film is perfect. The acting, cinematography and the music being the standouts. Kubrick made this film perfectly and the actors brought that to life. My one complaint is that the second act tends to drag, and is pretty boring. But the third and first acts more than make up for it.I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Even if you're put off by the sexual assault in the film, I encourage you to watch it. The scenes in question are fleeting and not very graphic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pure cinema,"There are only really two negatives I could find with this film (and they are very minor). Firstly I could have done a little more scene setting and orientation just to help ground me. I also thought there were some slight pacing issues and the film dwelled on certain areas longer than was perhaps needed.Aside from this A Clockwork Orange is brilliant. Kubrick's direction is sublime, what more can I say about it that hasn't been said already? The performances are top class all around, particularly from Malcolm McDowell. The story is intriguing and well put together.A brilliant piece of cinema and one that rightly deserves its spot as a timeless classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An ultra-great movie,"With his excellent, but violent movies like for instance Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill..., Quentin Tarantino is seen as one of the best directors ever. And yet, what he does isn't all that renewing. Stanley Kubrick did it before him in 1971, more than 20 years earlier, in a decade where violence in movies wasn't yet as tolerated as it is today. So in a way, Kubrick was more ground breaking than Tarantino will ever be (Not that I'm not a fan of QT's work, I certainly am).This is how the story goes: In the UK, somewhere in the near future, Alex is the leader of a gang of teenagers. He enjoys rape, violence, everything sadistic and ... Beethoven's classical music. They spend their nights terrorizing anyone who they might encounter. One night, they break into the house of a woman with a lot of cats and kill her, but than his gang turns on him and leaves him to the police. He is sentenced to 14 years in prison, but he finds a way to get out of prison soon. The government needs more prison cells for political prisoners and all he has to do is to be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment should change violent people into good, sweet and loving people, who are no longer able to even think about violence. Alex immediately agrees, because than he'll be able to get out of prison soon and return to society as a good and honest man. But the experiment has some unforeseen side-effects. He nearly dies and his case becomes a major embarrassment for the government, who arranges to cure him of his cure.What may be the most thought-provoking about this movie is the contrast between all the violence and the beautiful classical music, composed by Beethoven (I guess the man himself could never have imagined his music would be used in such a context). What you see is awful and the music accentuates that even more, but thanks to the music it also seems to be more ""digestible"". But don't think this movie is a celebration of cheap violence, it certainly isn't. If you look closer, you'll see that it's against violence, but also against any dictatorial government who thinks it should control its citizens by any means.Perhaps it is all a bit difficult to understand what I mean and I guess you'll have to see the movie for yourself to fully understand it, perhaps even more than once. Only after several viewings, this movie will get fully through to you. And after you've seen it at least once, you'll agree with me that this is an absolute masterpiece and that it deserves a full 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the most disturbing films ever,"This is stanley kubricks most daring film. And one of the strangest films I have ever seen.

Many things have been said about this controversial movie. In my opinion, it is a little too long. Everything is exaggerated and irrational in the movie. Therefore, Kubrick's efforts in rationalizing the ineffectiveness of treatment are completely pointless.

Individual Free Will vs. Government Control,"In a near future, Alexander ""Alex"" DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of a ultra-violent and cruel gang of delinquents composed by Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus) and Dim (Warren Clarke). They drug themselves and commit acts of violence, beating beggars and people, raping women, fighting other gangs and robbing. Alex adores The Symphony No. 9 by Beethoven and lives with his parents. When he has a friction with his team, he attacks them to impose his leadership. When they go to a closed spa to rob the owner, who is a lonely lady that has many cats, Alex breaks into the house and kills her, hitting her face with a phallic sculpture. When he leaves the house, Dim hits him with a bottle in his face and he is arrested by the police. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison but two years later, he learns that the government has an experiment that releases the criminal after two weeks of treatment. Alex volunteers himself to the experiment without knowing the price he has to pay.In 1971, Brazil was living a severe military dictatorial period and ""A Clockwork Orange"" was forbidden and banned from my country. If you were lucky, you might borrow an imported book with the story from a friend, and the greatest curiosity was the glossary to understand many words in Nadsat. In 1978 or 1979, this film was released in Brazil in one cinema only in Rio de Janeiro (Cine Veneza) and took hours in the line to get the ticket. The censorship ordered that the women sexes in the rape scenes were covered with a black circle, making the audience laugh a lot in the dramatic rape scenes and the black circle jumping on the screen to cover the sex. Stanley Kubrick was a visionary and foresaw ultra-violence that did not exist at that time and now is common in the news in the present days. Malcolm McDowell has an impressive performance in the role of Alex and deserved the Oscar of Best Actor for this film. The discussion of individual free will vs. State control is raised based on the ""afterlife"" of Alex after being brainwashed. Does the state have the right to destroy the life of a criminal the way Alex was submitted, and many victims of dictatorships are destroyed through torture is the great theme of this unforgettable movie.

Fascinating politics,Plenty of female nudity although most of it in the wrong tone. Beautiful camera movement and angles. Stunning imagery conveyed through set design and makeup. A bit boring in terms of surround but the music is excellent. The dialogue is fine but lacking depth. The sound effects are sometimes a bit ropey. An interesting story well told. It has some fascinating political undertones. It is a full circle movie where the story makes sense from beginning to end referencing earlier encounters and making every shot important. Every aspiring director should watch this to get a sense of content and how to pack it in.

Dystopia!!,"Dystopia! That was the first word that came to my mind when I completed the movie. I could not believe how people like Alex, and his droogies(a slang used by Alex for his friends), can do such things so brazenly. Alex is presented an opportunity to be released early, if he volunteers for an untested experiment called Ludovico technique; which he readily accepts. When the aftermath of the experiment is shown, the viewer starts to feel sorry for Alex, which is strange, because he has not actually changed, he just can't do the things he wants to, without getting physically sick.I loved the Music. I loved the score, and the soundtrack, and the classical symphonies included. Some of the places the music pops will leave the viewer speechless, will leave the viewer disgusted, or angry, and that is the best thing about 😘😘I loved the cinematography. The way in which some of the scenes were shot was amazing.I loved the acting of everyone, the gangs, the doctors, the parents, and especially the droogies.

Violence made to seem beautiful- a reflection of human nature?,"Violence made to seem beautiful- a concept that repulses many, and rightfully so. However violence is deeply embedded in human psychology and in society. Clockwork Orange uses a stunning sound-track and stylized English argot as a backdrop to choreographed extreme violence to bring across this point. The association of Beethoven's Ninth and Nazi horrors exemplifies how thin the veneer of civilization really is. Can the sociopathic human really be change, and if yes into what, is a second aspect that the picture explores. Beyond the major sociological point raised by the film, it is a masterpiece of atmosphere and setting, exemplifying the strength of cinema as the major art form of our time.

This is one of the best Kubrick films I have seen yet.,"""A Clockwork Orange"" was always a book and a movie that were both forbidden due to extreme violence and coarse matter. Like any young guy, I acquired an interest to see it one day.So now, as a teen, I can say that I have read the book, and also seen the movie. The book is one of the best novels I have read yet. It is amazing how foresighted and smart Anthony Burgess was in making such a book. Then, who decides to make it a movie? Stanley Kubrick. I had seen some of his other films, and I was eager to see ""A Clockwork Orange"".The film is a very good film, most especially thanks to the talented Malcolm MacDowell, the directing skills of Kubrick, and the story itself.Malcolm gives such an amazing act as the villainous youth Alex de Large, who is a youth in a futuristic England, where hoods and teens rule the night streets with a savage immorality. Rape, violence, and rebellion are the order of the day, and Alex loves it. Then he is apprehended by the police, and his journey leads him to a dreadful new experiment. I would have to say that I could not imagine anyone apart from Ewan Macgregor (TRAINSPOTTING) that could even match to the stunning, Oscar-worthy performance of MacDowell.Kubrick is a very good director, who ranks alongside Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese as my three favourite directors. His films inspire thought, interest, and entertainment. His methods of direction truly pay off in this adaptation to ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's a pity that he was soon to be despised as a reclusive pervert from this film. He did an amazing job, and I admire him for it.Finally, the last but not least credit must go to the cleverness of the original creator of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Burgess' novel is wonderful, and for the most part, the movie takes the ideas of the novel correctly. One error would have to be the cutting of Burgess' original novel, but that is not Kubrick's fault, as the American version of the novel is made that way. It would have been nice to see the original ending in the novel, but this is a minor complaint.This movie really appeals to youth, and it is a great movie to see. If I had to pick the best films of Kubrick's career, I would hail ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Barry Lyndon"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"" as the best films he ever made. Thank you Kubrick, thank you MacDowell, and thank you Burgess, for the genius that is ""A Clockwork Orange"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding...,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is a Drama - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a gang leader being imprisoned after some incidents. In prison he finds out about an experiment that whoever takes part his sentence will be reduced and he will be out sooner.I liked this movie very much and it is considered as a classic movie. The plot of the movie is simple but very interesting and the audience can follow it very well. The direction which was made by Stanley Kubrick was for one more time outstanding and he succeeded on creating a bond between the audience and his main actor. The interpretation of Malcolm McDowell who played as Alex was iconic and he did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Carl Duering's who played as Dr. Brodsky and Warren Clarke's who played as Dim.

Sci-fi + Drama + Kubrick = A MASTERPIECE,"What kind of movie is this? A drama about life? A film about the life of crime? A Sci-Fi? A film about or against violence? Well, maybe everything I just said and more! The story is about Alex ""DeLarge"" (Malcolm McDowell), a young teenager, music lover of Beethoven, who lives a life of what he calls ""ultra-violence"". He and his small group of criminals terrorize London night with all imaginable kinds of crimes, from rape to assaulting houses and beating up on thugs. After all ""the fun"" Alex returns home and pretends to be the boy behaved that works to help people during the night. When he's line of crime reaches a point where he is arrested and sentenced to 14 years in prison.2 years of knocks and suspensions, Alex hears about a program that could take him out of prison soon. Little does he know that this will take him to an even worse situation.Interesting story does in it? Despite the fact it took years until his debut and premiered when he was attacked viciously by critics. Well, let's continue with the review of this masterpiece.Kubrick manages to make a film in a breathtaking by every minute that passes. The film is narrated in an exploitative and satirical language, even the dialogs between the characters can have a language satirical and exploitative, Alex is a great proof of that. Each of his words to the group and all other characters is all Shakespearean, we watch the film as if we be reading a dark and gloomy poem (like Alex himself). But every moment Kubrick doesn't resist putting the little British dark humor, letting the film be it pure entertainment at some point.The disturbing scenes that plague the film (which are many, no spoilers) are filmed in a even disturbing way. The use of image and cinematography that Kubrick's use is disturbing as fascinating, framing in an impressive way.A mixture of themes that Kubrick uses in the film is also a point to be brilliant. The use of drama in the story of Alex, while a hint of dark humor. Alex's vision of the world as a violent place where violence is to be made. And while it can have a cultured and intellectual mind with books and classical music.The time when Alex is arrested and have entered the small program where he is just a guinea pig, for much less than he knows what it is, it will totally change his life and his mind, with that Kubrick's make's a entry of sci-fi so impressively. Then with the return of Alex to the world now as a completely changed man, suffering, tragedy and drama again re-enters in the film, and criticizes the society (even unpredictable in the film) and for the first time we start feeling sorry for Alex's character.The performances are all excellent, Malcolm McDowell gives a fantastic performance in all details, their eyes and their expressions get's better by every passing minute.A true masterpiece that manages to be so disturbing and interesting to watch. Move both mentally and exciting journey and when we watch the transformation of Alex and his world around. With a superb directing and writing and fantastic performances, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is truly a masterpiece of centuries with total recommendation from my humble part.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Is mankind inherently cruel?,"An interesting, still relevant take on the nature of human beings. Alex is a rapist, he's a man which desperately seeks for violence and terror, these things keep him go on in life, and during the first half he makes it clear that he feels no regret pursuing these acts of violence.The portrayal of Alex and his friends is terrifying, there are no morals for them, and watching the singing in the rain scene feels not right and hard to get through, because it shows everything and just goes on. It doesn't want to end. It feels extremely uncomfortable, and because of this it's the most important scene of the film. Because this scene gives us not only information of what Alex pursues as normal, it gives us an idea and lets us as viewer feel the impact.There's only one thing that Alex loves the same same such as chaos, and that is Beethoven. So, the government takes in their part, and try to manipulate Alex into seeing his actions as mistakes.Alex sees the clips of war terror with Beethoven compositions playing in the background, and he suddenly is more than frightened. He begs for them to stop. Because his mind simply can't comprehend something so evil with something so pure.And that's the turning point. There's to kinds of interpretations from here on. The first one is, Alex learns what he does is terrible, and suddenly he seeks out to stop it. And the second one is, that Alex already knew the whole time what he does is terrible, but his obsession with terror and violence does not stop him.In both cases Alex regrets what he has done. The manipulation worked in that case. But Alex didn't self reflect, the government forced him to see how terrible the things are he had done, so the seed that was planted, has no place to grow. It was never his own motivation to stop.And that is the point of this film. They stopped him from doing these horrible acts eventually for now, but he still thinks about the horrible things, his mind still is overstimulated with acts of violence. And eventually, one day he'll return to do horrible things.As far as I understand is, Kubricks point is, you can stop a man from doing the things he wants do to, but deep down he'll still think about it, and deep down he still wants to do all the horrible things, because it is in his nature, it is his being to be that way. Alex can change, but it needs to be his own conscious decision.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A brutal masterpiece,"Stanley Kubrick has always been a good director and that's why a lot of his movies are pretty good. This film was another evolutionary step in his style of filmmaking after 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is Malcolm McDowell's great debut in his role as Alex DeLarge which is to date the best of his entire career. Malcolm's performance is sublime and his character is quite believable. Many of the acting are good and the photography is impeccable. It has brutal scenes and striking black humor. It is very well directed and produced. The soundtrack is another of the best things about the film because of Wendy Carlo's electronic score and the use of classical music pieces. The soundtrack fits very well with the rhythm of the film. It's supposed to be a sci-fi movie, though it doesn't feel quite futuristic in some ways. The script is well developed, but as always happens with adaptations of literary works, there are noticeable differences. Most of the changes are understandable, since the movie summarizes the original novel leaving out some things and there are changes that don't affect the plot. One of those changes is Alex's age because in the novel he is a minor and also in the novel, the young victims of rape are girls. Of course, replicating this in the film was not going to be entirely possible and that is why it had to be modified. Even so, the film respects the novel quite a bit. His only sin was to omit the final chapter that was not included in the novel after it was published in America. That caused the book's author Anthony Burgess to have a low opinion of the film, as he thought it was a misinterpretation of the novel. That suspicion grew even more after the film ended, inspired by some crimes that occurred in England after its release. Sadly, that made Anthony regret writing the novel and ended up hating it. Although the film omits the final chapter of the novel because it hasn't been published, it does in part cause the film to end with a moral opposite to the novel's original moral. This is where the clash between the novel and the film is born. The novel is an excellent book and the movie is a masterpiece. Both deserve the same recognition. Despite the controversies, that will never change the fact that A Clockwork Orange is a very good work. The novel deserves to be read by lovers of literature and the movie deserves to be seen by movie lovers. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

For example, he and his ""droog"" of friends break into a writer's house, beat him up, and then rape his wife. Who wants to see that happen? No one. So why bother making it?

Sheer brilliance in cinema,"Stanley Kubrick explores both the nature of the artist as well as the society that he inhabits in this demented and fascinating film.  For, Alex is not simply a hoodlum, he is an artist that works in the medium of pain. Kubrick's film examines the sanitization of his art through societal impositions upon it.Kubrick's masterstroke is to shoot the actions of Alex and his ""droogs"" without any sort of object removed moralizing whatsoever.  The actions are simply depicted, and it is the viewer who must process the sequences and produce a genuine and unmanipulated response.Equally important, however, is Kubrick's extreme moralizing when depicting the actions of the state.  The actions taken to ""help"" young Alex come across as little more than a shocking brand of neo-fascism.  It is the very fact that we find Alex's behavior distasteful without any manipulation that serves to make Kubrick's point.  We must preserve our right to free expression and trust in the people to make the appropriate determination as to the legitimacy of the work.

Although the movie is very old, it shows us that the problems of the society have never changed. I can't compare this movie with the new movies of our times: in effects, sounds, video, but the message is better than many others. Really I don't like the movie because I am accustomed for other kind of movies, but it's interesting to know different points of view about the human behavior because in this world there are people for all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Too complex for the average viewer to appreciate it,"I previously thought that the greatest movie of all times was ""Braveheart"", how wrong I was. I had seen ""Clockwork"" before, but I didn't quite understand it, as I was too young to get the point. The movie consists of two halves, the first part is the bizarre, disturbing, ultra-violent, sexual and complex part of a routine day in Alex DeLarge's life. This part is really hard to understand, it is very complex, it has elements like the 5 Jesuses hugged and dancing. This shot alone is enough to write a thesis about it. Then the second part is really what the movie is about, but people seem to remember better the first part and this part is the one that has made this movie an all-time cult classic. The music chosen for the movie is also perfect, I couldn't picture the movie with another song. The casting is perfect, Alex couldn't have been played better than by Malcolm McDowell, with his funny-evil expressions, that give a double meaning to every scene. The best thing of this movie is the story itself, teaching us that we have a choice (this is what the bible is all about), whether to be violent or not, so then they show us what would happen if we weren't violent and Kubrick somehow lets us see that this is not the answer, that we need violence as a choice, really makes you think. But I think this movie isn't pro-violence because it shows you that if you are violent you will eventually get caught or get some kind of payback, so I would define it as pro-choice. When you see this movie you do not get a Hollywood, commercial movie, you get a piece of art, and movie-making today is lacking this. What people call weird I say it's art and that's why this is without a doubt the greatest picture of all time. All of those ""Traispotting"" fans MUST see this movie, because I think that its based on ""A Clockwork Orange"". Amen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures""","It's got to be handed to Kubrick; no other director can be cited as making so many back-to-back classics in his working career.  His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage.  If his previous film 2001: A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society.  The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?'  Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes! But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life.  But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda.The year is now 2002, we have sailed through the year that Kubrick made famous with his watershed sci-fi picture, and we stand looking out at an uncertain future, and one thing that stands out, is the shocking similarities between the fantasy of A Clockwork Orange, and the reality of the everyday world.  Hooligans are everywhere, teenage louts that have elderly people too terrified to leave their homes after dark, our countries are run by lying, back-stabbing politicians who are always out for their own gain, and now scientists are looking into new treatments for the correction and rehabilitation of violent offenders.  It's not hard to see the pompous politicians of A Clockwork Orange and not subliminally think of Jack Straw or Tony Blair stood at the podium.  And this is the talent of Stanley Kubrick, his ability to build lasting images through his own visual sense. Everything about his movies takes on a certain iconography, they not only represent the style of the times they where made and simultaneously dictate the style of when they are set, I mean, who wasn't just a bit let down by the year 2001's less than glorious look in comparison to Kubrick's vision, in the same way we are perturbed by A Clockwork Orange's dilapidated future.Kubrick turns Burgess' themes into a full scale plan of attack, complimenting his message by utilizing all the camera and editing effects that went into the grandeur of 2001, but simplifying them to conform to both the idea of A Clockwork Orange, and the film's limited budget.  The use of slow-motion and ultra-speed works well, even if the laughable high-speed sex orgy looks like a throw back to the days of Benny Hill, and some people have trouble with the use of back projection and process shots, but all of these help build the world of the film, and help dictate the skewed perception of Alex (McDowell).  Both the character of Alex and the way in which McDowell portrays him is unbelievably complex, guiding the audience through this world with his narration, he makes the audience one of his `droogs' which means that we like Alex right from the start, his actions may appal us, but at this stage he's our only ally.  This is another one of Kubrick's trump cards, because if we like Alex, then we will feel for him as his victims take their revenge, and that's when the film has you, when you start to feel sympathy for this amoral character.`What's it going to be then?' is the future of A Clockwork Orange almost upon us, is Kubrick such a master film-maker that his films have the ability to predict time? Well, since none of us are now actually revolving in a space station to the haunting echo of `The Blue Danube' I would say no.  But it is impossible to watch the images of restrained violence and political corruption of A Clockwork Orange and not be drawn in, and more importantly not you leave feeling overwhelmed by the attention to detail and iconic, haunting images that Kubrick shows us.  Pop-art fantasy, or harsh political indictment, you decide.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A lot of Burgess,"A Clockwork Orange is probably the most merciless story about society, the most convincing of critical statements ever made. We awe it first to Anthony Burgess, then to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick, while treating Burgess's text respectfully, made the very best out of the wonderful plot. He managed to bring it across visually with almost more wit and creativity than any reader of the book can imagine for himself. He crowds his stylish futuristic world with an excellent leading actor and with an uncountable number of (stereo)types that are so funny and so funnily played that the movie is not depressing despite its disturbing topic. When during the end credits the song `Singin' in the Rain' rings out, I will sing along jollily, despite what the song stands for in the movie. Generally, the music, virtuously conducted, is an important element in the film and  again  a brilliant one. And the production design! The Korova Milkbar alone is a masterpiece.A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's most original film  although it does not have an original screenplay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Culpably Irresponsible Film,"Thanks to Stanley Kubrick 'The Animals Went in Two by Two' and 'We'll Meet Again' were never the same once I'd seen 'Dr Strangelove', just as 'Singin in the Rain' was never the same agin after I saw 'A Clockwork Orange'.Considering what a perfectionist Kubrick was it's ironic that because he sat on this film for such a long time after the tabloid feeding frenzy it initially provoked that for thirty years a whole generation knew the film only from dreadful bootleg copies; while with the passage of time 'Strangelove' just looks better and better, but 'A Clockwork Orange' has rapidly dated. (When Anthony Burgess wrote the original novel in the early sixties he had teddy boys in mind, while the droogs are egregiously seventies in their appearance.) The film also irresponsibly makes Alex fascinatingly evil and infinitely more articulate than the average yobbo.

One of the treasures of the cinema,"There aren't many films I would praise as highly as I could ""A Clockwork Orange"", the select few would be the likes of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994); ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946) and Kubrick's marginally (very marginally, I might add) better ""Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb"" (1964).  Of course ""A Clockwork Orange"" has its critics - indeed, what film doesn't? - but none of these narrow-minded individuals can prevent me from appreciating the film.  A grim vision of the future sees young Alex (a career-best performance from Malcolm MacDowell) and his band of 'droogs' (there are a lot of post-modern slang words used in the film, by the way) who spend every evening beating, raping and pillaging innocent people for their own amusement.  In 1971, the film understandably caused outrage for its graphic violence and sexual scenes but by modern standards they are what cinema-goers have come to expect.  Alex is arrested and the film centres on his rehabilitation in prison and how he volunteers for a revolutionary new treatment aimed at wiping out crime.A hugely important film, it most likely paved the way for the more tolerant censorship of today, as violence on-screen became gradually more accepted.Being a UK resident, I had to wait a while before being able to legally see the film, Kubrick infamously pulled the film from UK Cinemas amidst fears of copycat violence and proclaimed it could not be released until after he went to that great editing suite in the sky, which he lamentably did in 1999.One of the greatest cinematic achievements, don't be put off by the film's unsavoury reputation, it's not nearly as horrifying as you might think.  The chilling question the film provokes is just how far are we now from the future Kubrick envisioned?One thing goes without question - Stanley Kubrick is the best director bar none.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

My favourite Kubrick,"Based on Anthony Burgess' excellent novel, A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece. A dark vision of the future, with ultra-violent youth ruling the streets and people being afraid to leave their houses after dark. Alex, a leader of such a gang gets caught after committing an ""accidental"" murder, and after two years of prison sentence, he is chosen to be reformed by a new method called Ludovico's technique, which is claimed to turn bad people into good people.I think every director runs a risk when adapting a great novel, but the way Stanley Kubrick did it seems to be THE way. He kept the best scenes of the story, created a semi-dreamlike visual environment, added an terrific soundtrack, chose the suitable actors (nearly everybody who had more than two lines was memorable), and ran the whole thing with his usual precision. The only weaker point was the sex scene between Alex and the two devotchkas from the record store (but it would be a bit difficult to adopt the violent scene from the book with Alex of 15 and the girls like 10).I don't know which movie should I consider as Kubrick's best, but this one is definitely my favourite. The first time I saw it, I just couldn't believe the soundtrack. Though it owes much to the novel, it transcends to an audio/visual experience only a movie can give you. I think Kubrick made the right decision which scenes to include. I'm glad he completely omitted the last chapter of the book. Also, this films features probably the most menacing last line in movie history.Finally, there seems to be a common misunderstanding: many people seem to think that Ludovico's technique turned Alex into a good person, as promised. Wrong. Alex' body was conditioned to react to violence with sickness, but our humble narrator's personality hardly changed at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Kubrick was like a chess player in this film because the story is just a masked ball of another vortex to another meaning. Every detail is in a strategic reflexion.

And the fun never stops in the wonderful world of Stanley!,"I hate Stanley Kubrick movies. Actually, I think the word 'hate' isn't quite strong enough to describe my feelings towards the most overrated person in moviehistory. Try physically revolted. But I'm not writing this to bash Kubrick, tempting as it is. Because, if I had to choose a favorite among his considerable output, I would say ACO is easily his best work.A big part of the credit for this has to go to the fantastic, fascinating story by Anthony Burgess. A story so good even Kubrick couldn't ruin it. In fact, for once his trademark clinical touch enhanced the story, instead of just alienating the public as it usually does. The opening scenes are the best moments Mr 725 takes has ever put on film.I wouldn't go as far as to recommend this movie. That would be against everything I believe in. God knows the world doesn't need any more Kubrick fans. I only want to say that I understand people who say that this is a great film. Something I refuse to accept for 2001, for instance.

Killing a Show Tune,"A Clockwork Orange (1971)If you read the book, be patient. Learn Nadsat. After a third of the book, you'll forget there's a glossary in the back. Also, there are two versions of the book. The British and the American. As I remember, the American version has a prettified ending, or something akin to that.As far as the movie is concerned, in many ways, ACO hasn't aged well. It looks like a 1971 universe masquerading as 2017. Yet there are elements that are surreal that they translate effortlessly to any time.I remember watching it for the first time at The Magic Lantern in Spokane. I felt icky and exhilarated afterward. I saw it again in a film class at Spokane Falls Community College. A third time in the early 80s.The last time was within the last ten years. I turned off the DVD player and thought, this is how I felt when I saw Pulp Fiction--amazed at the technical expertise and disgusted by the crimson pornography Pauline Kael wrote about in the New Yorker and mentioned in the Atlantic piece by Adam Chandler.With all that said, my takeaway from ACO is never really liking Singin' in the Rain anymore.

A Pseudo Masterpiece,"What is the message? There is a lot of symbolism in here but it does not add up to anything. This movie is great technically it does not really fill this major void of what the message is. Is it to show how bad we are as people? I'm not to into that and pretty sure plenty of other people are like that too. This does not seem to be it either. I'm fine with negative movies just not this one. It makes you feel so horrible and use you get the feeling of what was the point of watching this movie in the first place.The writing is good along with the cinematography which is great giving you the feeling of the chaos we call life. The music is very fitting and the directing is great with every scene showing something different. Kubick is the best in history at disguising a movie as a masterpiece, he has a long track record of it. Even the acting is pretty good at showing the insane world and characters. Malcom Macdowell is just perfect in here.Still this is not enough for me. In order for a movie to be good it has to have some sort of a message. This movie seems to fail horribly at it. This is why we watch movies, to get something out of it. None of these great technical achievements really matter because of this. In order for the technical parts of a movie matter it needs to represent something and that does happen a lot except it does not add up to anything. This makes this movie very shallow rather that deep. What I can credit it for is that it does probably the best job of disguising itself as deep when there is really not much there. This movie feels as if Kubrick is just tying to just impress once again rather than deliver something meaningful.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Rape, Ultraviolence and Beethoven- THE ULTIMATE SATIRE","What can I say about A Clockwork Orange that hasn't already been said? How can I convey the magnitude of its brilliance in words? I'll try, best as I can to paint a clear picture of this masterpiece. And what can I say about Stanley Kubrick- the man was god! I've seen all of his films, but this one is my very favourite. This is his magnum opus.It starts off with dear Alex and his droogs sitting in the Korova milk bar sipping away and preparing themselves for what they call 'the old ultraviolence,' which we'll soon see is rape and a severe beating to a particular old writer. From then on, from these events there unfolds a tapestry of chaos, weirdness and disaster. But Malcolm McDowell is just a delight. While all of this horror and oddity occurred, I never found myself blaming him. He makes Alex seem so charismatic that it's amazing.What the hell is ACO about? A guy called Alex living in the distant future, a bizarre colorful kaleidescope of stylized clothing and living spaces and odd people in a Kafkaesque (yep, i just had to use that word) nightmare. He commits a nasty, insane (and somewhat funny) crime and does time for it. And he bumps into a few of his old...acquaintances later on, and the law attempts to cure his delinquency...in a rather disturbing way.The cherry on top is the excellent soundtrack. The weird Moog synthesizer just adds to the strange atmosphere. And the way Kubrick artfully uses classical music, like Beethoven's 9th and Rossini's Barber of Seville overture and Thieving Magpie and William Tell Overture is simply a marvel. It's a pleasure to listen to such lovely music while watching such vivid imagery.Anyways, that can't even begin to describe the film but all you can do is see it for yourself. I watched this as a wide eyed 14 year old and I was just bewildered by the whole damn thing, but I loved it. What's not to love? Call me crazy, but I've always though that the 'violence' in this film was over-hyped. People tend to make a mountain out of a molehill. ACO was not meant to be a goddamn tragedy, it's a biting satire that's darkly humorous and prodigal in it's predictions. It's pretty funny, when it all comes down to it, the irony, the black humor, the sharp wit of Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick, the inane charm of Malcolm McDowell, the ridiculousness of it all.And then there's people who complain that ACO promotes violence and perversion. Reallyy?? Is that so? I guess those people were jerking off for the whole time and not even paying attention. If that's what you got out of it, then you must be brain dead. The ending is unrepentant though, that's why I love it. As Alex grins and says ""I was cured, alright"" you realize the 'method' in which society 'cured' him.All in all, for the open minded (the religious zealots oughta stay away) art lovers, A Clockwork Orange is a treat. Not only is it my favourite film, but one of the greatest films ever made. Come and get one in the yarbles...that is, if ya got any yarbles!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hello my brothers.,"Welly welly well.  A Clockwork Orange is one of the most artistic movies I have ever seen.  The settings, costume design, music, and even the language in the movie are very unique (the opening scene says it all). The story line is also great.  You are never really sure if you like or hate the main character, Alex,.  The story plays with your mind, one minute you are disgusted by Alex the next minute you feel sorry for him,. I also enjoyed the fact that it was a science fiction movie that didn't involve lasers, spacecrafts, or time machines.  In fact, this movie had shown practically no advancement in technology.  The only thing that really changed in the future was the lack of morals (makes you think, don't it). It is definetly one of my favorite movies ever, and the most artistic one I have ever seen.

"A Gen-X Fairytale, several decades early","Oh, my droogies, a horrorshow peek at the old ultraviolence to which our humble near future is heir...Once again, Kubrick took a novel and adapted it with utter faith to the screen, while simultaneously creating a visual style that was utterly unique.  On top of it all, he gives us the character of Alex -- thug, rapist, delinquent, unrepentent little s**t -- and makes us like him, even as he attacks, injures, rapes and kills...This film (and the novel), you see, really isn't about Alex and his Droogies.  It's about us -- our attitudes toward crime and punishment, and our weird ambivalence and denial.  We love to claim to want to see justice done, but never make us admit that all we really want is revenge.  We can't admit that -- it would just make us the same as the criminals.  However, the ""Ludovicko technique"" seen in the film, the Pavlovian reprogramming of criminals, really would be the ultimate solution to crime.  Turning the violent into little clockwork oranges -- objects that look organic on the outside but are mechanical on the inside -- would solve a lot of problems. However, it's a concept that'll never fly.  Not because it's cruel to the criminals, altough lipservice is paid to that idea.  No -- it's because it denies society the opportunity to smack the doo-doo out of the nasty little thugs.  But, see the comments on hypocrisy, above...And all of this is in the movie implicitly, never explicit.  (The high point: when Alex encounters his former gang mates, now ""reformed,"" working as policemen -- and behaving exactly the same as before.)The formula of crime and punishment is really a perpetuating loop, not a one-way track, but the punishers can never admit to their own criminal behavior.  This equation is hiding in the structure of the film, which is a classic fairy tale -- hero journeys outward and passes three obstacles (or gate keepers or trolls or whatever), then journeys back in a diminished state, and encounters the same three whatevers for some instant karma. The concept was the genius of Anthony Burgess, but the faithful execution (pardon the expression) was pure Kubrick...Final notes: the film is funny, stuffed with little in-jokes (keep your eyes open in the record store for some self-references, as well as a collection of names that actually became bands later) and the use of music and wide-angle lenses has no equal in cinema.  The opening shot is one of the more memorable images in film, the closing shot is a subtle ""up yours"" to Ken Russell, and everything in between will stick with you forever...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An terrific combination of writing talent and a great musical score.,"This film for me was very beautifully made, and I loved the way that it didn't seem to pull any punches. The sign of a really great movie is when you don't want it to end (unlike Pearl Harbor). Watching ""Clockwork"" was seeing film history made. I think that Kubrick, in his own way, was the Quentin Tarantino of his time. Pushing the envelope constantly. The script and scenes tie together extremely well, as does the ""Ludwig van"" portions. The characters are well developed, and there can never be too many hot women in any movie. Superiorly original concept by the author Burgess, but putting it on screen is entirely a different ballpark. I couldn't wait to see it again. Very high quality, I'd give it a 100% if we were giving grades.

As relevant today as it was then,"Senselessness of crime is exhibited most convincingly in this great movie. ..It shows how a psychopath can be a bigger menace and danger than an ordinary criminal.. violence and crime may stem from many reasons, but when it is rises out of boredom and utter disregard of social values. It can be alarming.. YOU FEEL THE TERROR MORE THAN YOU VIEW IT During the last few decades we are becoming increasingly aware of a close and ever-strengthening nexus between crime and politics and how they are becoming complimentary to each other..

A subtle remark on the society, where everyone changes with time. Politicians change, parents change, friends change for their self-interest. A world of selfishness and hypocrisy.A film that hooks you up from the very first to the very last frame. A combination of great direction and fabulous acting. A completely unpredictable film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Watch it!,"I have waited too long to finally watch this movie.I always thought the cover didn't look appealing, I didn't know much about Kubrick, the white clothes looked silly, I thought this would be a random gang violence movie, 'A clockwork orange' - I couldn't think of anything meaningful to it.But I can assure you, there is more to it and it is definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie!,"I will never forget the first time I watched this one. I felt quite numb afterwards. This is, after all, Kubrick's most controversial film, originally rated X for its candid, uncompromising scenes of rape and violence.The part that stands out the most is the infamous ""Singin' in the Rain"" bit. Yes, THAT scene. I had to rewind the tape to make sure I actually saw THAT!!! I also love the scene with the ""cat lady"". An extremely powerful, nightmarish setpiece, it lingers in your mind forever afterward. The opening shot is one of the best in cinematic history, effectively establishing an eerie, menacing tone for what follows.Malcolm McDowell is great here. This is the one he'll be remembered for decades from now. He deserved an Oscar, but the people who give these awards are just too timid. If I were in charge, I'd give it Best Picture, Director, etc. Come to think of it, it's surprising it was nominated for anything at all. (On the other hand, those New York critics were remarkably forward-thinking!)Even after nearly thirty years, its power has not diminished. Believe me, I know. Judging from the comments posted, even some 21st-century viewers will still condemn the film the same way conservatives did in the 1970's. To be honest, it took me a while to decide this is my favorite, and it's not a decision I came to lightly.Rating: **** (out of ****)137 min/Released by Warner Bros.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
So what?,"Having waited such a long time to see this film, it really was a bit of a disappointment.That would be a bit strong perhaps, it was good without ever getting to the levels of being anything special; although that is perhaps due to it being a victim of its own hype and being as dated as it now is.Burgess' brilliant book was largely turned ho hum by one of the most over-rated directors of all time, and the main redeeming factor was the soundtrack and the performances of the supporting actors to the ever irritating Malcolm McDowell, who is now a part of that annoying band of celebrities who are famous for being famous, having done nothing any good since.Worth seeing to judge for yourself, and the soundtrack is excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A movie that will stay in your head for years.,The fact that a Clockwork Orange is the most shocking and disturbing movie I've ever seen and it was made in the 70's should be an outstanding award to Stanly Kubrick especially because of the horribly twisted plot the likes of which you've never seen before.

The best film ever...,"The film director- Stanley Kubrick. And he knows his job well... Damn good film.

Sheer brilliance,"For anyone who has not seen A Clockwork Orange, it is only fair to point out that the director, Stanley Kubrick, perhaps unwittingly made the U.S. version of Anthony Burgess' novel into film. Burgess seemed jaded that a significantly different ending was cut from his own intended version which for a while could only be found in the U.K.Aside from the controversy of whether or not the film genuinely relays Burgess' own ideas, I think the film is so brilliant that there is something noteworthy to be observed with each subsequent viewing. It never loses its thunder. I have known a few people to get offended by the violence, but the film does have a sharp sense of satire and even slapstick. The ugliness arguably just mirrors the human condition--in which men ""have been on the moon,"" yet have not conquered brutality on the streets or in the government for that matter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Real horror show""","""I like to videe the old films now and again""This film is a beautiful car crash. That's not to say there's anything poor quality about it but it pushes hard at what's acceptable. At the time of release it was so controversial that the director, Stanley Kubrick, banned his own film from being shown for the duration of his life.I love A Clockwork Orange but I feel bad for doing so because of the amount of violence towards women shown in it. That aside the script is brilliant and thought-provoking, it's full of strong character actors, it's beautifully shot, it's frightening, it's funny and it's unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rites of Passage  {Stanley Kubrick},"In the early 60's, when Burgess wrote the novel, one of the controversies in the realm of psychology was the popularity among academics of the Behaviourist approach of B. F. Skinner. Skinner had evolved his scientific approach directly from Pavlov and his demonstration of how dogs could be made to repeat responses to stimuli in a predictable manner {""classical conditioning""}. Skinner developed this theory applying it to human behaviour as ""conditioned response"". Skinner was so confident that his approach was the way of the future that he wrote an utopian novel called ""Walden 2"", as a riposte to Thoureau's transcendalist novel, {""Walden""}, of a life of bucolic fulfillment. In Skinner's novel society would be in the morally superior hands of apparatchiks that he termed ""planner-managers"" Behaviour would thus be regulated by the state by the use of conditioning technique. Anthony Burgess was obviously well aware of the threat to human freedom that Psychiatry and psychology posed and set out to write a novel where the absurdities of control obsession/mania would be exposed.Kubrick made a highly coloured rendition of the life of the young miscreant Alex, {magnetically portrayed by Malcolm McDowell} and his band of teenage rebels who dress in a group fashion, speak in a personal argot, get juiced on drug-laden milk and whisky, steal cars, use weapons and engage in anti-social behaviour which includes rape, burglary, and grievous bodily harm. In Burgess's fictional world , you have here a supreme character for behavioral modification.Alex is eventually betrayed by his comrades-in-arms and is convicted for murder and enters the State Prison for a period of nine years. There, because of the overcrowding, and the need to make space for the more threatening category of ""political prisoner"" - Alex is offered the satirical option of a 14 day quick non-surgical lobotomy, termed ""aversion therapy"". It is important, at this point, to point out the one unexpected anomaly of this young rebel, Alex. Although Alex is revealed to have no respect for pedantry and culture {in the novel he destroys books with the utmost contempt}, in any shape or form, he has an abiding worship and love for the abstractions of classical music {a form of higher culture}, This characteristic is something he shares with his creator, Anthony Burgess and also the auteur, Stanley Kubrick. Why it is plausible, that such a rabid prole and anti-elitist as Alex surely is, - would be disarmed by the abstract formulations and precious classism of Ludwig von Beethoven, {while also displaying a total disdain for popular music}, is one of those mysterious elements of good fiction and good cinema. Alex, then becomes a pawn in the political game of the ""politics of the Future"" eventually pronouncing himself ""cured"" and according to the film {though not according to the original novel}, ready to continue with a life of mayhem and ultra-violence.That this movie tells a yarn which is both entertaining and challenging, is without question, the result of a collaboration of a great writer and a great movie maker. It is rare to see a novel so precisely realized as this screen adaptation. Voila!!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Full Circle,"Often times, films depict a character and his ardour. A Clockwork Orange has a crafty lead in Alex who is as dynamic and vibrant as any. This movie is definitely creative and provides an original theme uncommon in most modern movies. It's the gait of the delinquents, diction of the characters, structure of society and underlying themes in this movie that make it such a spectacle.A Clockwork Orange is sinister. From the initial acts of the four to the events of Alex's life, the entire film revolves around the theme of ""an eye for an eye."" Committing criminal acts, remorseless to the innocent and weak and pure disregard for the future is what life is like for the boys in the beginning. As time progresses, it is evident Alex is, by nature, looking for excitements and finds it in violence. A Clockwork Orange literally displays that people can only, to a certain extent, be changed at the core level. Despite advanced psychological treatments, a criminal who does not choose to change will not.A reason people love this film is because of the sharp contrast it has to most contemporary movies. Rarely do you see such an adventurous yet negligent person who has wits but chooses to exploit others with it. This film is definitely worth the watch since it will leave you on the edge of your seat always awaiting for Alex's next move...",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
As queer as a clockwork orange,"This is my favorite movie and always will be, thanks Malcolm McDowell and Stanley Kubrick.
Alex is one of the best villains in the history of cinema, his intelligence, personality and above all, his tastes are what make him unique; he is violent, the most cultured of all characters and always finds beauty with the music of the great Ludwig Van Beethoven. The narration is impressive and unique, we always see his perspective of things and his creative imaginations.Malcolm's performance in this film I think was the best of his career and deserves recognition as it is also one of the best performances in history.The dialogue, direction and cinematography in this film is unique.Thank you Stanley Kubrick, thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubricks' celebration of violence. 0/100.,"It is abundantly clear that Kubrick was a film-maker of genius. This genius was not balanced by anything resembling a moral sense. This film with it's synchonized beatings and hilarious in-out rape scenes are indication of a creator who was so in love with the image that what was actually shown doesn't matter, as long as it looked good. (Think of the whole of ""2001"".) There is a scene in this film where a middle aged woman is raped and beaten to death with the huge phallus she keeps as a work of ""art"". In many ways this is the crucial scene in the film. It is much changed from the book - but only in ways that make us feel that she was just getting her just rewards. Kubrick loads the dice so much that he is at this point more manipulative than Spielberg or Disney would ever dare. Are we supposed to think that a woman ( who quite obviously in the context has no man about the house ) who keeps giant phalli around is just asking for it - YES is quite clearly what Kubrick felt. Why does the film do this. Is it because Kubrick was a violence loving mysoginist. There is no evidence I have to say yes to that. The only answer that I can come up with is that Kubrick just liked the way it looked. That scene though is just typical of a film which dehumanises victims, family and everybody else. The only character allowed the merest semblance of life is Alex - our hero. Even if you appreciate the glorification of the thug, this is still not a good film. Most of it looks like some godforsaken mix of Lindsay Anderson and Ken Russell. The acting is constantly abysmal in that way that only British actors seem able to achieve. To sum up this is pornographic film making posing as a statement about free will. Your still allowed to like it, but be honest with yourself why.Incidentally the director of this film finished his career with a 3 hour snoozefest suggesting that adultery was somehow equivalent to murde. Odd that.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I was back all right!,"I saw this again last night on BBC America. I'd forgotten just how visually fascinating this was. I saw Clockwork Orange for the first time in about 78-79, tripping my brains out. Needless to say, it burned itself into my brain immediately, and watching it now, almost a quarter century later, it still feels as fresh and shocking as it did then.Just commenting on the surface aspects here, there's plenty that's been said here about the story itself (plot, characters, morals, etc), but for me the real treat has always been just the look of the movie, the cinematography and the soundtrack. Some of my favorite scenes from this perspective are: The montage when Alex is in his bedroom listening to Beethoven, with the chorus-line of crucified Jesuses; the scene where he kills the ""cat woman;"" and of course the opening scene in the milk bar, with Alex staring down the camera.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"My Compliments to Kubrick's ""Clockwork""","Being a Kubrick fan (as of recently), I dove into this movie with both excitement (it being directed by Kubrick and being considered a classic) and hesitancy (due to its reputation as a depressing film filled with sexual references). At that time, the only other Kubrick films I had seen were ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", so I was expecting an awesome, thought-inspiring movie. I was not disappointed. I say now without hesitation that this is my favourite Kubrick movie. The others I've seen were awesome, but this takes the cake.""Clockwork"" is a very well made movie, showcasing Kubrick's directoral talents in all their glory. The acting, though lacking any actors I'd heard of at the time, was wonderful. Alex was done with sublimity by Mr. McDowell (I believe that's his name, hehe), and was very threatening and dangerous before the treatment, and rightfully innocent and vulnerable after it. I honestly felt sorry for him.Also, being a classical music fan, the soundtrack, which consisted of it entirely, pleased me deeply. I felt more sympathetic towards Alex, due to his love of Beethoven and, I presume, other classical music.Despite its disturbing message, it was a wonderfully made movie that pleased me greatly. As always, Kubrick challenges the viewer to think, and perhaps that's why he's my favourite director. And this, to me, is the crowning achievement of his illustrious career. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Kubrick, likes to think, or has the stomach for some of the things this film can throw at them. It may not be for everyone, but nonetheless, give it a whirl, and you could, like me, find one of the most powerful and fulfilling movie experiences of your life.And now I'm done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Conspiracy!,"Something's probably bugged you about ""A Clockwork Orange"" and other films like it. You're not quite sure what it is, but it makes you mad. That's because you are witness to one of the greatest conspiracies of moviedom. Critics say Clockwork Orange is good. Film professors teach that Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece. Contentious artsy-fartsy students can't shut their silver spoon mouths about the brilliance that lies within Clockwork Orange. They do this about many, many horrid films, and we take it meekly, assuming that other people know something we don't.That's a lie, 'cause I know it all. And A Clockwork Orange reeks. It's a lot like Impressionistic art: labeled as classy and innovative, yet it really makes no sense to anyone.I tells it like it is. Here you have a film that has a really antagonistic subject Alex (Malcom McDowell) who revels in sex, violence, and talking in some sort of weird language that's most likely based on sounds emanating from 5-month-old tots. After some shocking, shocking acts of violence and rape (and CHECK OUT that phallic imagery, our film professors chime), the law catches up with Alex and throws him in jail. A bizarre experiment rehabilitates him to become nauseous at the mere thought of sex, violence, and Beethoven. From this point on, a large subtitle might as well be flashing ""SOCIAL COMMENTARY"" at the bottom of the screen.My thought is, social commentary in movies is fossilized dinosaur dung sold at museums, unless shown with a spark of creativity. This is not the case. The plot turn is not more complicated than anything you've seen on a Happy Meal box. Think: What goes around comes around. Alex treats his friends badly. Later, they do the same to him. Alex tries to beat the system. Alex drinks milk. Blah, blah, blah. Kubrick revels in long, dry stretches of cinematic wasteland that has everyone barking that it's the best thing since Oprah started reading books. Open your eyes to the truth!

Aversion therapy may work to do both, but is that really a solution? Why waste the fortnight? Just give them a frontal lobotomy and be done with it.The American solution is just the opposite. No less right-wing, the largest prison system in the World serves two purposes: legalized slavery and disenfranchisement of minorities.

A Clockwork Dilemma,"It's a proven fact that when you read a book, and then watch a movie based on it, you'll often feel disappointed of the result. This is a fairly general rule, and I've experienced those results many times. But there's something definitely different about this one. I'm not saying that the general rule applies here, but I'm not saying it doesn't either. I think that the best way to understand this is to consider both the movie and the book as two separate entities, and not one being the result of the other.In this case, the movie was excellent. The disorientation, the violence, the anguish, the existential void were all displayed beautifully and almost poetically by Kubrick. Burgess achieved the same level of greatness with the book, but we have to understand as a group of somewhat intelligent people that books and films are two completely different means of expressing art. Books are interpretative, films are almost absolute. Books require more imaginative drive from the reader than movies from the spectator. With books you have to look within yourself and find an image of how you think the main character (in this case, Alex) would look like, in the movie, the director already made that decision for you.There are also substantial differences as to how the message will get across. Burgess relies on direct language and action driven chapters, Kubrick lets the photography and the imagery speak for itself. I'm an admirer of Kubrick's films, and I can't say that I've ever been disappointed in his interpretations. In this case, I haven't really resolved the whole ""which one is better: the film or the book"" dilemma, mostly because even though the film is based on the book, and has the same characters, the same lines of dialogue, and the same setting, they both say two different things. Certainly the exclusion of that last chapter of the book from the movie created a new message to say, and reflected a new society to which the message was addressed to. Furthermore, it generated two different perspectives to read the book or watch the movie from: an optimistic one, and a decadent one.Again, I have not yet solved this internal dilemma. But for whatever's worth, you should definitely watch the movie first, and then read the book. Just in case you don't think like me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"""A Clockwork Orange"" tells the story of a criminal named Alex and is composed of three parts. The first part features him and his followers committing crimes while the second features him being forced to be good and the third features him trying to adapt back in the real world. There are so many things that make this a wonderful film. The first that comes to mind is the music. No, not the Beethoven music played (although that's great too) but the music played in the more intense scenes. This is a great movie, but it is rather obscene.It can be hard to understand the message of the story, but it is truly a powerful one. Alex is depicted as a sadist who is tortured to become an ordinary person. The film's main moral is that no matter how evil someone is, they shouldn't be forced to be rehabilitated. Alex even comes off as quite sympathetic in this movie. I guess most of the characters in this film are evil to a certain extent. I feel bad for Alex as he meets more conflict trying to readjust to society.What's also so great is the imagery, especially at the beginning. I love seeing all these strange statues that set the mood for the rest of the film. I am so glad to finally see such a high rated movie on this website. The scene where Alex's eyes are forced open is among the most powerful and disturbing scenes in cinema history. The pacing with the three parts is fantastic and in a long film, that's always a big plus. It's great to see a film that has been homage so many times. The title refers to how an orange (something colorful) is worthless if it's done by clockwork (being forced to) just like a man in this scenario. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of my favourite movies,"A Clockwork Orange is undeniably one of the greatest and most original films ever made and, in my opinion, Kubrick's greatest work. The intricacy with which Kubrick unravels his nightmare-ish vision of a futuristic, violent people is unrelenting and amazing.I have never been able to find a problem with this movie and yet it stands above so many others in complexity and scale of vision in terms of both the story and the composition of the film itself, indeed ideal breeding ground for mistakes and complaints. But there are none that I can find.There is one small notion, oft-stated that the film is not as shocking or provocative these days as when it was first released. That I can't argue with; these days we seem to have become more desensitized to sex and violence in films and can only wonder why this film in particular was banned when it first came out. But while the action in the film does not have quite the same impact, it cannot possibly detract in the slightest from Kubrick's artistic vision. The story, the characters, the scenery and the occasional spurts of savage irony are as impressive and awe-inspiring today as they ever were, and time cannot wear them down.

Do critics enjoy boring, non-psychological crap from the 70's? I guess so! There was honestly no point what so ever to this disgusting film. The story line was terrible, the acting was below horrid, and the fact that this movie is a cult classic makes me sick to my stomach. Terrible, terrible film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Six Double Five Three Two One, SIR!","A Clockwork Orange may be #70 on AFI's list of top 100 films but it's #1 for me.Alex, Pete, Georgie, and Dim - and a bit of the old ultra violentYes! - this was my mom's favorite movie. Because, she said, 'they buck the system, and I love any movie where they buck the system'. Only she didn't say buck.I love A Clockwork Orange for that reason and for the experience I had watching it with my mom at the Art Theater in Long Beach.But I also love A Clockwork Orange because it's amazing. The imagery, the music, the characters, the style, the cats. It isn't just unusual - it's iconic - have you noticed no one has ever attempted a remake? Why not? Because it's perfect as-is.A Clockwork Orange is the story of a young gangster who gets betrayed by his mates and is sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. He is later selected for an alternative therapeutic treatment in exchange for early release. The therapeutic treatment causes him to become ill when faced with sex or violence. That alone would be enough to make an interesting film - but the author has the story set in dystopian England and the characters have original language and glorious costumes. And that would be enough but ultra-violence and the old in-out make this film a thrill to watch.It's a superb film. Share it with your loved ones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nothing Less Of Brilliant,"This is surely one of the best movies ever!  Some might disagree and call me a pervert (I'm 14!), but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Beautifully put together and brilliantly written, acted, and most of all directed.  The screenplay is disturbing and funny at the same time.  During the raping at the beginning, it is disturbing to watch, however, the singing of ""Singing In The Rain"" adds a little comedy to this upsetting scene.  Also funny is some of the dialogue.  My favorite quotes: ""No time for the old in-out love, just came to read the meter"" and ""Eggiwegs, I'd like...to smash them.""  Simply put, brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great filmmaking, disturbing film","""We are not concerned with motives, with the higher ethics; we are concerned only with cutting down crime.""Quite stylish, has very amusing dialogue, and Malcolm McDowell is great. The commentary on humanity is dark, from the violence of the hooligans to the violence and corruption of the system. It's probably a little too dark for my taste though, and I didn't like how the gleefully the rapes were depicted. Humanizing McDowell's character, making him the witty narrator, shooting the scenes of great violence so artistically to playful music ... I think it gets into glorification, taking away from the deeper theme of the morality of behavioral therapy, which to me was a mistake. Kubrick certainly created indelible images though, and the caliber of his filmmaking is high.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Evil in its finest form,"This is probably one of the best film I've watch. Despite being made for almost half a century ago, it still tops many of the films made today. I love the way this film was directed, the tone of the film, the narrative of it, the characters, and the meaning behind the story.I believe nobody could argue that the protagonist, Alex, is the greatest villain of all time. He is pure evil and absolutely detestable. He is the embodiment of every terrible things in this society. Still, I found myself strangely smypathizing with him in many situations. Malcolm McDowell is absolutely fantastic in his role as Alex.The film itself is brutal and disturbing. I can understand how and why some people can't make it to the ending. Moreover, there is no good characters in this film, and there's no one I'd like to root for. Everyone is all acting in their self-interest, doing what best for themselves.This film can be interpret in numerous ways depending on the viewers. In my opinion, the film is trying to represent the real nature of the society we're living in and the unpleasant reality of this world. The violence is real and most of it exists because of human, however, we often choose to ignore it to our own convenience. In this case, what should the society choose, freedom or safety?Finally, this film is probably not to everyone's taste, but I believe it deserves to be on the list of iconic films. It touches on the topic that few are dared to discuss. And although, it seems surreal, I believe it's actually not that far off from reality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

¿Can we hope a society without crimes?,"I believe this is a very interesting film, because it shows the way like the governments of the Satates, during the history, look for putting an end to crime.

Because, What other thing is prison, death penalty and those kind of corporal punishments but other way of keep and generate much violence in the societies? Perhaps the best way of solve the crime is education and and social inclusion; however one of the parents of the sociology - Émile Durkheim - said that the crime was since the beginning of humanity and will be forever, because that is an structural feature of the society.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

It is amazing how they get you to feel bad for him at then end after all the despicable stuff he does in the beginning. The music is some of the best to be put on screen.

Crash course,"Hey, droogs, when you're trying to wrap your yahzick around bolshy great words like ""malenky"" and ""malchick"" without spilling too much red, red kroovy from a burst blood vessel, guess what, that's Russian you're speaking. Just when you were enjoying all that ultraviolence, real horrorshow, and the old in-out, you were really hitting the books. Subversive, isn't it?The current Penguin edition of Anthony Burgess's novel now makes it clear that your humble narrator's arresting way of speaking is actually Russian (right down to ""horrorshow""), but in olden times you had to figure that out for yourself, assuming that you ever did.""Clockwork"" may well be a director's Meisterwerk, a stylistic pièce de résistance, but it is at least partially a succès de scandale. I still feel that Kubrick was irresponsible not to include the final chapter of Burgess's novel. Perhaps the film would not still be banned in the Mother Country if he had. It may well have required someone of Kubrick's ingenuity to handle the abrupt change in mood at that point -- assuming that he had shot the ending straight without putting his own ironic twist on it, which is doubtful. And of course this paragraph is predicated on a fairly literal reading of Burgess, but Burgess edited Joyce, so perhaps Burgess should never be taken at face value either.For all its brilliance, the film needs to be taken cum grano salis. Investigate the book, and draw your own conclusions. (You will even find the explanation for the film's title there.)Afterthought, since reviewing the other comments: When I first saw this film 20 years or so ago, it was unspeakably violent and physically repellent to watch. This was before the modern wave of crime and horror films. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" may have opened the floodgates for cinematic violence, but ""A Clockwork Orange"" was in an entire other class. It disturbs me that I can now watch this film without revulsion, and that's not due to overexposure to the film itself which I've only seen a couple of times, but rather to mass culture as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I was 18 years old, and it was absolutely mind-blowing for me. A brilliant film, made on a shoestring budget, too.

A profound look at human nature,"Kubrick analyzes the Human Condition, and has a very Darwinistic point of view. This film is amazing. Its statement is profound, true, and not so easy to swallow if one hasn't thought about it before.The beginning of ""2001 - a space odyssey"" recounts that we have evolved from apes and cavemen into a species of great technological finesse. In comparison with other lifeforms on this planet, we possess great intelligence, and high powers of mental abstraction.However, much of these mental powers were, are, and will be used for the development of weapons needed to satisfy that part in us which is still monkey and caveman. On our evolutionary path, we are not as far from our primitive origins as we would like to believe. Our societies are still pretty barbaric - we haven't overcome violence; we have only succeeded in containing violence by organized force and violence through our governments.""A clockwork orange"" makes the statement that stealing a person's brutality is inhuman. In doing that, one steals an integral part of what makes us human. No matter how obscene and extreme the violent part of a person is, eliminating the ability of being violent it is deeply immoral.We humans tend to believe that animals are very far below us on the evolutionary ladder. However, the fact is that an integral part of us has remained completely primitive and barbarian. Human history has not only given us opportunity, but has forced us to learn how to channel our aggressions into more civilized activities (competitive sports, career, etc), and in civilized times, we tend to forget about our potential for utter violence.However, in times of chaos, political and otherwise, our innate brutality is allowed to erupt without inhibition. Usually, humans will then immerse themselves passionately into genocide and murder, as is well recorded in human history. The moralists try to think deeply about it, and ask: What went wrong ? The answer given in this film is: Nothing went wrong - we are a violent breed, it is our nature. Only the mechanisms containing our violence have broken down.Alex in ""a clockwork orange"" is that brutal, raging monkey buried inside of us by the nature of our genes, in some deeper than in others. The bottom line is that society, civilization, morals, ethics, and religion all serve as tentative mechanisms to contain the destructive, sadistic devil inside us without which we wouldn't be human.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Cult classic.,"""A Clockwork Orange"" can be the scariest film you've ever seen, because one day our society may end up like the one seen in the film--a place where ordinary people are afraid to walk outside even in the daytime, where innocent young women can be taken from the streets and raped, where the government itself doesn't seem the perfect solution. Sound familiar? Perhaps in twenty years, you'll be staring into the blue eyes of Alex while he asks you in his Nadsat slang if you value your life.Possibly Stanley Kubrick's best film after ""2001""--but who can put Kubrick's films into any particular ranking when they're all so excellent? ""A Clockwork Orange"" is not a ""cool"" film in any sense. It's not sick or offensive or bad. It's a social commentary on life, and the book on which the film is based is even better--though the film is perfect because of its visual look of the near future. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is already a cult classic--and future generations will watch it and hopefully learn from it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of Kubrick's best,"From the cold, haunting, electronic opening theme of A Clockwork Orange (written and directed by Stanely Kubrick), you can tell immediately that this will be a very unsettling film.  Alex's (played by Malcolm McDowell) leering stare into the camera, as it slowly zooms away, is very menacing, and you can tell instantly that this isn't a fellow to be messed with! Through the narration, he tells you of his gang or his droogs as he calls them, and his fondness for something called 'ultra-violence'.   We then come to the first scene, where he and his gang savagely beat up a defenceless old drunkard.  Then they get into a fight with another gang, which is played to classical musical, but strangely enough, it seems to fit in perfectly with the violence on screen,  which I think is part of Stanely Kubrick's skill as a director.  After that, they steal a car, and go joy riding down a country lane, with little regard at all to any other people on the road.  They then come to a quiet house, owned by a writer and his wife, which they have chosen for what Alex calls, 'Surprise visit'.  What this surprise visit consists of is forcing their way into the house, trashing up there home, and in between beating up the writer, raping his wife in front of him, Alex cheerfully sings, 'Singin'' in the Rain'.  It's such a horrible, disconcerting, violent scene that it's really very difficult to watch, and all this happens in the first few opening scenes!  But it isn't as bleak as this the whole way through.  There are some nice, comical touches to it, such as Alex's slimy parole officer, who at the end of every sentences says, `Yes?', and tries on several occasions to touch Alex up.  Also, when Alex eventually goes to prison for killing a lady, the warden (played by Michael Bates) seems as if he's stepped straight out of the set of 'Porridge', as he's very similar Mr. MacKay, albeit he swears a whole lot more!  There's also the prison priest, who's a rather amusing character, too.  However, the most complicated character in the whole film is Alex.  Although he has committed some awful crimes, for some reason, and I think this is partly down to Malcolm MacDowell's acting, and Stanely Kubrick's direction, you not only feel sorry for him, but you identify and sympathise with him.  Alex is, essentially, still a child, as he lives with his parents, and goes to school.  Also, when he's told that one of his victims is now dead, he's speechless, almost as if it's never occurred to him that somebody could die from his actions.   He keeps a pet too, a snake called Basil, which although is an usual animal to have, it does show that he has a sensitive side. Also, there is a far darker side to his personality, too.  When he reads the Bible, he fantasies about torturing Jesus, and leading many of the battles that happened in the Old Testemant, but has an angelic look on his face while reading it, making the priest think he's had some sort of religious enlightenment!   The main thing that you wonder when watching this film is what kind of society created Alex, and during his time in prison, that question is answered.  The government is clearly a near  state totalitarian state, and consider Alex to be a petty criminal, more concerned about political prisoners.   When Alex undergoes the Ludovico treatment, where he's forced to watch violent images of murders, rapes, and even footage from concentration camps, all to the music of Bethoven, in order to make him a 'better person'.  However, as the priest says, he has no choice on whether to be good or not, and that's essentially what makes us human.  Without the choice, we cease to be human beings, which is one of the many deep themes of the film.  Also, we get the impression that Alex has been through all this before, as his prohibition officer hints that he's been in trouble before, and at the end of the film, it appears that he's back to his old self again. In short, I think A Clockwork Orange is possibly one of Stanely Kubrick's greatest films, and is also one of the best films ever made.  It's a dark, twisted masterpiece of cinema.  It's a bit heavy going, but it's well worth watching!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Horrible,"This is a short review - I think this film is horrible. Showing scenes of rape and violence, this film is a piece of trash. It glorifies what it presumes to decry. It does nothing to really help people - it just encourages the violence that is in the world today. Young kids watch this and feel their emerging sexism and hatred are well-justified. The rapist mentality is what feeds this films. It's hypocritical in the extreme, because of this. Kubrick should have had to do ten years parole at a rape shelter to see the devastation up close. Anyone who gets off on this movie should have to do the same. It's too bad that so many movies add to the hatred that exists in the world today - and it makes it even more heinous if they are done well - it's creativity in the service of something trashy and hateful.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Bizarre! Metaphorical! Sardonic!,"The reasons behind the troubled release of Stanley Kubrick's jet black comedy satire have been misread over the years (I would go so far as to say deliberately mis-written by the tabloid press) meaning that when the film finally received a posthumous UK release it was assumed that the film was previously 'banned' on the basis of copycat incidents. In fact, Kubrick himself demanded the film never be shown in his adopted country out of fear for his family's safety, following hate mail and death threats, the exact content and source of which may never be known.That is not to say the film is NOT shocking. The violence inflicted by Little Alex (Malcolm MacDowell, fresh off that other anti-establishment classic If...) and his droogs is deliberately, sickeningly glorified; it's as if they are playing out their fantasies as if performing on some great stage, complete with their own Shakespearean-style syntax not spoken by straight-cued Ma 'n' Pa (Philip Stone and Sheila Raynor). One of the opening scenes is a ludicrously exaggerated fist-fight played out in a deserted theatre.Very few redeeming characters raise their head above the mire. As a result, we, as an audience, are left in the unenviable position of sympathising with the calculated, and later stricken, rapist and murderer at the film's centre. Or rather, we are forced to sympathise with his predicament: stripped of his free will, is he truly human at all? Even HAL 9000, the homicidal super-computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey, possessed the power of choice.Superficially, this is the most dated of Kubrick's films, distinguished by psychedelic art design straight from the turn-of-the-decade era. But we should not allow this to detract from the fact that Kubrick and (original novel writer) Anthony Burgess' future vision is essentially a stylised depiction of logical sociological progression, complete with hyperbole, and just because today's thugs DON'T maraud in bowler hats and over-sized codpieces, spouting pidgin Russian over pints of alcoholic milk, does not make the film-makers' alternative version of reality any less convincing. Nor less relevant: as always, Kubrick's themes are timeless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
what a disappointment....,"I just saw this film for the first time about an hour ago, and I really didn't think Alex was cool. In fact not at all. He seemed intelligent but like most psychopath's that really doesn't say much. I really dug the soundtrack and the point Kubrick was making on violence. I also thought it had to do with the media and how his parents just believed more in the papers than in their own son. It struck a chord with a lot of social issues that are still problems to this day, but it could have been shorter and have illustrated the same points. I also found some scenes to be really bland, almost like eyes wide shut. As usual it seems like people hyped up this movie to be the end all be all of all films when in reality I'd give it a 6 out of 10. six because it really left this impact with me, you can just tell the picture had this magnitude of power behind it (some scenes are really jarring)....but with richer dialogue and a shorter storyline, I would've been more satisified.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very creative but repulsive at the same time,"It's a dystopian film about delinquency and mind control set in England, probably in the 1980s, though its imagery comes from the late 1960s. Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) leads a small gang of thugs that includes Dim (Warren Clarke) and Georgie (James Marcus). Alex is an anomaly as he is highly literate and is obsessed with Ludwig van Beethoven, especially his Ninth Symphony. The gang is obsessed with violence and sex, and the film shows a night of violence against a homeless man, an opposing gang, and a writer and his wife. Later, Alex has a falling out with his gang members. He assaults a woman who owns many cats, but Dim and Georgie beat him, allowing the police to seize him.The cat woman dies, and Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. After two years, he applies for a new two-week therapy that creates a Pavlovian aversion to violence and sex. He successfully completes the program, is released, and faces a confusing world as he tries to return home and deal with violence against himself by earlier victims.""A Clockwork Orange"" is a challenging movie to describe. It is very visually stylized, with long, narrow rooms and a dance-like flow to many scenes. The dialogue is a kind of gang jargon. The violence and sexual aggression are explicit but fast-paced.

It doesn't feel like a Kubrick film to me, and there's not much artistry to it.But, in films like this and his other visual masterpiece Barry Lyndon; art is rampant and it takes a lot to squeeze everything in. So much happens in the course of this film it's insane. It's fast-paced, intense, brilliantly acted and scored.From a board, I've something I said in trying to 'prove' to someone this film was good, since saying the same thing twice would be a bit trivial, I now quote myself; (I'm lazy)Malcolm McDowell's performance is brilliant and energetic while being subtle at the same time. He delivers his lines well without looking like he's reading for the sake of the script. He didn't play Alex -- he became Alex.Stanley Kubrick's direction is astounding here. More-so than other Kubrick films I'd say. Watch how he conducts his camera so methodically. After the singing in the rain bit (in which Alex sung to the estranged writer) how they walk back through the milk-bar. The camera is first focused on the stairs as the come down it, as they advance towards the camera it begins to back up; after that it spirals to the side and then behind them and follows them. Also, when they first meet with the old man when they're coming up to him all you can see is their shadows cast on the wall before him. Beautiful moments are strewn about everywhere. Such as when Alex is walking home from the milk-bar, to his home (the first time we see it; before the brilliant directed 9th symphony montage as he's going to sleep) and he's walking through an abandoned futuristic court-yard of sorts and all you can hear is a somber whisper.The music is used well in every scene, and sometimes it's to the point where it reminds of the imagery produced by the original disney film Fantasia. I don't have to explain the music being great, I doubt you question that.The story, to me, is imaginative and brilliant. A writer, writing of his wife being murdered by hooligans is writing a story, the story we're watching, thus he's writing about a writer who's in the book he's writing about writing about the book he's in. It's brilliant because it's a poetic pi; which is very hard to create.The questions on moral choice have given me nice long thoughts at night. Think about it; so Alex was a rapist and a murderer; is that crime enough to take away his humanity by stripping him of moral choice. Stripping someone of their ability to choose is worse than murder.So many things happen within the film, think about it. It comes on and things spiral into the main story. Many many many memorable scenes and they're all done so well. First, they beat up an old man, terrorize the road and then go to the writer's home. After they make their way back to the milk-bar and things continue to happen rapidly. Events pour in and out in a constant and well timed pace for it all.It's more imaginative and unique than any movie I've ever seen. It's one of a kind and will never be copied without complete failure. The Usual Suspects plot has, and will be done, again. Same with these other movies with the 'great twists' at the end. They're just fluff with no moral center, no questions about humanity or anything else that actually matters. A Clockwork Orange is a character study and portrait of evil. The Usual Suspects is a quotable action flick with a 'twist.' The made up language delighted me throughout the film. There's no way you could predict the ending to this film, there's too many possibilities.As for you saying I need to watch mindless action movies -- that offends me. I do, but I dont hold them in too high of a regard. Such as Leon, I watch it for it's mindless action. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark and other action films. I love the stupid flick as much as the next guy -- but they dont really matter to me. They're not art -- they're just entertaining portraits. Art is something that makes a statement. The one reason people rate this lowly is because I think people get other ideas of what the ending should be; and as sporadic as this film is, I don't believe there's anyway to predict the ending.A+: Anyone who appreciates film as an art medium should experience this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick at his finest,"I'm a guy who like quality before quantity. Less is more if you know what I'm saying. So Stanley Kubrick is for obvious reasons one of my all-time favorite directors. He didn't make many movies, but those he made are excellent works of art. And that brings me to my personal favorite of all his movies: A Clockwork Orange.The film is about a young man named Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). He is a guy who likes music, especially Beethoven, but he is also found of rape and ultra violence.One night however, he get's arrested and goes to jail. In jail he hears about an experiment, were criminals are turned from bad to good. Still, as the priest puts it: ""Goodness is something to be chosen. When a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man."" Alex goes through this experiment and returns to society being, as it seems, ""cured"" from his criminality. Or is he? A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant piece of film-making, making us ask question. What is good and bad about man? What makes us good or bad? And at the same time this is a very psychological movie questioning our own moral code. Do we have the right to force people into goodness? Okay, some people may not like the film. Either because they can't understand the psychological bit or because they don't like the violence. I took this to school once and there were only me and another one who liked it. This is a very raw film, even with todays standards and it's nothing for the faint of heart. But if you wan't to see an intelligent film about the dark side of man, this is a film for you.""It had been a wonderful evening and what I needed now, to give it the perfect ending, was a little of the Ludwig Van."" - Alex",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best Kubrick film ever.,"There never is, never was, or never will be a film like A Clockwork Orange. This film is so ahead of its time I can't even imagine what people thought about in 1971 let alone 2001. It is a dizzying array of violence, black humour and special camera shots that sets this movie apart. There might have been imitators to this film and Pulp Fiction is definitely influenced by this film but there is no film like this one. Kubrick is brilliant with all the special camera angles, editing and whatever else he does. Malcolm McDowell is fantastic as Alex the troubled youth who gets brainwashed for his own good and suffers the consequences. And Beethoven's music is the perfect score for this film.

Spastic Porn?,"After watching the network premier on Channel 4, I was pretty much left wondering what all the fuss was about.  As is the case in many Kubrick films, nothing is left to the imagination in this futuristic ""shocker"". The special vernacular used by the movie's juvenile delinquents puts me in mind, however, of the ""computer-nerd"" language used by teenagers at the start of the new millenium as a way of setting themselves apart from their 'square' and 'pedestrian' elders.  A future society that revells in extreme violence was also more than touched upon in the 1976 film ""Rollerball"", but thankfully these dire predictions have not yet been realised.  A much better film (based on a protracted adventures of a young man, at odds with the world around him) would have been ""O, Lucky Man"" (also with Malcom McDowal), two years later.  As a film of prophecy, one has to say that ""Clockwork Orange, A"", like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", pretty much fails in every respect.  So the question has to be asked - ""What was all the fuss about?""",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Cinematic Work of Symbolism,"""A Clockwork Orange,"" directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, stands as a remarkable testament to the power of symbolism in cinema. Kubrick's genius is on full display as he skillfully translates intricate symbolic elements onto the big screen, inviting audiences to delve into a dark and thought-provoking exploration of human nature and societal control.While ""A Clockwork Orange"" might not evoke the conventional range of emotions that many films do, it undeniably demands attention and contemplation. It's a film that isn't meant to be simply watched.Watching ""A Clockwork Orange"" at least once in a lifetime is an experience that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on anyone willing to brave its intellectual and emotional depths.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Try it: if you don't like it, you don't.  If you like it, you'll love it","A couple months ago, a Stanley Kubrick film festival was on TCM, so I decided to tape his movies-me being a great fan of him.  The first one I watched happened to be A Clockwork Orange, and I immediately became a fan. Granted, this movie is certainly not for everyone (especially the faint of heart), but everything in the movie is highly notable, including the direction, performances, camera views, music, script, and the novel it was based on. The movie begins with the adventures and times of Alex DeLarge, a vicious teenage monster, and his three droogs: Pete, Georgie, and Dim.  His main interests are Beethoven, rape, and ultraviolence (especially the old surprise visit).  On one unfortunate outing, the millicents (police) catch him as the rest of his gang flees.  He's thrown in staja (State Jail), but soon sees an opportunity for early release if he consents to be a test subject for a new technique for treating criminals.  He does, and is virtually reduced to a machine, or 'clockwork orange'.  He is robbed of his ability to choose, and in turn ceases to be a man.  There's quite a bit more of a twist near the end of the movie, so I won't spoil it for you.I would recommend this movie to anyone over 18, any movie buffs, aspiring filmmakers, or Kubrick fans.

Alex DeLarge is a character that has transcended time and art and become immortal; his journey is one of profound meaning.

Beethoven???,"i think is important the connection between the violent nature of Alex and Beethoven. But, which may be his reason? I think that perhaps a taste for Beethoven is due to the desire for Alex to preserve his intellectual or classical profile, or perhaps to show through as Beethoven handle his anger. In the music of Beethoven you can see aggressiveness, drama, beauty; perhaps why Alex looked attracted by this music and this music inspired him to commit his acts of violence, either hitting the people or sexually transgress them. Of course he can not be awarded to blame Beethoven by the violent actions of Alex; I also believe that his action was due to their negative attitude towards life and believe that through violence could burn his adrenaline and feel as powerful as he so wished.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The violence is a mechanism to get the deeper meanings across,"This is not some flick with random violence and a simple message.  Make no mistake, the violence is horrifying.  It's meant that way.  It's meant to be a reflection on how society was progressing in the future, where for some ultraviolence is a way of life.This movie can be divided into thirds.  The first third delves into the madness of violence, and the horror a few ultraviolent individuals can produce in a society.  The second third is about reformation and the price of reformation - can a society take away an individual's right to free will to protect itself?  The final third is again a commentary on violence - this time that the violence is inherent in our society, that we are ALL products, and instigators, of violence.  We're not supposed to feel sorry for Alex! We're supposed to feel happy that he's getting what he deserves!!  But that's the mastery of the film - in the end our lust for revenge is no different that Alex's ultraviolence, and the ""treatment"" eventually blows up in the government's and societies' and in our (the audience's) face.  Alex ends up the same as always, just much richer and with immunity from the consequences of his actions.This film is violent.  It is disturbing.  It questions the lines between justice and revenge, beauty and horror, societies' greater need and an individual's basic human rights.  It does so against a backdrop that is at once soothing (Beethoven's ninth) and horrifying (the ultraviolence). A Clockwork Orange is brilliant, but to appreciate its full impact, one has to get over the brutality of the film.  The deeper meanings will be lost to anyone who can't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My Favorite Movie Of All Time!,"Stanley Kubrick's dark, ultra-violent and morbidly witty masterpiece is a film that cannot be seen indifferently.  Those who view it fall distinctly into two seperate and opposed attitudes:  Those who think it is nauseatingly sick, and those who love it.  I fall into the latter category.  This is my all time favorite movie.  It is probably one of the most controversial films in history, and certainly Kubrick's most daring.  The entire length of the movie, adapted from Anthony Burgess' dark novel, is unrelentingly violent, horrifying and if you can laugh at those things, you'll love it.  THe story is as fascinating as the main character Alex, dealing with the concept of human choice in a delightfully sadistic way.  But the concept itself is not the only attraction, Alex himself creates a positively delightful love-hate relationship between himself and the viewer.  His napoleanic complex and fascination with his own sense of control is brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm MacDowell.  When released in 1971, this film received an X-Rating, and while it would be less controversial today, it still has enough violence, sex, nudity, rape and sadism to transcend almost all the films punched out by today's ultra-violent, MTV driven culture.  In conclusion, while not a film for everyone, A Clockwork ORange is an undisputed masterpiece with an everlasting appeal for those of use who can laugh at ""a bit of the ole' ultra-violence.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Cured, alright","So how did Singin' In The Rain co-director Stanley Donen react after a private viewing of Stanley Kubrick's dark satire? A film in which Malcolm McDowell's band of phallic-mask-wearing psychos croon Gene Kelly's signature song as they subject a terrified couple to some ultra-violence and a bit of the old in-out? Donen emerged from the screening room to find Kubrick pacing nervously outside. ""That was very mischievous,"" Stanley told Stanley. ""But very good!""'Very good' was also the verdict from the BBFC, who passed it without reservation and uncut. Only later would the media and local councils demonize the movie, alleging copycat violence and the like. While Kubrick, under threats of death, ultimately banned it from British cinemas.But what happens when a film made infamous by absence, is granted the oxygen of re-release? What happens is that, in the year 2000, Woolworths, the epitome of high street probity, include the DVD in their advertising campaign as 'Santa's perfect Christmas gift'. And who's lasted longer?

One Of The Most Ambiguous Movies Ever Made,"Whilst the reader of this review will question my title, I implore them to read the other reviews of this movie, and it will become clear why I chose such a title. This movie is purely dependent on the person watching the movie, what he/she takes from it.The film was made in 1971, some 43 years before I'm writing this review. I have more pros then cons about this movie, but let's start with the cons. I felt the movie did not shock me as some other movies have, perhaps this is because in nearly half a century we have wised up to the deep, dark underbelly of this world or quite simply I have been exposed to it. Further to this, the film was a bit long to watch in one sitting. Finally, the actual lingo was a bit to hard to understand, and I've lived in England for 11 years now!The positives were I thought the actual cinematography and filming of this was pretty good, and the main protagonists acting was second-to- none. More to the point, I really adore how this movie depicts that as a criminal, he continued to get away with multiple crimes but it was only once he became good (by force, may I add) that he was well and truly eaten up by the world. Whilst harsh, it shows that the world we live in now may not have much space left for the pure of heart anymore. To follow from this, I like how the main character shows that each human is different, and how when it comes to someone's mental state, anything can trigger a reaction unexpected. The best example of this is his reaction to Beethoven's 9th symphony. I especially like how the film portrays the underhanded dealings of a government, summed up in the scene at the end with the main character sitting with the Minister, whom speaks so politically in a way that basically depicts the sneaky way in which politicians go about their business.Whilst I only gave this film a 7, I would say it is a much watch as there is something oddly fascinating about this film, and kudos to the director for filming it in such a way that everyone has a different opinion and focal point on the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Worst Movie Ever Made,"I knew what I was getting into with Kubrick, and I've either strongly liked or disliked every movie he's made.This was a whole other experience.This film was total garbage. To enjoy any aspect of this film you have to completely walk away from the concept that films should be enjoyed.If when you pick up a movie, rather than popcorn, you prefer to buy a bag of broken stained glass from a orphanage window to eat while you watch it...than this is probably the show for you and ignore my post.As for me, I like popcorn. And I like movies that are enjoyable on some level. Inspite of what appears to be a ton of movie critics want to tell you, this movie is not enjoyable, educational, or even deep.First and foremost, it is long. Really long. Ridiculously long for as little as it ties to accomplish. And just when you think ""my god, this film has been on for a week and half, surely it has to be over soon,"" it keeps going. Of the six people who came to my house to watch this movie, I was the only one that didn't walk out.Most of the aspects of why this film sucks have already been discussed at length. I will tell you why I hated it most.It wasn't the violence, I can handle that. I found it poorly incorporated (which was remarkable as it is the primary focus of the entire film).It wasn't the artsiness. I can usually enjoy that in films.What bothered me most was after I watched this film, I read a ton of reviews and internet analysis of this movie thinking that there has to be more to this than what meets the eye.There wasn't. I actually got it.There was little depth to what this movie was trying to say other than the kiddie pool deep discussion of the definition of morality, conformity, and behavior that a 4th grader could have picked up on.I am not anti-violence. I am not anti-creative. I am anti-worthless. And this movie is worthless in every level I can relate to you.The only people who will like this movie are those stuck up, smarter than thou, I am so much deeper than you that I urne to find stuff the rest of the world hates, snobbish pricks who have no friends and probably work at the video store you rented this from.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
2nd most poetic and artistic,"Aside from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", A Clockwork Orange is probably the most poetic and artistic movie ever made. From it's haunting and downright frightening first shot of Alex's face (with his perfectly constructed wardrobe and one fake eyelash, an idea nothing short of genius), to the dialogue (consisting mainly of Nasdat, a language similar to english though certain terms are used in replacement of our terms. Example: Good=Horrorshow, In-Out, In-Out=Sex), to the ultra-modern houses that Alex and his droogs raid, to the ironic and disturbing idea of having Alex sing ""Singing In The Rain"" while shamelessly raping a middle-aged woman, to the fish eye lens shots Kubrick uses to capture imagery, to the contraption that forces Alex to watch the ludivico video, and finally to the overall question of the entire movie: What is it better for a man to be--naturally evil or mechanically enforced good? Alex has a chance to experience them both.Now to the plot: Alex (Malcolm McDowell)is a disturbed youth who spends his days faking sick from school so he and his droogs (friends) can drink milk-plus at a bar or go out for ""a little of the ultra-violence"" It is kind of like a gang of theirs, which Alex leads, consisting of 4 members. They wear the same costumes, fight other gangs, beat up homeless drunks, rape innocent women and sometimes kill them, and try to run cars off the road. Alex is obsessed with Beethoven, who he refers to as ""Ludwig Van"". He associates Beethoven with sexual violence. After he angers his droogs and puts down a potential mutiny through (what else?) violence, they decide to double cross him by knocking him out after he kills a woman, leaving him for the police. He hates it in prison, but he manages to humour the religious head there by pretending to be interested in the bible (all he really cares about in the bible are the sexual and violent parts, which he imagines himself in). Through gaining the religious head's favor, he is allowed to get off early for his crimes, on one condition--he undergoes the ""Ludovico Treatment"": a treatment supposed to cure the need for violence. The treatment consists of holding Alex in a chair, putting him in a straitjacket, forcing his eyelids to stay open by putting hooks under his eyes, keeping his head stationary, and thereby forcing him to watch the video that they display: A video of sexual violence with a soundtrack of bastardized Beethoven music. Alex is absolutely shellshocked at the sights and sounds of this video. After he watches it, you see him on a stage crouching down. A topless woman walks onto the stage. He reaches for her breasts. Before his hands can get there, he crumples over and starts gagging. Whenever Alex now thinks a violent thought, he becomes unbearably sick. Then he goes back into the everyday world, where the tables are turned on him in almost every way.... Malcolm McDowell's performance perhaps ranks among the 10 best ever given. His brave portrayal of an absolutely monstrous teen is so frighteningly believable that the mere sight of him is scary. The music is appropriately moody, as it is in all Kubrick movies. The art direction is flawless, as is the cinematography. This is the most Kubrickesque of all his films, and probably his best overall. The surreal atmosphere is disturbingly relevant, though perhaps not at first glance. This movie deserved oscars for best picture, best actor, best director, best adapted screenplay, best cinematography, best art direction, best costume design, and best sound. IT GOT NONE OF THEM!!! It was nominated for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, and best editing. What did it lose to in all 4 categories? THE FRENCH CONNECTION!!! The two movies are completely incomparable--The French Connection seems so shallow compared to A Clockwork Orange. It's losing to The French Connection ranks among the top 5 mishaps of the oscars: the other 4 being Citizen Kane losing to How Green Was My Valley, an unnominated Vertigo losing to GIGI?!?!, Goodfellas losing to Dances With Wolves, and Pulp Fiction losing to Forrest Gump (Honorable mention goes to an unnominated Usual Suspects losing to the poorly acted Braveheart). In retrospect, one wonders how any of them could've happened, but they did. Somehow. See A Clockwork Orange. And if you're one who says it is nothing but ""sexual, ugly rubbish,"" you probably (not definitely) should be forced to be placed in a contraption not unlike the one Alex was forced into, and be forced to watch the movie over and over until you realize the true wonder of cinema that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Kubrick masterpiece,"As relevant today as when the film was made 30 years ago, Kubrick's film has become a classic. I include it in my best ten. With keen penetrating vision Kubrick has given us a slice of life as it was....and still is. Let's face it....what has changed? Rampant youths stealing cars, breaking into homes, daubing walls with grafitti, overdosing on drugs, bashing the elderly, involving themselves in murder, rape and terrorism.  What a prophetic film! And how magnificently does Andrew McDowell portray the character of Alex Delarge (under Kubrick's expert direction).  This actor was at the right place at the right time and Kubrick seized the opportunity.  McDowell has never done better than his role in ""A Clockwork Orange"".The various brutal acts performed by Alex and his gang have been amply described by other reviewers.  They are scenes not easily forgotten, and the hatred, disgust and loathing captured in Alex's expression is a credit to his acting ability.Alex's so-called rehabilitation was an interesting part of the film. While ""aversion therapy"" is not so much in use to-day because of the introduction of new medications, to have one's neck clamped and eyelids pinned back is an unenviable position to be in and actual torture for Alex. The subsequent testing of the success of the treatment by exposing a naked woman in close proximity to Alex in front of the assessing medical fraternity seemed to me to be primitive to an extreme, but it made good cinema.The media report on Alex's attempted suicide with its political ramifications brought a new sense of power to Alex. As the Government Minister pandered to his every need, even feeding him with a fork. (I laughed outright at this point. It was such a humourous situation).The film does not state what happens to Alex.  It gives us little hope.The best that can be said is that Kubrick thrusts the facts directly at us and just as in the """"aversion therapy"" we cannot turn away. This film has such a strong message. What has happened in these intervening years....what have we accomplished to put things right? Sad to say....nothing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Eggiwegs.,"Kubrick's mesmerically unsettling glance at an unimaginable future UK overtaken by the barbarically indifferent is somehow both extremely dated and weirdly timeless. Looking and sounding like a wild mash between the drugged-out end of the 1960s and some lost 18th C epic. It's a style-over-substance type affair as the narrative is fairly tissue thin. The alien framing of everything is far more fascinating than anything actually happening within it, especially after the bombastic first half an hour where it begins to lurch aimlessly onwards, bunching up and tumbling over one improbable coincidence to the next. The cast are utterly brilliant, and I always get a hoot out of seeing Aubrey Morris showing up (here portraying the psychotically perverted Mr Deltoid).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Kubrick's best,"I have read many comments here about the movie being disturbing or offensive but believe me, that is not true. This film is a stunning visual experience. As with most of the Kubrick films attention to detail is quite apparent here. From the costumes to the sets to the music to the acting, everything is just perfect. I need not say anything more.As regards to the films relevance today, I would like to say that films like these are ageless. They will always be relevant. The central premise of the film questions whether it is correct to suppress the free spirit of an individual, even to do wrong, for the greater good of the society. I think that this premise remains as significant today as it was 100 years ago and would be, a 1000 years from now.I had always thought that 2001 was Kubrick's masterpiece, but that was until I saw A Clockwork Orange. I can only now sit back and marvel at the genius that was Stanley Kubrick. I just wish we had more filmmakers like him today.Highly recommended to everyone. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Full of shocking and remarkable sequences, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a masterpiece that constantly promotes debates that reflect on political and social pillars","Originally, the story was written nine years earlier by British author Anthony Burgess. It was born as a dystopian novel about a rotten society, more specifically young Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), a 15-year-old sociopath who runs a gang of boys - his ""droogs"", as they are called - through the streets. Together they commit everything from petty crimes (such as theft or driving at high speed) to acts of violence and vandalism in a forgotten and lawless Britain. In one of these acts, after invading a lady's house and committing a murder, Alex is captured by the police and is invited to be a guinea pig in the Ludovico experiment, a method that promises a possible cure for violence and the containment of a citizen's perverse desires. Who was once considered a monster.Both for its socio-political bias and for embracing the point of view of an extremely controversial anti-hero, A Clockwork Orange is an opinion divider. The fact is that Kubrick is not concerned with being careful in the sense of polishing what would be the ugly parts of the plot. The narrative is brutal, naked and raw, and almost nothing is omitted from the viewer. Scenes of sex, rape and cowardice are portrayed with a certain naturalness, without filters, to illustrate the protagonist's vision of what he himself calls ""ultraviolence"". However, far from an exaltation of violence, the feature prefers to encrypt the message with an almost imperceptible irony. If taken at the foot of the letter, A Clockwork Orange distorts itself in relation to what it really is.Another great point of the script is the break with the idea of duality, since it was at that time that films that did not deal, in a way, with a fight against ""good and evil"" began to appear. These concepts are mixed up in such a way that the viewer is confused, no longer knowing whether to despise or sympathize with the protagonist. The phrase that best describes the plot goes almost unnoticed, said by a mere extra. At the beginning of the film, Alex and his droogs attack a homeless man, who claims that people have started to look up too much to Heaven, that they have ended up abandoning Earth. It is a perfect allusion to the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, over who could get to space first.The phrase that best describes the plot goes almost unnoticed, said by a mere extra. At the beginning of the film, Alex and his droogs attack a homeless man, who claims that people have started to look up too much to Heaven, that they have ended up abandoning Earth. It is a perfect allusion to the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, over who could get to space first. It stands out, the Ludovico treatment, to which Alex is submitted, the iconic scene in which the protagonist's eyes are forced to remain open by a metallic device, forcing him to watch brutal scenes of acts similar to those he committed to the sound of the 9th Beethoven's symphony, his favorite. However, an aversion towards the violent act is installed in him, which removes from the protagonist his defense reflexes and part of his identity. This detail is the basis for substantiating one of the surveys most associated with the film: the failure of the State.Kubrick presents a colorless character to the viewer's eyes, dressed in a gray and white uniform. Malcolm McDowell (Caligula), who plays Alex brilliantly, walks through the streets of a city that is in ruins: dirty, dark, poverty and carelessness installed in all public spaces. There is an oversight of what the ""authorities"" would be, characters that are hidden until halfway through the film - here represented on a smaller scale, which would be that of the prison system. It starts from the assumption that the situation of helplessness and constant oppression by the State would result in two unknowns: citizens who become subservient and consistent, without questioning, the situation to which they are submitted; or the opposite is created, a marginalized ""parasite"" that reverberates discontent through aggressiveness. Therefore, the delinquency created in the protagonist is the result of its own creator, the establisher of norms. On the other hand, there is the mockery of an elite that isolates itself and protects itself from criminality. The production design adorns them in a different way: both the furniture and the costumes are given vibrant colors, referencing the pop-art movement that was in vogue. If Alex's behaviors seek to destroy himself and others, those of this elite are different, valuing self-care and activities such as writing and yoga (to this day referred to as ""idle"" practices, which only those who don't need money would have concern to do).Several are the central points of the narrative. Juvenile delinquency, which is caused by various political and social factors, juvenile delinquency is illustrated throughout the film. Alex and his companions are frustrated teenagers, with no goals, who only feel pleasure and enthusiasm through the consumption of drugs and the practice of violent acts. Within the gangs themselves, hierarchies and structures of social oppression are repeated, with tyrannical leaders like Alex Delarge. Precarious human relationships and sex as aggression. The erratic behavior of this youth is the result of a sick society where human relationships are practically non-existent. Families, totally distanced from teenagers, are unable to control or discipline them. With their time consumed by work and exhaustion, they neglect their children and end up abandoning them. The bonds of friendship and brotherhood between companions are also fragile, with fights and betrayals. This results in the absolute loneliness of these individuals who cannot depend or trust anyone. The extreme sexualization that runs through this entire society translates into a notorious objectification of women who are now seen as prey that men hunt for fun. Thus, following their most animalistic instincts, they turn sex into rape, attack and mere demonstration of power.Another of the main reflections to which the film leads is the legitimacy of the measures to punish and contain crime promoted by the government. Using all weapons, without measuring moral and ethical consequences, Justice also becomes criminal. Prisoners are seen as a problem that must be solved at all costs, even if it means forgetting their rights, their humanity and individuality, controlling their minds. The authoritarian state tries to solve social problems through violence, without re-education. The transformation in individuals does not happen thanks to their will, but only through manipulation, conditioning (as if they were animals). Alex Delarge and his companions in crime are products and symptoms of this diatopical society.The sequences in the film are shocking because it is not common to see this type of cruelty shown with irony in many moments, and especially, with classical music in the background. And yet: imagine what it's like to hear Alex sing and dance to ""Singing in the Rain"" while committing barbarities? Really remarkable because until here the music reminded us of a beautiful Hollywood musical. Yes, but the soundtrack of A Clockwork Orange is a spectacle of its own: in addition to classical music and Hollywood success, there is the futuristic touch of Wendy Carlos, who created the film's memorable and strong music, which you may not remember exactly how it sounds., but when you hear it you will know where it comes from. The theme is different as well as everything else in the film. Several types of art are highlighted in the film: the very elegant environments following the influences of pop art; the dances and songs (Alex commits the greatest atrocities, but loves to listen to Beethoven, and classical music plays for much of the film), the slow motion sequences, (like the moment when Alex throws his friends into the river) and the script which goes into great detail about the character's path (like when he goes to get the new treatment and various roles are signed one by one).Much more than shocking scenes, the film is also iconic because of its cast, led by Alex DeLarge (a clever English pun on ""Alexander the Great"") was probably the role of a lifetime for Malcolm McDowell, who absolutely shines. Leader of a gang who spends his time beating people, raping, robbing, using drugs and committing all kinds of atrocities, it's hard to imagine that the public could fall in love with such a figure. But it's inevitable: at some point you'll find yourself bewitched by the scoundrel and rooting for him on his (not easy) tour. Owner of very peculiar tastes, which combine Beethoven and snakes, Alex is the gravitational center of the film and a metaphor for ""the other"", of the observed, in this great parable that is A Clockwork Orange.It is also impossible to ignore the art direction. Conducted by Russell Hagg and Peter Sheids, it builds a futuristic imagery only possible in the 1970s, including loud colors, metallic walls, rounded furniture and props with a strong symbolic load (the bedspread on Alex's bed resembles cut oranges and works of art always have sexual references). The costumes accompany the trip and dress the characters in something that reminds a meeting between science fiction of the 1950s, the characteristic style of the 1970s (with hair that could be in an Abba clip) and a lysergic coloring, which sometimes fights with the scenery. It is curious to note that the protagonist gang renounces the colors that impregnate the rest of the ""mortals"" to dress in the most immaculate white, interrupted only by trinkets that resemble eyeballs and blood.""A Clockwork Orange"" constantly promotes debates that reflect on political and social pillars. The strongest part of it undoubtedly resonates with the way both the State and society deal with someone who ""needs to be reformed"" and why.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Awesome Movie,"A pure classic movie. A psychological Thriller. One of the best of all time. Is a comedy and a horror all in one. You can't beat this movie. A oldie but with watching. You will love this movie. Makes you wonder why can't Hollywood make more movies like this. Made in1971 but is way before its time.My favorite movie 11 June 2001 <> by Ayatollah (Florida) – See all my reviews Without a doubt, my absolute favorite film of all time. I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since. I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so under-appreciated (at least by ""casual"" movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything.Something that I don't think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the ""peace-loving citizens"" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language?

"Brutal, sexual, graphic, horrendous. One of the best movies ever? If it is, I do not want to see the worst.","I never liked this movie. It's based on a book I have not read yet, I've never found it for sale, so I can not judge if it was true to the book. However, most people seem to have a consensual opinion that this movie is brilliant and one of the best ever made. It's a nuisance movie in its very nature, as it tackles too brutal themes. It basically speaks of extreme violence and the possible ways to control it through brainwashing and absolute control over people. It's a world that no one really wants to see. If violence is something we condemn, extreme violence is disgusting. The total conditioning of a person reminds us of the times of slavery and the man as object. These are ideas that our civilization, at great cost, has learned to hate, but we all won with it. These themes would make an excellent movie and this movie would have been great if it did not overdo it all through barbarically graphic and unnecessary scenes! And the film gets worse as it shows to the public plentiful bursting and destruction, accompanied - surprise, or perhaps not - by scenes of nudity and almost explicit sex. Stanley Kubrick filled the vast majority of his films with generous doses of blood and semen. He has always seemed obsessed with all this, and I am sure that Freud would make a rather interesting analysis of that, so why would it be different in his ""magnum opus""? In the midst of all this monument to madness, we must recognize that the film tackles a complex subject and has an interesting history, although it is so abject that it ends up not worth the effort to watch. Perhaps in the future someone with courage will remake this movie in a more restrained manner, without exaggerate. We also emphasized Malcolm McDowell's excellent performance. The actor, still relatively young, went to the limit, accepting things that I, in his shoes, would not accept, and manage to maintained the interpretive level and shine. For this, he deserves congratulations.From the point of view of detail and technique, its possible that this is one of the best films ever made. But we are too shocked to notice and appreciate. And the truth is that cinema is not only technique. The audience does not fill the theater to admire the way the camera moves, the color and light of cinematography, the quality of characterization. The essence of any movie is the story told and, in this case, it's the story of a nightmare. Does the conception of a cinematographic work of art need, necessarily, to shock or cause erections? In the past, art was beauty and perfection, and I still think of art in that way. Does art now have to be deformed, sexual, pornographic and bloody? Is this art the pale reflection of our barbaric society or is merely the reflection of the apparently distorted mind of its creator?",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick's TRUE masterpiece,"A Clockwork Orange is, to put it simply, one of the scariest movies ever made. I know a lot of people like Dr. Strangelove, but I must say this is one of the best films ever made.Malcom McDowell gives an Oscar-gypt'd performance as Alex de Large who, with his droogs, go out, rape, beat, and kill many people. When, Alex finds his droogs making plans about robbing a dairy behind his back, he feels threatened but go along with their plan. Then he attacks his droogs as they walk down a pier, saying that the sound of Beethoven from a passing car inspired his violence. We see them in a restaurant and Alex once again brings up the dairy robbery plan. At the dairy they try to convince the rich lady at the dairy to let her in but she gets suspicious and calls the police. When the cops arrive, Alex's droogs betray him, knock him out, and run. To shorten his sentence Alex agrees to ""aversion therapy"" which seems to change him, or does it? Rounding out the cast are Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, and John Clive.I wish I could give this film a 6 out of 5 just for a revolutionary, directorial look, where Kubrick has many bad scenes accompanied by jolly music; where if we are to experience them as we should, we have to do it consciously, by realizing they are bad, and not because the director tells us so through the use of music and images. Just a terrific movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Dazzling and provocative; Kubrick at his creative peak.,"If there ever was a film that was shocking and twisted, yet so important and unique in cinema, that would be A Clockwork Orange. Stanley Kubrick, having just come off the success of 2001: A Space Odyssey, continued the most creative vein of his career with this adaptation of Anthony Burgess' controversial novel about gangs of young boys wrecking havoc amongst the streets of futuristic Britain.This film is so much more than just a look at the future of youth. Kubrick also is able to insert his brilliant visual style which works so well here with the subject material. For the first half hour, we are stunned, amazed at the vicious and cruel acts of Alex and his droogs. As the story moves on, under any other director the story would have become less titillating, but thanks to Kubrick's vision and a tour de force performance by Malcolm McDowell, this movie only gets better. We follow Alex through all aspects of his journey, and this is the key. By the final third, we find ourselves somewhat sympathetic for Alex despite his previous wrongdoings. Beyond this, there is also exploring the fact of whether state control is good or how much it takes until someone is devoid of their basic choice as a human being.Still, all these nuances aside, this is one movie not easily forgotten. With terrific performances, magnificent backing music, and flawless directing from one of the greatest of all time, A Clockwork Orange is a film to experience and think about for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick lays down the morality trap !!!,"'A Clockwork Orange' is violent, it's brutal, but what it's not is a film that glorifies its violence as many critics and audiences believe it does. Every scene of violence, however ugly it may be, serves a purpose thematically. The violence is often accompanied by playful classical/modern music. I think the music and playful tone of the scenes directly express the allure that violence holds in the minds of youngsters like Alex. An important aspect to be noted in the violent scenes is the lack of blood or the lack of shots showing the after-effects of violence. It's just unreasonable violence. But the lack of logic behind the committing of these violent acts and the playful tone of the scenes will make the viewer question why violence is so alluring to Alex and his 'droogs'. Why does he get stimulated by the prospect of harming others? Is Alex a bad seed, is he naturally 'evil'? Now although this question is not directly answered, there are hints and imagery littered throughout the film that suggest otherwise. In the movie, Kubrick depicts a society around Alex that cannot completely wash its hands off the crimes of Alex and claim absolution from the guilt of giving rise to boys like him. Kubrick implicitly hints towards the existence of elements like parental neglect and abuse, the insidious hypocrisy of authority figures like Mr.Deltoid, governmental impotence in dealing with and thereby curbing vandalism and criminal activity, systemic fascism and an overall societal apathy leading to perennial decadence. These elements underline the notion that Alex in spite of his demonic actions and tendencies might not be naturally evil and he might not be the sole person to blame. Alex is a product of the society that he lives in and of course a product of the government that 'protects' him.On one hand, Kubrick opens up the discussion in the social context, but at the same time, he manages to convincingly condense the discussion to a personal level too. This is because the questions of morality that this film asks will be viewed and remarked upon differently by every viewer based on their own sensibilities. After Alex undergoes the Ludovico Technique and gets completely stripped of his right to choose, everything that comes up in the film subsequently involves Kubrick making the audience ask themselves the tough central question: Should I feel sorry for Alex? This is the sequence where the extensively wild nature of Alex's 'ultra- violence' in the first half of the film achieves further relevance and purpose. Had Kubrick not had the proverbial 'balls' to show Alex at his worst in his violent days in the most visceral manner possible, the viewer's dilemma while seeing Alex suffer after undergoing the experiment, would've somewhat lost its potency. It is interesting to note that there is a reference made in the film about the distinctions between the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible. I think this is pertinent, because anyone who sides with the Old Testament's 'eye for an eye' attitude towards wrong-doers will retain their contempt towards Alex even during his moments of extreme suffering and will not sympathise with him. They will support the experiment due to the result offered by it which is the eradication of the criminal instinct, even if it means making Alex undergo inhuman treatment. But anyone who sides with the New Testament's far more liberal attitude towards wrong-doers, will sympathise with Alex and protest against the government's totalitarian decision to strip him of his humanity instead of giving him the time to redeem himself on his own. Opting in favour of the experiment means the dehumanisation of criminals who after all are still human beings. While being patient and allowing the criminal in prison to correct himself from within and then allowing him to go out into the world again, involves risking the prospect of releasing potential ticking bombs into the world who can easily revert back to their darker selves. Kubrick severely tests each and every viewer's dedication and conviction to their beliefs, no matter which side of the divide the viewer falls on with regards to the questions of morality. I appreciate the fact that unlike the original novel, Kubrick leaves the question answered without allowing Alex any sort of redemption in the end and thereby not allowing the viewer any reprieve either. He presents the problem, but doesn't present a solution to the problem because a universal, all encompassing solution to such a complex issue might not be so easily available in the first place. The relevance of the issue of capital punishment in our current times proves how even today, these issues remain unresolved. The more overarching social problems explored in the film are easier to locate and take care of, compared to the central issue of morality and the inherent subjectivity involved.'A Clockwork Orange' has the distinctive Kubrickian austerity to it. The camera placements, the intricate detailing of the sets to juxtapose futuristic advancements with dystopian decadence, the symmetrical visual compositions, the extensive use of wide angle lens, the extreme idiosyncrasies of the characters, the darkly comic tone,etc. everything screams out the name Kubrick. Now, let's talk about Malcolm McDowell. This is one of the most uninhibited portrayals of a despicable character in film history. He prances around like a peacock owning every minute. There is an intensity to him that complements Kubrick's style perfectly. McDowell's version of the 'Kubrick stare' which the film starts off with might be my favourite and the most iconic of them all. Wendy Carlos' score for the film is dark, hypnotic and again works brilliantly with Kubrick's visual style. Kubrick himself was a master when it comes to using music to underline mood and tone. Just like 2001, he makes optimum use of classical music and the music is in itself a character in the film.This is one of the easiest recommendations that I can ever make.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Every shot, dialogue, gesture, score, camera angle is chiseled, polished, studied to obsession and there is a meaning in every scene. No element available on screen is useless, meaningless. This pure masterpiece needs many many viewings, as you can guess. Malcolm Mac Dowell gives here his life time performance, it is for him THE role of his whole career. I Guess Tinto Brass will be inspired by this film to choose Malcolm Mc Dowell for his CALIGULA.

Wearing thin,"I rented this movie recently after many years, while I was on a Kubrick kick. Sadly, unlike other movies of his which only improve with age, ""Clockwork Orange"" appeared superficial and repetitious. Usually Kubrick's typical intellectuality and coldness didn't overwhelm his work because he chose subjects in which a fair degree of human passion figure, thus supplying him with a ready-made counterweight to his own approach. But when the subject is psychopathic violence and state-sponsored mind control, the limitations shine through in a hard, unyielding way. As for its shock value, that will always garner some enthusiasm from (usually younger) male viewers. No surprises there. That the limited violence is still appalling even when compared to the easy ultraviolence of more recent movies, is testament not to genius but to a failure to build a more extensive narrative framework. A lecture on morals, not a lesson.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Clockwork Orange: A Dystopian Vision of Violence and Control,"Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a bold and controversial film that delves deep into the darkest recesses of human nature, offering a disturbing and thought-provoking exploration of violence, free will, and the nature of authority. While undeniably impactful and visually stunning, the film's unflinching portrayal of brutality and manipulation may not be for everyone.Set in a dystopian future where societal decay and moral decay reign supreme, ""A Clockwork Orange"" follows the story of Alex DeLarge (played with chilling intensity by Malcolm McDowell), a charismatic but sociopathic young man who leads a gang of delinquents in a disturbing spree of violence and mayhem. When Alex is eventually captured and subjected to a controversial behavior modification experiment, the film raises profound questions about the ethics of control and the limits of individual freedom.Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the character's charisma, cruelty, and vulnerability with an unsettling authenticity. His portrayal anchors the film and drives home the central themes of power, choice, and the consequences of one's actions.Stanley Kubrick's direction is as bold and innovative as ever, with his distinctive visual style and meticulous attention to detail creating a world that is both surreal and immersive. The film's striking imagery, inventive use of music, and bold visual storytelling all contribute to a sense of unease and disorientation that mirrors the moral ambiguity at the heart of the narrative.What truly sets ""A Clockwork Orange"" apart is its willingness to confront uncomfortable truths and challenge conventional notions of morality and justice. The film forces viewers to grapple with complex ethical dilemmas and consider the implications of a society that values control over individual autonomy.However, the film's unrelenting depiction of violence and depravity may be off-putting to some viewers, as it does not shy away from the darker aspects of human behavior. The controversial themes and graphic scenes of brutality may be difficult for sensitive audiences to watch and could overshadow the film's deeper messages.In conclusion, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a 7/10 cinematic experience that offers a challenging and provocative exploration of the human condition. With its powerhouse performances, visionary direction, and thematic depth, this film is a bold and uncompromising work of art that demands to be engaged with on a deeper level. While not without its flaws and controversial aspects, ""A Clockwork Orange"" remains a seminal piece of cinema that continues to provoke discussion and debate to this day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Welly, welly, bloddy darn good movie Brother !!!","I've wanted to watch this one for a long time now, especially after all the reviews i heard from my fellow friends from the film school. Kubrick's work has always been unquestionable but this one stands out from the rest in the most classic, unique and artistic manner. The first scene of this movie introduces you to the director's vision and the accent is very catchy. Malcolm McDowell is Alex for all that he does in the movie. The music blends in fantastically and the lighting is something I can go on and on about. A very noticeable attribute for this movie would be that every scene is divided - more of different short stories but connected to one character which links them all. The jail house scene is my favorite. As writers one would tend to overlook small details which have been taken care of here as the jailer describes all of Alex's belongings.

Lots of the movie was painfully disturbing and no, I'm not talking about the protagonist beating people up or rape, I mean it was awful for him to be betrayed, the experiments they did on the protagonist and how they made him weak so he couldn't defend himself when attacked. I suppose I liked him and cared about his character despite his criminality. I think it was overly pornographic and a bit slow. It had a good ending.

Even though the movie was made back in the seventies it still captures audiences everywhere. This is a classic. I would put it in the same category as Vertigo and other classics before it. I wish they made more movies like this today, but I'm sure if they tried they would probably fail. This movie was definitely a trip and i think that everyone should see it sometime in their life. It is definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Deserves to be an icon,"This is the one moment in Kubrick's career when he overdid the `found' music thing.  He makes the most liberal use of Beethoven, Elgar, Purcell, Rossini, Dvorak, Rimsky-Korsakov ... have I left anyone out?  -although I must say that his use of music is often as cunning as ever: at its first appearance the use of Rimsky-Korsakov's `Scheherezade' struck me as being a cheap device, but it turned out a moment later to offer a sly remark on Alex's fantasy.  But `Pomp and Circumstance'?  Too obvious.That's my quibble out of the way.  When I saw it `A Clockwork Orange' did everything to justify its reputation as a masterpiece, although, curiously, very little to justify its reputation as a sick excursion into the old ultra-violence.  In fact it struck me as the product of a more civilised age.  (Whether or not it WAS the product of a more civilised age, I wouldn't know: I wasn't alive back then.)  Note how we are asked, as if it's no big deal, to feel sorry for Alex.  After committing terrible crimes he is altered so as to be physically incapable of committing any more, but this isn't enough for the people whom Alex has wronged.  They want to see him suffer.  Not to any particular end; they simply want suffering for its own sake.  I wonder how many people these days would notice that there's anything wrong with this.  We're starting to think, once again, that the purpose of the criminal courts is to exact revenge - just look at all the `vitcim's rights' activists about.Not that Kubrick's film has a message to offer them, or anyone else.  In many scenes every character present has a point and nobody is exactly right. Look at the scene where Alex is being paraded before the press as a triumph of the Ludivico technique, and the priest objects that all that has happened is that Alex has been robbed of his free will (just as he was when he was locked up).  The priest is almost right, just as the minister is almost right when he responds that hit doesn't matter, so long as the crime rate drops; but you'll notice that the reason the priest advances is a silly one: that Alex is behaving himself now only in response to a crude system of reward and punishment.  The claim that Alex has no power to make decisions, and the claim that he acts out of a fear of immediate punishment, can't BOTH be right; besides, the irony invisible to the priest, but obvious to us, is that his own fire-and-brimstone preaching is no more than an earlier version of the Ludivico technique, with this difference - it doesn't work.  Still, although we think little of the priest, and although he's wrong, we know he's on to something.  So is the prison guard whose reactions we see throughout the scene.  He doesn't take to the new technology at first, but when he sees that Alex is subject to fits of naseau - when he sees that his native cruelty will be indulged after all - he's all for it.No doubt about it - a film of marvellous complexity, and, two or three shocks of violence aside, it's a delight to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

KUBRICK'S TRUE MASTERPIECE,"""...Kubrick can do everything. He is a great director who has not yet made his great film....""  -Orson Welles 1965This is one unforgettable picture. It has been praised, hated, and argued about since its release. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is loved by critics, filmmakers, film-students, and dumb goth kids. It is hated by other critics, other filmmakers, other film-students, and dumb religious freaks. Kubrick has always been controversial, here most of all. The cause of the heat surrounding the picture is that no one can agree on what the movie is really saying. The film was hot enough to be nominated for Oscars, but too hot to win them (strange, since MIDNIGHT COWBOY won two years before).Let's get down to it. The film itself is terrific. Kubrick's cold, objective style brings the viewer the spellbinding tale of a violent, drug abusing punk in an England of the future who gets screwed by a system that longs to regain control. Anthony Burges's book provides a language that accounts for so much quotable dialogue, Kubrick's camera gives us a stark Pop Art future that is a stage for our players without overwhelming them, and Malcolm McDowell gives one of the best psychopath performances that's ever hit the screen. Viewers come away with ""Singin' in the Rain"" on their lips and a terrifying treatment on their minds. It makes Beethoven take on a whle new meaning! You won't soon forget this.The film's depiction of sex and violence made this a forbidden item in 1971. But the blood and nudity do not justify the initial X rating. The MPAA wasn't willing to admit it those days that they rated films for their mood and ideas rather than their actual content. The picture is certainly not pornography and it's not a horror film. This is a well crafted film about the problems with society and the justice system. Everyone should see this at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Style over substance,"Anyone who considers this art has never experienced violence. This is the most vile and disgusting film I have ever seen, yet typical Kubrick: style over substance. He takes great relish in the aesthetics of violence almost as if it were a ballet. And most of the audience enjoys it. From that perspective it is nothing more than a disgusting exploitation film. He then mixes the violence with humor. What's his message? Probably that a decision that is not taken consciously has no moral value. Fair enough but maybe there could have been a better subject than Alex. The film made me think that maybe the death penalty isn't such a bad idea at all I find the fascination some people feel for this Alex character just sick.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick at his Best,"This, was in fact, a very strange movie. But, it is worth watching; not only for the outrageous characters, but the way Stanley Kubrick directed.

I do admit that this film is disturbing at points, but very tender in others, a spectrum that Kubrick is good at exploiting.Malcom McDowell was excellent in the cast playing Alex, the deranged teen and crazed maniac. The entire film reminded me of the 'Monty Python' group, that is, the narration was reminiscent. And on a highlight, when released, garnered an 'X' rating, and an Academy Award nomination.

Evil is the price we pay for the freedom to be good,"To celebrate my 900th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. ""A Clockwork Orange"", based on Anthony Burgess's novel, is set in a dystopian London of the near-future. The main character is Alex, the teenage leader of a gang of juvenile delinquents, and a young man whose main pleasures in life are rape, ultra-violence and classical music, especially Beethoven. Alex is arrested and jailed after a woman is killed in the course of a robbery carried out by the gang. In jail he volunteers to take part in an experimental programme called the Ludovico technique, which effectively involves brainwashing him so that he will feel horror and nausea at the very thought of committing violent or criminal acts.The film was produced, directed, and written by that most original of cinematic auteurs, Stanley Kubrick, who finds a very original way of dealing with his subject-matter. Although it deals with social problems such as crime, violence and youth gangs it is not made in the social-realist style which had been a hallmark of the British cinema about a decade earlier. It is about as far from social realism as one can get; it is a nightmare vision of the future rather than a realistic vision of the present.The plastic-looking futuristic sets, the lurid colour scheme and the deliberately non-naturalistic acting are all intended to create an atmosphere of unreality, as is Wendy Carlos's musical score. Beethoven's music, especially the Ninth Symphony, plays an important part in the film, but for the most part we hear the ""Ninth"" in a strange, distorted arrangement for synthesiser. When Alex and his friends, or ""droogs"", have a brawl with a rival gang, this is choreographed, stylised, almost balletic screen violence. The gang wear bizarre costumes (white overalls, bowler hats, codpieces and masks) and speak an equally bizarre slang known as ""Nadsat"". The distinguishing feature of this private language is the many words borrowed from Russian, either in their original form (""Bog"" for ""God"", ""droog"" for ""friend"") or in an anglicised corruption. (""Horrorshow"" from Russian ""khorosho"" for ""good"", or ""Gulliver"" from ""golova"" for ""head""). Exactly why English slang should have been colonised by Russian in this way is never explained; if Britain has fallen under Soviet control this is never made explicit in the film.Burgess gave a number of explanations for his title, one of which is that the word ""orange"" is a pun on the Malay ""orang"" meaning ""man"" or ""person"". (He had served as a colonial official in Malaya and spoke the language fluently). Alex, after he has been transformed by the Ludovico technique, is a ""clockwork man"", one who appears human but who is in fact an automaton whose actions and emotions are pre-programmed by others. This gives a clue as to Burgess's intentions in writing his satire.On the one hand he was concerned that psychiatric manipulation could become a powerful tool in the hands of a totalitarian state, or even a nominally democratic one. The Britain seen here is an increasingly authoritarian society where a populist government is using strong-arm methods to fight crime, not only by brainwashing criminals but also by recruiting thugs into the police force; two of Alex's former droogs later reappear as police officers. The government's opponents, however, are also shown as self-seeking, anxious to exploit Alex's predicament for political gain. The harsh, authoritarian nature of this future Britain is emphasised by the use of uncompromisingly Brutalist modern architecture such as the Thamesmead Housing Estate as a backdrop to many scenes.On the other hand the Roman Catholic Burgess was also concerned to explore the nature of good and evil and the question of free will. The brainwashed Alex is incapable of committing evil acts, which means that he is also incapable of goodness. These views are articulated in the film by the prison chaplain who points out that goodness must arise from a free moral choice, not from compulsion, and that those who are free to choose good are also free to choose evil. Evil, therefore, is the necessary price we must pay for the freedom to be good.The choice of Malcolm McDowell as Alex was an apt one, as he is excellent at suggesting both the good and evil sides of Alex's character. In the violent scenes he plays the character with a sort of satanic glee, but at other times he is also able to suggest a surprising innocence, like a demonic choirboy.The film was immensely controversial when it appeared in 1971, largely because of its graphic depictions of violence, and there were predictable calls for it to be banned. Had it come out in 1962, when Burgess wrote his novel, it doubtless would have been, but the prevailing moral climate had become increasingly permissive in the intervening nine years and the censors were no longer prepared automatically to ban films at the behest of the puritanical. On this occasion, however, the puritans had an unlikely ally in the shape of the director himself, who withdrew it from distribution in Britain, for reasons that have never been clear, and the ban was strictly enforced until Kubrick's death in 1999. For many years this was virtually a ""lost masterpiece"" in the land where it was made, much talked-about but never seen.Since 1999, however, the film has been freely available, and we are once again able to appreciate its brilliance as a darkly satirical vision of British society which seems just as relevant today as it did nearly forty years ago and a masterly exploration of theological and philosophical issues. Kubrick made a number of great films, but it is ""A Clockwork Orange"", together perhaps with ""Dr Strangelove"", which remains his most personal. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Twisted, Sick, and Extremely Violent, This film is a seductive, beautiful and Brillaintly acted Masterpiece.","This Kubrick film is quite special due to it's ideas involving what could happen when man ceases to be a man due to his inability to make a choice. Then he becomes an animal, incapable of making a choice and only holding on to his survival. This film takes this idea to it's extreme. It's disturbing to see the human form be reconstructed in such a way, and yet there is something disturbingly satisfying about actually seeing bad come out of this sort of situation. When it happens to somebody who only wants to hurt people, does that make it justified? This issue is still just as relevant, if not more, relevant today. So this film is not at all dated, and in fact is still ahead of it's time despite being made in 1971. I believe that this and FULL METAL JACKET are Kubrick's two most relevant films, but especially this. I simply cannot imagine this film not existing. It's perfect.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What was the real attitude of S Kubrick to LV Beethoven,"Music, being the most intellectually abstract of all the Arts, lends itself to many so-called interpretations.I think I've understood the Film after 5 or 6 views spanned over some 20 years. None has answered my questions. 1 - Is Beethoven's music so ambiguous has to support both the utmost violence and ""the joy of brotherhood"" ?2 - Was Stanley Kubrick, originally a photographer and later a kind of painter (mostly in Barry Lyndon), an hater of non-visual arts?3 - Was he just a ""provocateur"". In my dictionary, such people attempt to destroy the civilization that they belong to. Voltaire succeed at doing this, but he left behind him very important writings.

Kubrick's most chilling study of human evil,"For the entirety of his career, Stanley Kubrick was interested in one universal theme: mankind's decay, both mental and physical. This led to some of the most intense and frightening depictions of pure insanity, as seen in The Shining or Full Metal Jacket, but none as powerful and consistently relevant as the shocking A Clockwork Orange.The notorious trailer consisted of quick glimpses of some key scenes, with words such as ""funny"", ""exciting"" and ""Beethoven"" written on them. Only the third word is spot-on - the rest is, at best, an example of bitter irony. How come? Because the only one who could possibly find the events of this film funny or exciting is the deranged protagonist, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Actually, ""deranged"" is the wrong adjective to use with him: ""paradoxical"" is better. And what's so paradoxical about this young man? Well, he's intelligent and cheerful, with a soft spot for ""the divine work of Ludwig Van"", as he calls Beethoven, and enjoys hanging out with his friends (or ""droogs""). The problem is, his idea of spending time is best summed up by an expression he uses in the chilling opening sequence, where the camera catches his insane stare and goes backwards to reveal the bizarre pub he's visiting: ""a bit of the old ultra-violence"". He's never perfectly happy unless he can beat, rape or (in one extreme case) kill someone. Everything appears to change when he's sent to jail for murder and undergoes a treatment that makes him completely incapable to commit violent or perverted acts ever again. However, this ""cure"" is a double-edged sword, as it also means he can't defend himself when his victims come back for revenge.It's the second section that constitutes the real heart of A Clockwork Orange. Much has been said about the film's use of on-screen violence and how it supposedly affected people upon its original release in 1971 (protests led to it being banned in England until the director's death) , and while it must have been a shock back then, most of the incriminated scenes look rather tame today (see Bonnie and Clyde for a similar argument). The notable exception is the famous brainwash sequence, which will probably never lose its sheer emotional power. That's because it represents Kubrick's real concern: the loss of free will, which will eventually turn all of us into mindless drones and lead to nothing but tragedy (the latrine shootout in Full Metal Jacket derives from this). The film was shot so that it would appear to be set in a not-so-distant future, but in a time where the media manipulate unsuspecting viewers and listeners every day, it is clear that the director saw it happening and tried to warn us. The use of violence was an inevitable part of this: the stronger the message, the more effective the reception.This strength comes not only from the haunting images and the terrifying irony (Alex sings ""Singin' In The Rain"", the ultimate feel-good tune, while raping a woman), but also and most prominently from the groundbreaking central performance: McDowell, almost a complete unknown at the time (not to mention pushing 30, while Alex is supposed to be something like ten years younger), seized the opportunity and delivered a portrait of absolute, unmatched evil, so powerful it is sadly obvious why he hasn't done anything as astounding since. Anthony Hopkins may have won an Oscar for playing a serial killer, but it was McDowell who forever raised the bar for cinematic inhumanity.Overall, A Clockwork Orange is like any other film by Kubrick: it has to be seen multiple times before its full significance can be grasped, it will upset and infuriate some, and it's an experience like few others. For its unprecedented boldness as to content and delivery, it is also the great director's best picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Among The Greatest Films I've Seen So Far,"I would be willing to delve into a discussion about why A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece that would likely run as long as the film does, but I will try to make this fairly brief. Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange is what I would consider to be one of his greatest.Very seldom does a films opening scene catch the eye like this one. Viewers are able to piece together what the film will play out like just by looking at how the Korova milkbar is decorated the atmosphere that the film will have. The music during this scene is a rendition of Henry Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary utilizing a Moog Synthesizer, which helps show Alex DeLarge's culture amidst the cold and mechanical background of the world within which the film is set. This variety of music occurs throughout the film.The production as a whole is a perfect homogenization of music, acting, cinematography, editing, and writing. The beats of the film hold just the right amount of sadistic disturbia to hook the audience on the events playing out before them. Every single frame of the film manages to capture an aesthetic without needing the context of another, much like other works by Kubrick.Yet, I feel the most important aspect that I found myself hooked on was the main character. The film manages to make us empathize with Alex despite him being a genuine sociopath and being incredibly open to us about the fact that he knows what he's doing is wrong and he couldn't care less about the morality of his actions. I feel that this is most assisted by a marvelous performance in the role by Malcolm MacDowell.I would not recommend this film to anybody who may be upset by any single serious topic. For everybody else, however, this is a must-watch",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Jolly Brilliant,"This is a movie which is ahead of its time, both literally as figuratively. If you watch it, you really wouldn't put the year 1971 on it. We have to thank Stanley Kubrick for this. His (r)evolutionary ideas have been of most importance for the movie industry. He taught directors how they could break all rules, and so much more. For one, the cinematography is totally new and brings a whole new dimension to movies. Prove: the first scene... woooooooooooow! This could very well be the best opening scene ever. Stanley Kubrick is also one of the first directors who really cared about the meaning of music in a movie. It really gives you that violent feeling, love it! But the reason I watch this one over and over again is Alex. In my list of all-time favorite characters, he would definitely be in the top 5. The energy that goes out from him (probably caused by the milk-plus) is very, very intense and masterfully brought forward by Malcolm McDowell.

Most depressing film showing results of children deprived of basic principles in formative years.,"Kubick received rave reviews for ""his genious"" in combining raw violence, depraved sex,  futuristic plot, classical music and spectacular filming.My viewpoint was, still is, entirely different, and comes from a pre-television, pre-drug,  culture, where adults emphasized the ideal to the young.From the opening scene in a futuristic, sex focused teen hangout, to near the end, when I left, I was horrified by what I saw. I could only wonder: what is the value in a film's graphical ability to sabatogue young minds by numerous brutal examples?I saw the film, in Indianapolis, one afternoon, in the early 70's. I was astounded to see the theatre, already packed when I arrived. This was very unusual; at that time, television had greatly diminished theatre audiences, and theatres were struggling to stay in existence.Three things from that afternoon stand out in memory:  The number of truant school students attending; the explicit violence and in your face sex; and how the audience cheered and clapped when this teen gang was abusing the innocents, including the elderly.  I left the movie, shocked and depressed, from what I had witnessed; movie-wise and crowd-wise.One thing is certain:  No member of the ""Religious Right"" would have put out such a movie.

I also like the frustration that the film conveys to the viewer, because it is well created and it is really frustrating.

Although the message is clear, that life is sustained by the grinding opposition of moral entities, more could have been done by sticking closer to the novel. The important thing is moral choice, and the freedom of choice.  Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.  Kubrick depicts this vividly, but leaves out much more imagery and juicy details that exist in the Burgess' novel, not to mention hacking off the ending.  By doing this, Kubrick lessens the severity and completeness of the work.

Still a masterpiece,"Got to see this on the big screen as part 1 of a Kubrick double feature (Full Metal Jacket was the second).A Clockwork Orange has long been my favourite of Kubrick's films, and seeing it in a cinema therefore didn't make me love it much more. It couldn't really make a 10/10 more of a 10/10. It's already up there as one of the best of all time, for my money, but was more than worth revisiting.I do think I understand it a little more, though don't think it went over my head entirely when I was younger. I think I just better appreciate what it's trying to say, and how pessimistic its ultimate outlook on the world is. Criminals commit violence, and the State retaliates, committing its own kind of violence against criminals (or those it designates as criminals). Neither side as depicted in the movie can be described as sympathetic, but the conflict and questions that come from it are still compelling.A Clockwork Orange raises troubling and difficult questions around law, justice, crime, punishment, and morality. That it also does so while being a visual spectacle (on a fairly low budget) with amazing music and memorable performances from the entire cast makes it a classic. It's challenging and disturbing, especially early on, but I think it has good reasons for confronting and terrifying its audience.Through its unique premise, it asks some questions we still don't have answers to.

Stanley Kubrick's best film!,"Untill 1971, the song ""Singing in the Rain"" from the movie ""Singing in the Rain"" was a nice happy song.

Personally, it is one of my favorite movies.

Still, like the rest of Kubrick's work, it is very well crafted, with a memorable score that fits the tone of the film wonderfully (I particularly liked the use of Beethoven), Kubrick's excellent writing and direction, and a fascinating story that brings to mind a thoughtful afterword culminating in a deliberately unapologetic conclusion.

Fans quote its quirky dialogue, delight in the overt violence and sexuality and marvel over its philosophical message-making, but if that were all there was to it Clockwork Orange would be a pretty poor film.Clockwork Orange is perhaps the most extreme example of the Kubrick technical style  a kind of formal method which instantly distinguishes his films. And bizarrely, it's all based around the game of chess. While he had by now dropped all the actual references to the game which peppered his earliest films, Kubrick had begun directing as if he were playing chess. Look at the camera movements. With a few exceptions, the camera only moves as if it was a chess piece  forwards, backwards, left and right. The actors also move like opposing chess pieces, more often than not directly towards the camera or across the shot.Kubrick was always meticulous and extravagant in conveying an idea and an atmosphere not just through performances but through set and costume design, sound, music and lighting. In the first part of Clockwork Orange (the first half-hour or so, up until Alex is arrested) every aspect of every shot expresses the collision between formal sophistication and crude roughness. So we have violent youngsters wearing bowler hats, the mural with penises grafittied onto it, classical music played on synthesisers and so on. It's a world full of images we recognise, but is at the same time as deliberately outlandish as possible. Compare this to the next section of the film, in the prison, where everything becomes realistic and contemporary, although the atmosphere is equally unnerving.Clockwork Orange also represents the peak of the growing musical dimension of Kubrick's films. It is what the director Michael Powell referred to as a composed film  one where the images play out like a piece of music. As I've hinted at above it's structured in contrasting ""movements"" which reference and counterpoint each other, like a classical symphony. However there's also the musical element to individual scenes. The scene, fifteen or so minutes in, in which Alex returns to his bedroom to listen to Beethoven's 9th is one of the best examples in cinema of image and music working together  the quick zoom onto the Beethoven poster as the piece begins, then the prowling downward scan in the following shot, followed by the staccato cuts of details of the dancing Jesuses ornament are simply perfect.A Clockwork Orange, like all of Kubrick's later films, is incredibly elaborate and painstaking in the way it is constructed. It's not quite the classic it's reputed to be, and the statement it makes about free will isn't really all that profound. It is entertaining though, and in spite of what I said in the first paragraph, you can't help but like that memorable, poetic Nadsat dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"O my brothers and only friends, I will never stop talking about this movie","A Clockwork Orange is one of the most brilliant movies ever. Of course nearly all the credit for that goes to Anthony Burgess, the writer of the novel. However, focusing on the adaptation of the book, this movie is one of the best movies in cinematic history. The casting of Malcolm McDowell as Alex was one of the best decisions made by Stanley Kubrick. He embodied that role so exceptionally and I can't see anyone that could have done it better than him. He performed all the characteristics so well, especially since Alex basically changed personalities three times throughout the film. The film itself is so well made, it lives up to the book and maybe even better. It's the only book adaptation I accept. The best part about the film for me is the narration. The way Alex talks to the audience makes the movie inclusive, which captures and helps maintain the attention of the audience. Malcolm McDowell did a terrific job at the narrations. You could not see his face but his voice alone could show how menacing Alex really is. The narrations and McDowell's tone and voice is what made people root for and sympathize with Alex despite his questionable actions. I love Stanley Kubrick for not shying away from the nadsat slang, used in the books, and actually used it religiously throughout the film. Its futuristic aesthetic is so well portrayed, everything looks so innovative yet there's still a hint of vintage. It is baffling how this movie did not win an Academy Award (that I still strongly believe was an attempt of avoiding controversial gossip from the public). No matter how controversial it is, A Clockwork Orange is still a cult movie which explains a lot about how good it is.PS. Malcolm McDowell's contribution to singing 'Singin' in the Rain' when terrorizing the writer and his wife is one of the best moments in cinematic history. Kudos to Stanley Kubrick for letting him do him and actually encouraging it by spending nearly $10,000 to purchase the rights to the song. Gene Kelly can get as upset about it as he wants, this song was elevated by McDowell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Overly Long, and Strangely Absent in Purpose","An arty film potentially masquerading as moral political satire, 'A Clockwork Orange' is a bizarrely bloated and needlessly long movie that is not easy to dissect its overall goal.Carrying it expertly though is Malcom McDowell, who brings the much needed humour to the irksome script. The dialogue is entertaining and out well thought out in each scene but the overall direction bouncing between horror and comedy is unpleasant.The biggest issues are the tediously long montages and uninteresting secondary characters. Plus the whole film feels like a bit of troll and glances with a childish analysis over any matter it tries to portray onto screen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"After Waiting For 2+ Years, I Finally Watched It!","The only Kubrick movie that ive seen before this one, was Full Metal Jacket, and Full Metal Jacket was half amazing, half boring. (The first half was awesome, the second half wasn't really that good). This movie in the other hand, was amazing. In the start, you might get bored, but then it sky rockets. It gets better, and better as the film goes on. It has a great message, that nobody is your friend. You see, Alex's friends ditched him, his parents left him, and in the end, the politics message, they are not his friend either! Instead, they are just using him for elections! They see him just as way to get more votes!This whole movie is really good, if you can wait like 30 minutes for it to pick up, and begin explaining it's self. Also, the first half, it felt like i was watching a John Waters movie, the first half was so absurd and weird, and then the second half turns into a very serious, lowkey social-message type of film. The only movie that reminds me of this one, is JAGTEN, and if you liked enjoyed JAGTEN, you'll most likely enjoy this as well. Personally, it took me a while to get into it, the start was really kinda slow, and then it just grew, and grew, and grew and we got an amazing story! If Jagten, Halloween, and Truman's show had a baby, this movie would be it. And it rocks.None actors did a bad job, the plot is strong as you can see, the camera work is good, everything here is good. I sort of enjoyed Full Metal Jacket, i love A Clockwork Orange! Man after waiting for so long, i'm glad i finally watched it. Also, also a lot of people are calling this movie DISTURBING and NASTY, and to that no. This movie was extremely tame honestly. To everyone that hyped me that omg, this movie is so disturbing, and sick. No, honestly no. To those people: Look up CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, MEN BEHIND THE SUN, and MARTYRS now that's what i call disturbing and gross.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Some thoughts about A Clockwork Orange,"I have to agree with a previous comment about the detractors of this movie; it seems this is not the right movie for people who just wanna see the classic psycho movie characters and be scared (while laugh at the characters' foolishness inside). This is not that kind of movie; so just watch The Shining (a really good movie, btw) instead of this if that's what you want. ACO isn't, indeed, an easy movie; Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job in trying to make the audience identify in Alex's character, while keeping Alex's character himself so unbelievably real that sometimes you think Malcolm McDowell was real crazy. That's probably why the movie is psychologically shocking (and no, you don't see that much blood or straight violence on the screen). This is not, indeed, a movie translation of the novel itself: although they share the sharp sense of humour of Alex's narrative, the story is slightly different, and the reader doesn't identify with ""the novel's Alex"" that much; as Burgess himself said, the movie is ""Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange"", the book is ""Anthony Burgess' a Clockwork Orange"". I'd say their aim was pretty different: Burgess' primary one was probably to describe society dehumanization, Kubrick wanted to show how criminals aren't ""aliens"" and sometimes respectable people aren't better than them. This is, probably, why the movie was dubbed ""disgusting"" by so many people. The movie is visually really different from anything else ever appeared on the screen: not at all hollywood-looking (nothing fancy looking here), and maybe that's another reason why the ""anti"" camp is still pretty big; nevertheless, I think Kubrick did a wonderful job in describing those ""futurible"" suburbs. One final note: the movie described a very close future when it came out; now it's probably more like ""an alternate world"", although really close to ours. That's why the movie itself still keeps his scary fascination.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick's best!!!  A haunting masterpiece that will always be remembered!!!,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film I didn't quite get the first time around, and it's interesting that many other people felt the same way in their first viewing.  I mean, how am I supposed to react a scene where Alex and his Droogs are raping an innocent woman, while he happily sings ""Singing in the Rain""?  I'm no sadist.However, in the second viewing, I realized the film's moral value and was able to indulge the spectacular visuals.  Kubrick has that masterful quality that sucks you into his movies via the initial shot.  The opening shot of ""CO"" is a memorable one in which we see Alex (Malcolm McDowell) staring straight into the camera, evil in his eyes--which do not flinch for a second.  Combined with the astounding soundtrack, highlighted by Beethoven's ""9th Symphony,"" we're dazzled by this hypnotic piece of artistry that contains maximum doses of style and substance.There are many lessons to be learned after watching this movie.  Because ""CO"" deals with all the faces of evil.  We embark on a journey, through the mind of Alex, bringing us into his sadistic world.  There's a great scene in which Alex retires to his bedroom, puts on Beethoven's 9th and we see a montage of violent sequences interlocked with close-ups of Alex's face with blood seeping out of his mouth.  We learn how these acts of violence and rape stimulate him to the fullest.  Then we learn about the jealousy that exists among evil.  When Georgie wants to take over the Droogs and become leader of the pack, Alex tosses him in the water along with the slow-witted Droog Dim, and slashes him in the hand teaching him a lesson on who's the boss.  And finally, when Alex commits his last murder, we learn about the betrayal that spawns from evil.  All of Alex's fellow Droogs beat him senseless and leave him at the scene of the crime, allowing him to get picked up by the authorities and thrown in jail.  In jail, we learn about how ""supposedly"" morally correct individuals try to eradicate pure evil. We're introduced to a fanatical preacher, who feels jail is the best punishment for this group of sinners and they fully deserve to rot inside until their souls are cleansed.  That shows how religion can sometimes be exaggerated and far-fetched, and religious leaders don't always take a realistic approach to these matters.  Alex is later rehabilitated by being put through an unusual procedure.  He is forced to watch scenes of brutal violence and rape, put to the soundtrack of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  At first, he feels satisfied.  But as his mind gets healthier, he gets more and more disturbed by these images.  And we learn that the healthy mind is not able to withstand such evil.  Alex was able to withstand this evil in the past, because his mind was in a sick, demented state.  After Alex is fully rehabilitated, he's released back into the world and--unfortunately--things don't turn out so good.  His family doesn't want him anymore.  And we learn more and more in upcoming scenes how evil cannot be tolerated by society, and how evil acts of violence and rape are not forgiven or forgotten in the eyes of those who were traumatized, no matter how clear Alex's conscience happens to be.  And society will often use evil against evil.  This is the type of the movie that gives a raw, unflinching look at the evils of society, how we deal with them, how we're faced with them, how they're inflicted upon us, etc.  This is one of the best social satires ever made, brutally portraying all the ""dark sides"" of society.The dialogue is also memorable--though sometimes difficult to understand. This is the type of movie that is great in all aspects.  It's not only emotionally stimulating, but visually stimulating, in a way only Kubrick could've expressed it.  I can't imagine any director doing it any better.""A Clockwork Orange"" is Kubrick's most noble masterpiece, and a definite must-see!!!My score:  9 (out of 10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Dense: visually, metaphorically, cinematically","One of my all time favorite films, I have watched Clockwork Orange more than a dozen times, and will watch it a dozen more. Every time I watch it I find something new. Every single scene is packed with multiple layers and meaning: watch it just for the lighting, or the sound track, the camera angles, or speed (slow-mo to high). Watch it as purely political fable, science fiction, horror story, comedy, or even love story (between Alex and Beethoven). Watch it for character development. Watch it purely for its art historical view (from the Renaissance through 19th century Romanticism to post modern, modern, pop, and kitsch (Velvet paintings?). Watch it for the costuming. Watch it for its take on architecture even, for chrissakes. Themes range from government control to free will, religious zealotry, Pavlovian conditioning, the welfare state, youth versus old age, political and police state corruption, education, linguistic evolution, penal reform, depression era economics (boarders anyone?), gang psychology, sexuality (rape, homosexuality, menage a trois, voyeurism), and even Biblical interpretation. There are so many cultural references and cross linkages it's mind boggling.The film is even more amazing when you discover it was made in less than a year, was low budget, and filmed almost entirely on location.A testament to collaborative genius: Beethoven, Kubrick, Burgess, and Malcolm McDowell. I defy you to find a movie where every single frame can be stopped, analyzed, and discussed on every possible cinematic level.It's well known that Kubrick would take dozens of takes and solicited comments and recommendations from everyone on the set including the security guys. In this way, he packed the film with so many details and irony that it's nearly impossible to absorb them all in one sitting. It's enlightening to discover that Kubrick was a still photographer before becoming a film maker. Thus, he was used to thinking and blocking out each scene as a static frame rife with meaning before adding time and action for the fourth dimension.Oh, and did I mention? it's damn good entertainment.Watch and be warned.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
No reason to watch it in 21st century,"Well, first thing first - my rate to this move was 3. I did rate it 1 in the evening after I saw it, but reconsidered that in the morning.This is spoiler free review.The move has a good idea, which has enough matter within it to be enough for about 4-5 minute clip. Nothing more. This movie is 2 hours of pure torture to one's senses. Each scene was carefully crafted to drill in your mind and torment your soul. There is nothing to be comprehended from most scenes anyway, nothing that can't be laid out within 30 seconds. The sounds are going from 0 straight to 80 decibels in a second and then back and then forth and then back... I had trouble sleeping after it, not because I was afraid of something but because I felt tormented.Highly unnecessarily graphic, too 70s-arty and it feels like some bat sh*t crazy hippy on LSD spat it out from deep within his delusional intestate.Would not recommend it to anyone, but perhaps a directing student, who is after ""classics"". I give it a rating of 3 stars because of the clever and teaching idea, which has nowhere close enough matter to hold meaningful focus for 2 hours.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Got Milk?,"Since the lady hasn't seen this yet we watched it tonight and even though I've seen it a few times rewatching it again and seeing how utterly absurd most of the movie is even with Kubrick's unique style it was still interesting and solid but not as good as the first time I watched it for some reason. I still enjoyed the thematic message about karma and what not though. A young Malcom Macdowell surely gave it his all though and I can see why the film was nominated for a few Oscar's looking back in retrospect. It was weird, artsy and influential in a sense and had a deep underlying story that was a bit complex and buried within the mania and ridiculously daft mind of Kubrick. While I enjoyed his other films like The Shining more than this one it's still a worthy watch even with its rather abrupt ending with its staple shock value scenes and compelling storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
True Piece of Art,"We will never expect what Kubrick would made. But, when he directed in his own universe, one for sure is we must be shocked and astonished. Whether you are Kubrick's fan or not, you won't forget every work of his hand. So do the controversial ""A Clockwork Orange"", you can really define wonderful world of Kubrick thought by this very movie. It's also a great idea of Anthony Burgess, the novelist who wrote it. A pile of great literature served on the table of motion picture, in the teenage age of movie industry. That abstract combination is just the base of this art. I mean, you can't really understand what it could mean. Just watch it and translate it with your own mind, don't worry with the interpretation. The Kubrick's point is to entertain audiences with their comprehension, not his ideology or critic's opinion. Honestly, it's the first Kubrick's movie I have watched, and it leads me to characterize who is he.Let's jump to the story. It's hard to believe the cinematic effect of this movie in 1971. A real movie that you can watch in every aspect of it, such as its cinematography, settings, and strong- character. In one hand, the plot is so vivid, that you can choke all the scene entertainingly. The rape, classic ""ultraviolence"", and all the slang. Masterpiece of dialog in this ""disturbing"" movie. A bunch full of sex-scene that shocked the entire movie fan that day even until now, but it's all make sense for the art of movie, the very bold violence. In the other hand, it's very abstract, just like the other Kubrick's work. The director often erase some important points from the novel just to make interesting effects, which is ignorance, puzzlement, yet amazement. For all impressionist, you can get very excited by its uncommon way to impress audiences. This is the point I say that it is indeed a true piece of art, no censor, vulgarity, or taboo thing, just the original amusement with its dark beauty. Comedy about blackness that isn't mark society, instead just to fulfill the art requirement. Not for the audiences who seek moral value, but suitable for you who want to criticize moral.It is divided into to part. I named it, the first is the ""ultraviolence"", and the second is the ""therapy"". Both of them has shadowy chasing with nasty core. The ""ultraviolence"" is dreadful as is, with the construction of awful figure. I advise, don't be to confuse, in spite of being innocent yet follower of each scene. There is no taboo here. The ""therapy"", is just a simple conclusion that everyone could imagine. But the latent effects of this ""therapy"" is logical as Kubrick had ever done. It makes sense in the end, a simply undefined movie. It's rather a fantasy than a science- fiction, because it's so absurd, pleasantly imaginative. So surrealist, with Beethoven as the background-music. Fast motion and other effects, just to form the entire amazing sequence.Yeah, it's easy on its skin, but dark inside. A movie that is really disturbingly unforgettable. Great art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

After Alex is sent to prison for murder, he is subjected to aversion therapy designed to cure his violence, but finds himself a pawn in a political struggle.Stanley Kubrick's 1971 dystopian sci-fi, based on the cult novel by Anthony Burgess, deals with the theme of freedom of choice vs. social order, questioning the ethics of depriving an individual of fundamental human liberties for the sake of the stability of the state, whilst raising numerous thought-provoking questions on the subjects of morality, good and evil and the abuse of power.There's plenty for the brain to chew over for sure, but it's never a dull experience, being one of the most consistently visually impressive and evocative films of the 70s, a stunning assault on the senses boasting an unforgettable central performance from McDowell, countless memorable supporting characters (my favourite being Alex's creepy post corrective officer, Mr Deltoid, played by Aubrey Morris.

A film everybody should see,"In ""A Clockwork Orange"" we get to see the life from the eyes of the sadistic young man, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Together with his buddies he goes out at night and has fun, which means raping women, fighting with other gangs, assaulting innocents, etc etc. One night he is betrayed by his own and caught by the police. He is sent to jail, but after a few years he is offered a way out, all he has to do is participate in a little experiment... This is supposed to make him a good man, but will it really work without any dangerous side-effects?This is one of Stanley Kubrick´s most famous movies, and also the most provocative. In the beginning I thought, ""Come on, are we supposed to forgive this Alex and feel for him later on, after all evil things he is doing now? I can never have feelings for such a b*****d."" But Kubrick and McDowell actually pull this off, with their great directing and acting respectively.The movie takes place in the near future, but it more feels like it takes place in the seventies or something. It´s not quite enough to throw in some daft furniture and clothing. The futuristic music succeeds better with setting the tone, this is probably one of the better soundtracks I´ve heard.The script contains some corny dialogue, and the movie is probably not as provocative as it was when it was released. But it still has a very strong plot, with an interesting message: can people change? It´s not as good as Kubrick´s best movies (The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, 2001), but it´s pretty close.

"Very Enjoyable, Funny, and filled with Kubrick's Style.","For a very controversial film based on a controversial book, A Clockwork Orange is one of those films you either Love, or Hate. Personally, I thought it was very good. It has that excellent Stanley Kubrick look and style, even if I didn't see the director I would have instantly recognised the Kubrick Styles. The characters are great, Warren Clarke was fantastic as Dim, Georgie was also very enjoyable. But of course the character that completely stole the show was Malcolm McDowell as Alex, he is one of the greatest screen villains of all time. However, despite how great the casting, the writing, and the style was, there were a few things that I didn't enjoy.

This film defines the classic term 'ahead of its time'...one of the best films ever made.,"Keep in mind, Alfred Hitchcock did introduce us to suspense and horrorific images on screen.......but in an age when the word 'shocking' was used to describe the end to ""West Side Story"", a movie as horrific as this not only broke down all barriers, but showed everyone just how horrid the world really can be. Many would be quick to think that this movie would be banned from every theatre in the nation......some in fact did......however, as horrific as some may have found it, not one person could look away from its genius. Even if what it is showing you is so graphic, there is poetry behind everything Kubrick captured in this movie. Rarely do i ever use the term 'work of art' when describing a film.....but in this case, how could you not. Not one part of this movie is less than entertaining. Many may argue over what movie has changed the way we look at movies, you have your ""Citizen Kane"", ""Godfather"", ""Psycho""......but to me, it is this movie......because it went farther past the norm of that time.

Eyelashes and Deception,"Science fiction stands apart from other genres because it is actually a setting and nothing else.  It is a toolbox of ideas and items that storytellers borrow from to try and heighten their work.  Matrix, Aliens, and Terminator are all action movies that borrow the sci-fi elements of machinery, technology, alternate realities, and souped-up firepower--that's the only thing that separates them from the Die Hard films.  Even Blade Runner is just detective noir set in 2019, no different.Only in 2001: A Space Odyssey did the full impact of unadulterated science fiction get ingrained in the public conscience because Kubrick makes the setting the star, not plot or characters.  He would later try again with Barry Lyndon to lesser extent.Compared to Sam Raimi, who isn't concerned with shot composition so long as the movement of the camera remains wild, Kubrick's parallel (or is symmetric) style is the definition of precision.  He loves orchestrating his shots around the characters in ways I'm sure Brian DePalma dreams about. The focus isn't on the people, it's on the scene and mood.  The fact that people are in the shot is incidental.That said, A Clockwork Orange is a genre-less picture.  The setting is not pure science fiction, but it certainly isn't anything other than drama. While not as declarative as Dr. Strangelove, it succeeds in making the science fiction point about what humanity's actions cause to our collective thoughts and psyches.  In this case, our newest crop of bad boys are in for some brainwashing fun.  Shallow yet insightful.Overall, between Ludwig Van's pomp and the shaky chords of ""Singin' in the Rain"", Kubrick proves he is still the music man of synchronization while McDowell menaces.  4 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Unlike any other,"A most famous book that no one thought could be filmed, but the genius of Stanley Kubrick proved that wrong. A film unlike any other made, it is brilliant from beginning to end. It is also extremely violent, but violence in a future society is its primary subject matter, so it would be hard to avoid it and give an honest depiction. Malcolm McDowell, shockingly not Oscar nominated, has never been given a role remotely as good as this, though he did shine in an small film called If...., another controversial film made in this era. As his later career has proven, he really isn't the strongest actor, but he was born for this role. Oddly, no other cast member shines in this, but other than the lead, it is really a director and production designer's movie from beginning to end.

"A bit cold and pointless, isn't it, my lovely?","The possibility of everything is depending on your faith, mind or what? It is only certain that Stanley Kubrick knew that the only border that could be put to mans mind is the one that you put yourself. A movie of violence, desire, lust and lack of the old good love.

Forbidden Fruit,"A Clockwork Orange holds a special place in the British film addicts pantheon. A film so controversial and so beyond what the British media were able to accept that Kubrick himself withdrew it from British cinemas in 1973. This meant that I could not see it, even though I was desperate to, until 1994 and a memorable evening in a B-grade cinema in Sydney, Australia. Only after Kubrick's death in 1999 did the shackles finally come off. I've watched it many times since. This is a tremendous movie.When we watch A Clockwork Orange today we can only guess at the impact it must have had in Britain in 1972: like a sledgehammer. It's a shocking film even now, with a subject that was, and is, massively emotive. There are huge themes of sociological dyfunction here, massive side-swipes at how attempts to create a somehow ""perfect"" world simply backfire and dehumanise. And this is where Kubrick gets in: he is brilliant at creating images and scenes from which humanity have been stripped.The world of A Clockwork Orange is a scared and sterile one. People won't open the door. Nobody with any thought for their safety goes out on the street. Politicians play games in the most overt way. Dangerous and paranoid - this is a world of our worst nightmares.Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his ""Droogs"" inhabit this world, speaking a mixed Russian conlang and taking spiked milk in order to get sharpened up ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence. They obey no rules whatsoever. To say anything more would be a spoiler.Watch A Clockwork Orange with an open mind. The writer of the original book, Anthony Burgess, foresees a world where minds are not open, rather, they are controlled and closed, for whatever reason and by whatever mechanism. This isn't about violence or dysfunction. It's about something else altogether.This is one of THE great films. Iconic and brilliant, the long wait to see it only added a sharp edge to the taste of its forbidden fruit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A piece of Art,"It's difficult to write something about Stanley Kubrick and about this film in general. Kubrick made only a small number of film in 46 years of career, but every picture is a masterpiece in its genre.""A Clockwork Orange"" is not an exception. Based on the Anthony Burgess book, the film is a story about violence. In a future society Alex only loves violence and Beethoven music. The government arrest him and tries to cure him in planting in himself a disgusting feeling for violence... But this therapy has its limits.The film is visually perfect, we can enjoy Kubrick's sarcasm and his taste for music -the score collects several pieces of different composers and different periods.Everything works very well, and the film is still shocking 34 years later after its release -although at the time ""A Clockwork Orange"" was a huge scandal because it was one of the most violent films ever made, today its effect is partially diluted.Just one thing -but it's a small detail, compared to the importance and the full achievement of the film. The film was made in 1970, two years after the release ""2001"". Although that, from a purely visual point of view, ""A Clockwork Orange"" looks older than the previous one. Set designing belongs to early Seventies idea of the future, whereas ""2001"" still looks as a new film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

You see the message of the movie is really great. It questions human's power of free-will.It shows us that it doesn2t matter to be good or evil without having a full-power of free-will.Coz the free-will is what makes us different from the other creatures.

Perhaps the best movie of all times.,"Here is one of the best films of all time. In a masterful adaptation to the cinema of a famous literary work, Stanley Kubrik gives us a sinister vision of a future where things work in a considerably oppressive way. Malcom McDowell in the character of his life offers us an extraordinary superb performance, representing a young man who leads a group of misfits who have no scrupulous in devoting themselves to delectable activities such as violence, murder and rape. The character's presentation causes us to have sympathy: it is possible that most spectators want to be part of that group. Events are adjusted to demonstrate how society can deal with those who do not fit morality and good customs. It is difficult not to agree with the system in the face of the decline presented on the screen. The progress of the film is capital and majestic supported by supreme production and music by Brazilian composer Carlos who will undoubtedly remain forever as a standard for the best music in cinema.

Powerful movie.,"Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is a cinematic enigma that delves into the complexities of good and evil within human nature. Its powerful and extreme narrative, underscored by disturbingly dynamic human relationships, makes it a compelling yet challenging watch. The film's portrayal of societal decay and the controversial attempts at behavioral correction invites viewers to question the essence of free will and morality. Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Alex, the lead character, is nothing short of mesmerizing. His ability to convey both the charm and the menace of his character is a testament to his acting prowess. The film's visual and auditory elements are meticulously crafted, with Kubrick's signature attention to detail, creating an immersive experience that is both unsettling and captivating. While 'A Clockwork Orange' may not be easily digestible for all, its bold exploration of themes and remarkable execution earns it a 7 out of 10.

The Greatest Study of Violence in Film,"Not only is this the greatest study of violence, it's perhaps the best film ever made, and it's certainly my favourite.The 'nadsat' language invented by Anthony Burgess in his original book, is absolute genius. The Russian vocabulary used in the film like 'Droog' and 'Babushka' implies that Dystopian Britain has been taken over by the Russian communists, a great fear at the time. Subtle. Alex's and his droogs character design is also pure genius, and he goes down as my favourite villain in film. After watching the film a few times, you start using Nadsat in daily speak, and so did Malcolm McDowell in filming (he was doing a part for another film and used the words 'groodies' instead of 'breasts').The entire droogs, korova milk bar, and Nadsat thing is to serve as a satire for modern day gangs and trends; on the streets of London, they have their own fashion (like the Droogs 'height of fashion'), their own slang (all that 'init bruv' and 'swag' nonsense), and their own hang-out places with drug use (like the Korova Milk Bar serving milk, laced with Vellocet, Synthemesc and Drenchrum drugs).No one has done this much creative and original stuff with language since Shakespeare, proving Burgess to be one of the best writers of the 20th century, and Kubrick to be possibly THE best filmmaker of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The erotic art showed in this movies gives us a glimpse of Stanley Kubrick's of how art and film making could be merged together. It's premise progresses and then declines revealing an anti-climatic atmosphere.Inherent in the storyline is the theme of moral choice which is well illustrated in this movie, Alex now at the will of choosing between good and evil when imprisoned for his crime he would be transformed from evil to good after submitting himself to a scientific experiment which was been described as unethical. We come across a bridge of bubbling questions one which includes; should science be used as a means of corrective justice ? Since the criminal strikes the state shouldn't the state strike back ? Alex encounter with science can be likened with the moral cause and effect of science on tampering with nature an example being the Frankenstein Monster created by tampering nature by means of scientific process in both cases they both result to calamity.Before you reach the finale take a grasp of one question which is this; is Alex a hero, anti hero or a victim ?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Disturbing masterpiece!,"Kubrick films have always had a special thing to them that I have always loved. They all work in a specific way: Specific camera angles, specific music for each situation in the film, and specific stories to each scene. Every soul disturbing and spine chilling scene in this has its own story which puts me on edge to no end. From the unusual use of wide angle lenses, to the awkward camera angles, combined with the eerie music to set the mood makes for one great thrill ride.Based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick decided to bring the infamous Alex character to life in this evil version of Anthony's classic, bringing the characters, tone, and language to his own sick and twisted world.Our main character named Alex, (Malcolm McDowell) and his three ""droogs"" all set out to spread chaos and mayhem around the world, breaking and entering, raping, beating, anything they can think of to make the world a worse place to live. Alex gets betrayed by his ""droogs and is sentenced 14 to life. He gets off the hook by participating in a new scientific experiment yet to be perfected, (change the cold blooded and deranged mind of a criminal into a peace loving citizen).Kubrick excellently displays Anthony's attempt on the language barrier between Alex and the viewer. The language, the setting, the camera angles, and every other piece of scenery perfectly places us into this characters world. The scenes of violence in Alex's mind puts us in his shoes and shows us how messed up he is. We see unexplained images that confuse us, but also intrigue us, as we transport ourselves into his mind. Kubrick does not show mercy with the nudity. Every corner there is a pair of boobs in your face. This is not his simple intention to arouse the audience or to be explicit, but simply to show us that Alex lives in a world without rules, regret, or discipline, and how it immediately all changes when he gets caught and participates in the experiment, and how it affects his world later.Kubrick truly is the only one who could have pulled off Anthony's vision. His absolute monstrous style of film making combined with the sick and twisted mind of Anthony Burgess easily makes this one of the darkest films of all time. I enjoyed every second of this classic story. The dark tone, the beautiful dialog and narration, and the excellent story telling makes this an easily enjoyed masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Clockwork Orange,"This is a truly challenging film that routinely glorifies violence - especially towards women, and offers us a terrifying appraisal of the effects of unfettered government and science working in cahoots with each other. Fifty years on from it's groundbreaking release, it's great to watch this on a big screen again - and though the imagery is much less potent that it was in 1971, the performance from Malcolm McDowell is scarily compelling. The plot centres around him and his three sadistic cohorts who live a disparate life terrorising wherever they roam until finally they go a little too far and he is apprehended. A fourteen year sentence is handed down but after two of them, he seeks enrolment in a controversial, experimental, aversion therapy scheme the results of which don't quite deliver as expected. The film presents us with some some pretty gruesome worst-case scenarios to start with, those serve to exaggerate the threat to normal livelihoods and thus lend credibility to the even more daunting prospect of the clinical conditioning of people. In this case, it is specifically the conditioning of one violent individual, but it's very easy to extend the principle to those with whom the government, or state, might disagree - and Kubrick lays that threat bare for all to see and evaluate. I struggled a bit with the nonsense language at times, it seemed puerile and prone to ridicule, certainly to detract from, the more thought-provoking elements of the plot. Perhaps it is there to serve as steam-valve for the intensity of the subject matter, but I am not convinced it is effective or necessary. The book allows us scope to use our own imagination as to the terror this whole concept could invoke, but as film adaptations go, this one offers us a great and innovative template for any interpretation, and coupled with the powerful use of a classical music score - including Ludwig Van, of course, and a solid supporting cast contributing well, this is a truly momentous piece of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Kubrick does justice to Burgess' vision,"One of my sci-fi/horror/fantasy reviews written 50 years ago: Directed, Produced and Written by Stanley Kubrick, from Anthony Burgess' novel, for Warner Brothers release.

Oh My Brothers!,"This is possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. This is by far the best Kubrick film ever, the brilliance of this movie is three fold; first, the performance by Malcolm McDowell, second the music, and third the political message presented by the movie. McDowell's take on the character Alex is so excellent because he makes you love him. Even when he's doing the most despicable and deplorable acts you can't help cheering him on, and wanting him to do these things to women, and innocents. You love this sociopath and want to hang out with him and go indulge in a little of the old ultraviolence with him. Every time he says my brothers you can't help being taken in by his charismatic and bad ass personality. The scariest part of this movie is when it's over and your sitting there and you realize that you love the character Alex, and you wonder what that says about you as a person. Second the integration of Ludwig van into the movie is what makes it a masterpiece. Beethoven almost becomes a character in and of himself in the film, like he's speaking to you through those eyes as the 9th is playing. also the scene where Alex singing singin' in the rain while raping the wife is so powerful, and it's amplified by the choice of such a happy go lucky song. After watching the movie so many times it's impossible to tell if I love this movie because of my love of Beethoven or if I love Beethoven more because of this movie. They become unified in your mind so that you cannot hear the 9th without thinking about Alex and this movie. You love Alex because as he is a rogue and utter miscreant, but the music he loves isn't hardcore rock, or death metal (even though they didn't exist in 1971) it's classical, and Lugwin van! That more than anything makes you love this character because of his complexity. Lastly, the political message of the movie. How the 'treatment' that Alex is given turns him not into a good man, but rather into a mechanical apparatus that has no real choice. I also love the irony that is not lost on the audience of the Priest saying that Alex has no choice, and is not really being good. But Alex is really the best Christian, because Christianity does not say that people should be good men for the sake of being righteous, but rather because of a threat of punishment if you perform bad acts, this is paralleled to the sickness that Alex experiences, which is his personal hell. The political implication of this are far-reaching and reflect many political writings on control, mainly, to me, Michael Foucault and the idea of biopower. Where in, after much conditioning the agent will control himself because of fear of a threat that may not even be present, much like the mind police in 1984, the fear of possible punishment controls the agent, as it does Alex. For while the drug has left his system the effects of the conditioning make him feel as if he is sick, he is within the panopticon. This is one of the greatest movies of all time, and reflects the artistic brilliance of it's creator. It is one that all generations should experience, whether you are a baby boomer, or if you are a member of generation x like myself.

It's never easy to accomplish something so magnificent in theatre, yet another thing Stanley Kubrick did extremely well with a knockout milestone film about 4 15-16 year old boys obsessed with rape. If I were to recommend it, it is for any moviegoer who loves authentic Stanley Kubrick.

My favourite movie of all time,"A Clockwork Orange is my favourite movie of all time and I doubt that'll ever change. Stanley Kubrick perfected the adaptation of the novel, which I also greatly enjoyed, with the protagonist's absurd narration and the eerie atmosphere of the dystopian world. The set design is shown immediately from the first shot in all its odd but genius glory, which introduces us to one of cinema's most vile and horrific characters. The classical music, Beethoven in particular, adds depth to every scene, further captivating the audience with Alex's world of crime and brutality. As usual, Kubrick's direction is otherworldly, but especially in this movie. Each shot, each scene, and each sequence is important and basically perfect. It provides an engrossing introduction to the main characters, a slower yet meaningful middle, and an interpretive conclusion that continues to shock and dumbfound people decades after its release. A Clockwork Orange is darkly hilarious, deeply disturbing, riveting and captivating from the very first shot to the very last, and is unlike anything else.

A strange film,"Stanley Kubrick directed ""A Clockwork Orange"" a very strange film. The film tells the story of the narrator, Alex DeLarge, a charming and scary criminal thug who rape and violence come naturally to. Alex is caught, convicted, and undergoes an experimental ""cure"" at the hands of the government that changes who he is. The film doesn't glorify or renounce violence, it shows it very matter of factly. Kubrick instead forces you to look at the criminal's role in society, and the ideas of free will, and individual rights versus overall benefit to society. The film starts out very fast and slows down as the story develops. This film takes many strange twists and turns, and although it wasn't something I enjoyed, Kubrick did a wonderful job of telling this strange story, and the movie will stick in your head long after you see it.

It's a social commentary that takes aim at the unethical hierarchy and the untethered people in power while featuring a dangerous yet vulnerable individual's individuality, from whom the very concept of choice and free will has been scrapped. The movie also examines the impact of societal pressures and expectations on mental health as well as the consequences of a system that prioritises conformity over individual expression.The totalitarian institution herein seeks advantage and authority through damaged intellects in the name of reformation. They instill fear and conundrum deep inside their consciences through their questionable experiments, turning their patients into nothing more than pawns for their selfish games. This system robs its victims of their individuality and free will, leaving them susceptible to the whims of those in authority.In summary, it is a brutal commentary on the supporters of tyranny, a contemplative yet provocative outlining of a criminal that outrageously portrays both the aspects of corruption of power and the frailties of human nature, or lack thereof.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Holy Overrated Movie, Batman!","Let me start with a little  autobiographical information. One day, I wanted to see ""A Clockwork Orange"" because I heard it was an awesome movie. But, I decided it would be more spiritually rewarding to read the book before I watched the movie. At this same time, I was assigned a research paper for English class, and I decided to do it on ""A Clockwork Orange"". So, I read ""A Clockwork Orange"" in detail, studied the Nadsat language of the malchicks'. I read criticisms, more criticms, analytical essays. And then, I decide, ah gee, I'm going to watch this movie. And yes, I am an avid movie watcher and I claim to know what I'm talking about when I say this or more correctly write this. Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a perversion of the novel. He deep down wanted to make a porn and decided he's going to interject it within the story of ""A Clockwork Orange"". What was the point of the sexually explicit material? There is no connection between it and the novel by Anthony Burgess. There wasn't sex in his story, there was rape and the ravaging of innocence. There was nothing sexy about it. So why then do these big chested, curvy Playboy bunny-type women ""get raped"" with little to no struggle (I think one assisted in taking her clothes off) and in the book they are 10-11 year old girls who have yet to have big breasts and gorgeous hips. A minor detail overlooked by a director's arrogant vision. And then there's the old lady who is brutally attacked (then murdered) by Alex. Very old and decrepid in the book with no capability of defending herself except with her copious amounts of cats (I think I saw five in the movie, in the book there was like twenty). In the movie she is limber, probably early 50's and is killed by a giant phallic symbol. In the book, it was a bust of Beethoven. It was so significant to have the music destroy this lady, not this huge phallus. What is the point? The point is, o my brothers, is that Kubrick I believe is a sexist man who wants his victimized women to be dominated by large maleness (aka ceramic phallus). I will admit one thing good that this movie accomplished, the comedic tone of the book. The lightness of the language and Malcom MacDowell captured the humor well, BUT he was too old to be Alex. Alex is fifteen which makes it all the more CREEPIER. The actors were too old to  be playing a gang of teenagers. Hmm, what else....oh yes the violence and the underlying theme of freedom of choice. The violence, not at all shocking, but then again I've grown up to ""pulp fiction"". Not that I need the in-your-face style, but I think that's what Kubrick was going for. He doesn't leave it for the imagination, but fails at providing grotesque imagery that would make you feel sickened by the violence. And the freedom of choice, yes the prison chaplain has his famous line, but I think the ultimate point of this movie is lost in once again Kubrick's obsession with sex. If you want Kubrick-directed naked people I suggest ""Eyes Wide SHut"". At least then I get the point. But here, he fails. He doesn't do enough justice to the book. He strays from the Anthony Burgess's vision too far. Sure, it's more faithful than a lot of Hollywood's book adaptations, but it could have been done so much better. This book was practically begging to be made into a movie with it's already picked-out soundtrack. But I honestly feel that if people read the book before jumping on the hype band wagon back in the '70's, we wouldn't look at this movie with such awe.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The art of killing,"From what I heard of this film it was going to be very violent. I found that it wasn't as violent as people claimed it to be.  Maybe I didn't find it as violent because I've seen so many violent movies.  One thing I found different was that this movie showed killing as an art.  It also had nice little musical numbers like Alex singing ""singing in the rain"".  Another thing a found neat in this movie were the words Alex and his friends used giving you a bit more reason to pay closer attention to what they say in this. There are still some words I don't know the meaning of .  He used odd words like Guliver and Yarbles.  Anyway I can see why this won a few Acadamy awards.  Also I found that Malcom gave a very convincing performance of getting physically sick when he was exposed to anything that is considered wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite works of art,"I know there have been hundreds of comments posted regarding this movie, but I just had to post yet another one because people should always comment on their favorite films. A Clockwork Orange qualifies as my favorite. If you have never watched this film, please do yourself a favor and take the time to do so; it is a highly rewarding experience. I won't go into a summary of the plot or the meaning behind any of it all because that has all been discussed at length here by other reviewers. I will simply write that it is impossible to overstate how truly remarkable and unique this film is, and how simply genius the vision and talent of Stanley Kubrick was with regards to A Clockwork Orange. This has been my favorite film since I first saw it about twenty-two years ago. I certainly enjoy and appreciate other films, though no other work in the medium of film has even come close to approaching this film, in my opinion, as the best example of the medium as an art form. (How very fitting that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the best piece of music ever written, features prominently in this film. A marriage made in Heaven!) Though usually classified in the genre 'science fiction,' this film genuinely defies categorization, so universal is its scope. Every moment of it is poetry. A priceless film and one of humanity's crowning achievements. I'd give it 100 stars out of 10 if that were mathematically possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Why Kubrick is dead?,"A Clockwork Orange is definitively a film which has something diferent from the other films. The Kubrick signature is in it, so this is a certificate of a Masterpiece. Many people and critics have criticized it, saying that is an eulogy of the violence. I don't think so. It's only a story, incredibly well narrated, filmed and acted. A Clockwork Orange isn't more violent than other films that we can see on the cinema or the TV. Nobody can watch this film, see the end, turn off the TV and go to sleep, like nothing had happened. You have to think about it... and watch it again, again and again. One of the greatest films ever made (like any Kubrick's one), and i'll give you the chance of watching it again, so you can criticize it then.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
i don't know where I'm going,"Director Kenneth Branagh and screenwriter Chris Weitz clearly have tried to bring the old story into line with 21st century feminist values: Far from a passive victim waiting to be saved by the handsome prince, their Cinderella is a paragon of quiet integrity and insight. But the lovely and fundamentally uninteresting James is no match for the fire and elemental venom exuded by Cate Blanchett's evil stepmother, who is by far the film's most interesting character. With her chartreuse and green wardrobe, scarlet gash of a rictus grin and darting fits of cruelty, she seems to have beamed into ""Cinderella"" as if from a 1950s Douglas Sirk melodrama into a cozy Merchant Ivory period drama.Branagh tries his best to infuse ""Cinderella"" with energy, from having his characters compulsively swirl and spin in otherwise static scenes to the palace intrigue and power plays that take the place of conventional romance. He even tries to inject some humor (yes, that's Rob Bryden in a cameo role, and Helena Bonham Carter hiding behind a hideous pair of prosthetic teeth), but to no avail.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic.,"First let me say this much, I've never been a huge fan of movies that invoke a lot of thought, but this movie is an exception. The movie is amazing, not on a material level, but almost on a subconscious level. It's something about the movie that leaves you feeling as you've never felt before. Why? Because the movie is like nothing ever made before. It is a amazingly original. The music and pictures intricately connect with each other in a way that I've never seen before. Alex DeLarge is an incredibly deep and well portrayed character. He is a character that you are currently having to change your viewpoint towards. I don't know what it is, but despite Alex's violence in the beginning of the film, he is not a hated character. You feel almost an indifference to hi min his droogies, almost as if they are mere helpless products of society, with little ability to change the course of their actions. Once the story progresses, however, you start to feel sorry for him as he experiences hardships. He is eager to change, but is constantly struck back by the actions of his past. I wasn't sure what I'd think of the movie before I started watching it, as I have never read the book. The movie however is a clear cut, amazing piece of art work that is hardly rivaled by any other movie. The mood of the movie is an odd juxtaposition of good and evil, an interesting look into the fruits of irresponsible society. Escpecially relevant in today's society.However, I must warn the movie does contain some graphic violence (including rape) and nudity. If you are sensitive to such things I wouldn't suggest watching the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Twisted and interesting to watch.,"This movie is done by Kubrcik himself, the same dude who did ""2001: Space Odyssey"".Unlike the other works I've seen him did so far. Clockwork Orange is a solid adult movie.Taken place in a Retro Future in Great Britain. Gangs roam the streets, violence and rapping is a common crime in this twisted future.Alex is a leader of one gang who like to club other gangs and hobos. Their specialty is going to someone's home and rape an unexpected woman.It's all fun and games for Alex and his buds to walk around the neighborhood and spend sometime at the Milk Bar. But Alex's crimes and perverted behavior will change once he gets caught.Clockwork Orange is a different kind of movie. It has a lot of sympathy music and nice locations in Britain. I've seen many adult movies with nudity in it. But I have to say this is the first movie I've seen with a lot of it. So in other words it's a Solid R movie and not just your average R flick.Stanley Kubrick fans or fans of Strange and unusual films might like this one. Please know that this is for Mature Audiences. It has language, Strong Nudity, rapping scenes, and suggestive images.So if you're mature enough to see naked women or at least aloud to see an R movie then it should be safe to see this movie without any trouble what so ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Worst Hollywood farce ever created!,"It should be said that one of the additional causes of my distaste for this movie stems from the blatant lack of regard for the original source material. As such this film is also a Stanley Kubrick film and for some god awful reason people seem to think that his crap is gold.The film itself was denounced by the author of the book, he was horrified that this was to be the book he would be remembered by. Thus it's being taken from another mans words, so less than 25% of this movie is unoriginal work taken from another and throwing the author into the trash much like he did with Stephen King's the shining and most of his so called symbolism and symmetry isn't anything different than what any film school grad student loves to experiment with. He skips some of the best parts in the book including WHY THE MOVIE IS CALLED CLOCKWORK ORANGE! In fact the story's ending itself is completely destroyed by Stanly reading the American version of the book which has one less chapter that explains the pinnacle point of the entire body of art. The movie itself has become something of controversy by the amount of disturbing material but really it's just plain annoying he completely loses the whole message and symbolism of the violence choosing instead to just suffocate us with this crap. (including choosing to show the titular character getting a cavity search instead of the whole experience of him in jail!) Really that's all the director adds is just more senseless boring innuendo. I'm not going to sit here and explain more since all of you who will read this probably are Kubrick worshipers and think I'm completely wrong. If I could talk to you I would but I can only write a review about it and I don't want to waste words to a deaf audience. If you want to know what I'm talking about than you can pick up the book, the new one with all chapters that is now being sold in the U.S.A. And has an insightful forward about the failure of the movie.This is the first review I've written and I just had to because of the cult icon and classic this has become and it's pathetic! I can't believe people could think that this movie had anymore validation than crap.

"Seductive,Disturbing,Pervert and an engrossing masterpiece studded with some brilliant acting.","The main protagonist Alex is a sociopath with no emotion who revels in sex, violence, and talks in a weird language, has a python for a pet and loves listening to Beethoven,especially the 9th symphony. He sings ""Singing in the rain"" during a rape scene and drinks milk in some sleazy bar full of nude female mannequins. The movie is highly entertaining with a solid storyline and some amazing cinematography. This is a controversial masterpiece, and, in a way groundbreaking, thought provoking and downright intelligent. You see a spectacle of absurd dialogue's, interesting costumes, gaudy sets and some bold images. Kubrick's on screen depiction a female body is disdainful, cold, cheap, and impersonal. The scenes portraying nudity are unaesthetically done but that goes with the the feel of the film.Although the film opens on a very strong note it tends to drag a bit in the second half. The fight scenes thou foolish are thoroughly entertaining. The movie raises a very important issue that a man ceases to be a man due to his inability to make a choice and is driven by suicidal tendencies.The term clockwork orange is some kind of a compound metaphor. It means something organic(free) has been converted to a controllable and an inorganic process. The experiment that Alex undergoes carves out ""clockwork oranges"" out of human beings such that they have no decision making ability and are forced to act in a some predetermined way no matter what the circumstances.We have seen many movies that glorify violence where we are love with a protagonist who kills for fun. But never was I repulsed by a film portraying violence. This movie showed that nothing good ever comes due to violence but the condition deteriorates further into evil. It's a very weird and a bizarre film, but for those who can digest it is thoroughly entertaining. It's not watered down and surely not for everyone, but surely an experience not easily forgotten.Till then Viddy well my Brother Sir, Viddy well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I wrote a paper about Kubrick, with the focus heavily on ""A Clockwork Orange."" I can't even begin to state the cinematic importance of this movie. You must see it for yourself. Stanley Kubrick was a man before his time, a film-maker with the sort of vision and technique and talent that all artists hope and pray for in their endeavors, no matter the forum.

Definitely Kubrick's best movie.,"31 march 2000This movie is amazing. One of the best movies I have ever seen.Violent, gross, strong, powerful, and the most uncomfortable movie in the world. McDowall as the Beethoven-loving hooligan-leader is perfect and disgusting, when he and his pack of 'droogs' is going around and rape, kills and as he says commiting 'ultra-violence'. His mates sets him up, he gets brainwashed and is thrown back in the society as a new person. But is he? And how does the world treat him nowadays?This movie is VERY disturbing. It's so tragic and powerful.Just the feeling you get when the droogs rings the bell on mr.Alexander's door. You don't feel safe in your house anymore. I don't think I could sleep for a week after seeing this movie. Actually, I kind of hide it. I have seen it two times, maybe three, no more. The main reason is... I don't dare. It isn't just a movie you slack upon a Sunday morning. Just as in other Kubrick movies you will have to be ready for something different. 2001 (you can't say I'm wrong), DR. STRANGELOVE (verrryyy bizarre), Barry Lyndon (is there a longer movie?), The Shining (it IS scary!!!) and Full Metal Jacket (about the same as this one). I haven't seen EYES WIDE SHUT yet, but I will be prepared.I love Stanley Kubrick, he is my nr.1-director (even though he's dead) and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is his best movie ever made.The scariest movie in the world. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One of the most demented and fiendishly brilliant films ever made,"Stanley Kubrick, the perfectionist genius who no director will ever be able to copy, has made many great films. But nothing is quite as great as A Clockwork Orange. A sociopathic delinquent is put in prison and given controversial rehabilitation, which soon impacts negatively on his life. With themes and social commentary in every frame, ACO is a very deep and thought provoking movie. It's one of the most controversial films of all time. This is where the film shows its age, as some of its content seems slightly tame compared to modern cinema. However, ACO is a harrowing, terrifying and deliriously brilliant movie which is more gut wrenchingly frightening than any theme park attraction; not because of the violence, but because of the haunting themes and chilling relevance over 40 years after its release. It's not the easiest watch, but you will not be able to get it out of your head. From the opening shot, in which an excellent Malcolm McDowall gives you the Kubrick glare, you'll be utterly hooked.Stanley Kubrick is at the absolute top of his form with ACO. Amazing cinematography, intelligent production design and a chilling, nightmarish atmosphere make this a complete knockout on the visual front. The writing is superb, and this mixes ultra violence and pitch black humour brilliantly, and the unflinching emotional power and haunting sense of tragedy further enhances the film. ACO is emotionally cold and very dark, so some viewers will not enjoy it. It may take more than one viewing to get it. The film has an authentic atmosphere but combines it with disturbing surrealism and the brilliant cinematography makes the film genuinely terrifying at times. While no easy ride, ACO is also a relevant, powerful and fascinating film which perhaps isn't enjoyable in the traditional sense but which will have you riveted and amazed at the sheer genius of the work. Stanley Kubrick's most controversial film but also his best, this makes 2001 A Space Odyssey look insignificant in comparison.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A unique Masterpiece, Masterpiece indeed","Just rewatched this absolute masterpiece by the BRILLIANT Stanley Kubrick and now I know that you never Fully understand a Kubrick movie unless you watched it twice.I decided to watch it twice because upon re watching clips and listening to the soundtrack ( opening soundtrack ) and such I've decided to re watching clips this masterpiece and to understand the meaning of it even more and oh yeah I know what Stanley Kubrick was thinking.The movie is an absolute joyride yeah there were some unsettling scenes but the overall meaning and the way this movie was told in my opinion is rewatchable enough simply because the hidden layer that the story conveyed is something important, it's about the human nature and how we can be controlled or manipulated and rolled out of our freedom by some mechanisms that manipulate us into not acting freely or how in our nature should we act , the film really captured the essence of the human nature and it definitely proved its point by submitting a stamp in our vision on the control and the manipulation which is a very powerful theme that occurs in this film thanks to the mind of thr writer Anthony Burgess and the mind of the legendary Stanley Kubrick that this adaptation was captured in a way that presents the human nature and what it is to be human at its finest form.Overall a very very good film and a classic by Stanley Kubrick that handles powerful emotions and what it is to be human and what it is to be controlled out of your freedom and was very well acted by the very talented Malcolm McDowell a very good acting performance that he did also the other cast did a great job like the other droogs and especially Phillip stone.Overall a very good Rewatch and very much worth it to fully grasp what Stanley Kubrick's vision meant. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""In this world of make-believe, they don't believe in me!""","I have just seen ""A Clockwork Orange"" for the first time, after many years looking forward to seeing it. Looking back, it was good that I didn't watch it when I was younger, as I probably wouldn't be mature enough to handle it.""A Clockwork Orange"" is certainly one of the most cruel, bizarre and disturbing films ever made. There are some really unpleasant, ultra-violent scenes. It is disturbing because it's not gratuitous, like Larry Clark's movies (especially the outrageous ""Ken Park""). Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick were visionaries. ACO not only hasn't aged, but it's quite a landmark now rather than it was 40 years ago. We can see a gang like Mr. Alex de Large's (Malcolm McDowell, superb) on every corner. 21st century youth is gradually getting lost. It's such an empty, brutal state that the recent movies to portray this callow, lost youth don't even use metaphors to criticize the ""society"": they're raw, straight to the point (at least, most of them). ""Thirteen"" and ""Elephant"" are good examples. They may not be half strong and original as ACO, but they're sadly realistic; because we tend to think there isn't a true reason for these teenagers to behave so badly. Apparently, they have everything they need. Whether there's a solution or not, I don't know. What could it be? Brainwash? It wouldn't work. Unless it's in a large scale. High technology has made us lazier, there are lunatic clowns in power, Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are queens and ""Crash"" gets the Best Picture Oscar. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. I'm laughing not to cry.Holden Caulfield, the catcher in the rye, is an idol of mine. He was no angel, but at least he tried to understand what's around him  in his eventually twisted way. But at least he tried. And he was sincere. Alex de Large is a bastard. I don't relate to him but, unfortunately, as an 18 year-old guy, I've known much more De Larges than Caulfields. I should stop digressing.My verdict: ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a truly unique film, one of Kubrick's best  if not the best. Watch it by yourself. You may not find a solution, but you're going to have an unforgettable cinematic experience. 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Overrated doesn't mean bad.,"I used to enjoy ""A Clockwork Orange"" a lot more when I was was a lot younger. Over these many years I like it less and less. The rape scenes never bothered me back then but now that I have two daughters, I have a hard time sitting through them. Those scenes are just as exploitative as the rape scenes from the first two Death Wish movies. (Wow, I just compared Michael Winner to Stanley Kubrick.) Another demerit is that it's hard to call a comedy a good movie when a lot of the laughs are unintentional. That said, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is often quite compelling. It has excellent performances from the entire cast and terrific music. I just wouldn't rank it up there with Kubrick's best work. This movie is required viewing. (P.S.

The Art of Violence: The Story of a Sociopathic Droogie,"It is very difficult to view this film without experiencing ""nausea"" from watching all forms of violence and sickening rape scenes. Kubrick has twisted all the violent sequences in a pure artistic way. The first 45 minutes of the film is riveting and disturbing. It's quite fast paced. The main antihero, Alex Delarge, is best described as knowingly evil, but seemingly having a innocent charisma. He part of a teenage gang who speaks in a weird slang, Nadsat. It was a mode of speech used by the teenage subculture in a futuristic Great Britain. It was developed by the author of the book, Anthony Burgess. The protagonist himself is considered too human because of his driven desire for ""ultra-violence"" and rape. His narration gives the audience an impression of his ""authoritative nature."" I don't want to give away most of the details of the film, but despite the excess violence, this film successfully depicts the ""state of nature"" our society is currently undergoing.

"Please, NO Tarantino remake.","In the 37 years since I saw A CLOCKWORK ORANGE I have always staunchly offended this stupid movie. I loathed it then and after seeing it again recently I loathe it even more. Why? it is BORING. It is OBVIOUS. It is a 20 minute idea that takes 2hrs 20 minutes to crawl through the projector initiating the sort of visual atrocity that these days, sadly, Tarantino and Roth get good reviews for. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is and always will be a terrible film; a vicious misuse of character, slyly pathetically trying to present a poncy vandal murderer as some witty ant-hero (yawn) and using classic music and songs as a defiant act of cine vandalism. An absolute no brainer to simply invert dignity and humanity and then bash it all together with stark sets and overalls. It is so unimaginative. And ugly. and did I say BORING.... it just goes on and on .. and even in slow motion! for hours. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE only has a future if remade as A CLOCKWORK CHUCKY and adds Bart Simpson rolling it all into a dumb pop satire of silly-Chucky doll grimace and Simpson's awareness. In 2011 when A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is 40 years old it will just again look as wasteful and bereft of creativity as it always did. Hopeless. What a con it was and still is.

Influenced on many film makers today!A masterpiece!,"What to say about Clockwork Orange?There isn't really so much to say because it's reputation speak's for it self.And i can say that it's justified on that matter.This movie is just great.It's excellent.Direction and production are at maximum in this film.I wont even speak about acting.Malcolm McDowell portrayed one of the most sealed character's in the history of movies in this film.If you watch new Batman,The Dark Knight you can clearly see that Heath,even though his acting was superb,based his way of acting The Joker on Malcolm McDowell's Alex.Don't get me wrong,i'm not saying that McDowell acted Alex better then Heath Ledger did the Joker,he probably didn't but Alex from Clockwork orange is a cult character.McDowell had no one to look by when he was acting in this movie while Heath did.Even though he looked after McDowell,it don't means that it made it easier for him.It just helped him in the way of imagination because he didn't have to figure out the entire character's behavior for him self.Enough about McDowell and his character,let's talk about Kubrick.Stanley Kubrick is one of the best,most admirable director's ever.Not only that he made one masterpiece but he made them plenty.Too bad he died,i'm sure he had many more trick's in his hat to show which would come in handy to the other director's and entire Hollywood.He was a true master.There are classic movies and there are classic figures of film makers.He is between those on the top.There is nothing bad in his movies.For example...If you take a look at his other movies an especially Full Metal Jacket you will see that no matter what the story is,he never takes the political sides.His movies and him self are independent!!!Period!!!That's why his movies are for everyone.No matter are you English,Scotish,Irish,American,Russian,French,Croatian,Serbian or anyone else,his movies will not insult your nation's history in any way.I wont say anything else except that Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece that will be loved through generation's.A work of a master director.Watch it under any price.No matter what anyone says he/she can't explain the originality and brilliance of this movie.No word's can't!An if someone says to you that it's a bad movie,don't listen to him because he is lying!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Apart from all the directing, camera works etc..., what I loved most are the comments on certain issues. Most people had already commented that the film critizises on social choice and individual freedom, however, I think there is another side of the coin which some of us had missed; which makes this movie even more of a masterpiece. As I see it, Alex (or many of us for that matter), is a victim that holds little freedom. But not just from social limitations but also from nature. From the beginning I could see this 'animalistic' conditioning and the movie progresses to social conditionings and later towards the end back to nature conditionings.

A vibrant and innovative journey into identity,"The more I watch Stanley Kubrick films, the more I love them. They have a certain quality and innovation that makes them a step beyond the typical movie. A Clockwork Orange is no different.The film follows a period in the life of a young man named Alex deLarge. It takes place in a futuristic totalitarian Britain, where the government attempts to ""cure"" crime. Alex is part of a gang that assaults women to please their own instinctual urges. After killing a woman and being betrayed by his friends, he is arrested and experiences the harsh environment of prison. While still in prison, he discovers religion and yearns for a day when he will be ""good"".The thing that really caught my attention was the creative use of colors. This becomes obvious right from the starting title, which is has a bold red background. Other uses of color include the white and black outfits of the gang and the decorations of the rooms (the design of Alex's bed cloth especially sticks out). The music mostly consists of classical tunes from Beethoven, which mixes with the color to create a vibrant atmosphere. This, along with some of full frontal nudity, makes the film truly feel like a work of art.The performance by Malcolm McDowell as Alex is priceless. The rest of the acting in general is good, and the characters are very interesting. Its neat to see how their actions towards Alex are reversed from the first half to the second half. I found the Chief Guard to be an especially likable character; he serves as a comedic diversion during some of the darker scenes in the middle.A Clockwork Orange is rich in themes that include identity, choice, forgiveness, and crime. Kubrick creates a world that absorbs viewers without any effort and leaves them in awe. The movie itself is a journey that takes you through an experience that you would not have otherwise. It may even change the way you look at criminals. This is a movie not to be passed up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Chilling.....Exiting.......Brilliant,I have seen all of Kubrick's movies and i loved each and every one of them but A Clockwork Orange is different and original from the rest. I was in way confused my first time i seen it. This is a type of movie you have to see more than once to fully understand its meaing. The movie is set in the near future where there is a struggle between power and technology. The story takes off when we see Alex a young troubled teen caught in the middle of this struggle in society. Him and his three friends go along the night causing whatever mayham then can. This is were the most disturing scenes of the film are mostly were Alex and his gang break in a writers home and make him wacth as they gang rap his wife. Alex acts as the commander of the band of rouges. One night the boys get fed up with him and set him up. Alex gets arrested and is put in prison but has a chance to shorten his term. He Voulneteers for a project by the government which is just part of the chaos in society. After that Alex is released he quickly finds out the world is in worse condition than before and he realizes he is a clockwork orange. The movie is most notorious for the portion when Alex and his friends are doing harmful acts against people and it shows how this all seems a bit fictional it could become reality.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant. Unforgettable.,"A Clockwork Orange is an incredible experience. Few films have the ability to grab your attention quite like this one. No matter what age you were when you first saw it, the film most likely changed the way you look at cinema. I would still give a slight edge to 2001 as far as which is Kubrick's best, but it's a photo finish.Our story centers around a mischievous young gang leader and the attempt by society to change him into a model citizen through the means of chemically squelching his violent or lusty desires. The first act shows how ruthless the young man named Alex and his ""droogs"" are, and some of the trouble they get into. We see how disrespectful he is toward his parents, and society in general. After a dispute over control of his gang, he finds himself solely responsible for the death of a woman. Alex is sentenced to a considerable length of time in jail, and soon he volunteers to participate in a new experiment designed to curb people's lust for sex and violence. We are never quite sure if he really wants to be ""good"" as he claims, or if he just wants out of jail. After two years as a model prisoner and some considerable sucking up to the prison Chaplain, Alex is cleared for the treatment. Little does he or anyone else seem to realize (except maybe the Chaplain) just how helpless the treatment will make him back in the outside world.The film, though made with a paltry budget, is a technical wonder. Kubrick once again mixes sight and sound like the master he was. The futuristic world these characters live in looks like a fully amplified version of 1971. Tacky, but kind of beautiful. The stylized dialect these characters talk with will be ringing in your ears well after the film is over. The film contains numerous rape and assault scenes that can still be somewhat off-putting even if you've seen the film a dozen times. It's easy to see why this film was pulled from distribution in England for so many years. Even by today's standards, the violent acts may seem graphic.The most amazing thing about the film is Malcolm McDowell. As Kubrick himself has stated, this film really couldn't have been made without him. His performance as Alex is on par with some of the best acting even done in movies. What's most amazing is how he can create such a lecherous character and then make him almost sympathetic in some scenes. Especially as he refers to the audience as his only friends once he's sent to prison. You almost feel sorry for him even though he probably deserves a much more severe punishment. Once he has been brainwashed of all his violent and sexual tendencies, Alex invokes nothing but pity. He cannot even fight off an elderly mugging victim who remembers him from years earlier. To top things off, two of his former gang members have become cops and now take pleasure in beating him up and leaving him for dead in the country. His parents don't seem to want him back, either.After all is said and done, we learn that people just cannot live without their animal instincts and free will. The treatment was most-likely scrapped after what happened to Alex, and hopefully society was able to find a more successful way to deal with their crime problem.The film is amazing in any way a film can be.

"""Clockworck Orange"", good movie!!!","Clockwork Orange is a movie deals with very futurist and polemic subjects, that makes it interesting and different than other movies presented in the past century.

From ethical point of view, the psychological manipulation like treatment for criminal people is very cruel and its effects are very harmful for the people emotional stability, the cruelty can not be combatted with more cruelty, that is ironic and the brain of people can not be an laboratory mouse for people with political, scientific or other interests.

"More than Just a Movie, See it again!","Don't be put-off by the ultra-violence in A clockwork Orange, this film is a satirical masterpiece that works on many levels. I would argue that, given the proper consideration, this film rivals 2001: A Space Odyssey in its ability to amaze, albeit in a converse way. Being a Kubrick film the cinematography is second to none, even if the synthesizers and set pieces feel very 70's today. The visuals are as woefully disturbing as they are beautiful, and really portray a world as seen only through Alex's eyes. Malcolm McDowell's performance gives meaning to the term ""born for the role.""The story contains a multitude of themes, from political (freewill vs. government control), sociological (the hypocrisy of modern society), and philosophical (morality and how we define good and evil), offers a damning commentary on behavioral psychology, and is fraught with a fiendish irony. You might describe this film as an Orwellian-like warning about the dangers of government control on free will. But it is also a dark philosophical take on the nature of mankind, the essence of the human soul, and the evil that dwells somewhere inside us all. Sociopathic Alex may be pure evil, but he is as pure as the music of lovely, lovely, Ludwig Van. Leave it to Stanley Kubrick to show us the good in evil.Many people will never be able to get past its graphic sexual violence and arguably pessimistic view of mankind, and I can understand this. While I agree the images are very disturbing and can make it hard to watch, I believe judging this film based solely on this aspect is missing the point. It took 2 or 3 viewings for me to fully realize everything that was going on, and I still find the story very compelling.While I have not read the book, I understand the film omits the last chapter, and this changes the ending significantly. I prefer the ending of the film because it leaves the story more open to interpretation. This is also part of what makes the film so daring, even today. How often do you see a film that offers this much food for thought? Truly a work of art from a man who pushed the boundaries of the medium.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The first was the realisation and appreciation of the joy of sex and violence and the second was to highlight what it truly means to be free.I urge you to watch this film and see what a wonder it is for yourself and if you have seen it you will be able to agree with me that it is a work of audio-visual art!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Rewatching A Clockwork Orange, I find myself appreciating Kubrick's audacity more than ever. Kubrick hasn't exactly made a habit of shying away from controversial content, and this film is no exception. English writer Anthony Burgess's novella gets an adaptation that the writer himself has disavowed, as it's based on the U. S. version of the story, which excised a key redemption arc on original release. It's not an easy watch, with plenty of content that makes me cringe.McDowell's portrayal of Alex de Large is both captivating and unsettling. Alex is a hard character to relate to. Glorifying ultra-violence, he's happy to live a life of excess and then head home to his parents with no consequences from them or the law. His charisma and disturbing actions make for a compelling, if uncomfortable, viewing experience. The way McDowell embodies Alex is nothing short of brilliant, even if it makes my skin crawl at times.Eventually, Alex finds himself in prison after taking a life. Here, he signs up for experimental treatment, hoping for a quick way out. Kubrick's exploration of Alex's redemption, or lack thereof, delivers a thought-provoking message: that curing someone of an issue must come from within. The psychological and moral questions raised by the film linger long after the credits roll.The visual style of A Clockwork Orange is another standout. Kubrick's direction is meticulous, and the film's unique aesthetic, combined with its haunting score, creates an atmosphere that's both surreal and disturbing. The use of classical music, particularly Beethoven, adds an ironic twist to the violent scenes, further enhancing the film's unsettling nature.Despite its challenging content, I can't deny the film's impact and artistic merit. Kubrick's ability to provoke and unsettle is unparalleled, and A Clockwork Orange is a testament to his bold vision. Rewatching it, I find myself both disturbed and in awe of the craftsmanship. It's a film that pushes boundaries and stays with you long after viewing. It's not for everyone, but it's a cinematic experience that demands attention.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.5

Mabey Its Just Me,"Mabey its just me but this film was more disturbing than anything.

The whole style of it is this movie's only saver, when theres bad taste in the characters they really make up for in the backdrop of the movie....

Pure cinema.,"Kubrick's wicked masterpiece Clockwork Orange is pure cinema. Every scene is movie magic. The incredible thing about this movie is that thirty years after its controversial first release to widespread banning, provoking of gang violence, owing to which Kubrick decided to withdraw the film from release, it has lost none of its insane, shocking power. Watching Clockwork Orange, you one moment have fun with its wicked sense of humour, incredible invented dialect (taken from Anthony Burgess' hilarious, inventive novel), and the next moment feel sick to the stomach. The first time i saw it i was absolutely terrified. I felt terribly sick in the stomach. Now, of course, it feels slightly less like Satan damning me to hell (and i'm not religious!) and more like a delightfully cinematic, delightfully dark joke. Each time i see it, I further appreciate it: it's visually stunning, menacingly comic and unashamedly controversial and shocking (with a touch of the old social satire, my droogs). It gets in your face and there's no stopping it. Does it all mean something? Is this our future described? That's for you to decide. What's certain is that Clockwork Orange defies every law about movie making ever invented, and defies categorisation at every turn. Try and predict where its gonna take you next, or try and sum it up (which, you may notice, i've avoided doing), and you'll likely fall on your face.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film directed by Stanley Kubrick, my favorite film directer.Set in the near future in England and the story follows a young man named Alex DeLarge. He's a reader of a gang group which does every criminal things we can imagine. One day they broke in old lady's house and Alex killed her accidentally- He wouldn't know until the police told him-. He was arrested and put in a jail. He could not stand the life in prison and was trying to find way to get out. Then he decided to donate himself for a secret program which was testing for prisoners.Such a ironical and beautiful film. They did a great work especially in music. They put Beethoven's ninth symphony, Rossini's La gazza ladra and some great classical music.

A complex and strange movie,"I think this movie is about that you cannot delete your past deeds, they will haunt you forever even if you become healed and cured. The society will not let you live a new life and will haunt you down. So we should consider what we do when we are young as it will determine our future life.Another idea is that there is too much anger in youth which is unprovoked. Maybe the director also tried to portray that the youth should be more analysed and the reasons for their anger discovered.Overall the movie is weird as all Kubrick movies.

If you felt bored or comfortable you didn't get it.,"This film is meant to make the viewer uncomfortable, to think, to be repulsed by Alex, to feel sympathy for him, to feel tricked and betrayed by Kubrick - by the film itself, for allowing it to manipulate your feelings about violence, about retribution, about Alex and his kind. Just as the social workers toy with Alex, Kubrick toys with the viewer, first throwing violent scenes all involving helpless victims at the unsuspecting moviegoer, then later turning Alex himself into the helpless victim. As the film progresses, Kubrick continues to challenge any conclusions one may come to: viewers appalled at the behavior modification techniques used to ""cure"" Alex can conclude the solution is as awful as the crime. If you agree Alex should be reformed at any cost, then at the film's end, one of its many jokes is played on you. I heard rave reviews of the film after it came out in the early 70's, but didn't see it until 15 years later. After having wanted to see it for so long, I was disturbed at first by the repulsive violence and let down at my own dismay about the film. It wasn't until I taped it, and viewed it over and over, that I understood and experienced what Kubrick was intending. Repeated viewings also gave me a chance to appreciate each element of Kubrick's impeccable and always entertaining filmmaking. Anyone who is reacting mostly to the film's violence, either disgusted by it or unimpressed because it doesn't match the realism or intensity of violence on film today, hasn't really gotten it yet.

Too far away from the book,"The book takes the (ultra-)violance in its focus, while the movies does the same with the sexual aspects.

"A disturbing, yet poignant film that only Kubrick could of directed.","Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker who continually tried to both shock and amaze his audience, but most importantly he wanted people to come back again and again to unlock the layers of secrets hidden beneath his films. Plenty has been told regarding the impact of his A Clockwork Orange upon its original release, yet even looking at the film in it's own terms, it's easy to see why it's regarded as such a masterpiece. Kubrick adapted Anthony Burgess's equally brilliant book rather faithfully, but still giving the film his own mark. His films have been criticised for being cold and heartless, yet it's almost necessary for A Clockwork Orange to be filmed in such a style. Kubrick portrays his near-future as bleak and lacking the Utopian feel that most science-fiction writers were predicting. Reading the headlines in today's newspaper, the futuristic world depicted in A Clockwork Orange has unfortunately come true. This goes both for the portrayal of youthful aggression as well as the government's attempts to rid the world of it.Teenage violence at its worst is personified in the lead character of A Clockwork Orange, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Alex is a parent's worst nightmare: He is cruel, violent, cold-blooded, but filled with intelligence, which he unfortunately does not put to better use. Alex romps around town with his gang of ""droogs"", raping and hurting innocent individuals just for the fun of it. One of the most disturbing (of many) sequences in the film is the scene in which is rapes a writer's wife while dancing and skipping along to ""Singin' in the Rain."" A seemingly innocent song about love is used in a means completely the opposite of its original intention, thus why it's such a disturbing part of the film. What's even worse is Alex knows that what he is doing is wrong, but his lack of conscience causes him to not care what society thinks of him and his ideas of fun. Kubrick's uncanny ability to seemingly combine beautiful classical music to a montage of horrifying comes into play in A Clockwork Orange, with Alex's admiration towards the works of ""Ludwig van."" Beethoven Ninth Symphony is turned from a wonderful piece of music to something particularly saddening as we learn how much this sadistic rapist obsesses over it and ""As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures!"" These so-called ""lovely pictures"" which contain such R-rated material as rape, violence and blood pouring out of Alex's fangs would probably scare Beethoven due to the way Kubrick so perfectly edits the images together.Yet, there comes an interesting turn-around when Alex is arrested and sent to prison. Soon afterwards, the tone of the film completely changes as Alex begins to play nice and the film becomes far less disturbing and chaotic than the first act was. Alex wants to get back out into the world as quickly as possible and when he hears of a technique that will help him do so, he jumps to the chance. He is soon put in the Ludovico Technique, involving him being strapped to a chair, his eyes made un-shutable and forced to watch horrible acts of violence on a cinema screen. When Alex's beloved Ninth Symphony begins playing over images of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, it is then that the effects take hold. Even Alex of all people realises that he is an amateur compared to the atrocities the Nazis performed during the Holocaust. This leads to an effect more cruel than the Technique's creators possibly imagined: Not only is Alex drained of violence, but also of his love of fabulous music. Maybe Beethoven heaves a sigh of relief, but us the viewer is oddly starting to feel sorry for Alex. He may be unable to commit violent acts, but he is also unable to choose whether he wants to or not.Stanley Kubrick launches on these themes perfectly as only he can. Other filmmakers would probably none too subtly through these into the viewer's face, but not Kubrick. Like many of his other films, he allows to slowly tear apart the film throughout multiple viewings and even let us interpret the film's views ourselves without him interfering. He just sits, stroking his beard and thinking ""yes, that seems about right. What else do you have to say regarding the film?"" Malcolm McDowell's performance also brings us into Alex's world, carefully pronouncing each word that Burgess created for his book so as not to make any mistake. Each subsequent viewing, we learn a new meaning for ""nadsat"" and see that it is more than just the way Alex communicates, but also a part of his rebellion against the world he tolerates so much of. Stanley Kubrick not only created a masterpiece worthy of plenty of conversation, but also a look at our world currently operates and ways we can resolve these problems without the need of brainwashing techniques.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
If the movie A Clockwork Orange is not a perfect 10 what is?,What is there to comment about this movie it is in my top 5 movies of all time.

An as well as in Shining – here we have brilliant story packed with Kubrik’s talent – deadly orgasmic combination of pleasures of cinematography and story-telling. In fact – the only thing that reminded me about the age of this film was the outfit of characters and sound design. But in all of the rest planes – one with classicism in heart could create this movie just yesterday.This movie sure does generate the urge to see more films from Kubrick, if not all of them.

Kubrick's best film,"I guess I am what you would call a complete non-fan of Stanley Kubrick, although I would never call him a pervert (displaying sex in your films hardly makes you this) or proclaim thankfulness at his passing away. I do, however, find that it is hard to enjoy all but two of his films: Dr. Strangelove and this one.The reason why A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's best effort is because it is his most faithful adaptation. Just about every Kubrick film was based on literature of some sort, and he almost always messed up translating it to screen. You can see this in Full Metal Jacket, where he leaves out more than half of The Short Timers in spite of its very short length. A Clockwork Orange also sees Kubrick leaving out details of his source material, but in all but one case, these weren't important. I'll deal with the one that is.Stanley Kubrick's conception of the ending was based upon the American version of the novel, which simply ends with Alex having the effects of the Ludovico technique reversed. While this is a neat ending that allows one to speculate about his next step in life, it cuts out the very heart of Anthony Burgess' story, one that is especially relevant in this day and age where child psychologists are shoving Ritalin down children's necks like mobsters electrocuting dogs so they'll be hungrier to tear into one another. That point, in a nutshell, is that being bad by choice is far preferable to being good because you have no other option. When Alex is suffering the vengeance of the so-called good folk, you just wish he could get up and start smacking the crap out of them again. In the chapter of the novel when he gets that back, seeing him make the choice to live a normal, peaceful existence anyway is a great triumph of the will over mind control. Not including that in the film was a big mistake, and it is a matter of record that Burgess was more than a little upset with the US publisher as a result.The reason why Kubrick's film is preferable to the novel, however, is that the novel often borders on being incomprehensible. Rather than asking you to read and try to decipher a very unstructured slang, the film just shows you what Alex is talking about, giving it to you in clear red, green, and blue. The novel is very rewarding if you get through it, but it smacks of having been written as a political statement and takes a lot of effort, which gets in the way of the horror factor. Sometimes, being able to sit back and watch is a big advantage.Nonetheless, Kubrick's film has earned him my respect as a filmmaker.

Singin' in the Rain,"I saw this film recently. ""Legendary"", ""cult classic"", ""extreme violence"", ""agonizingly crude scenes""; all these were but a few terms used in reference to it. I was quite uneasy before seeing it, worrying that I might not appreciate it enough. Or maybe I wouldn't ""get it"". I had heard that this film contained very important social messages which viewers were not allowed not to grasp. So with all this hype, I rented A Clockwork Orange and learned what classics are all about.The first thing that people who approach classics warily must learn is that these films are deemed so because they are highly accessible and let you go filled with ideas you did not have going in. Classics are not work, they impress you with their looks and their styles, their stories and the innovative ways in which they are told.One could interpret Kubrick's classic anyhow desired. One could say the film's message is you cannot ""cure"" someone from what is inherent, in this case, a sociopath. Or, one could say the message of the film is you reap what you sow; you can never escape the mistakes of your past because they will end up coming back at you in any way, shape or form. Of course, there are a plethora of other social messages in this film.Independent of the derived messages of the story, the film is brilliantly constructed. First and foremost, the main character's evolution throughout the film is admirably conveyed by both Malcolm McDowell and Kubrick. McDowell presents us with an absolutely ruthless Alex Delarge whom everybody fears, regardless of his stature; for all we know, he's eighty feet tall with that demonic look in his eyes. The actor shows, through his character, all the signs of a true sociopath, as seen when Alex gives us his first rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain"". In this early scene, we literally witness our main character (or as he deems himself, ""your narrator"") break into a married couple's residence, beat the man and rape the woman, all this while singing the aforementioned song. In stark contrast, after the controversial treatment he undergoes sets him free, he is not at all the same person, and only a great actor can genuinely convey that. In addition, what really got to me was when they put him in that restraining chair and they forced his eyes open. There was no cinema magic involved there, they were actually doing that to McDowell, yet he remained totally in character, albeit the physical discomfort.Now with regards to what Kubrick does in order to bring life to Alex's evolution throughout the film. There's a certain quality great directors have when making their great films and I believe it is that they immerse themselves so completely, heart and soul, into their works that all throughout them, there is a reigning atmosphere which screams that they are creations of artists. A Clockwork Orange bears these qualities. Unlike bad directors (whomever they may be), great ones do not dissociate themselves from their films, undertaking the shooting as a purely technical process riddled with time constraints and budget concerns. The first part of ACO (that is, until Alex is captured) is dominated by the classical music that Alex loves. Even during the beatings and the rapes, the background music is always happy, feel-good music. This is a means Kubrick uses to show what a sociopathic monster Alex is. Killing is fun, rape is a blast. This is Kubrick's message for the first part of the film. Consider this: Kubrick could just as easily have played heavy, dramatic music, or nothing at all, through all this. But he didn't. The reigning atmosphere here is surreal: the attacks are surreal, the homes are surreal and the characters are surreal. It is as if Kubrick is Alex during the film.A classic comes down to these pretty basic components: great acting, great directing, a score that improves the action instead of hindering it, great writing and all the offshoots of these. Don't break your heads over what we call classics. They are just damn good films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A mind-boggling film,"I'm not even sure how to start reviewing this one of the kind film. I had seen 5 Kubrick's films previously (The Killing, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut), and the uniqueness of each endeavor is so palpable. His film is divisive because he is not afraid to push the envelop, and A Clockwork Orange is more vivid in that regard than any others. From its jaw-dropping opening shot (I was like, ""oh my goodness, this is going to be weird""), the first act went on a mind-boggling journey of sex, violence, and unlawfulness. The extreme sadistic behavior is presented with Beethoven's classical music on the background; it truly has to be seen to be believed.The story got progressively weaker in the second and third acts, but it showed the other extreme of trying to eliminate the ""criminal impulse"", the dark side of human mind, by developing a negative Pavlovian response to illegal activities through medical and psychological treatments. It demonstrated the danger of dehumanization and proposed the important question of, as a society, how much we are willing to trade our freedom for a ""quieter"", more secure life. Alex turned from a chilling villain to a somewhat sympathetic victim; a lot of his acts are despicable, but somehow we could identify with him throughout the movie, even if we don't want to admit.The film touches some serious subjects, so it could easily feel heavy-handed with a lesser director, but Kubrick's style, full of memorable images, just completely absorbed me in until toward the end. It's both a satire and drama and deserves the status fans have given.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Hard to watch at first, but gets better with every minute","Kubrick is certainly one of my favorite movie directors of all time and is without doubt one of the most stylish. The film is really complex.To be honest, I did not love it at first. It seemed a little too much with all this ultra-violence, but believe me, it all has a purpose. The character of Alex by the end of the movie is a product of the evil and merciless society. I found it very amusing how Kubrick successfully made me somehow sympathize to this young, cruel man. At first, I was disgusted by the cruelty of Alex, but at the end I seemed to have forgotten how awfully horrible this man used to be.The director's role is to tell a story in his own style and way and Kubrick really achieved that.A masterpiece in a strange and beautiful way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
moral choice,"I used fake ID to get into this movie when it first came out. I'm 50 now. At the time, this movie made me laugh, think, and shrink back into my seat. The scenes of violence were so 'in your face' for the time, and yet so....so...eeeesh.....breathtaking??? I abhor violence, and can't believe I am using the word 'breathtaking', but damn, it really was (is) amazing how Kubrick pulled it off.Younger folks who watch it these days may not see the big deal about the violence as it is portrayed in the movie....which is simply a testimony to the movie's worth over time. Desensitization towards violence is a core element of the movie's point, after all.I liked (*really* liked) the main character (Alex) in the movie...he is funny, quick witted, and charming. But he is also a scumbag prick bastard, and it's easy to lose sight of that. He is easily embraced while we sit in the dark and eat our popcorn, but most of us would probably go out of our f*king minds if he lived next door to us.I walked away from religion as a young adult, a few years before I saw this movie. I am enjoying the view from out here to this day. However, the one person who seems to 'get it' in this movie is the prison chaplain. With all of it's visuals, and fine use of music, and great acting and directing, there *is* a point to this movie, and the chaplain articulates it. It's a simple assertion, and certainly not a new one...that people are regarded as being either ""good"" or ""bad"" based on their ability (or lack of) to make the correct choice while using their own set of ethics as arbitrator. The Catholic church **HATED** this movie when it came out, and yet it articulated the foundation of their entire credo in a favorable light. LMFAO!!!!

a disturbing film,"Kubrick had veered towards the disturbing in his movie plots before (the paedophilic in ""Lolita"", the insane and corrupt in ""Dr Strangelove"", the menace of technology in ""2001"").  In ""A Clockwork Orange"" he takes this to the limit in his story of Alex Burgess, a cultured psychopath (he listens to Beethoven and speaks in an unusual patois to his 'droogs') who is seen carrying out various attacks, rape, and eventually murder over two nights, before he is sent to prison and added to an intensive programme of torture and rehabilitation.  The first third of the film deals with the atrocities he carries out before his arrest, but the bulk of Kubrick's vision centres on the methods employed by the state to turn Alex into a reformed character, incapable of response and filled only with the desire to do good.  After release he leaves only to find further torments await.The characters, apart from Alex (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell), are little more than cyphers, cartoon characters on the periphery of his life.  These include Warren Clarke as one of his 'droogs', Adrienne Costi and Miriam Karlin as his victims, Steven Berkoff as a police thug, David Prowse as a sinister carer, and Clive Francis as the oily lodger who has taken Alex's place in his parents' flat.  Only Patrick Magee as the liberal writer who plays a pivotal role in Alex's life early and late in the film has a meaty role amongst the remaining cast.Is the film any good, and worth the hype after all these years of officially being unseen?  Hard to say.  Kubrick uses music again to good effect as he had throughout ""2001"", and the message from Anthony Burgess' original novel comes through.  However, ""A Clockwork Orange"" has to be viewed with mixed feelings, both for the subject matter and for the antihero himself.  My guess is the final jury will remain out for a long time yet.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Powerhouse performance and stunning visuals,"There have been many words that have been used to describe Stanley Kubrick's 1971 study of youth gone wild in a dystopian future, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Terms like Sardonic, Violent, Brilliant, Political, Metaphorical, Visionary, Comic, Bizarre and Satire have all been tacked onto this piece.And, surprisingly, I would add one more - boring.Based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 black comedy novel, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE tells the tale of an ""Ultra-Violent"" youth in a Britain of the not-too-distant future (at least, not-too-distant future of 1960's/early 1970's Britain) who is arrested and convicted of violent crimes and then is rehabilitated and returned to society.Deemed ""unfilmable"", Kubrick's funny bone was tickled by the VERY dark comedy in the novel and put his considerable visionary style to bear to bring this work to film. It is split into 3 parts - each one working just a little less than the part before it.The first 1/3 of the film follows Alex ""DeLarge"" (Malcolm McDowell) and his band of ""Droogs"" as they flaunt societal norms (and the law) while creating havoc in the form of violent crimes (and violent they are). This is the most successful part of the movie for Kubrick sets the table during this part to visually set the style of the story - and this visionary style is STUNNING (as one has come to expect from Kubrick) setting the world that Alex and his Droogs inhabit in an environment that is at the same time familiar and foreign. Kubrick was a former photographer and his photographic sense is in high form in the cinematography and scenic set-ups that this auteur Director lays on the audience. He also uses the ultraviolence (and there is ultraviolence to be sure) to shock and stun the audience and he succeeds in that goal easily.All of this is abetted by McDowell's powerhouse performance as Alex. He inhabits the modernistic, made-up language of the youth of this film much like the Shakespearean actor that he is getting his mouth around Shakespeare. The oddball words and phrasing seem quite natural coming out of McDowell's mouth and he gives the impression that he has been speaking this way for years. There is a charm and joi de vivre that McDowell brings to Alex that draws the audience in all while his eyes give off a vibe of extreme danger and violence. McDowell is perfectly cast in this role...a role that he would have trouble shaking for the rest of his career.The 2nd part of the film is Alex's ""rehabilitation"" whilst in prison. It is during this part that we see Alex's cunning and intelligence (again, through a terrific performance by McDowell) as he plays along with the establishment in order to accomplish his goal of getting out of prison as quickly as possible. Unfortunately for this part, the ""establishment"" characters are pretty one-dimensional and quite clearly are an inspiration for British political humor for some time to come.This, then, leads us to the least successful portion of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE - the 3rd act where Alex is ""rehabilitated"" and is returned to society where he encounters quite a few of the inhabitants of the first part of this film but this time the tables are turned and Alex is the victim of ultra-violent acts of the others. By necessity, the rehabilitation that Alex experiences during the 2nd part of the film neuters his character and, unfortunately, it also neuters the energy and the dysptopianism that were a strength of the first two parts of the movie and this is where the film went from interesting to somewhat boring with scenes going on just a little too long with an ending that lands with a thud.It also doesn't help things that McDowell's character and characterization of Alex is about 3 levels above anything else anyone else is doing. The other characters are not interesting at all and they all serve as bit players reacting to Alex's largesse.Besides McDowell's performance and the stunning visuals, one also has to admire the music used in this film to help support the story on the screen. Once again (like in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), Kubrick eschews a traditional musical score for classical music and standards and they work quite well - especially his use of Beethoven throughout the film and Alex's singing of the Gene Kelly classic ""Singin' In The Rain"" during one of his ultra-violent adventures in the beginning.Ultimately, the poor 3rd act (and dud of an ending) tarnish what up until then is an interesting film that starts with an ultra-violent beginning that uses that violence for a purpose that, then, upped the expectation of the rest of the film that it just could not realize.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank (ofMarquis)NEXT MONTH: Another Kubrick film I have never seen, 1975's BARRY LYNDON.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Challenging,"This is probably the most intellectually challenging film I've ever seen. I'm really not sure I understand more than a handful of what's happening in this film.  I mean, the story is easy enough to follow, and several of the themes become apparent on repeated viewings, but a lot of peculiarities remain.  Much of the supporting cast performs their roles with a high degree of stylized exaggeration.  I'm not sure what Kubrick was going after with all of this.Still, at the very least, it's a damn good film that I really enjoy watching.But every time I do, I'm thrust back into that dame dilemma.  What does the ending of this film signify?  Clearly, Alex has managed to indulge in thoughts of a highly anti-social nature without being torn apart.  So, the effects of the Ludovico treatment are gone.  So, what now?  The legendary story of the censored final chapter of Burgess's novel has this answer.  To viewers who complain about the abrupt ending, you have government censorship of literature to thank.  I know what Burgess's take on this was, having familiarized myself with the true ending of the story.  But what is Kubrick's take?  What does Kubrick think he is saying with this film?  Has Alex learned something from his ordeal?  It looks like he has not, in which case, the only point of the film seems to be that it is better to be free and evil than a good slave.  On this level, the film is more relevant now, in this age of personality- altering drugs people take for depression or ADD.  Is complete loss of self to high a price to pay for the elimination of undesirable behavior?The film is an excellent jumping off point for the topic of criminal justice.  Specifically, what is the purpose of incarceration?  Do we imprison criminals in order to protect society from them?  To reform them? Or to have revenge upon them?  It's a particularly fascinating question here in America, since the Death Penalty is still a very living issue for us. You can find in this film loads of material to fuel an energetic discussion on the topic.But again, I'm at a loss to understand what the driector had in mind.  It doesn't concern me.  This film is thought-provoking.  When I watch it, or even think on it, my mind spirals off into all sorts of issues raised by it. I don't know which issues, or which positions, the director intended to support, if any.  And I don't care.  It is enough, in my view, that the film provokes thought and discussion.Added to that, it is simply an enjoyable film to watch, with an intriguing (if slowly developed) story.  The structure of the film is beautiful. Slowly, patiently, it builds up an intimate portrait of Alex's pre-prison life.  Then, slowly and patiently, it takes us with Alex through prison, through the Ludovico treatment, and to his eventual release.  Then, in the third act, it slowly and patiently takes us back again through his previous crimes.  Encounters with his parents, with his former friends, and with his former victims tell another story.  The one thing that I do think the film is saying, quite clearly, is that people have a natural, emotional desire for animalistic revenge.  Toss out the high-minded theories we were discussing earlier.  When we hurt, we need to make someone else hurt worse.As usual, a very dark, pessimistic film about the terrible flaws in human nature.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick at his best,"While this is a must see-especially today I am not sure the word like is appropriate for this one. It is so deeply disturbing and though provoking. It does hold up after 50 years. Malcom MacDowell's performance is brilliant. About half way through the film the essential question is asked ""if a man is forced to be good and this is not his choice; then is he really good? Is he really a man?"" What is the essence of goodness, and what is free will? The film is supposed to be closely based on the acclaimed novel; however, I have not read it. Kubrick's filmmaking is stunning, unique, brutal, and violent. The images are disturbing. This looks at the conflict over the views on the nature of man, and that view impacts the response to crime and violence. 50 years later I feel the questions are the same, and we are no closer to answers. Law and order people may argue it doesn't matter whether good behavior is the result of free will; it is the result we seek. The humanist may not be so happy with that approach regardless of positive outcome. Aside from Other Kubrick films few movies evoke such conversations and thoughts.

"A Dark, Violent and Twisted Masterpiece - Spoilers","Alex DeLarge(Malcolm McDowell) is a hoodlum in not-too-distant future London. As the tagline says, ""His principal interests are rape, ultraviolence and Beethoven. He and his ""droogs""(friends) often spend a lot of time away from home and out on the streets. They go out at night and have fun which means getting into fights with other gangs, commit random acts of violence, and ""in-out""(rape) women. One night, when Alex comes out of some lady's house after beating her to death with a large statue, he is beaten up and betrayed by his droogs and is left to be arrested by the police. At the jail, Alex is informed that a woman that he had performed an ""in-out"" on had died at the hospital from her injuries. Alex is then sent to prison. While there, he reads the Bible(he only reads about the sex and violence) and dreams of getting out of prison. He then asks a preacher about an experiment that he had heard about at Ludovico that if successful, could possibly rid him of any violent or sexual impulses he might have. Soon enough he is sent to Ludovico. There he is forced to watch unedited footage of brutal beatings, rapes, and Nazi marches all the while with good old Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing in the background. Alex comes out of Ludovico a changed man or is he?This is actually the second film directed by the late Stanley Kubrick that I've watched with ""Full Metal Jacket"" being the first. Malcolm McDowell is truly awesome in his role as the sadistic, young Alex. Stanley Kubrick said he wouldn't been able to make this movie without him. Stanley Kubrick did take an awfully big chance with this movie. The violence here in ""A Clockwork Orange"" can simply be described as ultra. There are many brutal rape scenes and several bloody beatings. People who like Gene Kelly's ""Singing in the Rain"" may not like it anymore if they watch ""A Clockwork Orange"" because Malcolm McDowell sings it while kicking the crap out of an elderly man and raping his wife.The musical score is the easily one of the best parts of ""A Clockwork Orange"". It is fantastic! The opening score is the one I like the most. The way it plays while Alex is looking into the camera with that half-smile, you wonder what exactly is going through his head at that moment. The ""milk bar"" or whatever it's called that Alex and his droogs are sitting at, is unique and yet ultimately frightening and disturbing at the same time.The film's setting is apparently futuristic London, but it seems a lot like present day London. The reason it feels so much like present day is because of the clothing and all the cars and stuff like that. This feels a lot more like some sort of dark, comic satire than it does a science-fiction movie.""A Clockwork Orange"" certainly is a twisted work of art. It is now my favorite Stanley Kubrick film. As I said before Stanley Kubrick did take a chance making this movie.

Kubrick's Vision?,"A flawed masterpiece, especially where Kubrick detours from the vision of Anthony Burgess.Much of the comments about this movie refer to ""Kubrick's Vision"", unquote. The problem with that perspective is that the best parts of this movie are those that directly translate the novel by Anthony Burgess. The worst parts are those that Kubrick and his designers came up with themselves.For instance, the original novel was set in a much more Orwellian world of dark staircases, concrete decor and the smell of cabbage. The so-called ""vision"" of Kubrick and his designers gives us what must have seemed very futuristic then but now appears so very 1971. Look at the decor of the Korova milk bar with it's naked female sculptures dispensing drencrom from the breast. Look at Alex's apartment with its silver and golden walls. Look at his parents in their oh so 1970 clothes.

Disturbing Absurdity,"This film was based on a novel written by Anthony Burgess. Burgess is quite a cynical kind of satirist. Bearing that in mind, I have say, that it was the greatest load of tripe I have ever experienced. The movie was irrational,illogical and nonsensical. It was a celebration of anarchy and of humanism. In Burgess/Kubrick's opinion,to think outside the normal boundaries and restrains that have been placed upon us as society and our own conscience would constitute narrow-mindedness. To be free to explore all forms of indulgence and wickedness is to be,""enlightened"". Therefore,the average human-bean,""like you and me"", wouldn't have the capacity nor the intelligence to comprehend unless they were as broad minded us those who cast off their restrains,e.g,""Easy Rider"", another movie of its kind. As far as promiscuity goes, it was as vile as,""Cabaret"" (Of course, I could never agree with such nonsense)Although there were unspoken suggestions and hints that Alex was the poor victim of societies narrow-mindedness, it wasn't until the end of the movie that audiences were made to discover that Alex didn't need curing.

"Sensational, a beautiful montage of music, feelings, and images","Stanley Kubrick's probably two most infamous films are A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. At the 1971 Academy Awards, this film was nominated for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, and Editing. It is so very hard to put the brilliance of A Clockwork Orange into words. The film works on so many levels, from the brilliant score to the top of the line acting and the satirical photography. Many people have called it shocking and disturbing, but Steven Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan is 10 X as worse. As the troubled but ultimately intelligent Alex, Malcolm M. shines in his role by ultimately conveying a sort of child- like quality and at the same time a distant violent nature. He is perfectly adapted from the Alex in the novel. All the other actors do perfectly fine jobs, especially the Prison Chaplin who puts the ultimate message of the film into a few basic sentences. Kubrick's refined script is excellent, and is almost the exact same as the novel. Some minor details that have changed is that he focuses a bit too much on the ultra- violence and rape, and there is a lot less of the funny language that Alex and his pals use. Kubrick's direction treats this as a satire, and the viewer has all these images sent to his head. There are so many sequences when he suddenly does slow motion or when he puts it as if it's fast forward. Overall, A Clockwork Orange is everything you've heard and more. It's not exactly the most violent or disturbing film ever created, though there is quite a bit of nudity. It's a towering achievement from everyone involved, cast and crew alike and deserves to be on the top 10 films of all time.

English psycho?,"When I first watched A Clockwork Orange, I gave it 10. Then I wondered whether I liked it that much - was it really that good, or was it just a film filled with random violence and sex? After a second viewing, I was convinced that this is one of the most brilliant - and bizarre, films ever made.1971 was a particularly good year for film; Straw Dogs, Get Carter and Dirty Harry were some of the best, but A Clockwork Orange surpasses them all. Obviously it was hugely controversial when released, which pretty much just increased its popularity. The controversy however, was not needed, as the other films I have listed from 1971 were just as violent (although Straw Dogs was banned whereas this wasn't). All violence is in the first half an hour, and is nothing by today's standards. The violence and sex is only there to introduce us to the main character. After the opening, the story unfolds and is completely unique to any other film.The screenplay is the key to this film. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of adapting a book which might as well be written in Japanese rather than English. I have a copy, which has to have a glossary defining all slang words used by Anthony Burgess - it is 10 pages long. The voice over narration is a masterful touch, offering us a portal into the mind of a total psychopath.The only problem is in the nudity. Any need? There is at least 1 penis in every scene in the first half. It is completely pointless, and doesn't add anything to the film. And before you call me homophobic - the female nudity during the rape scenes is also totally unnecessary.I'll forgive Kubrick for that though. Because with A Clockwork Orange, he has given us one of the best, most original and most unique films ever. Behind the sex, violence and controversy lies a story asking more questions than any other, and which has stood the test of time as easy as any script ever written.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ultraviolence,"Clockwork Orange was one of five novels written by Burgess in 1961, when he thought he would soon die of a brain tumor and wanted to provide for his wife financially.

A Clockwork Man,"The first time I ever saw A Clockwork Orange, it was about 11 at night, and it was on ShowCase. I had heard about this movie a lot from reading stuff on the internet, always coming across it when I was reading about something else, so curious as I am, I decided to watch it. I wasn't ready at all to see what I saw in this movie, but it's like a horrific car wreck, or a guy streaking, you just can't look away. By the time the movie was over I felt sick to my stomach, and I couldn't stop thinking about how horrible it was. But I found, the more I thought about the movie and the more I read about it, I had grown a liking to it.I had become so fascinated with it, I went out and bought the book and read that, which was difficult because of the language, and it took a while to figure out what some of the words were referring to, but when I finished I was in love with the book.The movie and the book are very close, with the few adjustments due to time constraints in a movie. The ending to the movie though, kind of disappointed me because the book was much more to my liking. In the end of the book, Alex ends up going back to his old ways, but now him being an adult he finds everything he use to do very juvenile, and then he decides maybe he should get a real job, find a girl and settle down. In the end of the book, he's grown out of his old ways, and I really like that aspect, and it would have been good to show in the movie.A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant movie- it's colorful AND dark, comical AND horrific. Watch this movie with an open mind, and if you ever get the chance, read the book because it's more thrilling if you have the two mediums working together. A Clockwork Orange is my favorite movie and book and I recommend it to everyone- that is, if they are in a time of their life where they can handle it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Unlike my friends, I despise this movie","My friend told me to get past the disturbing parts and see how brilliant this movie is for its great parts. But I can't. I recognize that this movie does has some good parts, but all I can think about are the disturbing scenes. The graphic rape scene scared me and the scene where Alex has sex with the two girls is literally a porn scene. At this scene, I wondered, ""How could a movie take such a horrific turn?"" This part had no effect on any other part of the movie. It had no relevance whatsoever to the plot. It was just thrown in there. It was such a stupid, pointless graphic sex scene that was unnecessary and made me totally disrespect the film. I don't come to movies to watch porn. I come to movies to be entertained. And I know I am only mentioning the graphic sex scenes, but those are the only parts I remembered. Everything else is a blur. Which isn't my fault, and is the film's fault. I shouldn't leave the movie remembering the parts I absolutely despised, but I did. I really don't recall the plot very much because the terrible parts are all I remember. That's all I can say.

McDowell is fantastic and Kubrick's twisted direction is expectedly solid. The combination of classical music and that haunting, synthesized score is brilliant, and makes for some of the most memorable moments in cinematic history.

The music intertwines beautifully with it all, and the attempted suicide scene makes you feel the crunch of bone on ground. The ending also makes you think: has he changed at all?

"Visionary, timeless and an incredible example of how film can matter.","Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" will disturb you, bother you, probe you, intrigue you and confuse you to no end. It is abusive in its use of human vice as a means of showing society at its worst. But while it's hard to take, Kubrick's science-fiction social commentary is simply one of the best examples of how film can tell stories and make valuable points in ways that other media simply can't.The film takes place in a future Britain, which Kubrick portrays with a retro-'60s twist that only makes sense for someone envisioning the not-too-distant future from 1970. The main character is Alex, a teenager living a lifestyle of pure anarchy, focused on excessive violence, or ""ultraviolence"" as he an his cronies coin it. It's a gang culture and Alex believes in it, that is until his ""brothers"" set him up and get him caught and stuck in prison, where he makes an effort to get selected for a special treatment that is said to cure him of his evil ways and allow him to go back into the world immediately despite his prison sentence. The result is by far more ethically questionable than Alex's previous actions and Alex finds himself as the poster boy for an attack on the government.Kubrick's depiction of this dark and dangerous world is never without distinct purpose. Every scene is memorable, every camera angle or movement significant in some way or contributing to the mood of the film. The use of classical music both as an element of the film and as a major part of the plot is absolute genius. Music, especially Beethoven, seemingly the most harmless aspect of a stained character in Alex, becomes the most influential in the film and also is Kubrick playing the same trick on us as gets played on Alex.Malcolm McDowell as the eerie and controversial ""protagonist"" steals most of the acting thunder. After all, he is the narrator, but this is without question a work that feels dominated most by the ubiquitous presence of its director. He even went out of his way to create inconsistencies in the film's continuity.Kubrick explores the very indecipherable nature of both good and evil and how it is conditioned in society. The film also serves as a critique of higher establishment, specifically government, telling people how they are supposed to live, though ironically a minister seems to offer some thematic advice in saying that all men have choice to be good or evil.""Orange"" is the kind of film that has many layers that can be visited and revisited. Its science-fiction element makes it timeless as well - we can always ponder its questions about the future. Ultimately, however, no matter how much access you have or think you have into the film's insights, it still leaves an impression. There are so many memorable scenes and while most of those might be difficult to watch, they're deeply affecting and fascinating. The combination of visuals, music and ideas simply shows film's great contribution to thought and social ideas.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Clockwork Orange - cinematic masterpiece,"based on the 1968 novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is a thrilling dark piece of cinema set in a dystopian future. Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell) finds euphoria in drinking spiked milk in the Korova milk bar, leading his pack of droogs on ventures of ultra-violence and listening to Beethovens ninth. At the beginning of the film, he seems to epitomize evil. Whether it is his seemingly innocent blue eyes and cheeky side grin, that he refers to the viewer as ""Oh my brother"" and himself as ""Your humble narrator"" or the fact that he exudes optimism, charm and charisma, you inevitably end up batting for him and feeling your heart strings pull on his behalf. Through a twist of treachery from his unsatisfied droogs, Alex finds himself at the opposite end of the 'tolchoking' and in jail, where he hears of a new treatment that gets prisoners out of jail earlier. this is where the meaning of the story really comes in, the fragility of the individual. as Alex is being brainwashed, you can't help but feel his sickness as his face convulses with pain and horror. The strange language called Nadsat(meaning 'teenager' in Russian) coined by Anthony Burgess is endearing and Malcolm Macdowell plays the role of Alex with all of his heart, inhabiting the character of Alex rather than acting him, something few actors bother doing nowadays. A Clockwork Orange is stunning in every aspect, visually with the genius of Kubrick and the skills of Macdowell, Aurally with the sounds of Beethoven and other classics and a haunting Moog soundtrack that plays in the most crucial roles and really sets the dark scenes.A Clockwork Orange is a piece of cinematic masterpiece. from beginning to end, it is like watching an emotional, often comedic, realistically (too much so) acted piece of wonderful wonderful art. be careful before you watch this film, it is utterly heart wrenching and will stay with you for the rest of your lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick's sensational dystopian masterpiece.,"Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" stands as a testament to the filmmaker's mastery of his craft, offering a profound exploration of themes ranging from the nature of evil to the importance of free will in the human condition. Set against a backdrop of dystopian society, the film introduces us to the enigmatic and morally ambiguous character of Alex DeLarge, a juvenile delinquent whose actions serve as a lens through which Kubrick examines complex philosophical questions. At its core, ""A Clockwork Orange"" grapples with the notion of evil and its place in society. Through the character of Alex, Kubrick challenges conventional notions of morality, portraying him as both a perpetrator of heinous acts and a victim of societal forces. Alex's journey serves as a stark reminder of the inherent complexities of human nature, highlighting the inherent duality of good and evil within us all. The adults in the film, with their misguided attempts to control and manipulate Alex, represent the dangers of imposing order at the expense of individual freedom, ultimately raising questions about the nature of justice and the ethics of punishment. Central to the film's exploration of these themes are the performances of its cast, particularly that of Malcom McDowell as Alex DeLarge. McDowell's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the youthful exuberance and chilling malevolence of the character with equal measure. His facial expressions and physicality add depth to Alex's character, making him both captivating and unsettling to watch. The supporting cast, including F. Alexander and the Minister, further enrich the film's narrative, each embodying different facets of the human condition and serving as foils to Alex's complex persona. Kubrick's direction is masterful, as he expertly crafts each scene with precision and attention to detail. The film's cinematography, with its striking visuals and meticulously composed shots, creates a surreal and atmospheric world that draws viewers into its unsettling reality. From the iconic opening sequence to the film's symmetrical structure, Kubrick's visual storytelling is both immersive and thought-provoking, inviting viewers to contemplate the deeper meanings behind each frame. In conclusion, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a cinematic tour de force that continues to captivate and provoke audiences with its exploration of existential themes and moral ambiguity. Kubrick's nuanced approach to storytelling, coupled with McDowell's mesmerizing performance, elevates the film to a level of artistic excellence that transcends its genre. As viewers grapple with the film's profound questions about the nature of evil and the human psyche, they are left with a haunting reminder of the complexities of the human condition and the enduring power of cinema to provoke thought and reflection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Malcolm In The Middle,"People sometimes call ""A Clockwork Orange"" their favorite Stanley Kubrick film. Me too, except higher praise in my book is that it's my favorite Malcolm McDowell film. McDowell's portrayal of a vicious young hood up against a system every bit as cruel is what draws me in, and keeps drawing me in, time and again.McDowell is a young fellow named Alex, who in a vaguely futuristic society goes gallivanting off on assorted crimes with his equally nasty mates until he finds himself in the hands of justice. To get out of prison, Alex volunteers for a new mind-altering technique designed to rid him of his antisocial impulses. But is the cure worse than the crime?One of only two X-rated films ever to be Oscar-nominated for best picture, ""Clockwork Orange"" has lost none of its ability to shock in the more than 30 years since its release. It still attracts hard-core fans while offending others. I used to be a bigger fan, back when I was a college boy. I even took a first date to see this. Needless to say, there wasn't a second date, though it's not only for that ""Clockwork Orange"" hasn't aged for me as well as some other films I can mention.It's a very good film all the same. Kubrick's perversity and his structured style of storytelling are well tailored to an Anthony Burgess novel that operates like a boomerang cuckoo clock. The music by Walter Carlos, re-fangled classical melodies served up electronically, works very well with the slightly putrid color scheme and odd lighting to create a sense of prevailing unease throughout. In his other works, Kubrick too often tended to elicit either mechanical or hyper-emotional performances from his actors, but with the exception of Patrick Magee's embarrassing turn as one of Alex's victims, the approach actually works here because the film itself is something of a satire, boldly comical even in depicting brutal crimes like the murder of a cat-loving woman with a giant ceramic, um, sculpture.But what makes ""Clockwork Orange"" worth repeat viewings, more than Kubrick's cleverness, is McDowell's lead performance. Though we get an education right at the beginning just how terrible a person little Alex is, McDowell invests him with such charisma, wit, and even grace that we kind of gravitate to him despite ourselves. ""Don't sing that song in the bathtub, Alex!"" ""Watch out for that milk bottle!"" There's no reason we shouldn't wish Alex his instant karma, yet the lively McDowell gives us someone to perversely root for. His narration, like Richard III's, is a marvel of mordant sympathy-stealing.While the film raises questions about the necessity of being able to choose good or evil in order to be human, and how society casually corrupts the individual, I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of people gravitate to this film because it serves up generous helpings of nudity and ultra violence under a decorous umbrella of deep thought and even a vague spiritual dimension courtesy of the prison charlie. Kubrick knew how to make a trip in the gutter seem elevating.However absorbing it is in all its parts, ""Clockwork Orange"" is a one-man show, and for me that man is Malcolm McDowell. The way he smiles so menacingly yet with real allure, wipes a smear of spit off his face, screams out how he's seen the light while undergoing the Ludovico treatment, and maintains his weird bond with us the viewer is a marvel of morality-warping brilliance. McDowell had other great roles, but Alex is one for the ages. Is there anyone else who could make corruption seem so refreshing?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One That Was Made Way Ahead of It's Time,"Considering that this film is still considered intense even in times where The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Piranha are released, it shows how far Kubrick looked forward to in this film.

It didn't stop after 2001 and is in fact pushed to the point where it became a major X Factor in film (get it? haha). Yet as button pushing films come and go (Human Centipede just popped in my head as I'm writing this), one could asked why this one is Etch a Sketched in our brains. Answer: It's real. Whether it describes how cruel humans can be to one another to how they try to have absolute control on things they can't and when they fail how they try to pick things up. This film not only describes human nature, but it describes it in a way anyone who can handle the more sexually explicit and violent scenes can think and say ""Yeah this has been done in real life before.""

1971. A year of great movies. A year of controversial films.,"A few weeks after the release of ""a clockwork orange"" in the United Kingdom, Stanley Kubrick took the initiative to withdraw the film from the ""circuit"", after voices arose that either associated, or attributed, or even blamed the film to be responsible for the increase in crime that was registered (?) in the days/weeks following the release of the film. What is the truth of all this? I really don't think anyone knows. Was the film the victim of detractors who arranged this script to denigrate it? Is there any truth or foundation in the ""accusations"" that the film was the target of? To date, as far as I know, no concrete and substantiated data has ever appeared about what really happened. The truth is that the film was banned in the UK and other countries, a situation that remains to this day, 52 years later! The ""problem"" came from the way Kubrick presented Alex (the best interpretation of Malcolm McDowell's career): he steals, he beats up beggars, he is violent, he is a rapist, he kills! But despite all this, the truth is that almost none of us dislike Alex's character. On the contrary, he is endearing, funny and charismatic. We don't want to see him dead like other movie bad guys, we want to follow the adventures he gets involved in and see the outcome of them and we even realize that several times we are ""rooting"" for him. It's a film, it's cinema, it's fiction, the director takes this option with complete legitimacy. It is helped by the excellent and charismatic performance of the actor. But there were soon those who took the opportunity to accuse the film of the ills of society. In 1999, in the movie ""fight club"", Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) plays a terrorist. Did anyone dislike his character? Almost nobody, quite the contrary! And I repeat, we are talking about a character who is a terrorist! It's a movie, it's cinema, it's fiction, almost all of us (men) want to be like Tyler Durden (one of the most unforgettable characters in the history of cinema, just like Alex from ""a clockwork orange""). Here, too, the director (David Fincher) creates this ""healthy"" discomfort, extremely provocative and purposeful (after all, this is one of the main objectives of the film, perhaps the most intelligent and provocative social satire in the history of cinema). Well, finally, it should be noted that 1971 was a year with a few more films that generated a lot of controversy, for various reasons: ""dirty harry"" (Don Siegel), ""duck you sucker"" (Sergio Leone), ""straw dogs"" (Sam Peckinpah) and even the lesser known ""wake in fright"" (Ted Kotcheff, yes, the same one who directed the first Rambo) and ""walkabout"" (Nicolas Roeg).

One of the most bizarre and unique films ever attempted,"Of course it's not perfect...how could it be? Stanley Kubrick, the obsessive-compulsive auteur was the only choice (except for Ken Russell, who would have had a ball with it) to bring Anthony Burgess's brutally compelling novel to the screen, and he does a fine job. The opening shot, of a smirking, unblinking Alex, staring down the gradually retiring camera as he drinks spiked milk prior to going on a violent rampage of vagrant-beating, gang fights, joyriding, housebreaking and rape, makes sure the film grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. And what a journey it is! A CLOCKWORK ORANGE takes in everything, and I do mean everything, from high farce, black comedy, surrealism, British smut and schaedenfreude to some of the most disturbing, troubling and thought-provoking sequences ever committed to celluloid. It's a film that delights in pulling the carpet out from beneath the viewer, again and again and again. And it works on all kinds of levels, too - beneath the 'futuristic' veneer (which, for all I know, could have already looked dated in 1971) there's a virulent satire on the sheer, eyeball-coruscating ugliness of modern architecture, particularly the neo-brutalist school of characterless concrete blocks and swathes of hideous white cement that was cropping up all over Britain at the time. Then there are the 'minimalist' interiors, hideous costumes (especially on the female characters!), Godawful pieces of pop art trash...it's clear that Kubrick really HATED this stuff, and it must have been a conscious decision for him to dump the classically-minded misfit Alex (whose taste for Beethoven and the most sordid aspects of the Bible mark him out as one who abhors a shallow modernity, and rebels against it wherever possible) in the middle of a world that's so alienating and drab. A common complaint among British youths of the seventies, the nascent 'punks' in particular, was that ""everything's crap"" - and looking at the ghastly (and surprisingly, not TOO exaggerated) world of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, you can understand where they were coming from! I could banter about this film all day, druggies, but this is my perspective - it's one of the most vicious pieces of social satire ever created, and the legacy of the horrible world little Alex was rebelling against is still with us, decades later.

I don't get it.,"I have tried watching this film at least four times in the past couple years. I am a human being, the fact that sooo many film nerds call this one of the best films ever made is disgusting. I've always wanted to try to understand this, but I just can't anymore. It's too much for me, and I've seen Requiem for a Dream twice. I could probably never sit through Irreversible, not that I ever wanted to. Sex in film depends with each film. Eyes Wide Shut and Perfect Blue are incredible films, and I honestly, I can't even explain why this one bothers me. Because Perfect Blue also has a disstressful sexual atmosphere to it, but A Clockwork Orange is just so much worse.However, despite the obvious scenes that I cannot stomach to watch, there are some parts I enjoy. The opening scene, with the colors/titles, the long zoom out, and the synth music is perfect, it's so good. It makes you think you are about to see something great. The music in general is actually pretty good, and the Beethoven is well used. And yeah, it's Kubrick, the editing and cinematography are pretty incredible. I read the book in my senior year of high school, and it was atrociously boring compared to this film, which isn't a compliment. Some of the dialogue is pretty stupid though.I think I'm done giving this a chance, at least for a while. I saw it on IFC in September 2020, right after watching Eyes Wide Shut. Then on Showtime in July 2021, then HBO Max in April 2022, and now July 2022 on TCM. Each time I've seen it, I've gotten further in, but there is nothing about it that makes me want to see the end.

"possibly the most powerful, thought-provoking film of all-time","In my opinion, A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's best film, and may be the best film of all time.  The opening shot that tracks backward from a close-up of Alex is only rivaled by the opening shot of A Touch of Evil. Kubrick takes the use of color to new heights, constantly using orange and blues (a color scheme he returned to in Eyes Wide Shut).  Certain images from the movie are ingrained in my mind--such as the close-up of the handicapped writer's face while he is going insane.The movie successfully addresses so many issues that are pertinent to society, including the nature of the criminal mind, retribution, and political exploitation.  However, I think that the central theme is the role of free will and is exemplified by the argument made by the prison chaplain after Alex has undergone the treatment--Is he really human if he has no free will to make a decision?  Kubrick would argue that he is half-human, half-machine, as the title of the movie indicates (Clockwork referring to a machine and orange referring to the organic, living fruit).Finally, how could you write about this movie and not mention the music--the beautiful works of ""Ludwig van"" often serving as a wonderful contrast to the violent images on the screen.  The music adds to Alex's character so much--how many ""droogs"" would you expect to listen to Beethoven?

Even though it remains unappreciated because of the violence and the perversity bursting from the scenes, analysing and watching the film carefully would stress the important problems in society and the ways to prevent these.Adapted from the novel of Anthony Burgess, the story is told by 16- year- old Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) in a future Britain. Because of his interests being ultra-violence and rape he shortly ends up in jail. Not being able to hold up to the hard conditions in jail, he volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government to solve the society's crime problem. The therapy turns out to be a brainwashing program, which turns Alex into a dog-like proper citizen and when he's finally out on the streets, he faces the people whom he's tortured, hurt, raped or violated. And they're not willing to let Alex walk away safely.Alex did give up his violent self during the therapy but what he couldn't give up was listening to Ludwig Van. This is why almost all of the scenes are accompanied by a variation of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. The opposition of the mind-twisting ultra-violent scenes and the calm and relaxing 9th Symphony and more classical music show Kubrick's talent once again. Although the film is a long one (136 minutes), you're not bored while watching the perfectly realistic and remarkable scenes. The film has been criticised a lot, and it has been said that it leads teenagers to violence and was also once an R-rated (Under 17 requires accompanying by a parent or adult guardian) movie for almost 30 years. However it has been nominated for 4 Oscars and has won 5 awards and 12 other nominations.As well as being a movie of violence and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction of ""A Clockwork Orange"" also forces us to thoroughly question ourselves and that's why it is a masterpiece and will remain a ""must see"", a classic for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Beyond compare,"This is my all-time #1 movie.I read the book back when I was in high school. I spoke the ""language"" quite well, which perplexed most of my friends. They were soon a part of my little world, and a part of what was our own little ""cult"" following.I finally saw the movie when cable entered our household. Even my dad thought it was a great movie! We watched it several times, and quoted it often.There is no easy way to explain why this movie is so good. You just get enveloped by the concept after you make it through the disturbing violence that turned so many people off back then. By today's standards, it's quite mild. (That which is left to the imagination, can be more disturbing than anything presented in vivid color.) Nothing compared to this then, and nothing will ever compare to it again. There was a time when you could not get this video in the UK.

Kubrick's sheer talent!,"I am a big lover of Kubrick's films, so this may be a bit biased, but viewing A Clockwork Orange was meaningful because it left a sense of paradox, what life is really like and what you thought of the place you live in and this sense of realism was hard to find fault. Kubrick wanted things to be PERFECT in all his films because that was the auteur he was.

hard to understand at first.,"This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. The wacky twisted world created in Stanly Kubrick's A Clock Work Orange is so bizarre at first I really didn't know what to think. After I watched it a couple more times and did some research, I realized what a great film it is. First off it is a really great adaptation of the book which is written in a thick British dialect so it is extremely hard to understand. The story takes the unruliness of adolescent boys and how to deal with them. The film is shot really well. There are a lot of dark shots and contrast is used really well. I may never be able to listen to Beethoven again. Thought this movie is extremely violent and crazy. I think it is an excellent film. It takes a few viewings to really appreciate it, but the pay off is really great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
the Dark side of humor,"Kubrick's Clockwork orange is one of the finest example of idealistic and path breaking film making. It clearly depicts his own love for the story and cinema and this movie clearly defies all boundaries and will remain an all time classic.The characters have been artistically portrayed and with a very futuristic view the film has been designed with such authenticity and neutrality that even 35 years after this movie was made, it still has a contemporary feel. It difficult to believe that the movie was made in 1971, because even today with so many technological advancements several filmmakers would not be brave enough to justify a script like this one.The characters are bold, 'in your face' and have meticulously enacted by the artists. Its hard to believe that its fiction. The euphemistic and dark humor depicted in scenes where Alex is examined before entering the prison or where Alex kills the lady with an antique dildo is outrageously app laudable. The script and story moves along briskly and takes some 'out of the box' turns as we progress along with Alex's life. The sarcasm of human nature cannot be ignored.This movie will always remain an all-time favorite. Kubrick is the best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Sociologist's nightmare, film-buff's dream.","I must admit that I am not Stanley Kubrick's greatest fan - I found Eyes Wide Shut disappointing and 2001 just plain dull. However, I went to see A Clockwork Orange not only on account of the hype but also as I had read the book several years previously and I wanted to see if the film version lived up to the literary classic. I discovered, not to my surprise, that it is affected by 'The Exorcist' syndrome. Kubrick managed to create something totally different to its source material, yet with a charm of its very own.Obviously, from the very outset, a very seventies film, this was unlike anything I have experienced at the cinema before. This film disturbs at almost every conceivable level - rape, murder, brainwashing and ""ultra-violence"" are all breezed over during this films run time. And does the film stop to moralise? It barely takes a breath, leaving ethics up to the audience's discussions on their way home. You leave the cinema wondering who - if anybody - you should feel sorry for. Everyone in the film, from Alex (Malcolm McDowell) to Dim (a very early performance from Warren Clarke) and from Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris) to Mrs. DeLarge (Sheila Raynor) displays inhuman characteristics.There seems to be some confusion as to whether this film is really about Alex and his violent nature, reflecting the darker side of human nature, or society having no qualms about using a victim to their own ends. Perhaps it was too many people believing the former which led to its retraction in Britain for more than 20 years. Either way, the dark undertones, superb soundtrack and excellent acting make this film a must-see for any self-respecting film fan. Kubrick-lover or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Music is perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of the movie. Actually, I couldn't imagine ACO with some other music than this. Suits just perfectly. Acting of Malcolm McDowell is fantastic.

"Provocative, stylish, one of a kind and masterfully directed","From a directing standpoint, it's a masterpiece. Between the wealth of bright alluring colors, the avant-garde sets, the memorable electronic score. It's comedic, tragic, satirical and irreverent.Initially, I was offended by it and shut it off, but a couple days later, I gave it a second chance and ended up loving it. There are lots of graphic scenes of nudity, violence and rape, which rightfully elicit disgust. It's also the brash and raw nature of this film that makes it appealing. Either way, good or bad, if a film can impact someone, it has done it job. It's better to be hated than forgotten, and this is an unforgettable movie.This sci-fi film is about topics such as morality, free will, proper criminal justice ethics and political corruption. Is the government's treatment of curing a sociopath by performing mental experiments on him immoral. While Kubrick effectively conveyed how horrific of a sociopath Alex was, I don't think he came even close to convincing the viewer that the cure was worse (or as gruesome) than the disease.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing at best,"Before I am harshly attacked verbally for this review, let me begin by stating that I think Kubrick has done some brilliant work. I absolutely loved ""Space Oddyssey"", ""Lolita"", and ""The Shining"", but something about this one didn't sit right. The plot sounds like an interesting idea: the leader of a terrible violent gang is arrested and forced to partake in a new form of criminal therapy. The end result is that he becomes ill at the very thought of a violent or sexual action, and as a side-effect suffers the same effect upon hearing Beethoven's music. So why would such an excellent and creative idea turn up such bad results? The ""ultra-violence"" is indeed disturbing, but to be honest I couldn't care less about any of these characters. Malcolm MacDowell does a mediocre job playing the main character and hence I found it hard to even care about the story. I found the movie shocking and disturbing, but not good. Disturbing and graphic movies I've enjoyed before such as ""Se7en"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" managed to create characters I was interested in and could care about. However the below-average performance of Alex completely negated any and all chances of enjoying this film. If I didn't feel the need to sit through it all and not form a full opinion until the end, I would've turned the film off before falling asleep from complete boredom with the characters.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Beethoven and ultra violence. Yes... of course its about our ""clockwork orange"".","Stanley Kubrick is one of the most important directors of all movies history. He makes controversy since his ""Dr Strangelove"" to its confuse ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and films that we never going to forget like ""Lolita"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" (I Have not seen this yet) and famous horror classic ""The Shining"". But, without a doubt, ""A Clockwork Orange"" can be called as its most important masterpiece. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most important critiques to any powerful division of the world. Home, politic, religion and morality are the central critiqued topics.

With a unforgettable Malcolm Mc Doweell as Alex, this futuristic propose of Kubrick is one of the most important works that i (Maybe every one) have ever seen. If don't is the ""most important"" critique of society (For me, the best movie that critiques society and world in every sense is Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò o le 120 giornati di Sodoma"") is one of the best that you'll ever find. Alex, is that sarcastic character who embodies all a society. A dirty, unlawful and unmoral society. A society that in all its division, has and own interest (Politics and religion). An abusive and vengeful society. A society where only the strongest survives. The weakest lives wretchedly.

"Powerful, captivating, intelligent and violent","Stanley Kubrick followed his adaptation of 2001: A Space Odyssey with another one, this time from Anthony Burgess' book where he takes us to a near enough future where ultra-violence and sex rule.A Clockwork Orange breaks down into two or three more or less distinct parts. The first one throws us in the world of this young Alex and his ""gang"" where an obsession with sex, violence and voyeurism reigns. The second part tells us about his stay in prison and then the final part arrives to deliver this film's conclusion, what we did with Alex, the new Alex, and what has become of him. Under all these ""harsh"" aspects of the film, Kubrick created this unique aesthetic and will opt for this simple but effective mise en scene. Also a great casting with Malcolm McDowell in front, his ""innocent"" eyes, his mischievous humor, and his ominous gaze Kept the viewer focused on screen to witness this incredible social and contemporary satire.The title Clockwork Orange represents here the result of the Ludovico experiment on the character of Alex and also a way of criticizing and ridiculing the government and the psychological science.This film does not have the same impact on today's generation as it did on those targeted in the early 70s. Back then it was interpreted as a film with unhealthy or gratuitous violence, but today, ironically we seem to live in the same ultra-violent world as Alex. In short, A Clockwork Orange is a reflection on 'man', 'punishment' and 'social morality'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the Most Memorable Films of All Time,"Stanley Kubrick made many important films during his career including several that are far more famous than ""Clockwork Orange.""

It's been said that he never repeated himself, and perhaps that is why he made so few.) Still, despite ""2001,"" despite ""Dr. Strangelove,"" no Kubrick film has stuck with me as vividly as ""Clockwork Orange."" The Malcolm McDowell character may be the most frightening ever depicted -- far more disturbing than Hannibal Lector or the villains in those awful horror movies.

man as a machine,"The movie deals with the human mind, the pervert man, brutal, violent, atrocious but free and the 'good man', the man seen as a plant, as a manipulated object, without free will.

Man is both good and evil, thats the beauty of humanity, that's the thing that brings color to life. The movie mocks at the government, the supreme control organ that manipulates the human mind under the pretext of doing something good for the society. The use of music in the violent scenes is not comic, Kubrick deals with music just like David Lynch does.

Worth Viddying (watching),"Yeah, I'm a fan.I made a mistake of mentally blocking out this film for many years, harbouring a misconceived grudge that ACO is nothing more than an arty, complicated film-making statement about very little. Now I realise I was wrong.It's an enjoyable film with an imaginative, sarcastic, pretty daft plot that rumbles along and keeps you interested (mostly) throughout. It's bizarre and rather stifled in places due to the exaggerated British/false accents and its generally old-fashioned feel, which isn't going to appeal to horror/violence/gore aficionados from the 21st Century, I accept that, especially due to its rather drawn out, pompous and indirect nature.It's sordid entertainment regardless of how striking or bland it might seem, with an underlying, sinister presence, a revolted, angry attitude towards life, mostly society, but also with a soft underbelly and an almost dear, childishly witty heart - the heart of Kubrick, I guess.I've gone through a phase of watching, appraising and re-evaluating Stanley Kubrick's films, all of them, since the 'The Killing' and 'Paths of Glory', and I'm pleased with 'A Clockwork Orange'. 9/10 for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A bizarre, terrifying masterpiece of cinema.","Stanley Kubrick's a Clockwork orange is one of the best movies ever. And unlike the media portrays it, it is not a simplistic glorification of violence. It is a beautiful in it's camera and artwork, it's music is genius, every aspect of production is perfect. However, most importantly, the character and story are genius. Alex, from the description of him being a snobby, violent, delinquent murderer hoodlum, sounds like a despicable character. But like all good movies starring anti-heroes, the movie just dares us to forget morals and like him. Because it is truly impossible not to like him. Despite the fact that he is a violent murderer, he is one of the coolest characters in movies. The plot is fairly simple. Alex gets put in jail and is subject to a new conditioning treatment, and is sent out into the world again. To say anything beyond that would be to spoil the story.

This is the greatest film ever made - better than The Professional, and that takes some beating.  The overacting by the minor characters is excellent, as is Malcolm McDowell.  Why this film didn't win all sorts of awards for art direction and costume design is beyond me.  (as well as for best film, director, actor, editing, cinematography and adapted screenplay)  Kubrick uses music in such a brilliant way, like in 2001, (notice its display at the record store) making for a great experience for eyes and ears.

Fascinating...Impressive...What an AMAZING Film!!! :),"Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film, ""A Clockwork Orange"", is the story about an aggressive young man named Alex DeLarge, who has a strong passion for ultra-violence, rape, and (believe it or not!!!) Beethoven.   As the leader of his so-called droogs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), who share the same passions as he does, Alex and his three droogs have terrorized futuristic England...raping and beating helpless victims until he is captured by the police and sentenced 14 in jail for murder.  To shorten his jail sentence, Alex goes for aversion therapy to cure his violent ways.  After being released, Alex's passions for ultra-violence, rape, and Beethoven have all, but faded away.  Soon, Alex finds out that being cured isn't all that is cracked up to be...and his former victims are all ready to turn every bit of pain and agony he has caused for them over to him.  Like they say...everything you do, always comes back to you!!!I always was eager to see this film...even though it is ten years older than I am...but after seeing Stanley Kubrick's final film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", I was impressed by the strange and yet fascinating characters Stanley Kubrick's films have featured.  Alex DeLarge is an unforgettable character played by Malcolm McDowell...his brilliant mind, but horrible passions have made the film itself unforgettable.  Stanley Kubric once said, ""If Malcolm hadn't been available I probably wouldn't have made the film.""  Malcolm McDowell has brought a light onto the screen portraying the strange Alex DeLarge, and I don't think anyone could do better than Malcolm did!

Raw and wicked. Stanley Kubrick's take on the mind and macabre.,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is clearly a film of delight, pleasure, and just flat out raw drama and horror. The scenes and images during the film are highly remembered and stunning especially the colorful displays in houses and the sculptured mannequins in the milk bar at the films start. Also flashing images of nude women and even Christ are hard to leave one's mind after watching the film. The story is a great take on character study of the mind and how it can change. You have Alex(Malcolm McDowell) a thug and modern day hooligan who along with his friends enjoy having fun at the expense and tragedy of others. You name it Alex and his sidekicks roam modern day Britian in search of terror, from violence to the attacks and rapes of women. A viewer will find many scenes of this film disturbing . Until one day Alex's little playhouse comes crashing down when caught he's sent to prison. Upon arrival he begins the journey of reform it's only when a new experiment of a mind and ego transplant takes place that really changes him and it makes this film a different story from the second half on. Alex then upon release finds himself a different person now a proper citizen after being brainwashed it's crazy to see him encounter his family, friends, and many victims after his release it's just not the same as the guilt, remorse, and sorrow drive him to be crazy and again a need to be dark. Really I just love the way that Kubrick showed how one's mind can change and that people can take on new and different personalities and behavior, and yes I believe anything is possible by mind manipulation and tinkering. Really a film that shows two sides of a central character like Alex the good and the bad proving that the mind and one's own free will and choice either makes or breaks you. To sum it up ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the best films made because of the images, and the music theme is creepy and spooky it really tingles your skin, Stanley Kubrick as always pushes the limits by showing another side to humanity and life proving that having fun and a good feeling can both be great. A final say this classic proved still that much is still to be discovered in terms of the mind and of the future, clearly an unforgettable picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Philosophical 'Clockwork Orange' Thrills us with it's Lessons,"Anthony Burgess book of the same name is really the rarest of gems in English letters; The philosophical novel. The main character is the near futuristic street thug Alex, played in director Stanley Kubrick's ultra violent screen adaptation by Malcolm McDowell. Who brings a priceless and vicious vigor to the roll which is almost impossible to top. Alex and his gang of 'Droogs' wreak havoc on 21st century London, as they rape, rob and rampage throughout the early scenes of the film and novel alike. Both stories following each other very closely with just a few minor changes. But when Alex is betrayed by one of his traitorous droogs after giving him a thorough 'Tollchocking' He finds himself holding the bag for a burglary gone awry. Which turns into the bludgeoning death of an elderly cat lover. With a long and frightful arrest record Alex finally lands in prison. Where he sets out to convince the in house Chaplin and anyone else who'll listen that he is reformed and ready to rejoin society. And when a radical new treatment becomes available to one lucky inmate. A therapy which can be completed in a mere two weeks. Alex considers himself the perfect candidate to be revamped and released in a fortnight's time. Not realizing that he will become 'A Clockwork Orange.' When Kubrick previewed his film for critics and audiences alike. People were stunned by what they saw. And whether or not you liked it or hated it one thing was for sure. No one had ever seen anything like it. The 'Ultra violence' is amply gratuitous and the rape scenes are harrowing, especially for the era that only immediately followed the sexual revolution. It's hard to imagine that Kubrick got the code and ratings administration to slap an R rating on there. Actually the film was originally hung with an X rating and it only after Kubrick revamped the editing, which included speeding up some scenes which were downright pornographic that he was able to get the labeling changed to an R rating. The dialogue is similar to the dialect which Burgess employed in his brilliant novel. Which is Alex's own mix of Russian, street slang and the regular King's English. Hearing McDowell speak these lines with wit and vinegar is very satisfying. His performance is a special accomplishment. I'm sure he brought more terror and life to this persona than even Burgess, who was also an accomplished conductor and writer of classical music, dared dream. And Kubrick isn't too bad himself. No one had ever even attempted to make a film this daring up to that date. And whether you gather the moral implications or not. There's not one scene that wouldn't entertain as it's own entity. With the engrossing and fascinating McDowell leading the way in almost every frame. Many have called Kubrick the greatest film maker of all time. Including, among others, the not too shabby himself Martin Scorsese. And after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' and being thrilled by it for the umpteenth time. I can find no avenue to disagree.

I also at times felt that some characters were portrait very differently than I had perceived them while reading the book. Still I think Kubrick really did a good job bring this piece of literature into a different medium.

Not just entertaining...,"The film based on the book is an intriguing view of choice, personality and the morality of society and the media.  It centres around the main character, Alex de Large, and his gang of young adventurers who terrorise people for the sheer pleasure of it.  But this is not the point of the story.  The story is concerned ultimately with the right to choose how to live: to be an individual.  Should a criminal be kept essentially human by being allowed to live criminally, as is his nature or nurture, and be punished for their crimes, or be transformed into a ""good person"" through deliberate conditioning for the safety of other citizens?The film takes great effort to reveal points on both sides in the backdrop of a strange nihilistic, almost cyber-punk world with fine acting, direction, and atmospheric music by Walter (now Wendy) Carlos.  The film was banned in Britain by the director, Stanley Kubrick, until recently which added to the mystic of the film, at least here in Britain.This is a film to watch and in my view, the first film of this genre recognisable today as a ""modern film"" in its execution and, in some cases, a truer representation of today than one may, at first, realise.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A movie that should gladden the hearts of career criminals everywhere,"Stanley Kubrick's ode to personal freedom at any cost is one of the most amoral movies ever made.  The film seems to be implying that it's all right for a person with incorrigible anti-social tendencies to rape and steal and murder if the ""Ludovico Technique"" is the only alternative.  Kubrick really wants us to think that Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a cool guy.  First, we have the chummy, confidential narration, spoken by Alex himself.  Then the director distances us from the rapes, beatings and brawls perpetrated by Alex and his buddies by setting them to jolly Rossini and Beethoven.  He then dehumanizes Alex's victims by making them even more vicious and disgusting than he.  Figures of authority are either pathetic, grotesque cartoons (Alex's parents) or sadistic repressed homosexuals (Alex's correctional officer).  The movie does raise the important question of just how far a government should go in attempting to reform career criminals, but since cocky Alex does volunteer for the treatment in order to get a reduction of his prison sentence, no one can say that he doesn't know what he's in for. However, Kubrick means for us to cheer at the end when our ""hero"" is able to return to his old sociopathic self.  Somehow, I didn't feel like joining in the chorus.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Check this one, what a movie!","Stanley Kubrick's striking visual interpretation of Anthony Burgess's famous novel is a masterpiece. Malcolm McDowell delivers a clever, tongue-in-cheek performance as Alex, the leader of a quartet of drools, a vicious group of young hoodlums who spend their nights stealing cars, fighting rival gangs, breaking into people's homes, and raping women. While other directors would simply exploit the violent elements of such a film without subtext, Kubrick maintains Burgess's dark, satirical social commentary. We watch Alex transform from a free-roaming miscreant into a convict used in a government experiment that attempts to reform criminals through an unorthodox new medical treatment. The catch, of course, is that this therapy may be nothing better than a quick cure-all for a society plagued by rampant crime. A Clockwork Orange works on many levels--visual, social, political, and sexual--and is one of the few films that hold up under repeated viewings. Kubrick not only presents colorfully arresting images, he also stylizes the film by utilizing classical music (and Wendy Carlos's electronic classical work) to underscore the violent scenes, which even today are disturbing in their display of sheer nihilism. Ironically, many fans of the film have missed that point, sadly being entertained by its brutality rather than being repulsed by it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling and Attracting,"After having watched the film for several times, I must say that ""A Clockwork Orange"" is truly a masterpiece and has not lost any attraction ever since. Why? Because Kubrick managed to connect his ""style"" and the controversial topic of Anthony Burgess novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" and turned it into a nightmarish and futuristic thriller. When I watched it for the first time, I was completely stoked and could not believe that it was made back in the 1970s, because for me it could easily keep up with a lot of today's films.Especially the language of ""Alex and his droogs"", ""Nadsat"", a mix of old Russian and English got me right from the first scene of the film and has not let loose ever since I have watched it for the first time either...Some people argue that the violence used in ""A Clockwork Orange"" might be too ""violent"" and too graphic, but I think that the violence only contributes to Kubrick's main goal of connecting the strong language and strong violence, in order to create the notion of a strong apocalyptic future, where the individual is completely dispatched from any kind of values, confronted with a society based on the material status and only functions (especially in Alex' case) as society's cue ball.Almost like our current world! Almost?",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Karma=Commupence????,"Malcolm McDowell plays the optimum role in the film. His cruel intent eyes. and his hook smile, bring upon a vindictive character that all will fear. Although the cool, controlled motions of his character bring about an icon that most men would like to experience once in a lifetime, his leadership ways are so sincere. He is both feared and revered. He is an ugly Churchill. Taking into account the other end of the spectrum, women find him dominating, yet attractive and at the same time very repulsive. He is both feared and loathed. He is an ugly Bruce Willis.The film also highlights the idea that abiding by the law and conforming to religion, is the correct way that people should live. Being filmed in 1971, religions that were of the minority at the time, were not taken into account and were dismissed entirely. Yet who is to decide that this is right? There is that edge that Christianity is the only root.Throughout the film Beethoven's 'ninth symphony' can be interpreted in a rainbow of ways. There is the fear of being unable to predict what is around the corner, but it also has that definitive feel of defiance and dominance. It is so consistent throughout the film, it creates an equilibrium level. Furthermore the use of William Tell brings an accelerated pulse to the consented sexual notions in the film.The use of Russian language and the combined idiolect of the characters bring about some amount of social understanding and status hierarchy. The understanding however, is shot right back down when the filmography is taken into account. Stanley Kubrick uses wide shots on a technicolour camera then extreme close ups on the characters, whereby the appearance means nothing and their facial expressions and eyes show their emotions.Guilt is a key theme that runs throughout the film, recognised fully at the end, unfortunately however sometimes not recognised at all. None of the characters feel guilt, it is in actual fact the audience that feel it. It is the pressures that the Government put people under to bring a shortcut to legislation and the revival of criminals. One thing that the audience should not feel guilty about however, is thoroughly enjoying the film, as it is a work of art in its own right.And lets face it, Karma is a key concept, and if believed we should all treat our friends better and take into account how much they are worth....BKWF",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best movie ever made.,"While that is subjective, as is with all movie reviews, to me this movie says a lot about the way society tries to modify and appropriate people for their own agenda and good.
While Alex isn't a character with a good personality, it's intereseting to watch him live his 'you only live once'-lifesyle. Of course he is an extreme character, but that makes the film work.
The way his past comes to haunt him when he's free is a simple but effective way to portray the concept of karma.In the end I think this movie says a lot about the human condition and what makes us human, and what drives our actions. And, nontheless, howmuch we are influenced by the media all the time.As with all Kubricks, mutiple viewing are wise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Greatest movie ever.,"A clockwork Orange is a brilliant masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick: in my honest opinion, the best movie he ever made. The Shining en 2001: A Space Oddesey were fabulous movies, but ACO rises all above them. To tell you the truth, I have never been so impressed by a movie as this one. I now am going to explain the reason for that right know, at least, I'll try to.What many people say, is true: The first time you watch this movie, you really think ""What the ****""????? and you'll prefer to throw this movie away. Then again, it's not a movie to rent at a dull Friday night with a bunch of friends. No my droogs, this is a very controversial movie, so brutal and cruel yet filled with so many messages and looks at the future, you really have to think while watching this movie, and have to stay serious. The movie has very funny pieces in it, but then again, it's far from a comedy. It's a dramatic, criminal, violent, and also a very crazy movie. But with crazy I mean it the good way crazy. This movie is about a teenager (16-18)named Alex, who's life is all violence, sex and Beethoven. Every night he sits at the Korova Milk Bar, drinking drug milk with his 'droogs' (buddies or friends) Dim, Pete and Georgie. Dressed very odd, they walk and drive to town, raping and beating the **** out of innocent people. Just for fun. But when they are breaking into a woman's house, the other droogs take revenge on Alex for being to bossy and too violent against them (pushing Dim into the water, slapping him etc. etc.). Alex is caught by the police and has to go to jail for 14 years. For 2 years he sits in this prison, when he hears of a new technique that will cure him and make him a free man in 14 days. He agrees...Thus so far the story line: I don't want to tell too much of it, for many people still have to watch this movie.Why do I give it a 10?? This movie is harsh, violent and almost pornographic sometimes, but those are just a few scenes. The real moral of this movie, the plot, the idea behind this whole story is the work of a genius. Also, they can make a movie look so good without any SF and the actor's are doing a great job, especially Alex. Also, the set is very strange, yet awesome: you can't place this movie in a certain time period or year. This movie still plays on in my head after 2 years, still let me think about this strange world and I'm still a great fan of Alex and his droogs. Cheers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""What we were after now was the old surprise visit. That was a real kick and good for laughs and lashings of the old ultra         . "" - Alex DeLarge","#1 Best Film of 1971There are many great filmmakers who are unfortunately not alive today. There was Hitchcock, Curtiz, DeMille, and the list goes on and on. Eventually you'll get to Stanley Kubrick, director of such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the , Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and my personal favorite, A Clockwork Orange. Out of all the filmmakers to ever live, I always thought Kubrick was the finest. His meticulous and carefully crafted works of art (his films) are superior to any other filmmaker on a good day (in my opinion). Out of all his incredible achievements, I find the best is 'A Clockwork Orange', the controversial - Best Picture nominee about in youth in our society, well a future society.In futuristic Britian, young Alexander DeLarge (Malcom McDowell) and his droogies enjoy pranks, robbing, izing, , spiked milk and 'a bit of the old ultra '. One day while Alex and his crew (Dim, Georgie, and Lodger) are izing and eventually ing a ""dirty old sumka"" with a lot of cats, Alex's crew decides to turn against him, and leaving him alone at the scene for the cops to come. Young and trouble-making Alex's life gets turned upside down when he goes to prison. In prison he becomes very interested in religion and the and pain Christ went through. Not because of sorrow for Christ, but because of his obsession with inflicting upon people. He day-dreams of being a Roman, whipping Jesus while he carries the cross, and having s with the temple chambermaids. One day, Alex comes across an experimental medical procedure that supposedly cures violent criminals, and decides to take up the offer so he can get out of jail. The rest of the film follows him in the procedure and the consequences, hardships and situations that follow.'A Clockwork Orange' is such a well-made production it almost can't even be considered a film, it should be considered a work of art. Stanley Kubrick beautifully molds this dark, dim and disturbing tale based on Anthony Burgess' novel, and turns it into his own glorious vision. Kubrick achieves utter and absolute perfection in his direction, and he also provides a magnificent screenplay filled to the brim with intriguing almost Shakespeare-ish sort of dialogue in which Alex speaks. The acting is a cut above the rest also. Malcolm McDowell owns the role of Alex DeLarge, and plays him with intensity, passion, great understanding and an almost shocking realism. You don't see Mr. McDowell on the screen, you see his character Alexander DeLarge, a young mischievous monster in the making. The film also stars Patrick Magee, Warren Clarke, Carl Duering, Adrienne Corri, Anthony Sharp, James Marcus, and Michael Bates in a very comedic role as chief guard at Alex's prison. The film garners neat cinematography, awesome set decoration, interesting costumes and a highly inventive and exceptional vision thanks to the brilliant Stanley Kubrick.'A Clockwork Orange' is my favorite Kubrick film, and that is saying a hell of a lot. Others may not agree because it doesn't have the awe of '2001' or the cult following of 'Dr. Strangelove'. I love it to though, because it's so different then his (Kubrick's) other work and that is what makes it so special. It was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s because of it's extreme and , and it had to be cut from it's original version (now restored on DVD today) to receive an 'R' rating it all along deserved. In conclusion, this is an incredible work of art (one of the two only - features to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture) that will be adored by the film buffs and detested by the weak-hearted. I highly recommend it. Grade: AMADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #12",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Viddy well, Stanley Kubrick. Viddy well.","A Clockwork Orange is a haunting and powerful fable told by the unique and foreshadowing eyes of a true creator, Stalney Kubrick.The whole movie feels so exotic and out of this world. The colours, the weird sets and the shiny furnitures, they all create a sense of alienation, but the irony is that this story is really realistic and grounded.We perceive the film through the view of Alex, the protagonist. Alex is a troubled anti-hero. He has fun with the pain of others and is commited to sex and ultra-violence, but soon he falls into a neverending black hole and he faces the true evil of the movie-the ones who want to turn him into something he cannot be.Alex is used as a tool to an experiment which turns scoundrels like him into noble men.We have sen that Alex loves his criminal life and nature, he cannot live without it and when they force him to change and pretend to be a good man, he naturally cannot. And they treat him in the worst way possible. He is like a thing to experiment on and he is spit on and I felt that really nobody eserves such a life, even Alex.The real monters and sinners are the goverment and the men who do these experiments. Kubrick also questions what is considered noble and what not. Alex and his gang go in the same infamous bar with famous singers, the officer inspecting Alex reveals an animalisitc expression when he sees a naked woman, some of the characters just treat Alex with a barbaric way.It is a really thought-provoking film, but the filmmakin aspect-oh lord. The use of music is sensational. Vivaldi and Bethoven are instanlty mxed with horrific, brutal images and the result is fun and memorable. The colours are also fresh and the clothes, the way the rooms are lighted and decorazed gives th film another feel -one of being at a far-away world, but the simularities with ours are so obvious. The different and crazy vocabulary is so fun to listen to. The way the camera moves when the characers walk to halls, the closeups to the Jesus' schalptures, the fast-forward in the sex scene, the slow motion, hte subtle pull back in the first scene...

That Chaplain sticks in my throat,"One problem with this movie is that senseless violence is depicted as glamorous. (This is obviously less of a problem after Pulp Fiction and Sin City.) Speaking for myself, I find this to be only a minor problem.My main problem is different: the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner. The issue is whether something like the Ludovico treatment, if feasible, would be ethical. For those who have not yet seen the movie, the Ludovico treatment is a (fictional) conditioning process, by which a violent criminal comes to associate the sight of violence with strong nausea. The purpose is to make the criminal practically unable to use violence ever again.Presumably, the Prison Chaplain speaks for Burgess and Kubrick when he complains that the Ludovico treatment is unethical because it robs the patient of his free will: the patient avoids violence because he fears nausea, not because he has changed his ethical outlook.What the Chaplain says is well phrased, as can be seen in the ""memorable quotes"" section. It is also very silly. It is silly because it assumes that people who try to avoid nausea have lost their free will.Imagine a criminal who has been to jail and has abandoned crime because he fears going back to jail: does this mean that the threat of jail deprives people of their free will? Imagine also a man who experiences nausea after tasting Bearnaise sauce in a restaurant: this man is unlikely to eat Bearnaise sauce again, but can he sue the restaurant for depriving him of his free will (as opposed to suing for food poisoning)? If the answer to both questions is no, then a man who abandons crime because he fears nausea has not lost his free will, either.On the other hand, if the answer to either question is yes, that means that people lose their free will when they have to suffer the consequences of their actions. So this is what the Chaplain's tirade amounts to: there is no free will if people suffer any consequences from their actions; and therefore there is no free will in the real world. It sounds absurd if put in these words, but this is the only way I can make sense of what the Chaplain says.It might be argued that there is a qualitative difference between fear of prison and nausea: the two emotions activate different brain pathways, for instance. There can be reasonable disagreement on the differences between the Ludovico treatment and prison, and there is plenty of room for debate on this issue. The fact is that the movie does not even begin to address the issue! The Chaplain does not explain why he is opposed to the Ludovico treatment, but not to prison. Nothing in the movie suggests any reason to prefer prison to the Ludovico treatment; if anything, the Ludovico treatment is portrayed as faster and more effective in reducing crime. This brings me back full circle to my starting point: the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner.In spite of all this, I was entertained by the movie: there is an interesting story and stylish cinematography, as one would expect from Kubrick. The violence is unpleasant, but it is not gratuitous: it shows what kind of person the main character is, and what kind of people he hangs around with. But at the end of the movie, what remains in my mind, and sticks in my throat, is the Chaplain's speech. I perceive it as an insult to the intelligence of the audience. Should I be more disturbed by the violence? I don't think so, because the violence is fictional, while the silly ideas that the Chaplain is advocating can do serious damage to an impressionable mind.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Does not do the story justice.,"First of all, let me state that Anthony Burgess' ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most phenomenal books I have had the pleasure of reading. I've known about the film for many years now, and have given it multiple viewings--not even being able to make it all the way through the first few sittings. The main character, Alex, is a completely different person in the film than he is in the book. Burgess' character has a very likable way about him. Though he's committing acts of violence, he manages to win your heart over and you cannot help but side with him throughout. However, in Kubrick's ""masterpiece,"" Alex is an annoying, underdeveloped character that you never feel any emotions for. He's not scary, loving, funny.. he's just, there.I've viewed the film before reading the book, couldn't finish it. After loving the story so much, and knowing the high regards the film gets, I had to watch it again, and once again I didn't like it. So much more could have been done! It drives me crazy that this is rated so highly when to me it seems like a mediocre attempt at reconstructing a real masterpiece. The book itself deserves beyond a 10/10 rating, whereas I hate to even rate the film.Burgess, Kubrick has done you wrong my friend.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
From a Fruit to a Vegetable.,"A Clockwork Orange (1971)Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Anthony Sharp, Warren Clarke, James Marcus, Godfrey Quigley, Michael Bates, Philip Stone, Carl Duering.'A Clockwork Orange' is, without a doubt, one of the strangest films I have ever seen, and will ever see. It is twisted, disturbing, and ultimately haunting. It is a masterpiece that shows us a look inside the mind of an intelligent, yet disturbed youth.The plot is about an older teen named Alex who enjoys listening to Beethoven, skipping school, and hanging out with his friends during the evening in a not too distant future. He is obsessed with sex/rape (""the old in-out"") and ""ultra violence"" so much that he thinks about it almost all the time. During the nights, he and his ""droogs"" either hang out at a milk bar, terrorize bums on the street, or get into brawls. They get into a gang fight, steal a car, break into a writer's house, beat up the writer and rape his wife right in front of his eyes.The next night, Alex accidentally kills a woman inside her home. When he leaves, his friends betray him and leave him for the police. Alex is sent to prison for years because of his crime. In prison, he hears of something that can cure people from their problems. The doctors decide to test it on Alex by flashing images onto a screen, images that Alex is obsessed with. When Alex is released, his former victims and friends plot revenge on him.'A Clockwork Orange' is a thought-provoking piece of film that still delivers after over 30 years. It had a powerful impact on me by the film's finale. Content wise, I don't recommend it to everyone. It is extremely graphic with strong use of sexuality and nudity. If that doesn't bother you then you should see this. It really isn't as disturbing as it sounds.Stanley Kubrick, once again, gives a wonderful direction. I love the way that he directed his movies, almost all of them are great. The soundtrack is very great with Beethoven's Ninth and the film's original score. The composer of the original score, Wendy Carlos, does an excellent job of giving a haunting score.The words to describe Alex De Large are sick, perverted, twisted, and despicable. I'd be surprised if anyone couldn't tell that already, even after the grin he gives to the camera after the opening credits. Alex has a wide imagination, even if his thoughts are somewhat disturbing. Malcolm McDowell plays him masterfully. I really didn't expect the movie to be like this. I expected it to be some sort of Cyber-Thriller, but it turned out to be a powerful experience.This movie was adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess. I admit, I never read the novel, but I really understood the movie. Although it is a Science Fiction movie, it never does have what most others of that genre do: which is lasers, flying objects, and epic battles. This is much different from those, and much more original.'A Clockwork Orange' is one of Kubrick's best films, definitely his most thought provoking. He is one of the greatest directors in the history of film, and has given magnificent movies. I can't decide if I like this or 'Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (quite possibly THE Sci-Fi film). I will never forget the impact that 'A Clockwork Orange' had on me. 5 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I cannot see it enough times,"First of all I just have to admit that this movie has some outdated shocking material. A lot of movies have outdone this movie now in terms of shocking contents like Baise Moi, Visitor Q, Za ginipiggu and Moomin. Even though they are more shocking, they are not good enough movies otherwise in my opinion. They are lacking in many other areas of which A Clockwork Orange shines through like a billion suns on a bright summer morning.This is the kind of movie I can watch again and again and still want to watch yet another time. What appeals to me so much is the use of music, the mildly non-formulaic story, the characters like the loud prison warden, the writer and Mr. Deltoid, and how it all fits together so nicely with such unparalleled pacing.There is something about this movie that moves me, that really evokes feelings inside me that no other movie have come close to give me. It makes me happy to watch, and is to me the very best feel-good movie I have seen so far in my life. There are of course minor things in this movie I find rather unnerving, like the opening sequence with the Korova milk bar and the moving camera that a bit awkward, and the scene with the lodger, but apart from those, there really is nothing I can think of that makes this movie feel bad.The use of music like ""The thieving magpie"", ""Pomp and circumstances"" and Beethoven's symphonies is what makes this movie sound so spectacular as can be. Luckily it also avoids the ""epic"" movies like LOTR and Eragon's use of clichéd touchy-feely string music in key moments, but that is not to say it does not have its touchy-feely music in there. Which brings me onto the excellent use of pacing, that really makes the use of such music in this movie so great, and because it is only used once, it is totally acceptable and fits in really well. No need for repetition, it gets its point across and that is all that it needs to.To sum it up: I can at the present moment not imagine a more perfect movie for me to watch.10/10 on IMDb's rating system is my final verdict.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"
