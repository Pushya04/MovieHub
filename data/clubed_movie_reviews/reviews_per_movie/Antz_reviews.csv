"Very underrated movie, this is one of Dreamworks' best","Antz is an animated movie that wasn't appreciated upon its initial release. After the family friendly movie Toy Story, I feel like people weren't ready for something a little bit darker, and more intense. This movie has death (and a lot of it at that), it has violence, it has gore, it has humor, it has swearing, and it has alcohol in it... pretty epic huh (granted, just being edgy doesn't necessarily equal good). The movie Antz which actually came out before A Bug's Life by about a month takes the role of what ants do a lot more seriously and better captures an ant like atmosphere. The movie A Bug's Life really doesn't seem to understand what ants do or how their colonies work, but the movie Antz does it all. There are the miners, the warriors, the drones (the ones with wings) the queen and others. The voice acting itself is also pretty good and Woody Allen fits the role of Z perfectly. The animation was also pretty advanced for its time, because it did many things that were hard for that time: Water, large amounts of moving objects, realistic face movement, realistic body movement, lighting, and many others.The nice thing about this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be a kids movie. Ants swear in it (the word b****in is used once) and as mentioned there is a lot of violence. Like a very intense scene where the ants are trying to fight a termite colony and the ants are getting attacked by acid, are getting decapitated, and dying in other various barbaric ways. The thing is that this movie doesn't cover up death. When someone dies, the movie won't hide it.The other cool thing in Antz is that the rest of the insects in the movie are as hideous and monstrous as they should be. Praying Mantis? It is infinitely larger than an Ant. Wasps? Like giants. It gives this overwhelming sense that Z is not only small in the ant world but also small in the insect world as well. There is nothing that can't kill him (even the princess could if she wanted).Honestly this movie was really good, it has a good story, it has good characters, it is realistic, and has nice action. One of Dreamkworks' best.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"so lifelike, so didactic","It's probably the first time Woody Allen is so much like himself when he isn't at all. Ant Z, a neurotic, fatalistic, depressive, sorry ant with a record low level of self-esteem transforms into a (part-time) content, revolutionary hero of his utterly totalitarian and fascistic colony ever imaginable. Apart from the incredibly precise animation and ""logical"" fantasy, one feels a bit distracted with the subliminal messages the picture tries to impose. While it would be easy to reduce the moral to the frequently recited motto: ""think for yourself once!"", there are too many of them to ignore. This definitely is not a kid's flick, it is meant for and appreciated by adults, with many philosophical, psychological and social references and conflicts. One big ""bravo!"" to Dreamworks. I think they have achieved the point where adults can actually enjoy animation movies while believing the whole stuff. These insects are surely going to bite some Disney bugs.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Antz isn't as perfect and smooth as a Disney film. Great!,"I'm probably a weird guy, but I really appreciate a good animated movie even though I'm no longer a kid (I'm 26 years old). What I liked about this one is the great animation, the nice story, the humor...I haven't seen A Bug's Life yet, which makes it impossible for me to compare both of course, but I really liked the style used in Antz. Usually a Disney production gives me the feeling I'm watching a movie which was intended for kids only (although A Bug's Life was created by the Pixar studio's, which gives me a bit of hope), while Dreamworks understood that adults too can appreciate this kind of movies, if only they take care of the style and the story. Most of Disney's animated movies are just too smooth, too perfect for me, and to be honest the songs almost make me sick.The style in Antz is much grittier. It isn't as perfect and smooth as a Disney production and the message is a lot stronger. The film is probably exciting for little children, thanks to the humor, fantastic images and action, but the underlying subtext and social commentary on humans make this movie different from Disney's moralizing films. However, the different message isn't the only difference between Disney and Dreamworks. I don't think Disney ever risked to use very well known scenes from other movies in their own films. In Antz you can find some excellent scenes which refer to movies like Metropolis, Starship Troopers,...Some people have some critics on this movie because it doesn't show how a real anthill is organized, how strong ants really are, that ants don't look for a partner, ... Let me tell this to these people: I respect you're way of thinking but I think you should have watched a documentary instead of an animated movie. I sure hope you understand there is still a big difference between a documentary, based on scientific research, meant to teach people and a movie like Antz, who's only purpose is to entertain people. Personally I liked the movie for what it was and I give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watch this and enjoy it. Kids optional.,"The trouble with making a children's film has always been to keep the kids happy but avoid making Mum and Dad fall asleep. Disney have always stuck to a solid ""one cute song for every acidic aside"" ratio which meant that the over-15's got Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy doing a stripped down routine whilst the 10 year olds got pretty pictures, cute animals and plenty of slapstick. This is what has made the House of Mouse the dominant toon makers but their mastery is under attack from Dreamworks SKG. While Walt & Co. delivered Mulan, Mr. Spielberg gave us Prince of Egypt and though Disney won, narrowly, the next round isn't going to be so easy.Antz is brilliant. Don't let anybody tell you differently. We've got stunning visuals, great jokes, some brilliant scenes and some very likeable characters. What we have is a very smart film. Maybe too smart. The jokes are funny if you're old enough to get them. The sight of a neurotic ant lying on a therapist's leaf complaining about his anxious childhood is hilarious. Especially when the biggest neurotic in the world, Woody Allen, is delivering the lines. His timing, throughout the entire film, is exquisite and the script takes advantage of this at every opportunity i.e.:Mandible: I like an ant that laughs in the face of death.Z: Actually I stand behind Death and make belittling comments at its back.It reads like one of Woody's early, funny films (sorry, but I couldn't resist it) and the rest of the cast are good too but that's because the script takes advantage of their history. Weaver acts like Stallone, Cutter acts like Walken and Barbatus acts like Glover. Anybody that's seen one of their films instantly recognises the voice behind the ant because of how they speak and act. They also bypass the sing-along route and insert a grisly battle sequence similar to Starship Troopers. The adults in the audience will love it. Children may be a little underwhelmed.How many kids have seen an Allen, Stallone or Walken film? Not many I expect. How many kids have seen Troopers or Metropolis, (which is a big inspiration for the visuals)? Very few. There are a lot of jokes they just won't get. They may enjoy the pretty pictures but there's a distinct lack of cuddly animals, obvious slapstick or happy tunes. Boredom may set in and there may be a few cries during the battle sequence so be ready. Another downside is a slightly weak villain. Hackman does well with what he has but it's not much and truly cool bad guys like James Woods' Hades run circles round him.Despite that Antz is a blast. As funny and enjoyable for adults as a child-orientated flick could be. It's not the best toon but it's a definite step forward. Maybe Disney have finally met their match.",,Anonymous,Animation
Antz (Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Colony),"I watched this for the first time with my sister as part of our Dreamworks Movie Marathon. Though not even remotely comparable to Pixar's A Bug's Life in terms of quality, Antz is an enjoyable overall experience. The main character was a bit annoying, but at least he was different than I expected. His romantic counterpart was very intolerable, and this resulted in an extremely forced romance between two characters who had no reason to fall in love.That all being said, the movie had teeth, and it was unafraid to kill off characters left and right. The main theme of non-conformity really beat you over the head throughout the film, and could have been a bit more subtle. This basic plot leads me to believe this film is directed at kids, but the innuendo and adult-jokes make me think otherwise. Not sure if it's a good kids movie since I'm not a kid anymore, but Antz is a pretty good film with some problems here and there.I'll be reviewing every Dreamworks film after my sister and I watch it, so Antz is a good start.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Dreamworks answer to 'A Bug's Life',"Released 1 year after Disney/Pixar's 'A Bugs Life' and still during the early years of the computer generated genre, Dreamworks released their second all CGI cartoon 'ANTZ' and despite the glaring resemblances between the 2 movies; all it not as it appears.ANTZ still stands alone as the more adult movie in the genre, far more complexity in the character's emotions and a far more sinister plot evolution separate this from rest. OK movies like 'Shrek', 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story' have adult undertones beneath the humour, but ANTZ doesn't rely on such subtlety.PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM OF EITHER STYLE!We follow the struggle of 'Z' (Woody Allen) as he tries to come to terms with his life as a worker, his neurosis, his love for Princess Bala and dream of something better. Allen is excellently supported by an all star cast, including Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, etc, and we are treated to a visually impressive rendition of a heart warming story about life as an ANT.This movie can still be enjoyed as a family film, but much of it will be lost on younger kids.In Summary ANTZ is a fine film, but in truth it is difficult to compare with others in the genre, and for that; i salute it!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great movie!,This is one of the movies I used to watch over and over again as a kid and I still love it even now. The animation was great for the day and the writing is great with many humorous parts and a great storyline. This movie is also backed by an all star cast which you don't really see too often in an animated movie.This movie is about an ant named Zee who is a part of an ant colony when he figures out a terrible secret lead by the general of the ant colony that not even the queen knows about.This really is a perfect film for all ages. It has a great cast great writing and it makes it a very enjoyable movie. If you have kids or are just a fan of a good animated movie this one is for you.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Top class intelligent entertainment,"I loved this story. I thought is was a very intelligently entertaining movie:- a good combination of interesting ideas mixed with great visuals and broad comedy.All the the voice casting was top notch; especially Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Dan Aykroyd, and of course Woody Allen. There was also great version of Neil Finn singing ""I Can See Clearly Now""; and the visual design and music score was breath-taking and dynamic. Plus the storyline is more gritty with a darker undercurrent, and would appeal to a more sophisticated audience, which it is good to have. I'm not saying that cute fun stories aren't OK too. In fact IMHO the wider the spectrum of stories we can get the better we'll all be.I personally think this is slightly ahead of the equally brilliant A BUG'S LIFE; even though both are really top class storytelling. This one wins by about half a feeler.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alienation of a member from his society may be funny...,"It is a cartoon meaning two things: First it shows us a typical cartoon. A cartoon of children..Main character Faces with some fun and this make audience have some fun. However, the cartoon has another face. As can be seen in the book of George Orwell called 1984, there can be a guy distinguished, alienated himself from the society even though the society was established with very strong ties. It is interesting that, there can be another member like himself and they find each other by ignoring some strict rules. As we saw it in 1984, same thing occurs in this cartoon. Being bored of her life, Princess Bala joins to workers entertainment. And the `extreme` life of the couples gets start. As the time passes, strict rules become useless and some liberal ideas spread through the society. Moreover, we see some lovers from different classes. These are some examples of the destruction of a totalitarian society in the cartoon. And we see many fascist rulers like General who wants to create a pure colony in our world. This cartoon is a very good example of this idea. As in the real world this idea collapses at the end. Finally i can add that there is a lot to learn how to make all the members enough satisfied. May be there is no way...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who thought animating films for adults was a good idea?,"_Antz_ is the latest in a misbegotten trend of trying to graft adult content onto animated family films.  Blame _The Lion King_ (and guiding hand for both films, Jeffrey Katzenberg) for doing it well and reaping the financial rewards, but successors reaching for the same brass ring (both within Disney -- _Hunchback_, e.g. -- and without) go too far.  Not only is the language in _Antz_ a tad inappropriate (do you really want to explain ""erotic fantasy"" to your five-year-old?), the use of Woody Allen as the voice of the hero along with battle and flood imagery reminiscent of other DreamWorks films like _Saving Private Ryan_ and _Deep Impact_ only reinforces the sense that _Antz_ is aspiring to be something perverse:  a gritty, neurotic, philosophical disaster movie for the whole family.But the worst offense of all is that the film is boring.  The script is as trite as they come, moving as it does from one movie cliche to the next without stopping for real character development.  The dialogue is surprisingly witless and plodding, with every joke telegraphed well in advance.  The songs -- admittedly a frequent bane of Disney films as well -- are of even less interest here as they are ""standards"" tossed in for no apparent reason.  And the film is visually dull as well -- all dark and dingy in the ant colony where most of the action takes place, but hardly more beautiful in the great outdoors._Antz_ may represent another leap forward in the art of computer animation, but I found the short trailer I saw for _A Bug's Life_ to contain much more life, color, whimsy and invention than the entirety of this disappointing affair.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Yes, for kids.","You know, there was a time in which we didn't candy coat stories for children. The Evil Queen in Snow White, for one, was forced to wear red-hot slippers and dance to her death. Even in older Disney films like ""Bambi"", the serious issue of death is broached.Now, no one dies. It's too serious.Horsehocky.One of the best moments I had watching ""Antz"" in a theater was listening to a mother explain why Barbatus died. Guess what? Death is a natural part of life -- and to refute it exists is plain wrong. Or, as in the recent Disney flick ""Hercules"", Hades, the God of Death is portrayed as evil. (What, are people supposed to be immortal?)While not appropriate for 4 year olds, I wouldn't think twice about showing it to an 8 year old. Why must movies be dumbed down -- PG means parental GUIDANCE. Any movie that forces you to talk to your kids after a movie is a good one. Don't treat your kids like little morons.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A highly anticipated...flop,"I had entered the theater with an open mind upon the opening of DreamWorks' initial animated feature, ""Antz"".  Finally, I felt that there would be a perfect film for children.  However, before the film was over, I was in a state of wonder how a film for children could be so inappropriate.  Now, before you get ""antzy"" (sorry!), I'd like to note the entire toy collection of ""Antz"" figurines, clothing, action figures, and the like aimed at children under 7.  In addition, the commercials for the film (which showed a festive dance and bright picnic scenery) were continually aired during young children's programs such as cartoons on FOX, NBC, ABC, etc. where only an imbecile wouldn't know that kids were watching.  So naturally, any concerned parent would be skeptical over an MPAA rating of PG when the merchandise was aimed at a G audience.The violence is quite appalling and the language pushes the PG rating.  I don't disapprove of animated movies for adults (think Japanese anime), but when films can literally claim bloody murder and receive a PG rating, I find it completely and absolutely horrifying.  When will film studios learn that a completely entertaining film can be created without profanity?  Within every scene, the absolutely vulgar and horrific cast screams out a four letter word.  Other family movies with PG ratings can produce quality work without uttering such pointless drivel such as ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Hook"", and ""Matilda"".  Compared to these traditional family films, ""Antz"" hardly measures up.  And this barely touches upon the movie's punctured plot.I was disappointed that such a promising company as DreamWorks would stoop so low to collect the final dollar.  It's the parents which fork out the money for the film, most of which ADORE the violence and vulgarity...the perfect target.  Where DreamWorks may have produced quality family fare, they spit out another traditional movie flop without the heart and warmth needed to be entertaining for the ENTIRE family.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A straightforward kid's movie? It ain'tz necessarily so...,"Okay, so it's not War and Peace, but this film is about as dark and meaningful as you could want a big-budget comedy animation to be. The computer animation itself never ceases to be awe-inspiring and more than compensates for the plot holes - I personally did like the style of the characters themselves, although others have disagreed. The casting is perfect, and Woody Allen as Z-4195 the neurotic worker ant complete with impeccable one-liners is at times hilarious. Although the plot falls into predictability, the communist metaphors combined with the basic boy-meets-girl-above-his-station story make this highly enjoyable, and all you could want as a 3D animation suitable for adults. A strong opening blow in the Disney-Dreamworks rivalry swordfight.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation, nice story, but I'm not sure if this was meant for the kids","I just watched Antz and I have to say that over all I did enjoy it. I was looking forward to seeing this next animated flick that was on my list of ""must-see's"", it's one of those movies I always meant to get around too, but never did. When I saw that my friend had it, she was happy to lend it to me, and I couldn't wait to watch it. We have a great cast, including the coolest actor ever: Christopher Walken! Gosh, I could never say that enough.Antz is about a worker ant, Z, who has never had the chance to prove himself any more than an average working ant. When he meets Princess Bala, that all changes and he begs his soldier friend to trade places with him so he can see the princess again. But he gets caught in war and is the only survivor by major coincidences, when the royal family finds out that he met the princess before, they want to kill him, but he takes the princess out to find ""insectopia"" as his hostage for survival. But they must go back to stop the general from drowning the colony to build a new one.The only thing that disturbed me was there was a little bit of language that seemed just a little too much for kids who would be under the age of 8 or 9, not to mention the violence is a little mild, so I do warn parents that the PG rating isn't for nothing. But I thought while this isn't my new favorite animation movie by Dreamworks, it's still a good one.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Debugging Antz,"Part of the fun of the movie Antz is that on works on many different levels and as several different stories. Children might enjoy it as simply a cute animated film (although the aftermath of the battle between the ants vs. the termites earned Antz a PG rating). At another level, Antz is the old girl-meet-boy from the wrong side of the tracks story). The film is also part adventure film with political intrigue and action. At yet another level, the film is an interesting political parable complete with sophisticated humor and witty dialogue.Antz is about Ant Z, a neurotic worker ant in a colony of millions of ants. The movie opens with Ant Z lying on the psychiatrist's couch asking questions about the meaning of life, and the needs of the individual as opposed to the society as a whole. Fittingly, the voice, neuroses, and mannerisms of Ant Z are provided by Woody Allen. Sharon Stone provides the voice of Princess Bala, daughter of the queen of the ants. Princess Bala meets Z when she goes to a working-class bar. There is a cute dance sequence here complete with imitations of John Travolta and Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction.
 
The one part of the movie that could use some debugging is the political parable. There are some references to the class system that could have been written by Karl Marx. There are other times when Ant Z rallies the troops around the themes of individualism and autonomy. In short, the film is a bit unfocused in terms of its central theme, and as a result, the political parable is the least satisfying of the elements.If we don't take this part too seriously, we can still enjoy the film. Additional voices are provided by Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Danny Glover, and Jennifer Lopez (too name a few). The computer-generated animation is excellent. The dialogue is witty and well-written with lots of tongue-in-cheek references to contemporary culture. For example, when Ant Z is in trouble, a chorus of Ants starts singing ""all we are saying, is give Z a chance."" All in all, not a bad summary evaluation for the film as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Witty and charming... a must-see!,"Antz is rock-solid entertainment, and while it isn't as funny as Bug's Life, it has a great social message that Bug's Life lacks. I thoroughly recommend this movie, and the only criticism I have is that there are some scenes that young children might find frightening, like the fight between the ants and the big green bugs. The visuals are a delight, as well as the tightly-structured script.The story, while simple, is well-told, and is sensibly revolved around the life of Z, brilliantly voiced by Woody Allen. Sharon Stone was suitably feisty as Princess Bala, and Sylvester Stallone was a huge surprise as Weaver. Christopher Walken was also good, but it's the villain who steals the show, like Bug's Life. Gene Hackman's General was deliciously sinister, and quite complex, very similar to Kevin Spacey in Bug's Life(Hopper is SLIGHTLY better). All in all, a witty and charming film, that is recommended. 9/10. Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Big starpower, Big disappointment","I was impressed with all the big names that were in this film and figured that it just HAD to be at least marginally entertaining.  And I was right--it was sometimes marginally entertaining.  I just couldn't help thinking that this could have been a much better film by doing one of two things: making this completely a childrens' movie, or making it a ""grownup"" movie.  As it is, Antz wobbles back and forth and just doesn't do either job very well.The animation just wasn't consistently good.  Sometimes the screen was filled with beautiful eye candy, and other times it was just a plain screen with an unmoving, undetailed head of an ant that looked like something from an old video game on my old computer.The supposedly deep underlying social messages just didn't work for me.  I wasn't inspired by the emotional music and all the references to other movies just seemed to fall flat.  The film's big adventures didn't seem all that adventuresome or exciting.If they wanted to make a dark comedy for adults, they marketed the film wrong, and definitely didn't put in very much dark comedy (although the potential was definitely there).  If they wanted to make a kids' movie that adults would enjoy, they somehow missed that mark as well...

Animated Film That Will Entertain Adults,"From what I have read, DreamWorks got the idea of an insect animation film from Disney, rushed to market before the Disney version was released, and that they think this will enable them to compete against Disney in the animated film market?  I think some reevaluation is in order.ANTZ is not bad, far from it.  The animation is very well done (to this untrained, unschooled eye) and the voices well-acted (and maybe Woody wasn't so much acting as being Woody).  The feel-good plot was well......very Disney.  Certainly worth the price of a rental.  And I mean this for adults.

Teaching collectivism and individualism to kids,"In an ant colony in Central Park, a neurotic ant Z-4195 (voiced by Woody Allen, which goes without saying is perfect casting), or ""Z"" for short, attempts to steal the heart of Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) while also freeing himself from an oppressive culture. Looking beneath surface, this film can be seen as an interesting and safe take on collectivism-versus-individualism. Some of the ants' faces share similarities to the actors who voiced them.

Good Fun,"Antz (1998)*** (out of 4)Z (Woody Allen) is an ant that questions just about everything but after a chance meeting with the Princess he decides to try and meet her again, which gets the two of them outside their colony where they learn that the General (Gene Hackman) has some bad plans.ANTZ isn't any sort of masterpiece but if you're a fan of Woody Allen then you'll certainly enjoy seeing his type of humor in a kids movie. In fact, the movie is a tad bit more adult in nature, which took me by surprise and especially with some of the mild cussing that can be heard in it.For the most part this is a mildly amusing film that manages to get a great number of vocal talent. Not only do we get Allen and Hackman but there's also Dan Aykroyd, Sharon Stone, Danny Glover, Anne Bankroft, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez and more. All of them are good in their roles but I think the one major flaw of the film is that none of the ants really look their own. I guess part of the joke was having the worker ants and the war ants looking alike. I think this just took away from the film and it would have been better if they had their own look.

"For a starter, it is actually pretty good.","We all know the drill about DreamWorks' Antz being compared to Pixars A Bug's Life. I think they both succeeded in their own ways. While A Bug's Life was more kid oriented, Antz offered much more adult material and cleverness.Due to their similarities, I won't say that much about it, but briefly highlight what I think is good about Antz.Antz has a voice cast of great actors, who add so much to the characters. Adults who have seen Woody Allen, Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken will recognize the immediately. It can be distracting at times, but it is admirable that Dreamworks' first feature managed such a great cast.The different insects depicted in Antz are much more realistically rendered, given the fact that insects are different sizes.It has a battle scene which is memorable and dark. Maybe scary to the youngest kids, but great.The conflict of our main character Z is superior to the conflict in A Bug's Life. Z is a neurotic ant who doesn't feel special given the fact that every ant in the colony from birth is placed either as a soldier or a worker. Z wants something different, but the general ant is against all sorts of ""weakness"" and plots a cleansing of the weak ants and take over the colony.While it is good, the villainous general could have been more threatening and memorable, but it is a minor thing.Antz may lack the brightness and colours of A Bug's Life and could perhaps use a little more laughs, but it surely is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An enjoyable film, but suffers in Disney's shadow","Antz, on it's own, would have been a good movie, if you enjoy Woody Allen's neurotic characters and self-depreciating one-liners.

I don't know how these movies spontaneously pop up -- like one year we get a pair of asteroid movies, the next, a pair of animated ant movies -- but ""Antz"" is worth seeing once.

"The 'Ant' is for 'Anti-authoritarian,' but the 'Z' is for 'Zippy'","History will regard it as the film that famously butted mandibles with Disney's A Bug's Life for monopoly over the anthropomorphized bug market in 1998. And yes, Antz is fundamentally a product of its time - if not for its hip, 90s misspelling, then for the reason that no one would ever let Woody Allen within a hundred miles of a kids film again. Still, he's able to meld his neurotic, intellectual schlub persona well into this clever little tale. Antz may not be as heartwarming or beautiful as many of the decade's classics, but, appropriate for a film championing the snarky underdog, it's still easily fun and provocative enough to entertain and stand out, even against its insectoid competition.Fittingly for a film sparring with Disney, Antz sneaks in subversive themes of individualism and Marxist anti-authoritarian revolt into a children's animation. But this script is far too snappy to ever get bogged down in misguided dogmatism, pumping out sly gag after gag to keep parents and kids alike engaged (if ""the war on termites"" isn't enough to win you over, try Dan Aykroyd's wasp's drolly pontificating on ""Eurotrash""). Directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson churn out a hugely fun adventure romp, which bustles along at a perfectly bouncy pace, pulling thunderous momentum from Harry Gregson-Williams' tremendous score. The deceptively detailed animation still holds up (check out how much Colonel Cutter's gaunt facial curvature looks like Christopher Walken), especially when playing with size perspective in the world above ground, turning a ride on the underside of a human's shoe into the most blood- curdling roller-coaster imaginable.Still, if the high percentage of Woody Allen jokes wasn't already enough to tip the scales in favour of a slightly older audience (""I have something against drinking from the anus of another creature""), the intense content is sure to set off all but the hardiest young viewers. Not only do we watch Sylvester Stallone's cocky worker ant get beaten in an interrogation sequence - there's also the nightmarish termite massacre will. A flurry of stabbing and decapitation against the acid-spewing, behemoth enemies, it's a magnificent sci-fi battle for adults, but easily one of the most horrifying sequences ever to make its way into a kids movie.Antz also marks one of the first animated features to play off celebrity voice casting, which unquestionably works in its favour. Apart from quality comedic work from Allen and Stallone playing off their established personas with gleeful aplomb, having a supporting cast chock full of actors like Jennifer Lopez, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd and Christopher Walken helps lend texture to otherwise largely thankless secondary roles. Gene Hackman's ferocious growl makes for a perfect adversary as disturbingly militaristic Mandible, and Sharon Stone's effete drawl butts heads perfectly with Allen's neurotic bluster, keeping their road trip pseudo-romance entertaining throughout.Even if only regarded as A Bug's Life's sparky, snarky cousin, Antz is uniquely daring enough children's fare to stand the test of time. The humour still bristles, the adventure whips along, and there are enough sentimental grace notes amongst the film's self-assured, intellectual snark to ensure that adults and (slightly older) kids are enjoyably engaged throughout. And hey - how long have you been yearning for your average flick to contain the phrase ""Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor?"" Yeah, I thought so.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Really My Type of Film.,"Antz looked like quite an interesting premise, I was absolutely intrigued to see it. Unfortunately, I was bored stiff during this imaginative but near-unwatchable film.The action hones straight in on Z-4195 (Woody Allen), a worker ant living a blue-collar existence among a colony of millions, who is none too happy with his lot in life. Possible escape comes in the form of the lovely Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), with whom he becomes smitten after an impromptu dance at a bar, only for a string of mishaps to occur in his attempts to impress her: ""Z"" becomes a war hero, a revolutionary, and finally kidnaps Bala, stranding the pair in the outside world. Meanwhile, it becomes increasingly clear that Bala's fianc, General Mandible (Gene Hackman), is one untrustworthy ant.The story is original, but the idea of computer-generated war ants is used poorly. The actors are a major upside to Antz, Sylvester Stallone who plays `Z's war buddy is excellent for a change, and Woody Allen is amusingly choice as `Z.' The characters are plenty likeable and the direction is great, but Antz drags on for many large drinks of coke, and the story soon begins to lose track of where its going.Antz isn't all that terrible, I guess it isn't my type of film. For slightly more impressive computer-generated work, check out the similar A Bug's Life.I rate Antz 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A bit heavy on message and somewhat light on entertainment value,"I can't say for sure how many times I've seen this film... and perhaps ""seen"" is the wrong term. I watched it a few times, and from then on, it became kind of ""background noise"". One belonging in a select group consisting of movies that I kinda-sorta like... but I cannot put upon myself to sit through all of, so I simply put it on to listen to while I do other things... and occasionally glance at. Some of these films I've seen too many times, some I just only really like scenes of... not sure which one this is. Possibly both. Anyway, having had it on as background noise for so long, I, again, couldn't fully agree with the idea of watching it. Not truly watching it. Not sitting down and concentrating on it. Still, I gathered enough to comment on the film as a whole. Something I realized was that the basic plot and the way it develops never truly stuck with me... something unusual for the background noise movies. Usually, that is only the case with movies I've watched once or twice and decided was just too bad to give one more chance... even as background noise. And even then, it's a seldom occurrence. But it's the case with this one. I simply can't recall it from one ""viewing"" to another. Something that truly surprised me upon this time(since I have far more politically and socially aware since the last time I watched it) was the message and how much of the film it really takes up. And I also kind of noticed... this is not a pleasant film. This is not for children. I kid you not, I can think of teenagers who would be frightened by the ideas put forth by this movie(mind you, rather ignorant and easily affected teenagers, but still). This is a movie that very strongly advertises individualism and opposes totalitarianism... views that I can only agree with this films opinion on, but here, they just seem painfully heavy-handedly presented here. Not much room for free thought(ironic, since that is the very thing the film advocates) about the subject. The plot is fair. The acting is nice, and the actors all play characters reminiscent of what they often, if not usually, play... which makes for some entertainment for those of us old enough to know them. Again, this is really not a family/children's film. The humor is decent enough... however, half of it is for those too young to see it, the other half is for those of us who are old enough to know everything it tells us and who will most likely find it too simple. The animation is dated, and has been pretty much(at the very least) since the film came out. The soundtrack is fair, with a few decent tunes. Doris Day performs the credits song, one so insipid and daft and yet annoyingly catchy, you find yourself humming it and being irritated at the discovery. All in all, there's just not anything to watch this film for... except for the admittedly good references to other frequent roles of the cast. I recommend this to big fans of the actors and virtually no one else. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Woody Allen as an ant,"Z (Woody Allen) is a neurotic little worker ant. He doesn't like the collective and wants to be an individual. Princess Bala sneaks out to the workers' bar and meets Z.

He's touted as a war hero. When his true identity is revealed, he tackles Bala and they fall out of the anthill. He intends on going to the legendary Insectopia and Bala has no choice but to follow him. Meanwhile, word spreads that Z was actually a worker and the workers revolt. General Mandible turns the mob to his advantage.Woody Allen is an ant. Of course, he's neurotic but he's also heroic in his individuality. They probably missed an opportunity to make Z look like the real Woody. This works a little better for the adults who see the comedy coming from Woody.

An extremely underrated delight,"I had little to no expectations for this film, and man will I say that I was absolutely delighted. Antz is a very amusing satire that holds well both as a animated adventure and a Woody Allen flick. The film is endlessly hilarious, with tons of funny dialogue, quotable lines, and truly heartfelt moments. It's almost ironic that a film with such small creatures can be so massively entertaining, but Antz is incredibly easy to watch, and one that keeps you at the edge of your seat waiting to find what is next. It's been over 20 years since the films release, but it's still a relevant satire for today, and an animated style and honesty that I wish were still portrayed in more animated films today. The film can be crass when it wants to, with plenty of swears and some adult humor that would not be in the film were it to be released today, but is part of what it makes it so grand. Antz is a surprisingly honest, refreshing animated comedy that is truly unique, even with its comparisons to bugs life. It's humor may not always land, but it does so more than not, and when it does it truly brings its all- without ever seeming like too much. It's a touching tale, that is equally romantic as it is inspiring and heartfelt, and may just earn a place as one of my favorite animated comedies ever.

"A defense case for individualism and the American way of life, this film appeared before its time and ended up not enjoying great success.","This was DreamWorks' first digitally animated production, but despite that, it didn't leave us with an interesting legacy and almost no one remembers it. Its release came shortly after the success of Pixar's ""Toy Story,"" and was soon forgotten when they released ""A Bug's Life,"" a less adult, family-friendly film that in many ways is a direct competitor. After a few years, everything was forgotten with the release of ""Shrek"", which consolidated DreamWorks as one of the great animation studios of our time. So it was a film that came out at the wrong time and could have had more impact later.The script introduces us to Z, a worker ant who feels dissatisfied with his life in an anthill where there seems to be a Chinese-style communist regime: the will and value of each one are nullified to the detriment of the collective interest, of what each person can do for the State. This greatly bothers Z, who yearns for American individualism and the opportunity to decide his life without care for the needs of his community. In the midst of all this, he falls in love with Princess Bala in a typical romance condemned by social differences and becomes an unlikely war hero after he survives a war by doing the only thing he knew how to do: hide. Of course, there is a great villain: the general of the ant army, eager to transform the kingdom into a fascist military dictatorship, dethroning the monarchy and taking power for himself.The way I summarized the plot seems bizarre, but it's exactly how I see it: using ants and an anthill as the setting, the film basically makes a thesis in defense of American individualist capitalism, severely condemning both fascism and dictatorships as well as far-left political models. The way in which the queen and princess become helpless hostages can also be seen as a mild criticism of European monarchies, where sovereigns are deprived of the powers they would be entitled to use in other circumstances. The hero is an individualist eager to decide his destiny for himself, and who does not seem at all concerned with the society in which he lives, to the point of wanting to leave for another utopian place, the ""land of milk and honey"" that immigrants usually wish to find. Basically, it is a film with strong sociopolitical criticism and defense of the American way of life.With a powerful cast of actors who lent their voices to the various characters, it is a work of great technical refinement on the most varied levels. Woody Allen provides Z's voice in an impeccable way, giving him good modulation and personality, and Sharon Stone gives Bala a sensual and dense voice, but one that doesn't seem malicious. Sylvester Stallone also does a very interesting job, but Christopher Walken and Gene Hackman deserve special praise for the way they voiced their two characters. In the meantime, we will still be able to hear excellent contributions from Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover and Jenifer Lopez. The soundtrack is deeply beautiful and gives the film the ideal atmosphere at every moment. As for the visuals, there's nothing to complain about: it's a DreamWorks film, they're one of the best when it comes to computer animation, and they didn't leave their credits in other people's hands.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Woody Allen is an Ant...in an Oppressive Colony,"In 1998, the second feature length computer animated film was released entitled Antz. Created by the then brand new studio Dreamworks, the movie was already met with controversy when the media perceived it to be a ripoff of Pixar's second feature film A Bug's Life, which came out a month later. Obvious comparisons and bad timing aside, the film nonetheless went on to perform fairly well financially and earned strong critical reviews. As for the film on its own, while it does tend to be thought of as the only notable animated film to star Woody Allen, it is surprisingly admirable in its concept and execution.The film follows an anxious worker ant named Z, who falls in love with the princess of his colony. Upon trying to find a new world beyond the colony, Z must save them from the treacherous scheming of officer General Mandible, who threatens to wipe out the entire worker population. As the film's story tackles themes of individuality, the plotline of Z searching for Insectopia feels like a stronger goal in lieu of Z yearning for a world outside of what he's seen his whole life. By establishing the colony as a separation between workers who mine the area and soldiers who fight to protect their home, the film properly allows the colony to prosper and allow us to all sympathize with the different ants, regardless of their status. On top of delivering some witty mature humor, it also isn't afraid to tone itself up to show the dangers of going outside the world of your own, including a blatant hint at Marxism where the worker ants question their line of following orders. Although the film's story might take a while to get going, its worldbuilding and surprisingly timeless themes make it work altogether.Now as this film was made to allow Woody Allen to play the lead, it makes sense that this would end up with an all star cast. Many other players include Sharon Stone as Princess Bala, Gene Hackman as General Mandible, Sylvester Stallone as Z's soldier friend Corporal Weaver, Jennifer Lopez as Weaver's crush Azteca, Christopher Walken as Mandible's patient Colonel Cutter, Danny Glover as Staff Sergeant Barbartus, etc. Admittedly, each player fits their roles so well that it becomes hard to see the characters on screen as actual characters so much as the actors playing them. It's such a double edged sword that hearing Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin play two ""waspy"" wasps feels more at place in an SNL skit. That being said, the characters are still likeable enough to root for on the journey, and as shocking as it may sound, Woody Allen does mostly carry the film with his anxious wit and petty sardonicism in Z. Whether you can see the characters as themselves or only the actors, at least there is some charm to their performances that makes them fun to watch.Despite this film being made during the infancy of computer animation, the production crew put together a well crafted albeit gritty looking world. In a bizarre way, the dated rendering makes this film come to life by depicting a not so glossy approach to what is ultimately set primarily underground, complete with some grandiose environments, highly elaborate effects and solid coarse texturing. On top of a lot of detail put into each distinctive character, the character animation is well acted and full of life as we see each ant, let alone distinct insects, perform to their highest duty. By successfully capturing the point of view of creepy crawlies, the filmmakers managed to make even the most ordinary small elements unique and breathtaking. Much of this grandiosity is accompanied by composers Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, who would go on to become long time musical veterans at Dreamworks in the coming years. In making the most out of the technical limitations, Dreamworks and PDI successfully presented the infinite possibilities with a then brand new medium.Whether Antz was truly made to steal the thunder away from Pixar's second feature, it at least holds up well on its own. It may come with slow momentum and obvious casting choices, but its grandiose worldbuilding, biting humor and surprisingly dark subject matter make it a delightful if not perfect picture. As this film was made when computer animation was still fresh to the public, perhaps its reputation should be linked with how it helped kickstart a brand new artform to cinema instead of direct comparisons to another bug movie. It's amazing how the house that Shrek built all started with some wise cracking insects.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What the ....?,"What was this movie trying to be? It has a serious social/political subtext, but its too simplistic and naive of a message to support the whole movie as entertainment for adults. It's got action and goofiness for the kids, but it's a bit scary and dark for young ones. While the double-entendres will go over their heads, there are adult usages of words you won't want your grade schooler repeating. The animation is generally impressive but the characters' faces range from human-like (Weaver/Sly Stallone) to weird and alien-looking (Z/Woody Allen) with a limited range of emotion. The big name casting doesn't work at all. Woody Allen does the same shtick he's been doing for almost 40 years and it's just bizarre to hear him in an animated feature with a plot like this. (At least in his old TV cartoon his character looked like him, but that really didn't work well either.) Sharon Stone is wooden and old-sounding as the young princess. The other characters are shallow clichés of their particular voice-actor's typical movie role (except for Walken, who does a great job of not being one of his usual nutjobs). I guess it was all a novelty at the time. As mentioned in other comments, the story line is a mish-mosh of old plots from much better movies or books. The music is high quality but odd in places. The only humor in the movie is Woody's, so if you don't find his routine especially funny, this will be agony to sit through. Whatever the movie was trying to be, it doesn't work now. It does occur to me, though, that maybe its entertainment value is as a study on early mistakes made during the rebirth of full length animated films aimed at general audiences.

There are many other interesting characters too, all performed by an all star cast, and I say performed because they were so fantasticaly developed.

Although not written by Allen, his dialogue resembles that found in classics such as Annie Hall, etc. His sharp wit carries a movie that is otherwise lackluster and dull.The movie, unfortunately, has a rather deficient plot. It is merely a poorly constructed communist diatribe masquerading as a fun, family film.Allen's character, Z, is thrust into the role of Marxist leader after accidentally kidnapping the Queen's daughter, who is, for some reason, engaged to an ant general. The writers, while trying to create a realistic ant colony atmosphere, seem to have forgotton that queen ants' larva are fertilized by many male ants, and have no meaningful relationship with any one.It is decided that Z is a great leader, because he refuses to accept his role as a worker. It seems that the ant rulers are horrible, oppressive autocrats who have enslaved the entire colony, imposing their will upon the voiceless workers. Phrases such as ""the workers control the means of production"" are uttered as the ant colony tries to expel the evil General.Z repeatedly declares that is is essential for ants to be allowed to think individually, and that an ant's status ought not be determined at birth.Eventually, of course, the workers triumph over the evil General, and a just society is supposely established. Ironically, they achieve their sovereignty by forming a large ladder, comprised of unidentifiably, generic ants. In the end we see the great ant colony, in which individuality is prized and freedom prevails. It is merely a faceless mass, an undistinct cluster of undifferentiable insects.Woody Allen shines in this movie, but it is truly a one man (or one ant) show. Go for the humor, but do not expect anything more.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not bad.,And this was the first CGI movie I went to see with my children. It was an entertaining film even though the technology behind its images has aged noticeably. With a formidable cast of voices in their original language we have an almost impossible love story in the middle of a strongly structured society made up of hardworking ants. Circumstances and enemies arise that will test the anthill's strength and ability to survive and thus face almost insurmountable challenges. It is a well-made film whose ability to entertain far exceeds its technical age. It really deserves a chance if you want to complete your experience with cgi films for childs.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Antz is NOT for kids. PG??,"I saw this movie when I was a little kid and I thought it was great. Now I'm watching it and I'm in shock. Words are said such as ""tight-ass"", ""bitching"", drug references, and sexual references such as ""erotic fantasies"" and ""pheromones""(which are chemicals that stimulate a sexual attraction). I'm completely shocked at what they consider to be only PG. Most of the references and profanity-- the children probably won't recognize but it's completely ridiculous.

When I was real young, I remember having the VHS of the film and I used to watch it every single time.Now, 16 years later, ""Antz"" is still part of my childhood, behind ""Peanuts"" and ""Looney Tunes"". I still love this movie from this day forward, besides Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"", which that movie and ""Antz"" are compared back in the day.That lead into a feud between DreamWorks and Pixar. No joke. Anyways, this movie is outstanding and funny in every single way. My brother hasn't seen it, but we have seen it just last night.Overall, I'm giving ""Antz"" a 10 out of 10.

Adults will like this more than the kids.,"It seems to me that Antz is one of Hollywood's first attempts at making animation for adults on a grand scale.  For years other countries like Japan have understood that it is not the medium in which a film is created, but the story behind it that counts. Antz has taken that concept to the U.S. and I am very happy that they did.I have nothing against Disney animation.... as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of it, but Antz is definitely not a Disney film.  It is an adult film that children may enjoy.  It is aimed at the adult, but marketed for children.  Woody Allen was his typical neurotic self.  Sly Stallone played one of his best roles in years. And Christopher Walken was great as usual. Check it out if you get the chance.P.S. This movie may not be a great idea for extremely young children.  There are a few brutal war scenes which might scare a young child (the termite battle for those of you that have seen the movie).  You may want to view it before showing it to a child, just to make sure it isn't too violent for them.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Dark and mature for a children's film, so unlike most animated films after it","What I liked about this film is its mature content. I mean this is the only children's animation film that has the B-word in it, and as well as alcohol and violence. Even Shrek (2001) tried to get away with some adult content, but not as much as this one did. Nowadays, it seems like animated movies have come more juvenile and immature.The film had a good plot and was entertaining to watch. The music by Harry-Gregson Williams was really top notch, with a memorable theme. It is far superior to A Bug's Life when it comes to its story and thematic material (although I'd say ABL's animation was a little better, but that isn't saying much). The characters in Antz are far more mature than those in ABL and many other animation films (yes, even you Toy Story). Adults will definitely enjoy this film.I cannot believe how this film is already somewhat forgotten. It's like the 2nd animated feature film ever made, after Toy Story (1995). It sure needs more exposure and credit. But I think the adult themes in this film sort tarnish its image. It's one of those films that are criticised to as ""too dark for kids and too tame for adults"". Though I heavily disagree with that sentiment. It may still be tame and cartoony for most ""adult movie"" standards, it still is rather entertaining. If you enjoyed Toy Story, then I don't see how this one won't be enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Antz vs. Bugs,"The first computer-generated feature from Dreamworks is ambitious indeed. Featuring a cast of A-list actors right down to the smallest supporting roles, it's a story that works in most areas and falls a little flat in just a few sections.  It's a well-written story with an ending that is just a little too neat and tidy.  Another MINOR quibble I had was that, with so many famous voices, I was sometimes distracted from the story by trying to guess whose voice I was hearing.Comparisons to Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"" are inevitable, with supporters and detractors on both sides.  ""Bugs"" seemed targeted more on kids, but had an overall slickness in story and execution that seems lacking in ""Antz."" ""Antz"" was a little more sophisticated in its humor and approach to realism, but a lot if it was dark.  Also, the visual style of the animation in ""Antz"" seemed to be trying a little too hard.  The makers utilized a system of animation where the faces of the characters were given actual muscle systems to mimic the movement of human faces.  While technically admirable, the overall effect made it look like real faces were plastered onto computer figures and manipulated digitally -- it didn't look awfully real.  Of course, neither did ""Bug's Life"", but ""Bugs"" was from beginning to end a cartoon; it did not aspire to anything more lofty.  ""Antz"" did and fell short.But that's just me.  I could be wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

WARNING TO PARENTS!,"I just returned home from watching ANTZ with my three- and five-year-olds. I think I was as excited as they were, to finally have a movie I could take the kids to that wasn't some of Disney's latest Politically Correct multinational drivel.

Sadly, the fun and charm of an otherwise good movie would not be affected by replacing these words with less offensive phrases. I have heard that they included these words to get a PG rating and hopefully draw more adult attention. The real money is made by a kids' movie in repeat viewings, tape rental/sales, and merchandising (toys). I am going to make sure that my kids never see this movie again in a theater, we will NOT buy the tape, and my kids will never own ANY Antz merchandise.

Antz is chalk full of comedy, terrific one-liners, and other subtle humor. The animation is semi-descent, flawless for the most part. The voices are also great. I loved Gene Hackman's portrayal of the evil leader, as well as Christopher Walken's portrayal of one of Hackman's foot soldiers.

Visually Satisfying but lacks interest. **1/2 out of ****,"I want to start my review of  ""Antz"" by asking an easy question: What does Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Jennifer Lopez & Danny Glover have in common. No, not that they all live in Hollywood. Each and every one of them contributes their wonderful voice in this movie, which I may say, is the first animated movie from DreamWorks Studio, and benefits from the help of filmmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg, who earlier oversaw the renaissance in Disney animation, and Steven Spielberg.I also wish to explain to you that even the biggest names in the movie business, which is what this movie contains, and the other pluses of the production do absolutely nothing for the film and minds well have been absent from it. Sure, my star rating was certainly boasted because of them, but in the end, the main and final flaw in this movie is the fact that the movie offers noting of interest to an audience. An ant's  life is the story presented here and quite frankly, I couldn't care less about an ant's life, really.The ant who is magnified in ""Antz"" is voiced appropriately by Woody Allen, as a nautical insect who is named Z. He lives in the ground in a deep, dark colony as everyone else does, and has an important job in his colony; to work and obey orders given to him. And after many years of doing so, Z is starting to wonder why he has to, and why no one else wonders this, or what purpose does his mining server.There is another main ant in this movie, Bala, voiced beautifully by Sharon Stone, whose job is to be the future monarch and lay millions of eggs 24 hours a day. She is not too fond of that idea, especially because there is no fun involved with her life. She sneaks out of confinement one day and managers to present herself to the nerdy looking Z and dance with him during a daily festival. But when Bala is caught, Z asks when they will be able to meet once again and she states ""Never.""Z soon catches on that Bala is the princes and so on that there's about an upcoming soldier march to be presented in front of the royal family. So he asks his massively muscular ant friend, Barbatus (Stallone) who is a soldier to trade places with him for  that event. He says yes and lots of plot twist happen after the tuning point. I could bore (or excite) you with the pathetic story point for the next several paragraphs but I am not that mean, so I will stop there and let the imagination carry through.I loved the images of the movie. It is fully computer animated and tries to measure up to the magnificent ""Toy Story"" and ""Small Soldiers"" but doesn't come close to the visual pleasure. You see, those movies: 1) Offered something more than watching an urban insect's adventures, 2) had lots of brilliant colors. ""Antz"" gives us two colors; light brown for the ants' bodies, dark brown for the colonies' walls. There are some instances that prove me wrong but for the most part, the only visual enjoyment in this film comes half way thought.I can't recommend ""Antz"" for the reason of it didn't do much for me. I give the film a marginal thumbs down because I am one-hundred percent sure that a large majority of an audience will enjoy this picture to the extreme. A one line summary of the movie in my point of view: ""Toy Story"" meets ""Starship Troopers"" from an ant's point of view.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An all star cast does a great job.,"Antz (1998) -These childrens films where creatures are used to entertain and deliver morals and messages all seem to do a great job of utilising the known facts of the culture of those critters, whilst incorporating some sassy dialogue and a fun story, with wonderful colours and silliness for the kids. It was the little touches that have always added to the experiences for me. The ants perspective and the using of Latin names for the various characters as well as the more obvious jokes, some of which were very adult in this film.It is definitely the best Woody Allen film in existence. His humour worked better in this cartoon style, maybe because he has one of those faces that just annoys or maybe because it wasn't entirely scripted by him.I do find that I can never distinguish between this film and 'A Bugs Life' (1998). I kept waiting for the Grasshoppers to arrive. They are very similar and it would have been nice for the studios to come up with something more individual and different enough with the stories, rather than trying to compete.The animation was slightly clumsy and not as polished as I have become used to, but it didn't hurt anything at all and it was only to be expected of a film from the earlier stages of CGI development.There were a couple of moments that were purely for adults and not just the innuendo that usually appears. Things that might go completely over the heads of kids and things that parents might have to explain.I'd forgotten how good this one was actually, because I would have always chosen Disney's effort over it, but I have to say that I would gladly add this to a list of films to show my kid when the stork eventually brings them to me.Cupids being a bit slow too, so I may have to continue to enjoy those films on my own for a bit longer, but I'm sure I'll get over it.Perfect Bank Holiday, Christmas or wet Sunday afternoon viewing for the whole family.730.98/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best animated films for ALL ages,"I say this statement because this film is an example of a hybrid (like Close Encounters, or most Anime films) because this film works on many leves. Sure kids will like the animation and when two ants get stuck to a gum-shoe (literally), but how many kids know the themes in this film.  Like individualism, teamwork and stuff.  Kids that wacth this film will probably expect what came from Pixar (Toy Story and A Bug's Life).  But will they be able to understand a line from the lead Z- ""Instead of killing the termites, how about we stuin them, with campaign contributions?""Plot follows a thoughtful Ant named Z (voiced by first time voicer and filmmaker Woody Allen) who, thanks to a trail of circumstances, meets and falls in love with the Princess ant Bala (voiced by a slick Sharon Stone) and gets mixed up in trying to save the colony of ants he lives with underneath Central Park.  An amazing film as far as Anmation goes, and is recommendable for everyone.  I might fear (though I honestly don't beleve) the action sequences between ants and termites are too violent, while adults who love Fellini and Allen films won't appreciate Allen in a film like this.

Anti-feminist nonsense,"This story makes no sense.  The story of the anthill has been completely perverted to suit the gender expectations of Hollywood generally, and in particular that of Pixar, a division of Lucasfilm.  It's not especially surprising that Lucasfilm has all these gender hang-ups, it's just really annoying. 	Antz is a very traditional story.  The princess realizes the error of her ways, is threatened by the bad guy, is saved by the hero, and plays a small role in saving her people.  But the movie isn't about her, it's about the underdog.  He is the one who has an idea, leads the adventure, uncovers the evil plot, leads the ants to victory and saves the day.  Oh yeah, and he gets the girl. 	In a real anthill, there are no heroes.  The collective is the hero. Individuals can't do anything.  The anthill is a poor metaphor for the power of free will.  It is the Queen who holds the power, such that it is, in an anthill.  There are no generals, no husbands.  The female leads the entire community.  The worker ants are female, the soldiers are usually female. The male ants are the small drones or princes, whose sole job is to mate with a princess, and fly away with her to start a new colony.  There is no way for a male to seize power; this is unheard of in the insect kingdom.Why was the anthill even chosen for this story?  Any truth about the anthill is immediately dispensed with.  The communistic tenets of the collective are discredited.  The power of the female is also tossed out the window.  The only remaining fact in this movie is that an ant can lift many times its own bodyweight.  Any kid that sees this film is going to get a very poor idea of what goes on in an anthill. 	So would I recommend this movie for kids?  No.  It's one long cliché, first of all.  It's also anti-feminist and the animation style is already dated, and not for the better.  There is serious product placement in the form of Pepsi products.  Basically, I couldn't find any redeeming qualities lurking in the shadows of this lame movie.  Skip it and rent Chicken Run.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

In a world where rich colorful 3-D animation surrounds the imagination, ANTZ is marvelous at this surrealistic reality. This may be the next step in animated movies. Nevertheless, the water bubble and the boy's gum-shoe are two reasons to go see this. The celebrity voices including Woody Allen and Sharon Stone add the sparkles, giving this the splendor of Hollywood magic. Unfortunately, young kids may not take ANTZ too seriously, and with the unexpected mild language and violence, they're better off watching TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE for some light-hearted fun. Your kids will be bored and sleepy-headed because this aims at a much older crowd, which took me by surprise. The brilliant wonder of computer animation should be attractive fun for virtually everyone, and until we notice the movie feeling so casual and hard-heavy, it's too far away from being a ""G""-rated show. It's not what it should be, and it lacks the magically spirited punch of Disney, but ANTZ is fine testimony in transforming hand-drawn art to polygons.

Language & Content Not Appropriate For Young Children,"My wife and I were surprised at the language present in this ""family"" film. We have noticed that a large number of animated films created by studios other than Disney seem to make liberal use of words which we do not allow our children to use and which we ourselves do not use around children. I was surprised that one scene which appeared in the trailer and made reference to a bug's ""caboose"" was an overdub of the word ""anus"" which was actually used in the film. Gene Hackman's character used the word ""damn"" enough times that both of my children mentioned it to us after viewing the film. It was my wife who first noticed that a lot of non-Disney produced animated films seem to rely on socially accepted vulgarities that I imagine only parents of young children would notice.

"""Don't you want your Aphid Beer?"" ""Call me crazy, but I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature, okay?""","While watching Antz, it is always tempting to compare it with the similarly themed and CGI-ed ""A Bug's Life"" from Disney.In fact, doing so only detracts from both as, despite many thematic similarities, they are very different films. The Disney film is, as you would expect, the more saccharine and self-consciously humorous of the two. It scores over Antz by brimming with inventiveness, particularly the scenes where Flik is in the underworld. These scenes often reference latter day cartoons, including ""Hoppity Goes To Town"", and feature memorable scenes such as the Bloody Mary-drinking mosquito and the slug that forgot not to order salt with his burger. However, while a slight homage is made to the works of the 30s and 40s, the CGI on both these films is of the period and absolutely magnificent. Where this fails is in the fact that it is no longer groundbreaking, as it was when attempted with ""Toy Story"". To this end, Toy Story is spoofed during the truly inspired ""outtakes"" sequence at the climax.Antz, however, is the story I awarded the highest marks (7 to A Bug's Life 6). A Bug's Life is a children's film which adults can enjoy, Antz is an adult film which children may not enjoy or even comprehend. It would be overstating it to say Antz has depth, but certainly a cartoon feature with themes and images of genocide, decapitated corpses and graphic physical violence is not the sort of thing you'd want to show your newly-borns. While the basic plot is the same - ant leaves colony in disgrace only to return in triumph - the basic motivation is different. In the Disney vehicle, Flik leaves with the urge to return. In Antz, Z (Woody Allen) WANTS to leave. In all this is mixed up an Orwellian parable and the nature of individualism and choice. Not exactly Tom and Jerry.Woody Allen, while a fine comedian in his own films, is far better when out of context. He ALWAYS plays the neurotic Jewish New Yorker, but when that Jewish New Yorker is the chief villain in a James Bond movie (The only reason to watch Casino Royale) or an ant on a psychiatrist's couch bemoaning ""never being able to lift more than ten times my own bodyweight"", then it borders on genius. Antz also scores over its rival by having a smaller set of characters, with only (more or less) ants to make up the cast. No show-stealing fleas, ladybirds or caterpillars for this movie.But where A Bug's Life had Kevin Spacey as a villainous grasshopper, the only real protagonist in Antz is the stifling lifestyle of conformity. It's the better film, but is it any wonder less people went to see it?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A decent enough attempt at a bugs life,"This was probably the last thing I expected Woody Allen to appear in and probably the last thing I have seen him in. This has some pretty big names attached to it so it is not surprising to me to see how well it turned out.Still it's not as polished as A bug's life but has it's charm none the less. The voice acting from everyone is great especially Woody Allen who plays a neurotic ant that pretty much is just Woody Allen in ant form. Sylvester Stallone is his brute of a buddy and a whole slew of supporting characters including Gene Hackman as the bad guy.It all plays out fairly predictably, it is literally the same as watching a bugs life but manages to be it's own thing.

King of the Hill,"The first strength of this film is that it features Woody Allen in the principle role. The ant he plays delivers the self absorbed and fearful lines that Woody delivers in each of the films he is in. Here he plays an ant who is part of the collective. He realizes his only significance is a cog in the the machine that, for all practical purposes, reproduces itself but never evolves. He meets a female ant and the two have similar issues. There are all the expected pitfalls, and they make their respective ways toward a kind of utopia for crawly things. This is really quite delightful.

Overrated & over kids' heads,"Apparently, Dreamworks studios thinks this computer-animated flick will appeal to different age levels a la ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"".

The movie seems to be both an endorsement and a condemnation of Communism. The working class revolts against the fascist monarchy, but then again, the revolution's leader, Z(Woody Allen), bemoans the abscence of free-will and individualism. There's even a visit to ""Insectopia"" that shows why the concept of ""communal living"" never survived the 60's. That's alot of Socio-political theorizing for a cartoon!

In this movie the audience can see a Kingdoom, then an state in emergency, then a dictator and then a democracy... and all the tricks and strategies necessaries to win.

Thousands of ants show us a typical ant hive with a strict class structure and little individual freedom. This colony with its ""Mega"" construction projects is much more believable than the bunch of ants shown in ""A bug's life"". The mood of ""Antz"" is a dark one, as most of the story happens underground in the caves of the hive and death always possible.

"arguments regarding ""AntZ""","Were it not for ""AntZ"" and ""Akira"", I would have completely given up on any kind of animated film.  Thankfully, though, these two movies have restored my faith in cartoondom as a viable way of telling a story.  I agree with pretty much all of the positive comments I've heard thus far, so I'll omit the repetitive yammering and refute the claims of the more negative commentary on ""AntZ"".Bad language?  The movie was rated PG.  The MPAA doesn't rate these movies just for their own amusement, folks.  If you don't want your kids to hear profane language, keep your moviegoing limited strictly to ""G"" films. Otherwise, don't blame DreamWorks because your five-year-old's favorite new word is ""damn"".  It's not their fault.  It's yours.  Pay attention to the MPAA rating next time.Sexism? I read a comment claiming that ""AntZ"" sucked on account of the fact that the ""ant social structure"" was poorly portrayed: the males outnumbered the females, and the males ran everything.  If we're going to gripe about realism here, why not address the concept of talking ants (English, no less) that swing picks and wear WWII-style army helmets?  I vaguely recall having owned an ant farm, and they never formed big wrecking balls out of their own bodies.  Hence, realism is not an issue.It's boring?  Okay, I can understand how a child could get bored while watching this film.  However, taking into account the fact that's a PG film, most people should've known that right off the bat.  This is a more cerebral film.  A thinking adult with even a high school education should appreciate the social implications made in the movie, and a film buff should howl at the vast number of movie references made in ""AntZ"".  If that's too much to handle, stick to mindless drivel like ""Dumb & Dumber"".Woody Allen?  Damn right, Woody Allen.  Who could POSSIBLY better portray a neurotic ant in a colony of millions who feels that he is insignificant than him?An ""ugly"" film?  Absolutely.  Lots of dark browns makes a lot more sense than Disney's baby blue hexapod, wouldn't you agree? Once again, this is a PG film, which means that people should have clued into the fact that it's not a ""family"" movie.  Being, as it is, a more ""adult-oriented"" film, it doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbows. Why animate it at all, you ask? Especially in computer graphics?  (a) Do YOU think you could sit and watch an hour and a half of live actors dressed up in stupid-looking ant costumes?  (b) Computer animation offers unprecedented visual detail.This concludes my tirade.  You may now resume perusing the comments.",,Anonymous,Animation
"World's Most Sexist Movie, why not?","A minor point:  in ant colonies, males exist only to mate with the queen, then are discarded.  By human standards, they are literally sex slaves in a female-dominated society.  As for the movie, I count a whopping three females in the cast.  The hero, of course, is male.  Technically, ""Antz"" is the most sexist movie ever, implying the most highly successful species on Earth is run and operated by males, when the exact opposite is true.  Its critique of ant social structure is likewise so badly thought out that I wonder if the creators are illiterate.And why not?  All the detail in ""Antz"" went straight to computer graphics, even though the cinematography is second-rate.  The voice actors are unskilled, the characters cardboard (even the spunky princess and bumbling hero give that ""been there done that"" feel), the humor bland, and the plot idiotic.  It's possible Hollywood simply abhors admitting to children that female-dominated societies can be successful, but it's more likely that the creators were too stupid to know and too apathetic to care.Why are Americans so uneager to show children quality material?  If you want a good children's film, try ""My Neigbor Totoro"".  No CG, but plenty of beautifully detailed art and elegantly simple themes.  If you want wow-wow computer graphics or social critiques, ""Ghost in the Shell"" offers oh so much more, albeit not for kids.  ""Antz"" is cash-cow Hollywood.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

a good idea but overall failure,"Antz and A Bug's Life were both released in the same year, and both films competed with each other for an audience. Despite both films feature bugs as the heroes and the villains, the films are too different to really be compared. A Bug's Life is my personal favourite of the two, but it's not by much. It is simply a little more engaging. However, Antz uses a clever concept and focuses more on the world of the ant. The film can be enjoyed by adults and children, and like A Bug's Life, it is educational and entertaining.Antz is a story of individualism, which is an unusual concept in the world of ants. In fact, it is a little bit like communism. Everyone works, but nothing brings out the individual. For the most part, all ants look and act the same... but our little ant clearly stands out. It is he who saves the day because of his individuality and his ability to think.Although there are some good ideas and good story-telling behind this film, overall, it fails to really see it through and make a big impact. A Bug's Life was more entertaining and quickly paced, and it doesn't possess the sappy love story like Antz does. A Bug's Life also succeeds a little more with the family, whereas a lot of the story in Antz is just dull.

""Antz"" stands head and shoulders above most Disney films (especially the very similar ""A Bug's Life"") because it proves that animation doesn't have to be watered-down, sugar-coated, talking-candlestick nonsense.  This film, unlike ""A Bug's Life,"" for example, has not been designed to promote toys and dolls and trips to Disney World.

Great cartoon  get kids into Woody Allen early!,"Worker ant Z has issues - he feels insignificant and that he doesn't make a difference - and he's right.  As a worker ant he dreams of meeting the beautiful Princess Bala.  When he swaps places with Weaver, his military friend he becomes a hero in the termite war and goes on a search with Bala for Insectopia.  But with Bala gone, Sinister General Mandible has plans to take over the colony and wipe out all but the strongest ants, can Z be a hero again?I'm very much a Woody Allen fan, so straight away I'm a fan of this type of comedy.  The story is good for a child's comedy and it would stand up by itself.  The story is full of movie references (the `Starship Troopers' termite wars being the best), and is interesting enough to keep adults interested.  For children there are enough good visuals, action scenes and visual jokes to keep them happy.  But what really makes this film stand out is Allen's voice work.  He brings his style of humour to the film and is the perfect choice for the ant suffering from feelings of worthlessness and insignificance.  So many of the lines will go over the heads of children, but it is great to have this level of wit and humour in a kids film.The other thing that makes this stand out is the depth of the cast - and the fact that they are all good.  Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, John Mahoney, J-Lo, Sharon Stone (who Allen gave her first role to), and Sylvester Stallone (this is much better than the other Stone/Stallone feature `the Specialist').  The two other main roles are really well cast. Hackman is perfect as General Mandible while Walken is really well cast as Cutter - it's easy to see him in the animation.Overall this is an excellent film for adults and children.  A Bug's Life may be better for children because of it's brighter animation and greater reliance on visual humour, however Antz is by far the superior film.",,Anonymous,Animation

Woody Allen computerized...,"Woody Allen computerized as an ant. One of the weirdest ideas ever, but with an all star cast (Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone) you've got one great film.

One, it ushered in a whole new kind of animated film for children; dark, stylish, very adult, and usually appreciated by a certain type of child. This isn't necessarily the story believe would possess mainstream appeal by a public treated to the wonders of Toy Story and a previous slew of Disney films. Two, it bears a darker and more stark animation style that breaks free from the cuteness of other animated tales. And three, the explicit controversy that lead to this film's creation.For the ""Cliff Notes"" version of the story, Jeffrey Katzenberg, an executive at Disney, departed the day Pixar/Disney head John Lasseter pitched the idea for A Bug's Life, a charming little computer animated feature centering around the rodents of your backyard. Not long after Katzenberg departed, he formed ""Dreamworks"" and his debut feature would be Antz, focusing, likewise, on an insect-drive society, released seven weeks before A Bug's Life. Lasseter was greatly disheartened by Katzenberg's move, which was easily the case of taking someone's great idea and using it against them. Which one became more well-known? At the time, I'd most likely say A Bug's Life, but both films have gone on to be sort of the forgotten creatures of two massive companies. Yet Antz is more than meets the eye in several regards.We focus on an ant colony in New York City where ant Z-4195 (voiced by Woody Allen - whose character is also nicknamed ""Z"") is gridlocked in an oppressively totalitarian society where individualism is discouraged and conformity is king. As neurotic and somewhat inept he is, he hungers for the opportunity to express himself in a land dominated by conformists obeying the order of the ruling class. ""Z"" befriends Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), the daughter of the ruling queen ant, who takes a liking to his quirkiness, but recognizes he is merely a worker ant and not a noble soldier ant. To impress her, ""Z"" sneaks into the soldier march and is quickly taken for a ride to defend his ant colony. Yet he overlooks the fact that General Mandible (Gene Hackman) is purposely shipping out the loyal troops to die so he can formulate his own society filled with goon-like ants that talk with incredible power. The whole thing escalates into an integration of not only the plot of rebellion and survival, but romance and possessing a non-conformist attitude.The voice acting will without a doubt turn off some people, but there are so many terrifically cast people in this film that sink into their roles fittingly. Woody Allen comfortably sinks into his role as a neurotic worker, Gene Hackman is brilliantly cast as the villain, Sharon Stone works as the princess, and Sylvester Stallone and Danny Glover exercise their roles to a pleasant extent.Visually, as stated before, this is one of the darkest animated films I've seen - one of the very few not to be dominated by eye-popping, candy-coated colors while being soaked in a nice innocence that's easy to swallow. The message is strong and versatile; don't settle for conformity, but branch out and do what you want to do. Go against convention, do noble acts, do something that doesn't put you in a line occupied by faceless others. Some people have said Antz is a communist fable and I whole-heatedly agree. It shows in detail a society of shameless totalitarianism and exploits how it robs people (or ants in this case) of their individualistic qualities and personal traits.Antz is primarily targeted towards the ten and up demographic, but I can see slightly younger kids appreciating this for its charming convention-breaking roots and its enigmatic presence it unleashes on its viewers. Dreamworks would later become known for implementing this kind of style, where it would ditch the younger crowd demographic in favor of the tweens and teens still cool enough to see animated films. Needless to say, with their immense success with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they've had quite the lucrative success. At the very least, this is a footnote in the world of animation, not just for its successful cast but for its darker themes and appearance that contrast it from the typical animated film.Voiced by: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft, and Dan Aykroyd.

A movie for adults and children alike,"Animated movies are often considered ""for kids only"", with the adults just tagging along.  Not so with ANTZ.  Here is a movie with the adults in mind as well.  Storylines, humor, etc. were multi-level, appealing to both children and adults.  It was ironic the number of children-free adults that were in the theater to see this movie. I went with a friend, her daughter (age 6) and my daughter (age 8).  The girls loved the ""boy meets girl"" story and that the bad guys don't win.  My friend and I enjoyed the adult-aimed humor.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I Cantz recommend it,"I was reading into similar movies released during the same year, and 1998 being a year that saw the releases of both A Bug's Life and Antz is one of the most frequently cited examples. I'll defend A Bug's Life, as while it's not top-tier Pixar, I think it's pretty good (I'm a sucker for anything comparable to Seven Samurai and/or Three Amigos). I don't feel like Antz is very defendable. It does not hold up well.It's a movie I know I haven't seen in 20+ years, so it was pretty much a fresh watch. Still, it's weird how little parts here and there felt familiar. Part of me was interested in experiencing that weird sensation that comes with seeing something you haven't seen since childhood. But even when I was a kid, I don't think I liked Antz all that much. Watching it now, I get a similar feeling, because I'm not sure why this was made, nor what the appeal is.Woody Allen's brand of comedy is an acquired taste in adulthood, and I don't see how making him voice the main character in a movie like this was a smart move. He sounds so old and feeble, too. Elsewhere, the voice cast is impressive - many big names here.It's kind of raunchy and edgy for an animated film that gets labelled a family movie, and also pretty violent and unsettling. It's the more horrific stuff that I remembered most from childhood, not surprisingly. The whole battle sequence against the termites is weirdly intense for this kind of film.Maybe I can sort of admire how out there it gets at times, but I don't think it's good in any event. Critics apparently liked this upon release, but watching it now, it feels kind of unpleasant and misguided, and I think it deserves to stay mostly forgotten. The vibes here are just bad- I don't know what else there is to say.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
An insect's life in bondage and revolution.,"How did it take me so long to watch this all the way through?I remember being very little and being vaguely aware of this somewhat grotesque looking feature in which the ants actually have 6 limbs (shudder).But it's actually a pretty amazing movie.A Bug's Life may be the more feel good movie with verdant color scheme in contrast to the morbid reds and browns and slightly uncanny characters here, but what we have here is a compelling allegory to the nature of conformance and power struggle with more than a couple of misdirects along the way.Z (played with immaculate neuroticism by the timeless Woody Allen) is an impeccable character of his voice-actor: a lovable loser who is at least smart enough to know that something is desperately wrong with society but not sure what.Yes, it's that old theme of being yourself but has a refreshing amount of cynicism against military leaders and the glorification of soldiers while royalism sort of gets a pass because, hey, they're ants. This isn't a documentary but they are 20% than Pixar.This is more or less a ""family movie"" but it has that sweet spot of edginess in which we get disarmingly vicious depiction of war and its casualties. They were able to make it paradoxically enough, more palatable by being more extreme, you'll see...The mild profanity and innuendo just blend right in.A singular experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mixed Experience,"The movie was intriguing for me, although I found it to be a mixed experience. It didn't strike me as bad, but it fell short of being truly remarkable. The film had a lot of potential in terms of its storyline, but it seemed to lack depth for an hour and 20-minute runtime. The animation style, while not exceptional, can be forgiven considering it was DreamWorks's first.One aspect I appreciated about the movie was its ability to provide a unique perspective, allowing me to view the world from the standpoint of an ant. This aspect added a layer of interest to the overall narrative.In conclusion, I would primarily recommend this movie for a younger audience, particularly those aged 10 and above. While it may not fully satisfy the expectations of adult viewers, it holds value as a suitable choice for children who can appreciate its imaginative storytelling and the imaginative world it presents.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The film was great, but is it for kids?","First of all, I loved Antz.  Dreamworks and PDI have amazed me in their animated debut, and the story was great fun.  The script read like a more lighthearted version of one of Woody Allen's films, and being a fan of both Allen and animation, the combination entertained me to such a degree, I went and saw it again.  My only problem with it is that it seems to ignore the fact that kids are flocking to see animated films.  The swearing that the characters do (mind you, it is limited) shocked me simply because I was not expecting it from an animated film geared towards the G-rated audience. Also, some of the battle scenes were violent to the point of possibly frightening younger viewers.  However, if the audience is 10 or older, Antz is one of the most sophisticatedly hilarious films I have seen, animated or not, in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Antz is a great kids movie for grown-ups.,"The refreshing thing about Dreamworks SKG is that they don't appear to care very much about how marketable their films are.  Heck, the guys are millionaires, right?  This summer, for example, they made an action movie with believable characters and not much action (Deep Impact, which compared to Armageddon was practically a Merchant Ivory film).  And now with Antz they turn the world of children's animation on its ear.  This is stuff that Disney would never dare: No songs (or catchy broadway soundtrack), no bright colors, no hip sidekicks, No over-the-top villain.  Antz is edgy, and much of the humor adult. The PG rating isn't fooling around, you'll find three damns, a 'hell,' and a 'bitching' in here, as well as lines like ""I'm sorry, but drinking from the anus of another creature isn't my cup of tea.""  And yet Antz succeeds as a children's movie in spite, or perhaps because of its willingness to jettison the pop-culture junk that permeated Disney's Hercules, as well as the preachiness that ruined Pocahontas.  The paint-by-numbers plotting of recent animated movies is all but gone, as well -- the villain's master plan isn't fully fleshed out until the end of the film, instead of telegraphed in the first five minutes.  Antz is something of an oddity as a children's movie because it feels so completely *new*, every idea fresh, every plot twist unexpected.  When was the last time you watched a kid's movie and weren't sure how it was going to end?  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Antz looks GREAT.  The characters look real, not merely computer generated, and the Ant's eye view of the world is entrancing and nearly flawless (occasionally, the backgrounds look too static, but that's a minor quibble).   All in all, Antz is a fine movie.  Very young children should not be taken to see it, however; they will miss the humor, might be bored by some of the chattier scenes, and will most certainly be frightened by a termite/ant battle scene early on (heck, it frightened ME.  Those termites were nasty).  But anyone over the age of ten will be entranced by Antz' vision.  This is a film to see more than once, simply to appreciate the wit lurking behind the scenes (For example, in the ant/termite battle, every soldier on either side is killed except one ant.  The ants have a victory parade, and one sign reads ""One - nothing.  We win.""  If that's not skewering satire, tell me what is).  Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"" will most certainly be more lively and bright than Antz, and more kid-friendly.  But it will also be safer, more predictable, and more clearly aimed at the bottom line (that is, selling toys and soundtracks).  Antz is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and will be fun for children and adults alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
NOT for adults; TOLERABLE for adults with children,"Whoever originally spread the myth that ANTZ is a film that can be enjoyed by adults as well as children must have been an adult with children. And that much is true: If you've got kids under 10, this is good ""family entertainment."" It is a notch above almost anything Disney has ever produced, and it is not likely to cause the parents to wish immediately that they were somewhere else -- any place else. If, however, adults seeing it without children in tow are not likely to be impressed. The story line is typical of almost every feature length cartoon you've ever seen and a good many fairy tales: high born/low born romance, an arch-villain, heroine (and hero, in this case) tied metaphorically to the railroad tracks, creature solidarity, last minute rescue from disaster, comeuppance for the villain. The best thing that ANTZ has doing for it is Woody Allen's voice and an insect variation on his persona as a neurotic, love-struck little sh nook. Surprisingly (to me at least), I did not really recognize the voices of the other well-known stars who also spoke the dialog of other characters in this animated film. Without their faces and bodies, Sharon Stone, Anne Bancroft, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken could easily have been replaced by other actors, and I wouldn't have known the difference. If you've got kids the right age, this is a very tolerable film. If you're not watching it with little kids, watch something else.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Favorite Childhood Film.,"I remember when I was a kid I use to watch this movie nonstop it was so good, I had it on VHS, although VHS are pretty much extinct now. Antz is a very fun movie, and well created considering the computerized production. This movie has action, betrayal, jealousy, loyalty, adventure, bravery and more. It's not just a movie for kids it's also for teens and adults. This movie tells the story of a ant named Z a lowly worker in a culture where the welfare of the colony far outweighs the welfare of the individual, who is unsatisfied with his station in life. Through his perseverance and love for the colony, he ends up exceeding even his own expectations. Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Dan Aykroyd, Danny Glover, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances.The film score is excellent, and fits the movie perfectly.

Decent animated insect flick,"Released in 1998 and produced by DreamWorks, ""Antz"" is an animated adventure/comedy about a colony of ants where one of the workers named Z (voiced by Woody Allen) feels insignificant in a system of rigid conformity. He meets Bala (Sharon Stone) and they escape the colony to find the mythical ""Insectopia,"" which might not be the paradise they anticipated. Meanwhile, arrogant General Mandible (Gene Hackman) seeks to liquidate the lowly worker ants once they finish a mega-tunnel.This is a solid animated flick with many chuckles, but I found the opening act rather dull. The story really picks up when Z and Bala discover the outside world and the myriad hazards thereof. The end reveal of where the colony is located made me bust out laughing.Part of the fun of animated movies is trying to place the voices of the characters. Hackman was easy to figure out, as are Sylvester Stallone and Christopher Walken. Other actors who contributed include: Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney and Jim Cummings.How does ""Antz"" compare to Pixar's ""A Bug's Life,"" which was released about the same time in late 1998? Generally speaking, ""Antz"" is more adult-oriented and darker while ""A Bug's Life"" is more family-oriented and colorful. When it comes to animated 'bug' films, I much prefer the nigh-genius of DreamWorks' ""Bee Movie"" from 2007.The film runs 83 minutes.GRADE: C+/B-",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A nice change of pace,"I went into ""Antz"" expecting a Disney-like animated effort, but while this was definitely not what I had anticipated, it was no less entertaining than a typical Disney picture.  Refreshingly, this was more sophisticated than most animated features, and I can only assume that adults may have enjoyed this more than the kids.  While it is lacking in zany humor and outrageous characters that are standard in many animated films, it still succeeds thanks to a more cerebral approach that includes more subtle comedy, as well as some surprisingly graphic (but effective) violence.  The film was also helped by some terrific casting decisions, and an ending that was especially great.

Not necessarily aimed at kids, in fact, probably not at all, what with the ageing Woody Allen barely known to those under 15, he was a perfect example of himself as we all know and love him - and starring alongside Stallone and Stone, with Dan Akroyd, Christopher Walken and Danny Glover all adding to the A-List name-dropping. All well worth their parts. A highly amusing film, the first half being non-stop laughing and amazement at the animation - the only time I noticed that it was actually computer generated was the end flooding scene...but I've tried animating water, and what they did was incredible......completely recommended to any one who likes any of the actors, or to people who just want some light entertainment - the social commentary and class struggle was well covered, and I can't find any major faults that you'll complain about after seeing this film.

Many of them only have two to three lines. ANTZ is the first major computer animated feature. It was released in '98 when everything was new.

"Z isn't just for zero, and don't you forget it.","Contrary to the suggestion in the trivia section, this is not the most commercially successful film involving Woody Allen, although it probably is the most successful in which he is an actor. Both Annie Hall (1977) and Midnight in Paris (2011) were massive box-office successes. Some say Annie is the most successful when you take into account inflation etc, but purely on the numbers, this, ANTZ, is the most successful movie with the Woody Allen character in a leading role.And what a cast he is leading! It's a roll call of the famous from the 1990s, and plenty of them are still famous today. I can well believe Allen contributed to the script, even if uncredited. And did Stallone really do his part for free? That's charming.This movie is sort of Logan's Run meets Star Wars meets Animal Farm, and its full of hilarious stereotypes (the wasps who treat the runaway ants as pity cases - Eurotrash - and the dungbeetles as stoners, the gung-ho soldiers and the officious little inspector ants, etc). Politically it kind of toys with communism, showing both the advantages of revolution but also the inevitable pitfalls of a new order, with General Mandible a stand-in for every 20th century despotic purifier of the races you can recall (right or left wing, it doesn't matter: go far enough to the extreme and you meet the other extremity).Allen is superb as Z, the worker ant who dares to ask why and what for? As the trivia points out, lots of people in the movie worked with Allen on his own movies (Stallone, Stone, Hackman, Walken, Aykroyd). Sharon Stone got one of her first roles in an Allen pic (Stardust Memories, 1980) and they worked together again later on Fading Gigolo (2013, dir. Turturro). Playing the role of Princess Bala reveals a quality in Stone that one might not have registered, a certain hauteur, a confidence fit for command. I wonder if she has directed much? Stallone, Glover, and Jennifer Lopez are all charming in the smaller but vital roles as Z's friends.I can't comment on how this stacks up against A Bugs Life (also 1998), not having seen it. Apparently the plots are quite similar. All I can say is that Antz is dramatic and intelligent, satiric, funny, playfully nodding its head to a lot of movies both classic and contemporary, and managing to be pretty darn exciting (the termite battle, the water droplet and chewing gum scenes, and the lake flood) and also sweetly romantic. The intense scenes are a bit scary, in a good way. It has a stellar cast and doesn't go on too long, no matter how old you are.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The story was great, the casting was great, the computer work was excellent.  Definitely a movie for all ages.

The animation is absolutely outstanding -- it will blow your mind from frame 1.  The story as a whole is definitely targeted to an adult audience -- note the 7 or 8 profanities and/or sexual references -- and the movie has some great lines.

8 on a scale of 10,"Antz was an interesting movie with excellent animation. I watched it with another adult and 7 & 8 year old girls. Everyone liked it.There were scenes of violence and some language issues, but overall, considering how much kids know today, I thought it was acceptable.The most interesting thing about the movie was guessing the voices. We missed most of the initial credits - catching only the last one which included Sharon Stone. Though I could see her speaking, I became convinced that it was the ditzy brunette on  Just Shoot Me. Then, I decided it was Diane Keaton. In fact, even the facial animation reminded me of Diane Keaton. And, of course, it made sense that she would be Woody Allen's love interest. If you haven't watched it yet, think of those two. Anyway, I was so positive that it was her, I bet $10 against it being Sharon Stone - even though we both saw her name listed and I couldn't figure out who else Stone would be. I may be stupid, but at least I'm $10 poorer.... but I swear it was Diane Keaton!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Woody Allen as a cartoon character?  You betcha!,"A previous reviewer erroneously commented that ""Antz"" was released a year after ""A Bug's Life""; I distinctly remember that it was released a month BEFORE the latter. Comparisons between the two may abound, and most people told me that the latter - which I've never seen - was better, but I'm content just knowing the former. As is well known, it portrays Z (Woody Allen) trying to come to terms with his life as a worker ant while also trying to develop a relationship with Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), and in the process uncovers a conspiracy. You read that right: a cartoon dealing with a conspiracy.All in all, this is a very neat movie. Aside from one clever idea after another (""...get in touch with my inner maggot...""), the cast is quite impressive: Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, and Sylvester Stallone, to name a few. ""Antz"" is a movie that anyone can like.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
All star voice cast brings this to life.,"Woody Allen lends his distinctive voice and personality to the role of ""Z"", a lowly worker ant in an ant colony. He's become awfully tired of his inconspicuous, drab existence, and the idea of living only to follow orders. He becomes smitten with the colony's princess (voice of Sharon Stone), and in order to impress her, switches places with his soldier pal Weaver (voice of Sylvester Stallone), and inadvertently becomes a war hero. But what he really wants is to find a fabled ""Insectopia""; he must also expose the nefarious plan of a general named Mandible (voice of Gene Hackman).Written by Chris & Paul Weitz, with Todd Alcott, this is a funny and clever animated comedy from Dreamworks and PDI, the company that hit it big with the ""Shrek"" series. It does have a message about the benefits of thinking and acting for oneself, but it wouldn't really be for the youngest of viewers in one's family. There is some mild intensity and language. It would indeed have the most resonance for Allen fans, although the whole cast is well utilized. Other celebrities voicing characters are Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin as a pair of wasps, Anne Bancroft as the Queen ant, Danny Glover as a soldier ant, Jennifer Lopez as a worker named Azteca, John Mahoney as an old barfly ant, Paul Mazursky as Z's psychologist, Christopher Walken as a loyal colonel, and Grant Shaud as a foreman.There's enough slick animation, visual effects, and action sequences to make it all pretty fun, along with good music by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell. Some grandiose gags involve the comparative size of ants to humans, as Z and Bala discover a picnic spread. People are sure to love the character designs, and be amused by the philosophical exchange between a mosquito and a beetle.Solid entertainment, overall.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
fantastic,Antz i think was a good movie. A movie by dreamworks. I really liked this movie. It was made in 1998. I still like A Bug's life better than this one because it was also animated and it was created by the creators of toy story. I give this movie 10 out of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is a work of dreams!,"I don't know where to start but first I would like to say that I watched this movie second time because I believe my subconscious remindered me to watch this movie again. I was looking inspiration from old wise animation movies I don't know why but mostly I was desperate. However, after I watched the movie with tremendous attention I wanted to read the reviews as much as I can. After I read up to 200 reviews I realized I agreed all voters who voted 7 out of 10 and higher votes. That's why I voted yes as helpful to them and don't want to repeat them in my review. They are absolutely right. I also agreed some lower voters for some reasonable reasons such as language and little details for adults but I can say that I watched that movie when I was 9 years old as an introvert and I didn't bad effected about movie's language or any adult content. of course I didn't understand much the movie either but know I laughed so hard and understood the movie with all its beautiful little details. The movie is awesome. It is truly work of dreams. I would definitely let watch this movie to my children if I had because the movie is engraved in audience's subconscious with all good, real and required aspects of life to children. By the way most of lower voters are biased to movie with off topic reasons such as bad language, adult jokes, hatred to woody allen, being not deep-minded etc. There is no need to watch trailer or getting any extra details for this movie. Just watch it if you are mature enough to understand some details. By the way, there is also little details like the meaning of the words such as main character's middle name etc which is for adults to understand of course. I loved that movie. I will put it to my top lists. Thanks DreamWorks! For bringing those awesome, meaningful animated movies into our life. This movie is totally different than dreamworks' other movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty Good Stuff,"ANTZ *** (outta ****)I personally think A Bug's Life is far better than Antz, mostly because A Bug's Life is funnier, longer, and better characters. But, as good this is probably the best thing Woody Allen has done in years.The movie has a interesting story while making the visuals pop up right in front of you. It is pure magic for Dreamworks (who also did Shrek) to amaze us with such technology. It's not that Pixar is any better in computer animation, but the computer anime in Antz just dosen't live up to the astonishing animation of that of Pixar.I have to say though, maybe Antz had better vocal talents and famous actors to voice there characters, while all A Bug's Life had was Kevin Spacey. I don't think that makes the film any worse or better, but it certainly had better vocal talents.There isn't much to say about Antz, I enjoyed the film, but I had too high of expectations for it, and it let me down. But don't get me wrong, its still an enjoyable movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Antz Review,"Antz is a film directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. I decided not to watch or read anything regarding this film before watching the film. After finally watching it, I can say that I enjoyed the whole 87 minutes of this film.Plot: Z, a worker ant decides to impersonate as a soldier ant just to impress the Princess Bala.Story and direction: The film released at a time when CGI animation was just starting. This film is also famous because of its similarities with A BUG'S LIFE. But let me tell you these two films are poles apart in terms of content. This film mainly focuses on the issue of making your own choices rather than just doing the things just because someone told you to. This theme is very relevant in modern times and it has been very clearly justified in the film. There are many adult references in the film which also made it very different considering at the time animated films were aimed for the children. Also, the designs for the characters are amazing. The voice work was aptly chosen. Finally, the music of the film was great and was like sugar to the ears. What I did have a problem with was the animation itself. Three years before this we had a film like Toy Story which is considered as a landmark in terms of animated CGI films. The animation was not impressive with this one, but I laud the effort that the makers went to in order to make this film.Favorite Scene: It would be the first interaction between Bala and Z and then the dance in the scene thereafter. This scene caught on to my mind because this particular scene justifies the basic theme of the film of doing something different than others so that you can be unique.Verdict: Although I won't say that this is one of the best animated films of all time, but I do say that this film deserves a watch. With 87 minutes as the runtime, I did feel entertained for the whole time. I never felt for a moment that the film even diverted my attention, which is a huge credit for any film.I am going with an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A funny & refreshing fare with traditional themes.,"For all his faults, Allen is (& probably always has been), the best comedy writer for the screen. In fact, he's done many non-comedy movies that have been fantastic, including ""Midnight In Paris"", which the wife and I have watched at least three times..First, this is a cartoon kids ""could"" watch; but it is truly animation for adults. And I'm not alluding to merely sex, (of which there are a few allusions), but honestly, everything in the flick.Comedy Example: Early on, this piece made me laugh. Woody Allen's character, ""Z"", (our star), is in the psychiatrist's office, expressing his discontent around his entire life being arbitrarily dedicated to digging & moving tiny pieces of earth. At one point, Z dejectedly says to the Shrink, ""I just feel so insignificant.""
When they're all done, the psychiatrist says to Z, ""Congratulations Z! You've made a breakthrough!""
Z smiles & excitedly replies ""I have!?!?"" The smiling shrink says ""Yes! You ARE insignificant!""Good story line. And it's got it all.Our protagonist: ""Z"", our rebel. He's trulydefiANT. It's just by chance, that he comes to know the princess. One evening, Princess Bala decided to ""slum it"". So, with a couple of her girlfriends in tow, she went down and had a drink at the bar where the grunts drink, dance & relax in the evening. And of course, the moment their eyes meet, (even though
she's not his daughter), WoodyZ Allen has to have her.Our antagonist & BAD guy; (General Mandable), very aptly portrayed by Gene Hackman. The psychotic General has designs on pretty much killing all of the ants in the colony for his own insane reasons. He knows how to control and manipulate the masses.Love: Sharon Stone is absolutely delightful as Princess Bala. And when she gets caught with Z, there's your foundation for a love story. She is stuck up, yet bored & looking for some action.WarAdventureComedyWithout giving too much away, what's cool about this movie, is the quest. Most of the fun is had on Z & Princess Bala's adventure above the colony, on earth, searching for the legendary, ""Insectopia"".Sly Stallone (Weaver), is just great as Z's best friend. He's a soldier, unlike Z (who is merely a ""soil relocation"" worker .). Weaver plays a critical role in accidentally getting Z into trouble, and of course, Z's adventure.There's a short stint, where the cowardly Z gets caught up in a suicidal war against termites, and in the process, witnesses the ugliness of death that war brings. And, it's actually very effective & heartfelt. This reality is accentuated by the painful death of Z's new found friend, (and soldier) Barbatus (Danny Glover),Anne Bancroft does a great job as the queen albeit a small part; and the same goes for Christopher Walken as Colonel Cutter, (General Mandible's main hatchet man). Cutter has a key role at the end of the movie.I saw this movie many years after it was released. I just assumed it was a children's movie, which I'm sure many others did as well.When I did see it, it was just a small part that happened to be running on the tube, wherever I was at the time. But after laughing a couple of times, during that small piece, I opted to watch the whole movie shortly thereafter.I think we have this on DVD. It's on a bookshelf in the den with maybe a 1000 others.Yes, there's a statement around ""individualism vs collectivism"". And there's a bit of irony here:
Z represents the individualism, but in an environment that absolutely thrives on collectivism.But what's more, is (in real life), Woody's own party has gone completely off the rails, and now represent everything he has so vehemently detested his entire life.That aside;Always good for a laugh and yes I do recommend. It's a nice departure, and an easy, & fun/funny watch.It gets a 10 rating because of the aforementioned points I've made, along with the fact that I've continued to enjoy it more than two additional viewings. And inevitably, will again in the future.Thx

For 8 and up,"This is one of my favorite movies, but I have seen it so many times that it's lower on my list. The movie is PG and really pushes the rating.

There is also a graphic war scene that could be compared to Saving Private Ryan, a film that came out the same year. It's not for the little ones, if you want to show them a similar movie, show A Bug's Life, it came out the same year. This also has an all star including but not limited to Woody Allen, Stallone, Anne Bancroft, Sharon Stone, Christopher Walken, Gene Hackman, and others.

Fun family film featuring Woody Allen and Sharon Stone.,"I thoroughly enjoy this animation/CGI production, although the quality is not up to par with what we have, today. The main characters are well developed and easy to adopt as focal interest points.The story is quite well-written and delivered, the colors are bright and crisp, and helped to sell the DVD media to the average civilian. Even today, the content is still better than that of, ""A Bug's Life,"" which just basically has a few characters bouncing one-liners off each other. At least this movie has a STORY!Woody Allen's character is the star...and an Ant. He was classified ""worker"" as larvae and he's having a few problems with that classification. He feels inadequately judged and pigeon-holed by this assignment, and lets the whole world know it via Allen's nasal whining. There is something better in the world for him, and he is sure he could find and attain it, if only he had the chance. Finally, he realizes that he has to take the chance; opportunity doesn't come on its own to the normal people.There is a nice sub-plot and a strong main plot; well developed characters and a star-studded cast of voice and likeness donors in this adventurous and entertaining story.All in all it earns an 8.2/10 from... the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a very interesting film if you can overlook the language.,"I viewed this film by myself on the Wednesday before it opened and was really interested in the film until the Stallone character used the h--- word.  Now it was clear why it did not receive a G rating, however, the rest of the film was very good.  I don't know why they put in the 4 or 5 uses of bad language but if you can overlook that, I recommend seeing it.  The patrons at the theatre I work at have seemed to disregard the language content of the movie saying 'my kid's here worse on TV' but there were a few that decided to leave changing over to The Parent Trap instead (The only other PG or G movie we had).The movie itself is really good.  The computer animation is not PIXAR (Disney) calibre but a close (very close) substitute.  I will be really interested to see future releases from Dreamworks animation (Such as The Prince of Egypt in December). Also, this movie actually has somewhat of a story.  It's not just a bunch of bugs dancing around.  See this movie if you can, and if you're worried about your kids--watch it first before you take them and form your own opinion about the content.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great night out,"This is GREAT fun.  The animation is just terrific, but this alone doesn't make a good film; what do the animators have to work with?The plot is good and the screenwriters pull off some snappy dialogue, but the real plaudits have to go to Casting; the voices are perfect.  For the first time in a film, I found myself warming to Woody Allen (Z) rather than wanting to smack him in the chops and tell him to get a grip.  A little restraint means that he's winning rather than whinging.The film also avoids two animation bogeys: 1) The human is only seen from about the knees down (Toy Story's whole make-believe world fell apart when they introduced the kids; they weren't REAL enough!) and 2) There weren't any `cute sidekicks'.  These are starting to be a real pain in Disney films and, from the trailers I've seen, it looks like we'll have to endure them in `Bug's Life'.I didn't notice any bad language, but I suppose all this might prove is how constant exposure inures us to it.  Yes, there are some dark moments but, in the UK, Antz does have a Parental Guidance rating.And, anyway, who says animated films have to be for kids?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A thoroughly enchanting blend of animation and satire, ""Antz"" will thrill the entire family!","""Antz"" is a thoroughly involving film, filled to the brim with lovingly constructed visuals and a number of clever plot twists.  If it contained nothing more than entertaining visuals and humorous characters, the film would be perfectly acceptable.  But the creators didn't rest on their laurels; surprisingly, ""Antz"" sneaks a fair amount of social commentary into its frames.  It's not hard to recognize ourselves and modern society in the movie, which is perhaps the reason the tale works so well: we all know people who act like the various inhabitants of the ant hill.The intelligence of the screenplay was one of the biggest (and nicest) surprises for me.  In addition to the predictable (though admittedly well done) gags involving magnifying glasses and picnics, ""Antz"" depicts a level of religious satire uncommon in what's ostensibly a kids' movie.  Social satire also appears -- the story's biggest laugh comes when an insightful worker ant experiences a revelation: ""The workers control the means of production!""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun for all ages.,"This movie is fun to watch for kids but adults will also find this movie very entertaining and they might even like it more then the kids because of some clever adult jokes.Let me first say that the animations are totally wonderful. They were wonderful and revolutionary back in 1998 and in a way they still are now.The voice cast is amazing. Have there ever been so many famous persons involved in an animated movie? The voice cast isn't just big, it also is very well casted. Woody Allen plays a typical Woody Allen character that works really well for the movie and Gene Hackman is wonderful as the villain.The story itself is very simple and because of that very accessible for everyone. The movie also contains some very good and memorable scene's such as ""the big shoe"" that actually is a great piece of action. A surprise was the attack on the termites sequence, it was very rich of action and gore and seemed to come straight out of ""Starship Troopers"", like Paul Verhoeven himself directed the scene. I liked it a lot!Another thing that really added to the movie was the soundtrack by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams.

Glistening visuals combine with an excellent voice cast and a clever script to make a superb movie.,"Antz is a genuinely clever film, which should appeal to people of all ages but is geared more for adults. While equally impressive CG movies such as Shrek and Ice Age were hilarious and often laugh-out-loud funny, Antz settles for dry wit and clever anecdotes.But what this film is best for is its glamorous and well-developed voice cast. The main character, Z, is voiced by Woody Allen so to get full enjoyment out of this film really depends on whether you like Woody Allen or not. Most of the other voices are easily recognisable and are given plenty of conviction. Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Christopher Walken, Sharon Stone and Jennifer Lopez. Some of the other voice talents don't have many lines and aren't quite as recognisable. `Third Rock From the Sun's' Jane Curtin, Dan Akroyd, `Frasier's' John Mahoney.There are a few slow moments in the script but it does consistently entertain. Some of the jokes will only really appeal to adults and the film is a tad short, but these are only minor flaws.Far superior to Disney's A Bug's Life, which was released at about the same time, Antz is a hugely enjoyable movie, which is well worth a look. 8.1 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fable for contemporary neuroses,"""Antz"" is an enjoyable, engaging contemporary fable that gracefully illuminates the value of group cooperation as well as personal individuality and integrity.  The voice casting is gleefully on target; you can't help but love a movie that includes both Woody Allen and Sylvester Stallone.  The computer animation is absolutely first-rate, drawing the viewer into the story rather than calling attention to itself; the individual characters voiced by Allen, Stallone, and Sharon Stone are especially effective.  In its heart of hearts, this is a Woody Allen picture--the situations, humor, and neuroses are all classic Allen.  The opening and closing panoramas make it clear that the movie itself knows that it's a Woody Allen picture.  The movie may be a bit too intense in places for extremely young children; one battle scene, featuring an assault upon the ants by monolithic termites, bears more than a passing resemblance to the ""bug attack"" sequences featured in last year's ""Starship Troopers.""  DreamWorks is to be especially commended for resisting the marketing temptation so eagerly embraced by Disney in ""A Bug's Life.""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overall Good but I won't buy it,"I thought the movie was quite good.  Unfortunately, I have my own guidelines that makes a movie something I would buy for my video collection.  This one is not one of those movies.  I have a problem with any movie where they decide to stick in the token foul language to get that one spark of interest from that one small market segment.

If one can cheer, cry, laugh or basically adore Z & Princess Bala which are only pretend animated non-existent painted plastic boards then I think the movie has achieved something that Warner Brothers cartoons could not. Do yourself a favour and see it.Oh yeah...I'll never step on an ant ever again!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny for kids and grown-ups,"The great thing about Antz is adults and kids alike can enjoy it, and how rare is that for a cartoon? Because of the cast, adults will find it hilarious. If Woody Allen voices a worker ant, of course he's going to be in therapy! He's going to be diminutive, and the ant Sylvester Stallone voices is going to be brawny. Children who don't know the men and women behind the voices will still love it (I speak from experience) because it's a funny story.The queen aunt is Anne Bancroft, and she relies on the expert opinion of a respected war general, Gene Hackman. Gene wants to marry the princess, Sharon Stone, but his feelings are one-sided. One night while slumming it in a nightclub, Sharon shares a dance with a lowly worker ant, Woody Allen, and he's smitten. When a war breaks out, Woody and his friends are given their marching orders. Yes, they literally sing ""The ants go marching one by one"" as they head off to battle. Many of the jokes are tongue-in-cheek, or puns about insects, but there's also realism and tragedy in the story to keep the adults happy. After all, there's a violent war and some of the ants die. I saw this movie in the theaters when I was a kid, and while I found parts of it sad, I enjoyed the sweet, funny cartoon. Keep your ears open to also recognize Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, and Jane Curtin.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
**** out of ****,"In my view, some of the best movies are those that show the viewer something from a never before seen world/existence.  This could be our world, just seen from a different perspective, or it could be an entirely new world, that we never even conceived could exist (like in one of my favorite films, ""Dark City"").  Antz falls into the first category.The very first shot sets the tone of the film, when we see the shadowy outlines of what appear to be skyscrapers in the horizon, only to discover that they are merely blades of grass. After a terrific introduction to the lead character/ant Z, played by Woody Allen (in his best role to date that I have seen), the viewer is given a first look at the ant colony.  It is here that one sees the extremes to which the filmmakers have taken their technological advances.The creators took something as simple as an ant hill, and created an awe-inspiring visual tour-de-force.  Many people argue that ""A Bugs Life"" was the superior film when it came out, but this opening shot tops anything you see in that film (not that that movie isn't fantastic as well).  The first half of Antz takes place inside of this world, with one exception (the termite war, which I'll go into later) but in the second half, the animators top themselves by taking Z and another ant, Princess Bala, out into our world.It is here that the film becomes, in essence, a computer animated, and vastly superior remake of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."" Blades of grass tower over the ants, and drops of water can be fatal.  Eventually, they find themselves at a picnic (a fitting place for two ants to end up), and Z speaks one of my 2 favorite lines (I won't ruin it, but it involves the plastic wrapping around a sandwich).  Unfortunately, the biggest problem I had with the movie occurred during this, otherwise great scene.  Towering above the ants are various, giant forms of product placement, such as cans of Pepsi and Mountain Dew.  At this point, it feels like the movie has turned into a commercial.The climax to this scene involves the two ants stuck by gum to the bottom of a shoe.  Z's line right before they are released from the gum is the other of my 2 favorite lines.  The delivery is hilarious.In fact, the whole movie is hilarious.  As I stated earlier, there is a battle sequence between the ants and some termites (with the song ""The Ants Go Marching Home Again"" triumphantly playing in the background) that, as expected, was truly fantastic.  The final conversation during this scene, between Z and another ant played be Danny Glover, is very unexpected, but highly humorous.  It was a terrific way to end the most intense part of the film (for a kid's movie).In short, this is not a film for everyone.  Many children will be bored, and I have talked to many people who did not have the same reaction I did. However, as far as I am concerned, this was one of the best films of 1998, and I was very upset when I found out it didn't get any Academy Award nominations.  But then again, many terrific films were ignored, while many mediocre films were heaped with nominations.After seeing a movie like this, I can only imagine what ground-breaking films we have to look forward to.  I only hope they can pull more off that are as good as this.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pleasant surprise!,"I never thought that I would welcome the sight of ""Antz"" in a theatre, but after last nights (9/29/98) Sneak Preview, I was pleasantly surprised. I will admit, I went into this film with a closed mind, thinking that Disney had absolutely nothing to worry about.  But after a few minor projectionist glitches early on, I soon found myself engrossed into this film. Not only is the animation totally believable, and the attention to detail awe inspiring, but also the story kept us into the entire film.  I cannot recall any points where the film seemed to drag. Also, be aware that this is not a ""slap-on-you-knee"" comedy.  I would say that it is more of a satire. And, not that it is rated PG due to some language.

It started out well, but 30 minutes into the film it slowed.  The brakes were only on for a short time as we moved into the last quarter of the film.  The military coup in the colony as led by Gene Hackmans, Gen. Mandible was very entertaining, and the resuce of the colony by Z and Cutter was a master stroke of story writing.All in all, I rather enjoyed this film and look forward to more releases from this studio.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good animated adventure.,"Without going into how good the animation is and the Computer graphics the thing that really stands out in this film is how the famous actors who do the voices really fit the characters. The ants that have the voices done by Sylvester Stalone,Christopher Walken ,Woody Allen and Gene Hackman are so well animated they have the same manorisms as the actors themselves. I wouldnt say the film is quite as good as Toy story or Chicken run but in the Kids movie stakes this rates as one of the best.

"A really clever movie, that actually reaches all ages.","Stars: Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Christopher Walken, Jane Curtin, Jennifer Lopez, and Danny Glover.This is a clever comedy that was one of the first of it's kind...an animated movie that's fairly kid friendly, but also geared towards adults. This film is about worker ant Z, that wants to be a soldier ant, but picks the wrong time to switch with his friend Weaver (Stallone). He ends up in a war with the termites, these huge acid spewing creatures, and gets trapped in a hole in the ground becoming the only surviving ant. The film ends off where he kidnaps the princess, and trouble ensues. This is one of the best computer animated movies of the late 90's!

Starting with a Bang!,"Like how Pixar started off strong with Toy Story, DreamWorks also has a film that cranked their engine up nicely, its called Antz. It is a film that not only has a great story, animation, and characters, but one that belongs with the legends of animated films. After this, DreamWorks would shortly become Disney's greatest competitor. And this would only be the first of many successes in DreamWorks' lineup. Now let talk about what made this so great. First the story is very realistic. And the way the ants work actually seem like what they would actually be. The ants all look different, making them all easily recognizable. And the animation although dated, looks impressive for a first time animated studio. I'd say the animation is on par with Toy Story. Of course no film is perfect. The negatives are that although the story is realistic it does have many similarities to A Bug's Life. I know the whole story involving Disney and Katzenburg but don't get me started on that. The film did come out before A Bug's Life meaning that maybe A Bug's Life is the least creative. So with that said, Antz is the more original film. There however isn't much else to gripe about and the animation is just a nitpick, in 1998 it does look very impressive. Luckily, unlike Don Bluth, Amblimation, and Fox Animation, DreamWorks managed to stay for a long time to come. Antz helped to kick off one of the best companies working today. Now to grade.

i liked it,"This was a good animated movie. While it followed a formula, I still liked it. I think it had a great voice cast, and the story and animation were good as well. In it, a worker ant named Z is getting bored with his humdrum existence and becomes smitten with an ant princess who sneaks into a bar where Z hangs out one night. Z then convinces a soldier ant named Weaver to switch places with him so that he can try to woo the princess. (named Bala) Of course, Z and Bala wind up getting lost together, and they have to find their way home.I think there were many memorable scenes (such as the ""wrecking ball"" scene, the scenes in ""insectopia"", the battle scenes with the termites, and the ladder scene towards the end), and overall the movie was good.

This and A Bug's Life are the best animated features of 1998.,I remember and going and seeing ANTZ back in October of 1998 and I absolutely loved it! This and its competitor A Bug's Life are the best animated features of 1998. In the movie Z a worker ant meets Bala a princess in a bar and falls in love. He asks his buddy Weaver the soldier ant to switch places with him! Then Z goes off and fights some termites and then returns to colony and meets up with Princess Bala and then takes her on an adventure to Insectopia where ants can be free but Z and Bala know they must return to the colony to stop evil General Mandible who's planning to rule the colony! Filled with hilarious scenes and funney characters Antz like A Bug's Life is the perfect film for the whole family!

Too Smart for its Own Good...,"Great films often have one thing in common; the first minutes make you certain that you're going to encounter awesomeness many times.And surprisingly, in the case of ""Antz"", I had that impression before the very first minute ended (not counting the opening credits). I should mention that Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and storytellers, because when the opening shot showed a shadowy silhouette of what looked like a pre-2001 New York City and when I heard the voice of Woody Allen in voice-over, deep inside, I knew it was going to be a very special experience. And I wasn't disappointed.So the shadows unveil tall grass looking down on an anthill where we can hear Z' whining to (guess what) his psychiatrist. His mother abandoned him, he never knew his father and he feels somewhat insignificant. Yes, we've heard that before, but the masterstroke is to have adapted Woody Allen's usual shtick for the ants' world. The anthill is designed to look like a vast and complex metropolis where one can easily develop deep feeling of rejections if he has a mother whose daily occupation consists on laying eggs. When the number of children is to be counted on millions, this is not your usual middle-child syndrome and Z elevates the Allenian existential crisis to its most hilarious heights.And I admire Dreamworks for picking the most unlikely protagonist for not for any animated film, but their first one, their ""Toy Story"". And for its first hit, DreamWorks recreated a very convincing Orwellian society, a world where ants are conditioned from the start, checked at their birth and selected to be either soldiers or workers. Z is a worker, he doesn't like his job much, there's more exciting work than digging holes and demolishing rocks, but as a natural-born pacifist, he doesn't want to be a soldier either. In fact, Z only wishes he could have a choice, to be able to take his own decisions. If children wouldn't necessarily care for Woody Allen, Z's personal issues are handled in a way that can even appeal to a younger audience. If anything, ""Antz"" is like a kids' introduction to Woody Allen.But let's not make it too centered on our lovable neurotic loser. As central as Z is, we also get to know his friends, a gentle solidly-built soldier voiced by Sylvester Stallone, a co-worker voiced by Jennifer Lopez, and at the top of the hierarchy, you have Princess Bala, voiced by Sharon Stone, her mother, the Queen, voiced by Anne Bancroft. Bala sounds like the typical Princess with a craving for freedom and self-accomplishment but actually, she's just curious to discover the outside world. She has no projects to cancel her marriage with General Mandible, the ambiguous Army Chief voiced by Gene Hackman, and whose right-hand man has the voice of Christopher Walken. You get it, this is a star-studded cast.But the voices are never distracting because the roles fit the actors' personalities and watching ""Antz"", you never feel like watching an 'animated film' but a film driven by fully written characters, not archetypes. And this contributes to very powerful sequences, there's one involving a fierce battle against termites, and this is almost as if ""Saving Private Ryan"" was made into animation, and I admire that. I love how DreamWorks went as far as making a soldier (Danny Glover) die in the arms of Z and not make a cliché out of it. I often blamed DreamWorks for relying too much on pop-culture tropes and celebrities but this is one of these times where it drove the plot in a nuanced and efficient way.And the more I let ""Antz"" play in my mind, the more I reconsider my opinion about Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"", which made it in the box-office top 10 in 1998, unlike ""Antz"". But when I watched the Pixar's film, I knew I liked it but something was missing, too many characters I said in my review, I guess I meant 'not enough characterization', in ""Antz"", you have characters with opposite motives and opinions that sometimes overlap, but from these contrasts, believable and gripping conflicts result, not to mention very funny interactions. I can see why DreamWorks producers were so bugged about ""A Bug's Life"", this is a case where the lesser film won. Or maybe we should try to see what went wrong with ""Antz"".Maybe it's the look of the ""Antz"", too brownish, too geometrical, compared to the cuter rotund faces of Disney, or the fact that you can't really sell a film to the kids if the main voice is Woody Allen, or maybe the parents thought one ant-themed film for the year was enough. Maybe there were improvements to be made in the visuals' department and looking at the following movie ""Shrek"", you can tell DreamWorks adopted a more Disney-like style without abandoning their tongue-in-cheek and adult friendly humor. And as a matter of fact, I wonder if the Pixar animators didn't try to pull some 'Antz"" humor in their 2001 movie ""Monsters & Inc."" It's funny how the two rival studios can inspire one another.So, if ""A Bug's Life"" is a good film, ""Antz"" is a great one, so great it made the last Top 10 from the late critic Gene Siskel. It's even greater because you could tell the writers spent a few time studying ants and adapted some scientific facts into the film, the way they form a giant ball, the decapitated hand still capable to talk, the soldiers vs. workers shift. They could also add some human political questionings and philosophical issues like individualism vs. collectivity, and even feature war and romance. The film's as multi-layered as its underground setting.Or maybe that was the problem, it was just too smartly 'underground' for its own good.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good in it's own right..,"Okay, as almost everyone already knows, Antz is part of the film battle list including films of similar style and story released during the same year. IE Antz/A Bugs Life. I think both films are very good, but most would probably say A Bugs Life takes the cake. Yeah, that's only because Disney, one of the biggest film companies in the world was backing it, along with every other Pixar movie for that matter. I thought A Bugs Life was good, but was too much like a kids movie for me. I think personally Antz appealed to a wider audience. Maybe not for little kids, but a wider audience none the less. I guess it's the mild level of vulgarity in Dreamworks animated movies that I like. They are a little more lenient with swearing and such, and ""cruder"" humor. Where as Disney has a threshold on making sure all dialogue is pretty much censored. So, in my opinion Antz is the winner. Just as funny as A Bugs Life, and actually it was a little more ""real"".

Deeper than I thought,"This movie was wonderful. Yes, it looks great, has a great voice cast and great characters and a sweet love story, but next to all that this movie actually has something to say. When I sat down tonight to watch this on TV I expected to watch a funny, not so deep, easy movie, so I was surprised by the deeper meaning of it.The story is about the ant Z, who is a worker in a colony. He is very depressed and has the feeling that there has to be more to life than his boring job. When he meets princess Bala in a bar he immediately falls head over heals in love with her. Because of this love he is switching with his friend Weaver a soldier, so he can meet the princess again. But things start to go wrong when he ends up in a heavy battle and returns from it as the only survivor and hero. The story goes on as Z ""accidently"" kidnaps Bala and together they have several adventures, before the spectacular end scene.This movie is about choices, about equality, about standing up for what you believe in. The plan of the main villain, the general, has very obvious references to WW2 and Hitler. Also the references to 1984, the famous George Orwell novel, are very present. This movie has it all.But Antz is also still a movie for kids. This is what makes this movie so great for everyone to watch. Small kids (but not to small I think) could enjoy this for the visuals, it's adventure and it's humor, while the parents could enjoy this movie on a deeper level.All in all, I would highly recommend this movie for everybody above the age of eight.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A childhood favourite of mine, and it's still good stuff twenty years since it came out.","Antz is '90s entertainment embodied in CGI: it's got an underdog character named Z (voiced by Woody Allen) reluctant about the world he's stuck in, and of course the underdog gets a girl, Sharon Stone's Princess Bala, has a celebrity-voiced best-friend in Sylvester Stallone's Weaver and of course there's the menacing all-rotten baddie General Mandible voiced by Gene Hackman. Antz may be derivative of other movies but it worked in introducing audiences with CG-animation in cinema outside of PIXAR's Toy Story. And Woody Allen is of course a joy to listen to in the movie.Antz is a movie's movie and it deserves a watch for its period-specific charm and for showing people how DreamWorks came to compete with PIXAR in the long-run.

Dreamworks have found a formula which seems set to turn 'Toontown on its head, and I believe that a spate of similar movies will follow.

Also, casting Woody Allen as the voice of Z was a stroke of genius.  Like Robin Williams in ALADDIN, he makes it funny just by showing up.  The other actors doing voices were all good as well.

Smarter than A Bug's Life but not quite as fun.,"I always love a good animated film or TV show that can entertain both children and adults, like Toy Story or Shrek or The Simpsons, and while Antz is definitely aimed at pleasing both its older and younger audience members, there is something about it that is not quite as fun as its animated counterpart. There were numerous movies that were released seemingly in pairs around the same time as Antz and A Bug's Life were released, with one of them being better or more successful than the other, and it's clear to me that A Bug's Life is the superior film in this case. Antz, however, is certainly brilliantly written (like a lot of Woody Allen's best work), but unfortunately the film is not as versatile as I imagine was hoped.Part of the problem may just be that Woody Allen is so recognizable. From the second Z starts talking Allen's neurotic, spectacled face jumps off the screen at you as if he were really there, waving his arms frantically. But his character is given great lines and there is certainly a lot of charming characters. I am reminded of some other ""animated"" films in which the characters look and act like the actors doing their voices, like The Polar Express or the recent and highly disappointing A Scanner Darkly. Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, and Danny Glover all star as their animated selves, and this is one of the movie's charms.The story, however, and especially the message, is amazing in its importance and clever delivery. We are introduced to a colony of ants that all mindlessly go about their age-old jobs supporting the hive, when suddenly one of them breaches that line that separates humans from animals, he starts thinking for himself. He begins to lament that his own personal needs are overlooked completely as he does everything to support the colony. There is a charming scene where all of the ants are dancing at a cleverly designed insect bar, and while they all dance in an insect-like unison, Z decides he's had enough of the conformity and cuts loose on the dance floor. He immediately charms the beautiful (as beautiful as an insect can get, I guess) and engaged Princess Bala, who is immediately drawn to his sense of freedom and individuality.There are a couple of militaristic ants, perfectly named General Mandible and Colonel Cutter and played by Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken, who are obsessed with the defense of the colony and want to divert all resources to the build up of the military. They even give the queen false reports of an impending invasion of the far superior termites in order to convince the queen that they must act before its too late.Lately I have been learning a lot about Chinese history, and this is astonishing in the similarity to the way Mao Tse-tung deliberately inflated the possibility of an impending American invasion of China so that he could convince Stalin to give him the resources and expertise needed to build a nuclear bomb. Or the way he would commonly instigate action from Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang so that he could make a massacre look like self- defense. Thankfully, when it happens in Antz it is much less scary!The movie is filled with stunning visual sequences, many of them brilliantly inspired by the real lives of ants, with others that are clearly wild, but fun, flights of fancy .The animation is incredible and the script is intelligent, although there is just a tiny bit of Allen's unique style of comedy that doesn't fit very smoothly into an animated film, particularly one aimed mostly at adults. In a lot of ways, however, it does work. When praised for laughing in the face of death, Z comments in true Woody Allen form, ""Actually I stand behind Death and make belittling comments at its back.""There is a noted absence of cute showtoons and cloying romance in the movie, which even features a surprising amount of battle violence, a lot of which may very well put off some of the movie's youngest audience members. But it's also revealing about some of the unique physical characteristics of ants, like the one about how dismemberment may not quite kill them, but not the one about how it's almost literally impossible to drown ants. They can live for weeks underwater, but are given a human-like need for oxygen for the benefit of the plot.The end of the movie is a fun romp into the world outside the colony, and our heroes are clearly unprepared. There are some clever and brilliant things that happen to Z and Princess Bala, like getting stuck in a piece of gum of the bottom of a shoe on their search for ""Insectopia,"" a picnic.But the most important thing about the movie is the message. It's not about being yourself, but about not being the same as everyone else. After Z's brief military experience, he potently remembers a life-changing piece of advice given to him there.""Don't follow orders for the rest of your life.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent animation AND one of Woody Allen's best,"This is one of the best Woody Allen scripts I've seen in a long time.

"""All We Are Saying...is Give Z A Chance""","It has been said that this is not an animated feature for kids. Sorry, but today's kids are extremely sophisticated and are not going to be sidetracked or shocked by a few mild expletives, an alcoholic binge, or the deaths of some supporting characters. Some of Walt Disney's most beloved ""children's movies"" have this and more.The plot and characters are more philosophical and political but that does not distract from the overall story of love and teamwork coupled with individualism. However, the political and social conservatives will likely find the story content a bit too progressive.There is room for this type of a more cerebral and daring concept amidst the other sweet and straightforward films of this genre.This first Dreamwork answer to Pixar is certainly not as colorful and technically sophisticated but it is an excellent work that deserves its place in the world of early CGI cartoons.""all we are saying is...give Z a chance""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's still as poignant and funny as it was when I first saw it back in 1998,"Yes, Z basically is a slightly more child-friendly version of Woody Allen's movie persona and the film is Annie Hall with an action plot built around it, but it works, even though the way the movie started (you hear Woody Allen's voice from the off for a while before the animated ant he is voicing is revealed lying on his psychiatrist's couch) it initially was difficult for me to accept Woody's voice as the voice of this piece of animation which moves it's mouth in sync but - and of this I was convinced - is not Woody Allen. But this passed quickly and the symbiosis came to fruition. But it proves how problematic it can be to use the voice of such an iconic person for an animated character.The weakest element of the movie certainly is the villain, who is the cliché war mongering general who in this case doesn't even have a reasonable motive for his evil plans (he wants to drown the whole colony pretty much just because), which is made worse by the fact that he has the final say on all decisions in the colony, so the only one who can save the day is our Z, since everybody else would be negatively affected by the general's plans simply is clueless.The computer animation still looks good, although the motions don't always look as realistic as we got used by now. But the design of the ants still looks as unusual as it did the first day in a weirdly creative way. It also proved unexpectedly influential, as can be witnessed on MTV in the shape of Tila Tequila, whose team of plastic surgeons owes a lot to DreamWorks' creative minds in the art department. Who could have ever foreseen such an impact of ANTZ back in 1998, right? Talking about DreamWorks, this movie feels much more like a Pixar movie to me, given how clever it is and how much potential entertainment value for grownups it offers.Now I have spent the whole review on only listing all the things it doesn't do well and a few things it does well, while saying nothing about why it is as as important a movie as it is (apart from the surgeon influence). Well, unfortunately I have run all out of time now and the greatness that is ANTZ really is self-explanatory. Should you be ignorant to all the good things that it brings you certainly can't be helped and probably are blind and dumb or simply a Woody Allen hater, because ANTZ easily is one of the very best Woody Allen films - even without being a Woody Allen film.I rate it 9 out of 10 ant allegories which show us the insignificance of an individual in a mindless worker ant producing society that encourages unproductive work, and the power an individual can have to change at least his own life if he takes a stand against the system (and has a good portion of luck on his side as well).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The likes of Stallone, Lopez and Allen are perfectly suited to their roles and deliver one of there most memorable performances. Without giving too much away there is a battle scene which has a Starship Troopers-esque goriness that accentuates the horrors and futility in their lives that they are constantly burdoned with.

The Libertarian party should take the opportunity to set up registration tables outside every theater playing Antz!On a technical note, this film doesn't look to be nearly as advanced as Pixar's upcoming ""A Bug's Life"".  While Antz' achievements are still dazzling, they are no where near as sophisticated as what Pixar is putting out.  Antz is a lesson in the color brown, while A Bug's Life looks to be a rainbow of incredibly fine detail.  But, honestly, this doesn't matter a whole heck of a lot - people see movies for the story.  These excellent characters could have been hand-drawn stick figures and the film would have still played well.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful film in its own way,"""Antz"" is one of those movies that perhaps won't stick with us forever, but is still memorable and thought-provoking. Despite how it was promoted, this is not a children's movie. First of all, the swearing is a little too much for a child, and there are some pretty graphic sequences. Secondly, though this is nothing against the movie, the themes are too deep for a child to truly comprehend. A better kid's film about insects is ""A Bug's Life"" (which is also a fantastic movie). The anti-communistic motives and themes of individuality are well presented, and the voice acting is superb (Allen as the puny Z presents a perfectly whiny voice, that fits his character to a tee.) The menacing General Mandibly and his henchman, Cutter, are perfectly crafted by their respective voice actors. The overall plot is also terrific, and for what was to be a children's film, the termite v. ant battle is spectacularly done- very exciting. The overall idea of a lowly worker becoming a leader of his people has been done many times, and ""Antz"" sticks with a tried and true notion. If you can see the true ideas behind the cutesy insect animation, you wont be disappointed with ""Antz.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the greatest animated films of all time!,"This animated film by Dreamworks is very funny and is fantastic! It has an all-star cast which includes Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Woody Allen, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, and Dan Akroyd! All of the actors play their characters well and it is something else how these actors bring such much life and personality to these wonderful characters! I thought it was amazing that Curtin and Akroyd was a couple again! The animation is really incredible and I was amazed by the termite wars and the ant army marching scenes! They are so cool! The color is really clean and crisp and not to mention very clear. The story is very good and each and every character has their own personality. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell is very good as well. If you love the cast mentioned above and animated films that are hilarious then I strongly recommend then you check out Ants today!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Excellent Movie,"Antz, unlike Toy Story is a computer generated movie that is obviously not targeted at a younger audience.  The movie contains themes such as war, death, and adult humor (Woody Allen). The plot centers around one ant named Z who is one of the many ""workers"" of the colony. Relaxing at a bar, he bumps into a beautiful ant that turns out to be the princess of the colony.  Unfortunately, he's not allowed to see anyone in the upper class unless he's a ""warrior"".  The rest of the movie follows him on his journey of impersonating a ""warrior"" and rescuing the princess. The movie is very funny and the voices of Stallone, Stone, Allen, and Walken, work very well with the characters.  The computer images are amazing, showing things such as soda cans and drinking fountains as gargantuan structures.  Don't miss this movie, it's a movie presently like no other.  You'll get a lot of action, humor, and even romance.  We'll see how A Bug's Life compares to this.  I gave this movie an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A thrilling experience in acting, technology and story.",I saw this movie a while ago and I must say that it's the best animated movie I have. I left the cinema with an enormous smile on my lips. The technology though spectacular isn't the most thrilling in this movie. The great choices of actors and the sense that all roles are written for just the actor who performed it is the true thrill of this movie. The choice of Woody Allen as Z-4195 is truly a stroke of genius. He parodes all the earlier characters he has ever been in. And then you have Sylvester Stallone who excellently performs his role as Weaver and he also makes his earlier characters look a bit more human.To put it short it's a great movie for kids of all ages!,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Impressive animation from Dreamworks,"The first of the Dreamworks animated production has proven a potential threat to the Disney's reign in animation.

Stop your grippin' and pay attention!,"Alright, now let me just say first that this is an excellent movie!! I'm a huge Disney fan, but I really don't think that I've seen this good a movie from them in a long time. The animation is superb, excellent to say the least, and the characters are believable.Unlike Disney films, this movie is realistic. We don't have a sporty, handsome, sure-of-themselves hero type, nor the fair damsel in distress that falls for him. The secondary characters don't take away the spotlight (Pocahontas, anyone?), plus the villains here aren't bumbling idiots that reveal their plans to everyone in the first half hour of the film like so many Disney-esque chars. seem to do quite often.Once and for all, the dialogue is pretty good too. I remember sitting in the row, and when one of the characters swore, a mother behind me began talking about how this wasn't suitable for her eleven-year-old child. What are you bitching about? Yes, you heard me! I've gone to the elementary school and hear kids in like grade two swear up a streak! It seems that the only people concerned with the language in this film are the over-protective parents. Alright, I'm 15, so I haven't lost the touch that kids have, and I have a word for you parents: Your kids do use those words... not when you're there of course, but they do.As well, the fight scene and others of violence were believable too. It was true... in Disney films, someone can get beat up, stabbed or even shot with an arrow, and do you see any blood? No, of course not. Well, the war scene in this had an eerie quality that actually made it look real. Everyone was on the edge of their seats that time.Perhaps if people paid attention to the facts that the characters were good, the story plot was pretty well laid out and the animation was absolutely brilliant, instead of remembering the swearing and the fact that it wasn't Disney, then they would get the full impact of the show.It was realistic, it was human... that's all that matters",,Anonymous,Animation

"A few redeeming factors, but not many","Hated it.That said, it had its good points. Christopher Walken was really great. The animation was splendidly realistic, even if they did choose a very creepy head shape for the worker ants. And, well, that's about all I liked about it.In my opinion, animation should be used when you're doing something that can't be done as well any other way. The feeling and plot of this movie could have been portrayed better with human characters. See A Bug's Life for an example of how to animate whimsy; see Prince of Egypt for how to animate brightness and wonder; especially see Kiki's Delivery Service for how to animate sheer charm. This had nothing that couldn't have been done better another way; it's animation for the sake of showing people how powerful your 3D rendering computer is.And Woody Allen? For goodness sake.",,Anonymous,Animation
The kids might find it boring but not adults.,"It's less colorful than A Bug's Life. It looks like a film not made especially for kids. Woody Allen has a pest of a voice & he talks too much. But at the end, he has his day! Along the way, he falls in love with the 'Sharon Stone' ant. The general is menacing but of course, I have it for Sly, so the 'Weaver' ant gets my vote! He's big, he's friendly & he's confident enough w/the ladies (female ants) to never be lonely if he doesn't want to be. You can tell it's Sly! Just listen to that voice, too!

The best animated feature in years.,"A (mostly) well-written thought-provoking triumph of animation. Simply the best animated film in years, even better than the last big computer-animated film, ""Toy Story."" DreamWorks has given Disney a run for its money.",,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible use of various Dimensions and Levels in a film.,"I found this film to work on a ton of levels.  The first level is that of a classic story with a lovable, but neurotic nerd that finds some source of courage in a series of freak events. It also contains a similar classic love story of the underdog getting the girl that is completely out of his league. However what most impresses me is the story line of complex politics that exsist in modern society.  The ant hill that they lived in basically worked as a socialistic society.  Each ant was born into a class and they were never to stray from that class and they were always to do their work without question.  Then you have a high ranking officer trying to increase his power through military force. I just love the parallels this film has to the politics of the U.S.S.R. in its hayday. It does in fact require a great amount of thought and is definately not for little kids.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Really Good Animation, Entertaining Story.","Dreamworks is definitely putting the pressure on Pixar with this one.  A completely enjoyable animation, with likeable characters and a traditional plot.While Woody Allen plays himself, as does Stallone and Walken, Danny Glover plays the brave soldier who sets the wheels in motion for Z.",,Anonymous,Animation
Vary well done,"I think that Antz does a remarkable job in telling you about struggle and paradise. It shows just how visious struggling can get (it causes wars). After the war everybody is dead and it shows the Z (main character) holding Barbatos' head (his body was lost but his head was alive but Barbatos soon dies). Then it shows paradise ""insectopia"" which every ant dreams of. Everything there is happy. Z has struggles of his own with General Mandible. Z falls in love with Princess Bala who was supposed to marry General Mandible. Mandible hates Z and all the other ""worker ants"" and wants to kill all of them. I think that this movie does a great job using computer animation at the end of this movie. It show all of the worker ants getting together and making an ant ladder and escaping through the top of the anthole. Luckily for Z and the rest of the worker ants Colonel Cutter turns from bad to good and stops General Mandible from causing the ant ladder to collapse and kill all of the worker ants. I like to watch this movie because it is an adultlike cartoon movie!",,Anonymous,Animation
It's a spiffy film and damn anyone who says otherwise!,"Antz was a rather neat film, and there's no denying it. Bad language? Communist propaganda? *laugh* People are funny. ""Quit yer bitchin'""? Oh no! Antz makes baby Jesus cry!Antz is a classic Woody Allen film, 'tis true, and I expect he had a bit of a hand in writing Z's script. The neat thing about the film, though, is that all of the characters are sterotypes of their voice actors. Imagine Stallone, Hackman or Walken as ants, and bingo!, that's how they are. Playing their perfect roles, they all do a sterling job, although Walken's character, Colonel Cutter, only has one real sinister 'Walkeny' scene, which is a shame.Animation is really a liberating medium, and they took good advantage of it. Visually the film is superb; the grand caverns are amazing, and a traditionally difficult piece of animation, water, is done really well. I was impressed. The sound was great, with a fantastic score - and NO, this isn't a Disney film (it was made by Dreamworks SKG), so the ants do not sing, thank the stars.All up, Dreamworks have made a fine animated comedy. It's not a film for kids - just because it's animated doesn't mean it has to be aimed at small children/christians; it's only a little less sophisticated than an ordinary Woody Allen film (whatever that means). There's no swearing at all, and no ant sex (although there are frequent ant births!), even still the relationships and social commentary are just enough to amuse a thinking person.Go see Antz.

Definitely not for children,"I was very disappointed in this film.  It was advertised as a children's movie but was so riddled with profanity and references to adult matter that it was completely inappropriate for any child under age 13.  Spielberg seems to always have some message to send through his films, so I wonder what message he's trying to send here.  This is the last Dreamworks film I'll ever watch.",,Anonymous,Animation
Too Clever By Half,"There's no doubt that the technical advances in the film making business are downright amazing. The insects  in Antz (don't ya just lurve the spelling???) are completely computer generated by the Dream Works studio in association with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Speilberg. The industry has come a long long way since those few tortuous bits of bytes in Jurassic Park not all that many years ago. But sometimes we humans can get just a little bit too clever, or perhaps not smart enough, and Antz, although commendable, has neither the fantasy element needed for a good children's film, nor the realism needed for a decent adults flick. Antz is pretty entertaining, and visually it is every bit as stunning as Toy Story, although Antz is more sophisticated and  has a much darker look than the suburban Toy Story.  As you can imagine, much of the action in Antz takes place underground. Antz tells of an ant called Z (voiced by Woody Allen) who doesn't want to just be one of the crowd. He has an illicit romance with a princess ant (Sharon Stone) and they break the mould and come into conflict with the status quo. There are heaps of references to politics, movie genres, sexual angst and therapy, as you'd expect from a story  starring a Woody Allen type off character. But can an animated film effectively portray complicated emotions? Not so far it seems. The ants in Antz have faces that are almost human, but that then becomes disappointing, because so far the craft hasn't got any where near being able to really display the complexities of a human face.We love faces. We spend our lives studying the extremely subtle messages a tiny tremor of an eyebrow or lip might portray; to such an extent that we often don't even consciously realise how subtle we are as observers. If film makers are going to step towards trying to depict real human faces on animated creatures, and not leave animated films where they have been so far; a film world where it is obvious that the creatures, the faces, and the personalities are only two dimensional and shallow, then they will continue to disappoint movie goers.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Very funny, not direct ment for kids, movie!",Very funny and entertaining. It's about the life for the ants. Simple isn't it? Hornestly I think that ''Antz'' has many disneys behind than in front in the list. The story is about how the ant-worker Z gets into trouble while kidnapping the ant-princess by mistake. After a while a great conspiracy among the ants appear. To be a kids movie ''Antz'' seems more serious and the characters voices sure mix perfect with themselves.

I recommend this to an easily entertained movie goer as I guarantee, you won't be disappointed. Rating=5/5",,Anonymous,Animation
not quite innocuous enough for kids but lots of fun,"Clever animated feature is a perspective of the world inhabited by ants. The story focuses on one woefully neurotic ant who won't capitulate to the colony's organized structure, instead choosing to embrace individualism. This leads him to clash with a callous general lusting for power, catch the eye of the princess, and lead a journey to find an insect paradise which may or may not exist. The computer animation, visual effects, and wildly imaginative world of ants is something to truly marvel at, and you couldn't ask for a better cast of vocal talents. The political themes and double entendres are far too edgy and complex for young children, but overall it's quite an impressive showing. ***",,Anonymous,Animation
Double pun in the title?,"I don't really have an analysis of the film to add, except to say that I really enjoyed it. Instead, I'd like to comment on the double pun (or perhaps just a triple meaning) within the title itself.""Antz"" can be looked at in three ways: a cute misspelling of the plural of ""Ant""; a statement of the name of the protagonist, ""Ant Z""; and a description of how he felt about his place in society, ""Ant-z"" (antsy).I don't know that the writers meant this, but it seems too improbable to be just a coincidence.

An Unlikely But Still Funny Role For Woody Allen,"Casting Woody Allen as the leading voice in an animated film about ants may sound unlikely but it works surprisingly well in this 1998 Dreamworks release. Allen provides the voice of Z, an industrious, if sometimes inept worker ant who is willing to do anything to impress the ant colony's princess, Bala, even despite the fact that she is being forced into marrying the colony's tyrannical General Mandible. Some mild profanity and crude humor explains the film's PG rating but if that can be ignored, this ranks as a fine family oriented film. Its release coincided with that of Walt Disney Pictures similar animated release ""A Bug's Life"" and both films met with mixed results. However, I feel that both films were equally good.",,Anonymous,Animation

Never seen such a good feel-good movie,"The film AntZ is fantastic. I was surprised about the lay out, and the perfect 'type-casting'. Woody Allen is tailor made for AntZ, not to mention Sylvester Stallone for the role of Weaver. Sharon Stone is just bitchy enough for the role of Bala. The dialogues are great, the animation is great, and the jokes aren't predictable at all, as mentioned before by another IMDB member. I read the comment of someone who said that the words 'erotic fantasy' are not suited or appropriate for the five-year old. I think he does not understand it. THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATION MOVIE FOR KIDS, BUT FOR ADULTS!!!!! If you want to have a good night out, start with this movie then. It really won't disappoint you. Oh yeah, by the way. Me, being almost 23, almost had to cry at a certain moment in the movie. This is something Disney has never achieved. Adults who are moved by some animation movie.

I could go on and on about this one.....",,Anonymous,Animation
Hugely entertaining (and a lesson in civics),"This is one animated movie that is just too good and clever to be left to the kids, though they will certainly be entertained by the imaginative characterisations, exciting storyline, funny sequences and expressive music. But in addition to these basic merits, adults will also enjoy the way the main CGI-produced characters have been adjusted to the actors providing the voices, rather than the other way round. This applies especially, of course, to Z (Woody Allen) who embodies not only Allen's neurosis, but that awkward, questioning individuality that so often goes along with neurosis; and which is particularly awkward for a worker-ant, supposed to conform to the totalitarian norm with every fibre of its being.With gentle-giant soldier-ant Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), autocratic General Mandible (Gene Hackman) and his smooth sidekick, Col Cutter (Christopher Walken), also, the personalities of the voicers - or at least of the human characters they often play - have been successfully incorporated into the animated figures. This aspect of the movie is perhaps not so marked with the female characters - the Queen (Ann Bancroft), Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) and Z's friend Azteca (Jennifer Lopez), which may be because actresses are less typecast in Hollywood movies than their male counterparts.A dominant feature of the film is its strong political message in favour of individual liberty and freedom of choice, a message which carries more weight because it is delivered not by some super-hero, but by arch-nebish Z. Yet despite this theme of the individual, the climactic image of the film is one of teamwork, with the ants voluntarily combining their strength and agility to save themselves and each other, by forming a precarious tower of bodies supported by the strong-limbed and even stronger-hearted Weaver.",,Anonymous,Animation

An excellent film and a milestone in computer generated animation,"I enjoyed this film because of its technical excellence, its simplicity and sound track which made the ant-characters have personalities and behave like humans. This was, of course, the intention, Walt Disney did it decades ago, but using state-of the art computer techniques added a new dimension to the realism.  The opening remarks by the central character with Woody Allen's voice were both funny and memorable.  Congratulations to the production team and let's have many more like this based on the animal, insect etc. kingdom. It serves not only as entertainment but also conveys a powerful message about ourselves, the humans who have dominance over all other life-forms or do we?This film was not for the very young but the title and publicity may have been slightly misleading. At the cinema that I attended in Manchester there were many young children, who in some cases may have expected a different type of film.  This is not meant to be a criticism but should be considered when marketing the film.I await the next film with eager anticipation.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Very clever movie, but language was too weak.","Disney's worst crime is its bowdlerization of the animated film:  moviegoers expect that animated features will be targeted toward children, will be as spicy and complex and challenging as rice pudding.  Not so this flick:  go see it for the tons of subtle visual puns and throwaway jokes that are constantly in the background.  The attention to detail is astounding:  in the bar scene, the aphids (antly analogue for beer bottles) are placed without fanfare on plant stems between each use, so that they might replenish their juices.  Don't take your children if they are very young: there's a scene of terrifying violence early in the movie.Personally, I couldn't give a flying flip about language in a movie, for the most part, but the language in this movie bothered me:  it was clearly geared toward the rating.  To wit:  a blissed-out hippy fly says, ""this tastes like crap.""  Now, I know Spielberg has spent time around hippies; I know that he knows how they talk.  And let me tell you what, ""crap"" isn't the word a hippy would use there, any more than a mad New York executive would shout to his secretary, ""Sheila, get in here, gosh darn it!""  Why did they decide to dumb down the language?That's a minor complaint, however, in an otherwise extremely competent, mature, and clever film.  If you enjoy under-stated jokes as much as I do, you'll have a blast.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good Cartoon!,"I am a person who enjoys most cartoons, mainly Disney. And this is on of the best I have seen in a while. Woody Allen has lots of witty comments throught out the movie Giving Z great characterization.A must see.",,Anonymous,Animation
Thanks to computer animation !,"Stories like this have been languishing in the imagination for ages waiting for some new technology to bring them to life.  True, this would have made a great short story (and probably was for all I know), but putting it up on the big screen gives you a much larger audience.  I can only hope that we are not subjected to another dozen bug tales while we wait for something else as original as Antz.This movie, is what we refer to in the Winnipeg Film Critic Society as a ""hoot""",,Anonymous,Animation
"Fine Woody Allen in entertaining animation, more for adults","Woody Allen is perfect as neurotic ant Z in this entertaining CGI animated feature. I prefer 'Antz' to Pixar's 'A Bug's life' mainly because it caters to a slightly older audience. The film lacks the bright colors of 'A Bug's Life' but has it's own earthy charm. There are several hilarious asides, mostly dealing with adult relationships and politics. There is an all star cast with Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Sylvester Stallone and they all do a good job. The story is surprisingly intense at times with some specially bloody battle scenes. Recommended.Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,Animation
"Very funny, not directly ment for kids, movie!",Very funny and entertaining. It's about the life for the ants. Simple isn't it? Honestly I think that ''Antz'' has many disneys behind than in front in the list. The story is about how the ant-worker Z gets into trouble while kidnapping the ant-princess by mistake. After a while a great conspiracy among the ants appear. To be a kids movie ''Antz'' seems more serious and the characters voices sure mix perfect with themselves. Not to be missed by fans of the actors/esses! 4 out of 5,,Anonymous,Animation
Political 1900's animated look alike.,"A very interesting film if you've ever learned about the political machines and unions of the early 20th century.  I actually saw it for extra credit in my American History class, and it was very enjoyable.  An amazing casting job, and you're in for a laugh when you see how much Sly's character resembles him!  HA!Anyway... I really was shocked to find how ""adultish"" this movie is.  I mean, it's not rated R or anything, but parents should watch out for a little bit of bad language.  I'm just saying that kids might not enjoy it as much as older people, like myself, did.",,Anonymous,Animation
Animated movies comes much better than this.,"I just don't know what to make of this movie. The characters are unbelievable ugly, they just don't have that cute kind of look, that I like to see in animated movies. Many of the characters actually look like the actors that does the voice overlays. Sylvester Stallone and Gene Hackman as ant look-alike could have been funny, but it just isn't. The humour, the one-liners in this thing are few, and many of them will escape the youngest viewers, as will some of the plot.Conclusion: 'Antz' is watchable becourse it does have some good parts, but if you're going to see a computer animated family movie, you're much better off with 'Monsters, Inc.' or 'A Bug's Life'.6 of 10",,Anonymous,Animation
"A more mature version of ""A bug`s life""","""Antz"" is a computer-made movie about ants in about the same way as ""A bug`s life"", but ""A bug`s life"" was a bit for the kids, ""Antz"" is an animated film for a more mature audience. The storyline has it`s flaws, and ""A Bug`s life"" does look a bit better, but ""Antz"" still has its moments of glory. The characters are all excellent and the voice-overs are made by actors like Gene Hackman, Woody Allen and Sylvester Stallone. It is a fun movie, and it is great to finally see a great animated film which is meant to be viewed by a more mature audience. 8/10",,Anonymous,Animation
The Antz are Back in Town,"In the wake of Toy Story, computer animation had a new path open to explore, the only problem was, making a film better than Toy Story. The charm of the characters and the simplicity of the story made it a film that could not only be enjoyed by children but by adults too. This is where Antz comes in. While Toy Story only existed on the one level that could be enjoyed by all, Antz exists on two levels, one level that can be enjoyed by children, aswell as a completely different level that can be enjoyed by adults. While only one of these levels may be universally transcendent, it does not take away from the overall enjoyment of this film.On the first level is a simple story. Hitchcockian simplicity placing an ordinary character in an extraordinary situation, sees ordinary Ant worker Z foiling General Mandible's evil plans to take over the ant colony and getting the girl, Princess Bala. On a more adult level are the subtle movie references that range from the dance sequence inspired by Pulp Fiction, to the war sequence inspired by both Starship Troopers and The Killing Fields. Perhaps the best way to read this movie, however, is as a self referential gag fest about Woody Allen. As it is Allen who voices the main character Z, one can only assume that he knows that his character Z is an utter send up of his on and off screen persona. Any opening scene that borrows from Manhattan but is actually a decent from silhouetted grass stems into a psychiatrists room, where Z is telling his psychiatrist of how he feels inadequate and a nobody is totally sublime. The fact that the reply from the psychiatrist that he is a nobody also makes you wonder if this is more than just a cartoon and more of a social commentary on communism and capitalism. By the end of the film we realise that the capitalist ideal has won over the communist ideal first seen in the opening sequence where every ant knows its place and is working for the colony. This contrast between capitalism and communism continues as a motif throughout the film.Rarely does a film contain all the elements that one desires on a film but Antz is different, combining the politics of war, the cross class love affair, the down and out looking for inspiration and a reason to carry on and most importantly, a story about humanity and the human condition. Beneath the surface of Antz lies the struggle of an ordinary Ant who wants something more and fights, albeit quite humorously, for his place and fights to be a better ant (read person). One touching scene has Z and his new friend Barbados meeting for a final time after the battle. Barbados, now being only a head, asks Z how bad it is. Touching and charming this is what the film is all about.Another welcome idea in the film is the casting of two former A-list stars who have 0more or less become B-list stars, in the form of Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Both give underestimated performances as Z's buddy Weaver and Princess Bala respectively. Gene Hackman mirrors his tights and ruthless performance in Crimson Tide as General Mandabal and Christopher Walken is also at his usual best as Cutter. It is however Woody Allen who makes this film his own. The send up of himself as the neurotic ant who is trying to find a better place and a better life until he realises that he already has it has a knowing warmth and charm to it.Comparisons with Toy Story, A Bugs Life and even Toy Story 2 will always detract from just how good a film this is and in fact is probably the only criticism one can find with the film. Toy Story had the novelty of being the first, A Bugs Life had the plain simplicity of story and entertainment, Toy Story 2 had a previous fan base, already known characters and a better story than its predecessor. Antz however has everything, drawing together, aside from the familiarity of the sequel, all of the different elements that made the others good, aswell as adding a few elements to a fastly growing genre of digitally animated, clever, cartoons.",,Anonymous,Animation
Who is that?,"I watched this with my sister tonight on pay-per-view. All we knew about it was that it was a computer animated movie about ants, or something. We came in to the 5 minutes late because the Pizza man didn't get here fast enough, so we missed the opening credits. We had no idea who the voices were. Woody Allen and Stallone were easy to figure out. We had fun trying to figure out the rest of them. She beat me on Sharon Stone and Danny Glover while I guessed Anne Bancroft & Christopher Walken fairly early. The one we couldn't figure out was Mandible. I was stuck on Tommy Lee Jones, though I knew it wasn't him. It took us 'til 15 minutes to the movie's end for me to figure it out: ""HACKMAN!""  I beat her to it and that's all I care about. Now I'll have to watch the movie again to see what it's about!",,Anonymous,Animation
A Bug's Life vs. Antz,"This is an OK movie. Not bad, but not great either. It came out thesame year as A Bug's Life and A Bug's Life defenitely overshadowed this flick. I would have to say A Bug's Life isprobably funnier. It is overall the better movie. However, that's notto say Antz isn't good too. It has a lot of serious, important partsand has more realistic colours (but that also makes it kind ofboring to watch). Also I feel the storyline is a bit more believablethen that of A Bug's Life, although there are similarities betweenthe two main charactars. But there are some tedious parts in thismovie too. I would say, only rent this if you are anti-Disney or have seen ABug's Life. I give Antz a 6/10",,Anonymous,Animation
you've got to think for yourself,"Although animated and containing much humour, this film's message is more for adults than children.  Those of us who live our lives in the ""workaday"" world of routine - getting up, going to work, coming home, and starting all over again the next day - should be most receptive to the message this film has to offer.  Every once in a while it's a good thing to stop and ask yourself ""what am I doing"" or ""why am I doing this"".  In other words, don't be driven by life, rather be the driver - think for yourself.  This film contains many amusing moments, most notably the typical Woody Allen monologues that we are so used to seeing in his earlier films - nebish New Yorker becomes nebish ""New worker"" ant.  Allen doesn't fit the mold and decides to find out what life is really all about by seeking out ""insectopia"".  Along with the colony princess - played by Sharon Stone, the two ants try to find out whether there's a better world outside the colony. It's not exactly your usual ""boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl"" flick but it sort of follows that pattern, with a few surprises along the way.  Kids will love the animation but the dialogue is what really wins the prize here and it's what the adults should enjoy most.  A very enjoyable film with something very kids of all ages.",,Anonymous,Animation
Do they have writers at DreamWorks,"Although the animation was superb (partially made in Belgium, Yes!) this movie was not good enough to 'attack' Disney. They forgot one elementary thing of Animation : you do need a story too, and not the plot that was used in Antz.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Animated or not, Antz is a perfect 10!","Antz is, in three words, outstanding, outstanding, and outstanding!  Since Disney's The Jungle Book cartoon, Antz is by far the best coupling of appropriate voices and appropriate animations with given characters.  I'd give anyone who could think of more appropriate voices than Woody Allen for Z, Sylvester Stallone for Weaver, Gene Hackman for Gen. Mandible, or Danny Glover for Barbadus, a million bucks!  The animation and facial expressions are simply stellar; a little better than anything I've seen from Disney/Pixar.Antz is proof positive that just because a movie is animated doesn't automatically render it a kids' movie.  Antz is for us big kids!  The comedy is some of the wittiest I have ever seen in any movie.  Z's psychiatrist session at the start of the movie is but a sample of the clever comedy that this movie overflows with.  Ever heard of a ""soil-relocation engineer""!!? But you want slapstick?  How about that magnifying-glass scene?  If you were ever a child who had access to a magnifying glass (as I was), you'd nearly suffocate from laughter!I doubt I'll ever see another movie, live or animated, that can take a relatively simple (and common) plot, create delightful and memorable characters that fit the roles precisely, and turn it all into an amazingly witty and entertaining story.  Watch Antz, you will absolutely love it. Guaranteed!",,Anonymous,Animation
This is a clever marvel of animation.,"""Antz"" is a marvelous blend of brilliant animation and wacky humor.  The physical look of the picture is stunning.  The voice-overs are enormously entertaining, especially Woody Allen as ""Z.""  The social commentary about conformity versus individualism will be totally lost on young children. ""Antz"" is geared towards older children and adults who will get the political allusions and who will appreciate the musical oldies that provide background for the action.  This movie was pure fun.",,Anonymous,Animation
Different movie for da older guys ....,"Conservative parents worried that their children will be corrupted by the ""dirty"" words in ANTZ might be more appropriately concerned about spelling. If their kids look up the ""Z"" in ANT-Z, they might discover that it is the name of a 1969 movie by Constantin Costa-Gavras: a beautiful and beautifully effective attack on the fascistic (or downright fascist) regime of the colonels ruling Greece at the time. Leftist parents should teach their kids about ""Z!"", the symbol, and about the songs in ANTZ and try to get their kids to ignore the placements for Mountain Dew and other products. ANTZ is inspiring debates about its politics and in that way it is earning its social keep more than most politicians in my part of the world. Z!  And long live the individual citizen in a human community!",,Anonymous,Animation
Why do the characters look like their voice-over actors?,"I read in Entertainment Weekly a while back that when the animators first started this film, the character of Z looked ""too much"" like Woody Allen, and the animators had to change Z's look several times. They succeeded in their attempt--in the movie, Z doesn't look much like Allen. My question, however, is why do some of the other characters look like the actors that provide their voices? The ones that stand out the most are Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), Barbatus (Danny Glover) and Azteca (Jennifer Lopez). Of course Barbatus ""looks"" like a black man--how stereotypical. I'm not a big Jennifer Lopez follower, but I swear I'd recognize those lips anywhere... What happened to the creativity of animation? Isn't it more fun to ""figure out"" whose voice is bringing life to that animated character rather than having it ""shown"" to the audience? I know Sly's voice is pretty easy to identify, but so is Allen's--the creators obviously put some work into designing a unique ant look for his character, a look that made the movie more interesting to watch. Come on, guys--this is what you're paid for! Give us a creative look of an animated character, not just an ""cartoon"" Stallone!",,Anonymous,Animation
Reasonably entertaining animation showcasing Woody Allen,"I did not see Antz until after I had seen A Bug's Life, and I had the strange feeling I would have liked the former film better than I did had I seen it when it initially hit theatres. Antz is much darker and more serious than A Bug's Life, Woody Allen's solid one-liners notwithstanding. I was also surprised by how ""adult"" the film felt in terms of its dialogue, plotting, and angular (some would say ugly) character animation -- not to mantion the overall darkness of the design.  Some Allen fans will be pleased, as typical Woody-style jokes are transposed into insect vocabulary.I personally favored Z's off-color retort following an invitation to drink some aphid beer. Allen did not write the film, but just as well could have considering how tailor-made some of the jokes were for him.",,Anonymous,Animation
Forget Titanic - small is good,"This is Woody Allen as he feels about himself - definitely. An insignificant ant, the middle kid in a family of five million and named Z-4195 (Z for short),. Well, Zee, actually - it is an American ant!This film is not good because it has a thrilling storyline - it hasn't; Nor because it has a complex interwoven plot which keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the final credits - it hasn't;  Nor because it examines in ruthless detail and satirical probing, humankind in allegory - it doesn't. No, this film is good, because it is good.Telling a familiar story,  the awakening within a person (ant) of something beyond the mundane and the search for utopia (insectopia in the film), combining excellent characterisations and truly awesome visual imagery courtesy of the ever present CGI industry, works a treat. Woody Allen, sans body, is perfect, as are each of the other voice characters.  This may be one of the best things Stallone has ever done. All the voices are superb, and without the distractions of the bodies, you really appreciate them for the first time.  This is a much, much better film than ""Small Soldiers"". Nearly 5-star but not quite.There are no huge surprises; no real shocks (just one maybe); the good guys beat the bad guys; some movie and war clichés are paid tribute to along the way (including a battle scene pulled straight from ""Starship Troopers"") and the final scene is epic in its smallness.   Forget Titanic - small is good.  See this one and you'll feel better for it.",,Anonymous,Animation
