Zombie Revival,"Train to Busan was a treat.A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Challenge of Korean blockbuster, and it succeeded quite well","Making zombie blockbuster movies outside of Hollywood is not an easy task. Money is the biggest problem, of course. Since it takes a lot of money, success should be guaranteed before making a movie is decided. However, because there are no other precedents, you can't tell whether it's going to succeed or not. This bad cycle kept Korean directors from making zombie blockbusters. This tells how bold movement it was to make 'Train to Busan'. This movie was destined to be 'hit' or 'flop' and it turns out to be 'hit'. Then, this gives a food for thought. What made this Korean zombie blockbuster movie which is definitely unfamiliar to Korean people successful? Ironically, the secret lies in familiarity. Let's take a look at this movie. Yes, it has zombies, but is this movie all about them? No. Unlike 28 days later or resident evil, this movie actually doesn't care about zombies that much. Zombies are not explained much. Their origin, their ability, cure for zombiesThese are the things that are not being handled well in the movie. In this movie, zombies are just tools to represent 'threats'. The main theme of this movie is about how people react to threats. Selfishness, altruism, violence, love and much more are being depicted in this movie. And Korean people are quite accustomed to these elements. When directors mix these elements well, then the movie becomes a hit, just like this one. However, this movie still has some downsides too. Acting of Jin-hee is quite unbearably bad and the character Yong-suk (who keeps trying to sacrifice others to save himself) had gone way too far. Yes, I can get mad at bad guys but I don't want to get annoyed at them. Also, getting annoyed gets worse when it is not properly resolved as this movie does. Overall, this is a quite well-made movie, though it still has some bad moments. I believe this movie will be a new beginning for Korean blockbusters. And I recommend you to watch this movie to stay alert for rise of Korean movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
best modern zombies movie,"Hello,We can argue whether a zombies should be fast or not –In the movie, they are fast, deadly and merciless. It is more believable than those zombies can take over a city or a country within a day.The movie succeed where Fear The walking dead failed miserably, to explain how the pandemic starts and how it has been spread so fast.Most of the movie take place in a train, very claustrophobic place if you are chased by a herd of undead, but it worked for me, I felt the tension, the drama, the crazy survival instinct of ones and the resignation of the others.Walking dead made the zombie apocalypse almost cool, with guns and sex and love story, In train to busan nothing is cool, you do not have gun, your family and pretty much everyone you know are dead, there is no escape and nobody will come to save you ..I spent 2 marvelous hours watching a movie about zombies, I despite the fact I watched hundred movies about zombies, I have been surprised and scared.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies on a train!? Boss!,"We're leaving (leaving) on that Zombie Train to Busan (leaving on the undead train).Use to seeing Korean horror films about ghost, but Zombies!? This was refreshing.So this neglectful dad tries to make amends with his daughter by riding with her on the train (which she wanted to go by herself) to take her back to his ex-wife. Lucky for both of them as a zombie outbreak happens while their on the train. Now, their only hope for survival is to make it to the Busan stop.You really can't go wrong with a Zombie movie. It's rare that I've have seen one that I did not like. Train to Busan is definitely a good one too. Its filled with interesting characters. Other than the father daughter team, the train is also occupied by a pregnant women and her Macho and humorous husband, a school girl and her baseball playing boyfriend and some homeless wonderer who saw the outbreak first hand, just to name a few.The social commentary speaks on what you are made of as an individual and as a society with the best and the worse coming out of everyone during this crisis.I loved how relentless and aggressive the Zombies were. More like 28 days later than Romero. The special effects do get a little cartoony with zombies that seem to come form nowhere piling over one another like poring cereal into a bowl or something, but it does give you that man, these guys are screwed feel. Train to Busan focus on the idea that the walking dead sense you through sight and sound. If they can not see you or hear you they have no way of knowing your living flesh is a foot away from their hunger. It made for some cleaver obstacles when a group of passengers have to maneuver through train cars filled with zombie passengers (Sounds like the next game in the Resident Evil franchise).Also found it interesting that no zombies were shot in this picture. I don't know how Korean gun control laws work, but I can assume it's strict enough that the story would make no sense if someone on the train just happen to have one for zombie killing (unlike an American movie in which the unborn child having a gun would be fine so long as it moved along the story). Definitely a rarity in a Zombie picture and it worked.It's Action packed, it's humorless, with incredible looking zombies and a cast of characters so lively you give a crap what happens to them in the end.http://cinemagardens.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Adds a lot of spark to the zombie genre.,"This lively South Korean zombie flick arrives in Oz with a limited release, which is a pity as it's a riotous adventure filled to the brim with action, gore and damn interesting story beats. Like all good films within this subgenre, the narrative is rife with metaphors about modern day issues (parent-child connections, corporate greed, human interaction, etc) but it also provides a compelling survival plot when taken at face value. The core relationship between Yoo Gong's self-centred businessman and his quiet, emotionally-neglected 9-year-old daughter (Soo-an Kim – a tour de force) is riveting as it gets put through the wringer, never feeling anything less than authentic. There are spurts of melodrama, however, that induce the odd unintentional chuckle, whilst a select few from the supporting cast play up their stereotypes – love-struck school girl, despicable scaremonger, muttering homeless man – a little too much. Sang-ho Yeon directs with unabashed gusto, pumping up tension and thrills though a string of adrenaline-pumping set pieces, an amazing train-station sequence that turns from hopeful to deadly being a particular high point. The undead are suitably grotesque and enjoyably expendable, their physical movements a mix between the 28 Days Later mode of rapid flesh-eaters and the herky-jerky twitches of J-horror ghosts, although the rules for how quickly someone becomes ""infected"" seems to vary depending on plot requirement. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the zombie genre, but with a bunch of exhilarating set pieces and a willingness to kill off anyone at anytime, Train to Busan certainly adds a whole lot of spark.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An overall excellent movie,"A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Starts strong only to turn into a typical Hollywood blockbuster.,"Zombie movies aren't quite dead yet. Over the past several years zombies have snuck their way into pop culture, overtaking almost every form of entertainment and putting themselves in the for front as the most beloved ""monster"". There's zombie survival guides, magazines, TV shows, and, of course, movies. 'Train to Busan' is one of those movies. But, as of late, zombies are seeming to wane in popularity. It would seem that the zombie's novelty has started to wear down due to its incredible over-saturation. That being said, when they are done right they remain a rather fun gimmick. Unfortunately, this film is really nothing more than that.It's a fun gimmicky movie that doesn't do too much else. But while it lasts, it's a blast. The film almost immediately gets started showing the slow beginnings of the outbreak. A couple burning buildings, some emergency vehicles darting around, and the occasional convulsing person. This type of first act isn't new or different by any means but it's the fact that we get into the action within ten minutes that makes this movie instantly enjoyable.Despite the dumb family dynamic that the film introduces the opening forty-ish minutes is probably the most visceral action in a movie so far this year. This is largely thanks to the actual filmmaking. The camera-work is all extremely fluid and interesting. There is rarely a moment when I saw a shot and thought it looked bad. The director uses the camera to help build tension instead of just throwing in loud sounds and music.It also helps when the makeup effects and performances are as well done as they are. Obviously, there is a fair amount of blood in this here movie and it's used sparring enough to help heighten a scene, instead just being the scene. And the actors that get the nice close ups as the zombies all do a wonderful job selling it. There are multiple wonderful moments when the zombies fling themselves down thrashing wildly.The best moment is definitely when an army man throws himself off the train and breaks his arm. It just dangles behind his head as he gets up and takes off running. It's these wonderful little touches that make this film enjoyable over a 'World War Z' type of movie. But not everything works in this movie. The script is particularly messy. This feels far closer to a big budget Hollywood movie, except without the budget.The most noticeable bad aspect of the film is the visual effects. Even though the majority of the film takes place on the actual train, there are plenty of times when we move off of said train and the run down world comes into focus. What we get are mostly unconvincing effects that hinder more than help. Fortunately, they are used sparring enough to not be a huge issue.But, like I said earlier, this film's script is specifically poor. This mainly stems from the emotional manipulation that it has. It tries to offer characters that you like but it doesn't develop on them. They are people that have families and the film expects you to just like them for no reason. And since you are supposed to like them for no reason it tries hard to have tear jerking moments.Every time it does, they are horribly predictable and nothing more than manipulative. It pauses the film to have the sappy music and the zoom ins as the characters pretend have emotional moments. Every time this happened, and it does far to often, I just wanted to punch the movie in face and yell, ""GET ON WITH IT!"" If you want to have these moments in your movie, that's fine, but you need to have well- written characters. Or just go non-stop balls to the wall action.And that's where this movie fails. It tries desperately hard to be both action packed and emotional. When you try this hard to strike a balance, one aspect or another will suffer at any given time. Every time the film slows down to have characters talk, I just wanted to die. It affects the pacing in the worst way possible by making this a boring yet fun movie. It's definitely enjoyable to watch and it has a lot of great elements. If you like zombie movies or action oriented movies, you'll probably like this one, but for anyone else watch 'Dawn of the Dead' again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best zombie movie I have ever seen,"The best zombie film I have ever seen (outside of the comedy Shaun of the Dead). Such a great film. It starts exactly like a train ride gathering momentum and gaining speed. The only difference with this train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script, fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it will be done as well as this.

"Highly Entertaining - Climax after climax, not a single minute is wasted.","If I have not watched the trailer, I will give it a score of 10 for its entertainment value but having seen the trailer, a little is lost. I don't remember having watched any movie that is so damn engaging, so easy to follow, and so exciting right from the first few minutes all the way to the end. All the exciting moments end with a climax that's fit for a movie. The few minutes during each break for audience to catch their breath is not boring or wasted, perfectly used for characters development. I don't understand why someone commented the last 30 minutes is not as good. I find each climax better in the next. If they make a sequel to show some happenings elsewhere with the same plot and concept, I will still watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This train is delightfully out of control.,"""I'll take you to mom no matter what."" Seok Woo (Yoo Gong)This workaholic father, Seok Woo, doesn't realize the ramifications of ""no matter what."" South Korean zombie thriller and box-office phenomenon Train to Busan speeds him and daughter, Soo-an (Soo-an Kim), from Seoul like the titular conveyance through cars and society in a way reminiscent of Snowpiercer. The conceit works well because it can give ample thrills and jump scares while taking a figurative run through society from one car to another.Train to Busan is much more than the sum of the frenetic zombie hordes that terrorize the train in scarily multiplying numbers. It is also about the community joining forces to combat crime, workers facing down management, commoners disdaining government in general, and distracted parents. Director/writer Sang-ho Yeon navigates between the terror and the commentary with effective timing, never letting the flaming story erase the sociological implications, which sometimes are heavy handed.While cinematographer Lee Hyung-deok does first-rate work on the mise en scene (from macro shots of the train and stampeding zombies to action in narrow on-board bathrooms), and editor Yang Jin-mo keeps the story moving and understandable, Train is also about relationships.Although several of the good characters do not make it to the station, those who do are representative of the hope humanity must have in its darkest times. Along the way we do have to experience the silly, cartoonish characterization of the cowardly bus-company executive Yong-Suk (Kim Eui-sung). He could have been a zombie.I can't be sure how much of the South Korean audience embraced the implications of capitalism lying underneath the speeding-train motif. What I know is that for a critic who usually avoids zombie films unless they are humorous satires, I enjoyed Train to Busan as a multi-layered entertainment to appeal to just about anyone who likes to be thrilled by first-rate cinematography, a wild-ass story, and some heady thoughts along the way.",,Anonymous,Horror

My social commentary radar is beeping.,"Corporate does an ""oopsie"" and chaos ensues as usual. It at first looks like a run of the mill zombie apocalype with a more emotionally powerful execution than the zombie genre is used to. At times lighthearted and at times not at all so, with distinct and enjoyable characters that will evidently deliver on the entertainment promise.What it really subverts about the zombie genre is that the people consistently succeed in survival when they dare to trust each other while dissent and sacrifice doesn't appear to work in their favour. I like the use of the train cars as the setting and how they succumb to the chaos one by one from bottom to top, sorry I mean back to front, as the survivors make selfish and inconsiderate mistakes. Keep your eyes open for relatable metaphors as such.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The direction is amazing and the action scenes are fantastic. The screenplay is melodramatic but also attractive; the beautiful cinematography and special effects and make-up are highlighted by perfect edition.

Starts well but runs out of steam,"You may think you know all about zombies but have you wondered what it would be like to be on a train with fifty of them all running after you and gnashing at your ankles?Zombies on a train is the premise of this film, a big hit in South Korea. If you had no idea this film was a horror, or that it featured zombies, it might be quite exciting but I imagine most people will go into this knowing exactly what to expect.Some kind of catastrophe has led to an outbreak in which dozens of writhing undead are roaming the streets of Seoul looking for their next victims. A group of travellers including main lead Gong Yu are on the train to Busan. They've barely gone twenty minutes before there is clearly something wrong with some of the passengers. Checking the situation on their phones, the passengers see that the country is in a state of emergency.Cover.jpgThey try to leave at the next station but find that the soldiers who are waiting for them have already been bitten. The most exciting and tense scenes are when the group must flee back on to the zombie ridden train, running away from swarms of rabid recruits. Once back on its a long journey for the remainder of the film. Here's where the film runs out of steam. Once you've seen one zombie, you've seen them all. The film becomes a very standard struggle for survival and the scenes of characters running down train corridors become very repetitive.It's not a bad film. Its directed in expedient fashion but for a train film its seriously lacking any ambient sound effects such as the clickety-clack sound you would expect of a train on a track (or do South Korean trains run completely silently?).Fans of zombies will not be disappointed.Otherwise, it's more of what we've already seen many times over.My score: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

World War Z Meets Snowpiercer In A Non-Stop Thrill Ride,"A non-stop locomotive ride that lets the fast-moving & instantly-infected zombies from Brad Pitt- starring World War Z go haywire inside a fast-moving train, this South Korean zombie apocalypse horror is a highly gripping, thoroughly entertaining & consistently engaging journey that moves at breakneck speed from start to finish and keeps ratcheting up the tension throughout its runtime.The story of Train to Busan finds an absentee father & his young daughter boarding a train from Seoul to Busan to meet her mother. But all hell breaks loose when the train is overrun by zombies and results in death & reanimation of numerous staff members & passengers. With nowhere to run, the two team up with other surviving members to ward off the infected until the train makes it to its destination.Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, the film borrows certain elements from Marc Forster's World War Z & Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer but carves an original storyline that's brilliantly executed on the film canvas. Sang-ho's kinetic direction keeps escalating the stakes with skilfully crafted moments of horror and slowly but steadily manages to compel the viewers to invest in the characters' journey & eventual fate.The zombies retain their vicious nature but an added weakness does allow for some suspenseful moments that are expertly carried out. While the movie makes use of CGI in the depiction of the reanimated corpses, the zombies look far more believable than the artificial mess they were in the film they are lifted from, not to mention that even the human characters exhibit an emotional core that was missing in that feature.The dramatic portions, however, are a tad too overblown as the director is unable to pull them off with same zeal with which he carries out the action-horror segments. The technical aspects are finely executed and the film as a whole really benefits from its energetic camera-work, tight editing, excellent choreography, first-rate production design & fitting score and although a few CGI shots don't look realistic enough, it serves its purpose well.Coming to the performances, the entire cast chips in with serviceable inputs and even though the characters they play lack an interesting persona & certain amount of depth, the actors somehow succeed in making the audience get on board with their characters' predicament. While everyone does an apt job in their given roles, there really was no need to add a despicable human character when you already have a train full of zombies so that felt a bit forced.On an overall scale, Train to Busan still makes up for an exciting, action-packed zombie horror and boasts numerous sequences of sustained terror. The build-up is quick and once the train begins to move, it becomes all the more relentless & unstoppable. A few shortcomings like numerous stupid decisions made by a few characters does rob it of its uniqueness but there is no denying that Train to Busan delivers a healthy dose of adrenaline-filled extravaganza until the very end.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than average zombie movie,"I enjoy Korean media, and Train to Busan was no exception.

Powerful zombie movie with a heart,"South Korean cinema is so good. This movie is part 28 days later, part Snowpiercer and another part is The Cassandra crossing. But it still manages to be very original. The morality tale is strong, and we see a transformation of corporate self centered father into a self sacrificing hero. The movie disproves his early maxim that everyone should look for themselves in no uncertain terms. The selfish coward corporate train manager and his refusal to help others is given its due. And in the end, humanity wins in the perfect if hopeful ending.

Pretty good but not up to the hype,"I love horror movies, and this is on a lot of peoples lists, so I had to watch it. I'm kind of over zombies, so it didn't do much for me, as it's basically just zombies on a train.

Emotional zombie movie,"This has to be one of the finest zombie and horror films in general I have ever seen. Extremely thrilling and captivating from start to finish. Everything in this film has done with passion and care. From the characters and heartbreaking moments they go through, visceral zombie attacks, acting and camera work down to dialogue. Everything works great. This is what World War Z should and could have been. Sure the plot of the film is not original, because yet again we are shown the struggle and survival of people during zombie pandemic, but the way the story is approached and executed is beyond most of the average mainstream horror movies we get these days.

"Good zombie movie, Bad soap opera","The zombie bits were good but unfortunately the bits in between and at the start were some pretty average family drama cliché. Daddy works too hard and the daughter resents it, school performance he didn't make it to, the Korean relationship dynamic cliché (I really hope this isn't normal in real life Korea but it appears in every relationship in their movies), nagging wife, dumb (huh?) beaten down husband. The self centered baddie is a pretty easy to loath character, so well done on that, the effects were nice, the zombies looked great, sound was great, cinematography was a bit 'digital camera', but passable. They laid the syrup sentimentality on with a shovel and it really drags the movie down, making a 6 instead of an 8.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A hope for the Korean cinema and an alarm that it can be distinctive in the world wide cinema.,"Train To Busan ended the contempt of the Zombie in Hollywood. considering the difficulties that this movie saw to be made, It is very well made with the limited production. The story focused on the father and daughter relation that we moved with through the story. The movie however couldn't make the story more solid where there are some scenes that played very important turns in the plot that was based on coincidence and Exaggerated action by the heroes that made the situation worse and worse but I have to say it most of the movie was very entertaining and made my on the edge of my seat and a lot more was sensible. The bad character I found it overrated and over performed. Gong Yoo Soo-an as The father and as the daughter did a great job in their roles and their relation was the warm part of the movie. I take my hat off to all who worked to bring out this picture and the director Yeon Sang-ho .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A zombie movie made me cry?,"This movie is beyond incredible. As someone who hates zombie movies I went into this expecting a few cool action scenes and nothing more. But boy was I shocked and amazed by what I saw.This movie is the only zombie movie I've ever seen that actually brought me to tears more than once.The characters feel so real and their reactions are the cornerstone of this picture. The characters do not react in your typical ""cool action movie"" way, blowing zombies away at every turn. No, they are afraid, they are confused, they are selfish, they are human. They react in the way real people would react in this kind of situation. Some step up and go after zombies, some stay behind in fear for their lives, and some are putting others in danger to save their own skin. The reactions and characters are so diverse and I'm sure if I went in depth, each one could easily represent an aspect of human nature in survival situations.The setting is perfect and the things that happen are as realistic as a zombie movie can get. A huge moving train packed with zombies, no way to communicate with law enforcement, and no way to see what's happening in the outside world other than the TV. The only thing they can do, is survive until the train stops. This mix of danger and being left in the dark creates tension that leaves you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, praying for the characters safety.Speaking of the character safety, in this movie, no one is safe. I won't go in depth with the more gruesome moments, but rest assured, nothing is off limits. You truly get the sense that anything could happen to these people at any time.The emotional parts of this movie are also an enormous strength. Since the characters all feel so real and so thought out, whenever one dies it feels like a stab in the heart. Even when an extra dies, the acting is so well done that instead of the typical ""there goes another one"" feeling typical of zombie movies you get a feeling of dread, that's constantly encroaching upon everyone involved.All in all, this movie is a perfect example of what a zombie movie can truly be, instead of the same action star schlock usually made. I encourage everyone to watch it at least once, to experience one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh","Train to Busan, Sang-ho Yeon's hugely successful South Korean zombie movie, may just be the most effortlessly enjoyable action movie to feature the brain-hungry undead in years. Taking inspiration from the maestro who created the 'zombie' we know and love today, the late, great George A. Romero, as well as Danny Boyle's faster and scarier flesh-eaters, it's a wonderfully constructed and nail- bitingly tense piece, which manages to mix action, horror and a bit of family drama into two hours of pure entertainment. It also finds time to deliver a message amidst the carnage, and one that is perhaps more relevant than ever in these unpredictable times. In the most hopeless of situations, we must ultimately look out for one another if we are to stand a chance of surviving. Train to Busan condemns those who are willing to sacrifice others to save their own necks.Workaholic fund manager Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) is the kind of father who always seems to be on his phone at important family events. Divorced and single, he occasionally looks after his young daughter Soo-an (Su-an Kim) in the apartment he shares his mother, but pays such little attention to the girl that he buys her a Nintendo Wii for her birthday, forgetting that he got her the same present the previous year. What she really wants for her birthday is to see her mother in Busan, but Seok-woo is so busy at work that he is unable for find the time to accompany her on the 2 hour round-trip. After taking some advice from his mother, he eventually agrees. They arrive at the train station safe and sound, but it's clear that something isn't quite right. Police and ambulance sirens whizz by, people are running in the street, and the news reports show mass unrest and rioting across the country.Before the train doors shut however, a sickly woman gets on board. She soon collapses and starts to convulse, only for a poor train attendant to tend to her and wound up bitten. It's a big train however, and Train to Busan starts to clearly establish the collection of characters on board. There's a tough husband and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a young cheerleader, a rich and selfish corporate type, and an entire baseball team, who are handily packing many bats in their luggage. Panic soon sets in as the realisation of a zombie apocalypse dawns on the passengers, and with much of the country either in quarantine or overrun by the military trying to fight off the unstoppable hoard, its unclear just where and when they can stop. Seok-woo's intentions are to look out only himself and his daughter, and teaches the seemingly wiser Soon-an the same. But as the situation becomes increasingly dyer, it becomes clear that they are stronger together.The atmosphere and tension are turned up to the max during some incredibly inventive set-pieces, which often make the most of the most mundane of locations. These are the running, screeching zombies of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, so cramped train carriages are quickly turned into narrow isles of death. As the passengers learn the zombies' weaknesses, such as their inability to work out a door handle or how they quickly forget about you once you're out of site, the darkness of long tunnels become their ally as they journey from A to B. Sang-ho Yeon is careful to keep the social commentary at the fore, highlighting how fear can turn the nicest of people into selfish, despicable monsters, and how important it is to fight out primal instincts in moments of terror. After a fast-paced first hour, the events become somewhat repetitive and the running time could do with some trimming, but it all pays off with a gripping climax. In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's Ok,"I'm a horror lover and I'm especially a zombie fanatic, so I've seen just about every zombie show and movie at this point. I'm sure this makes me more critical when it comes to films in this genre. I also watch Korean films and series pretty often. Train To Busan was not bad, but in my opinion, it's not a must-see either. It's a decent zombie flick that attempts to tug at your heartstrings. It failed to do that for me, but I did really like a few of the characters. The actors all had great chemistry with each other. I also liked that we see the zombie virus affect animals in this movie. We don't see that enough in the zombie genre. As for things I did not like about Train To Busan, the first thing that comes to mind is how highly unrealistic most of it was (not including the obvious fact that zombies are not real). The characters' reactions were ridiculous at times. They made a pregnant woman do some nearly impossible things swiftly and silently. What they accomplished in ""2 minutes"" in the tunnels would have to have been more like 5 - 10 minutes at least. Unless I'm watching something in the high fantasy genre, I find it distracting when multiple things are way too far fetched. Also, why was the zombies' eyesight so poor but they can run fast, climb, and hear very well??? We don't get any kind of explanation for the virus other than a couple of vague mentions of a power plant or something contaminating a river, but it really made no sense. I would rather there be no explanation than a poorly written / executed one. Some scenes drag on for way too long to the point where it's just annoying and a waste of time. I didn't completely hate the ending, but it was lackluster at best. Some of the acting in this movie was actually really good and believable while others not so much. Overall, Train To Busan showed promise but was pretty anticlimactic in my opinion. It's entertaining enough, but could have easily been improved.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I spent most of this film hiding under my coat,"This movie has a very simple plot - a father and daughter get on a train to Busan and soon discover that their fellow passengers are turning into zombies at a rapid rate. From then onwards, the bodies start flying and the zombies become more violent and difficult to escape. I'm not sure I was following all the action because half the time I was too scared to look at the screen.Although this film is terrifying, it's also mesmerising. The special effects are top notch, so the zombies are totally convincing. In addition, the pacing is so fast that you never get bored, even though the film is mostly set in one location on a train. Nevertheless, I think viewers in the West might find some of the acting a bit too emotional and dramatic. On the other hand, if they watch this film, they will definitely find it entertaining. I would recommend this film to anyone, as long as they're brave!! (or have a jacket to hide under).",,Anonymous,Horror
Get on Board because you're in for a Ride!,"This is a must see for zombie enthusiasts - what a ride! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.First off, the characters are colorful, yet easy to relate to. I would say the supporting characters are some of the best and well written characters I've seen in a horror genre...ever. I was pleased to see there was a lot of attention to detail on each and every character.The location is unique (98% of the film is shot on a moving train) and it really adds to the high stakes, fast paced, high stress environment. I thought they did a great job creating a space and environment that really added to the story in many layers. It was thematic, metaphorical, helped pace out the film, and overall it was a great visual.This is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Train to Busan(why is it called Busanhaeng?),is a film that effectively establishes an emotional connection with the viewers,with great character arcs,a tense and well-constructed plot,masterful acting by the protagonists,well-done morality and social commentary,all building up to one of the best finales of the decade.
Of course,one can't overlook the perfectly shot action,with zombies that are actually,antagonists and aren't overshadowed by the humans(equally brilliant).

maintaining thrilling and tense throughout the whole film,without falling into the pitfalls of it's predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Get on board,"""The walking dead"" meets ""Snowpiercer"" but in Korea, it delivers too. It's on par if not better than most of it's Hollywood zombie apocalypse counterparts. It's a great action flick, it's paced well so it has your attention drawn throughout and the end is somewhat emotional. Not everyone can make it sorta thing, but it is a hopeful conclusion. An emotional zombie flick. Despite having a lot of the typical elements you find in most zombie or apocalyptic movies like the type of characters involved, it still feels original because it takes different features from different movies and genres and puts it together to give it a more underived sensation. The zombies were also incredibly quick and I liked that, made for more edge of your seat action without relying on cheap jump-scares; they were just as clumsy and dumb as any typical zombie is but they were made really athletic here so everyone who survived actually had to work for it. As far as imagining a zombie apocalypse could go, this seemed one of the more believable ones with the type of story and how reacted if the situation was ever to arise. I love it when fictional movies still try to be pragmatic and real. But, on that note the only thing that sorta put me off was the pregnant lady at the end, Seok-woo(the dad) was running quick as a bat out of hell with the herd of zombies behind them and she somehow was still keeping up???? She could barely walk at some point. At the end of the day it was trivial compared to scenes other movies try to make believe and it doesn't blemish how good a movie it is.If you're one of those people who don't let themselves watch movies in foreign languages just because they're in foreign languages you really do miss out on a lot because there're so many gems like this one, or parasite, another round, blue is the warmest color etcetera etcetera.

✒ 🚝A Trainwreck That'll Eat Your 💙 Out °7.8° °Excellent°,"🚅2B is an exploration of what happens when a zombie infected person stumbles onto a loaded train as it leaves the station. Loads of SK features have eating front and center, but in this movie, the dining car is closed. Only the zombies get to snack.The main protag is fund📈 manager and father, Seok-woo, who is traveling with his 10 year old daughter, Soo-an. She doesn't look 10, she's small and adorable. Newly divorced, dad is taking her to visit mom.What ensues is what one can expect from a zombie thriller at 60+ full-steam-ahead mph, with cars, door, racks, & compartments everywhere.The worst issue with the film is how characters don't take charge of their own well-being. None of these people are trained to kill. They aren't all grabbing or fabricating weapons. When a couple of them discover a major weakness the zombies have, they don't even inform the others or exploit it properly! One character had rigged armour, of sorts, around his arm, to go help rescue someone else. Why he took it off is perplexing: He needs it later. It isn't surprising that individuals would be paralyzed by shock, but the fact that nobody got fired up enough to take charge is hard to accept. More pro-activity would have kept one car of passengers on track to save many lives. I suppose it wouldn't be a horror film if nobody acts idiotic.What's also on display is the best and worst of humanity. The moral centers are the 10 year old Soo-an, and the big man, along with his very pregnant wife (she looks like she's 11 mos in, or carrying triplets in some scenes). The embodiment of evil and conniving, self-interest is portrayed by another passenger. As his true nature doesn't raise its ugly head until midway, his portrayal shows how dire circumstances can bring out the best and worst of people. Seok-woo is claiming the middle moral ground in the beginning of the show. He intends no harm, but he's not about to get involved or inconvenience himself, either. He even stores his investors' phone numbers in a file entitled ""Lemmings"" on his 📱. We watch his moral journey, not just his geographic journey, during the route of the flick.It all seems typical - not bad, not great - for the first 70-75% of the film. The last portion of the movie is excellent with regards to the filming, action, special effects, and acting (Zombies go flying all over in a fantastic trainwreck - we even see a train pull a horde of zombies as more and more of them jump onto the growing blob of a pile!). Kim Su-an, who plays the kid, may not get to kill a zombie, but she slays her part. SK entertainment, in an apparent overabundance of riches, parades a steady flow of amazing child actors.All Aboard! T2B is definitely worth the trip, particularly for the excellent last stretch. It comes in at just under 2hrs, and it streaks by in no time at all. The focus is on the people, but the zombies make some 🆒 moves, too. In the final analysis, it is also a worthy primer of what not to do during a zombie apocalypse, which I daresay might come in handy someday.IMHO🗣🎬8 🎭8 😅0 🤔6 🎨7 ⚡8 🔚9Age 13+",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Emotional Thrill Ride (get it),"Train to Busan really took me by surprise. I thought it was going to be another generic zombie movie, certainly looks that way by how it's promoted, but once you watch it, you realize just how much care and passion went into this project.Train to Busan is about a series of characters trying to survive a zombie apocalypse onboard a train that needs to get past stops, roadblocks and a ever-growing crew of zombies slowly working it's way up the train.Even though there's such a huge cast of characters, none of them feel boring or forgettable. In short time, Train to Busan establishes distinct characters that you remember the quotes of and cry when they're eventually eaten. The large cast of characters also lends itself to the tense atmosphere of the whole film. No one feels safe from the zombie horde and it's anyone's guess to who gets axed off next.Train to Busan is the most engaging zombie movie I've seen in a really long time.

Fear the commuting dead,"In this fine Korean entry in the 'fast-moving zombie' sub-genre, a diverse group of survivors find themselves sharing the linear confines of a high-speed train with ravenous undead, hoping to eventually reach safe haven. I watched an English subtitled version, but thought that the cast was very good, especially 10-year old Kim Su-an as Su-an and Gong Yoo as Seok-woo, her fund-manager father who is forced to re-examine his values in light of the grisly apocalypse. The film is somewhat uneven in the capacities of the hyper-animated corpses to absorb punishment but otherwise the story holds together pretty well (considering the premise is a communicable agent that near instantaneously turns a bitten person into a milky-eyed, frenetic cannibal). Well-made and smoothly directed, 'Train to Busan' is an entertaining entry into a generally bloated genre and impressively for a zomboid film, pulls off affecting, almost moving, ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An excellent excecution,"""Train to Busan,"" an action-horror film, pulses with locomotive power. Yeon Sang-ho's nihilistic image of humanity has been toned down in order to appeal to a wider audience. ""Train"" is a must-see for Asian-friendly genre merchandise buyers.Yeon presented a homeless community within the major railway station as the epicenter of a zombie epidemic in ""Train to Busan."" In ""Train to Busan,"" humans and zombies are divided by carriages, symbolizing the perilous divide between society's haves and have-nots.The action accelerates with exciting mayhem, aided by the confined train compartment structure. Resident Evil has a deliriously high level of energy and agility, as if they're fueled by ginseng and soju. Fans of Yeon's more edgy cartoons may miss his ruthless villains.

All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
No other director has ever tried to make a zombie movie in such a good way.,"Korean cinema is a repository of Sobi movies.Train to busan will be a movie that many have seen. But for those who can't see, there is no better option than to see a great zombie.No other director has ever tried to make a zombie movie in such a good way.The film is also a great emotional drama.The director deserves much praise for making everything that fills the minds of the audience and captivates them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fresh Zombie Film,"I didn't know what to expect from a Korean film taking on the zombie genre, a genre that I'd only ever seen from American directors and studios. I really enjoyed this film. It was a very dense film in that there was a tension, emotion, intent, and forward movement at every moment in the film. There was not really any down time, which is what I'm looking for in a thriller. I really liked the lead actor and empathized with him throughout and consider this a film worth seeing even if you're not necessarily a fan of American zombie productions.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Korean Zombies Done Right,"I've seen this film mentioned elsewhere and saw it come up in my Netflix recommendations a few times so I thought I'd give it a try - especially since the user rating is impressive for Netflix and it was nominated for and won some awards.In essence, it's a fairly typical zombie horror flick but the emphasis is a complex family dynamic and mental struggle of survivors on the train from Seoul to Busan. Nobody suddenly becomes a ninja warrior or a military arms expert and not everyone lives to the end of the movie. I think that differentiates it from standard Hollywood zombie fare and makes it more compelling in the end.The acting is pretty solid and the special effects are (even though sometimes comical) surprisingly high-quality. Even though zombies are kind of played out at this point I'd recommend giving this one a lazy, rainy day viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Korean zombie train,"It's the start of the zombie apocalypse. The population is caught unaware. An injured girl scrambles onto a train leaving Seoul for Busan. She had been bitten by an infected and soon becomes an infected herself. The infection spreads and the survivors find safety in a few cars. Among the survivors are a girl and her often-absent fund manager father, a strong man and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a baseball team and one cheerleader, and a selfish businessman.This is solid zombie fare. The zombies are reminiscent of World War Z. In fact, it might as well be a small part of that franchise. The characters are well-drawn. They are memorable. There are about ten good characters. The action is thrilling and scary both small and large scale. There is good tension throughout. There is one climatic scene that is trying too hard emotionally but that's a small flaw in an otherwise flawless action film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Train to Busan an showed America how to make a zombie movie.,"So, a typical Zombie movie from America has:
A badass character that does everything to save the world and side characters that help him do this things.
But Train to Busan is different. How?
Well in this movie the main character is just a normal character with a daughter trying to survive.And that's it.

"Snakes move over, because now there are zombies on a train...","Oh yeah! South Korea is back on the zombie map once again with another overly impressive feature. This time it is ""Train to Busan"" (aka ""Busanhaeng""). And I dare say that with this 2016 movie then director Sang-ho Yeon really solidly places South Korea on the zombie world map definitively.And although most of the entire movie takes place on a train from Seoul bound for Busan, then that is not really a hindrance to the enjoyment of the movie, because there is so much action and thrills to be had along the way that you forget that it only takes place on a train. But having the movie taking place on a train does also add some sense of claustrophobia and limiting the options of the protagonists.The story told in ""Train to Busan"" is about Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) a fairly neglectful father whom is traveling to Busan with his daughter Soo-an (played by Soo-an Kim). A deadly outbreak of infection spreads on the train, turning people into ravenous zombies hungry for human flesh, trapping the people aboard the train with nowhere to run.There is not really a dull moment throughout the course of this movie, and it does kick up into a high gear early on, and the movie keeps that pace all the way to the end. And that is really an accomplishment for director Sang-ho Yeon.The acting in ""Train to Busan"" is quite good, and it is good to see Yoo Gong in a movie such as this. But I must admit that I was more than impressed with the talents of child actress Soo-an Kim. She was really amazingly talented, and I think that she will go on to have an impressive career in acting.The effects in the movie were quite good, with just the right amount of gore and mayhem without it crossing into the gorefest territory. So this movie will appeal to a wide audience of fans of the zombie genre.""Train to Busan"" had initially slipped under my radar and I wasn't aware of the movie, before someone actually asked me whether or not I was aware that this was a zombie movie. So with that information, I immediately sought out the movie, and there is no regret here at all, because I was more than genuinely entertained and more than impressed with the final result of the movie.I can strongly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Train to Busan"" if you are a zombie aficionado like me. South Korea is making a lasting dent on the zombie world map, and if this is the level of future zombie movies from South Korea, then count me in for the long run.""Train to Busan"" scores a solid eight out of ten stars rating from me; no doubt about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great zombie movie!,"The prologue is interesting and sets up the story well. Gives us information on what is happening in the area, how it is effecting business and how even animals can become zombies. Due to the information we are told about what had happened in that area, we can already start theorising the cause of what's turning humans and animals into zombies.Overall the story was great. Good character development, some good pay-offs, great relationships made along the way and it really allows you to connect with most of the main characters.Towards the end things get very difficult for the characters we learn to love, giving us many emotional scenes and a bittersweet ending. To be honest, the ending almost made me tear up.There are some moments where things happen because they need to, such as the tunnels randomly coming every 2 minutes when they needed it despite being gone for half the movie and then never to be seen again. If you can look past those things you get a entertaining zombie movie I think many would enjoy and some may even love.There is a sequel and I don't feel like I will watch it. This movie has a great conclusion and I feel as though the sequel won't be able to live up to the original at all. I still may find it entertaining, but I believe there's a high chance it'll leave a bad mark on the conclusion of the original film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wouldn't watch again but is worth a watch if you like zombie films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Solid horror which is intensely, well-paced, and does well with the characters, even if it is not as perfect as the hype suggests","A lot of hype about this zombie film, and while I normally do not like these types of films (because they scare me), I decided to watch it. The plot sees a distant father escorting his young daughter back to her mother in Busan when some sort of outbreak occurs, and an infected gets onto the train. From there the film sees the infection spread across the train as an increasingly small group of survivors try to hold on in the hope that some stop will provide safety. In terms of narrative it is pretty straightforward, although at the same time it is a very limited space to make the action last for almost 2 hours – particularly since the zombies are more or less unstoppable.The film uses some convenience with vision to give the characters some breathing room, but mostly it does this by making us care about the characters. While they are essentially fairly obvious genre standards in the main, they are reasonably well done to make us care for them and invest in their struggle. This adds weight to the stakes and the decisions made. The film uses this well, and delivers a pretty well paced film. I thought that it was just a touch longer than it needed to be, but it comes in waves, with nice touches of respite along with intense scenes of attacks and chases. With this the writing does well to come up with different ways to have the zombies almost about to attack quite often – whether it be cracking glass, the dark of a tunnel, or so on. The emotional side of the film runs alongside this, and it is surprisingly affecting at times, although some key scenes at the end are a bit marred by the rather heavy use of music.The film does have blood and horror, but it is nicely light on the gore aspect; I dislike horror films which make a point of giving us real good looks at gore. Instead Busanhaeng lets the pace and tension and characters do the work, and I often found the pressure to be almost too much. The cast play well to this, whether it be the fear and regret of Yoo Gong or the gruffly likable Dong-seok Ma; even those playing more generic characters worked well enough to make it play.The film has received a lot of hype though, and this probably doesn't help it. It is a very good zombie movie, which does well to have plenty or horror but also delivers characters we feel for and want to survive, however it is still a zombie movie and mostly does just what you'd guess it will do – albeit that it does it well.",,Anonymous,Horror
The buzz for this film is totally worth it.,"Nothing turns me off more than when zombie films gradually derail from character development and fall into the trap of gorefests and amusement killing just for the sake of it. Train to Busan, however, restores my faith in the sub-genre as director Yeon Sang-ho does not treat his characters as mere cannon fodder. Each character arc is well-contemplated, the established relationships may not be equally potent with each other, but for a film to wrestle with so many of them while successfully maintaining the edge-of-the-seat tension, the result is quite brilliant.We can see positive character growth in the main protagonist, Seok- wu (Gong Yoo), a divorced, workaholic fund manager/""corporate bloodsucker"" who consistently neglects his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). We get to know that he's not exactly father-of-the-year material, he buys his kid a Nintendo Wii for her birthday oblivious to the fact that he already one to her earlier the same year. He reprimands her daughter's misplaced kindness during the zombie invasion, ""In times like this, you have to think for yourself first."" Few scenes later, the girl says to him, ""You only think about yourself. That's why mommy left."" Boy, he just got ""re-educated"" This kid is going to be her dad's moral compass throughout their eventful ride to Busan.Busan also includes a group of archetypal commuters to make this horrendous experience relatable to a wider audience: a pregnant woman (Jung Yu-mi) who's heavily relying on her brawny husband (Ma Dong-Seok), a pair of elderly sisters (Ye Soo-jung and Park Myung- sin), a pair of high-school sweethearts (Choi Woo-sik and Ahn So-hee) and a stern-looking businessman (Kim Eui-sung). The last person to hop in, however, is a girl with a strange bite on her thigh. We know where this heads now but the train crew seems to be more alarmed at the presence of a homeless man (Choi Gwi-hwa) hiding inside the washroom. Alas, once the infected girl rips the throat of her first victim and the zombies start to chomp and multiply (Hold the door! Hold the door! Hodor!!!), the film starts to categorize its characters: the selfless and the self- serving. These zombies may be the film's antagonist but there is a much more unsettling beast at the face of damnation: society quickly adepts to a new set of morals. Earning his spot as one of the most hated cowards in history, Eui-Sung's businessman character is the epitome of greed in this film. As he literally flings his fellow survivors to the undead for the sake of self-preservation, the point is clearly made that this is a dog-eat-dog world, whether it is the apocalypse or not.Whereas its obvious competitor World War Z shows a city-wide scale of apocalypse, Busan proves that confining it to a smaller scale is not a hindrance to deliver well-choreographed and jolt- inducing action sequences. Needless to say, my favorite part of this film is when the three male characters start to navigate their way through the carriages, each station proving to be more difficult than the last one. It certainly helps to know that these morphine-driven, break- dancing zombies have a flaw to them: they can only see or hear but they can't smell and they're also not taught how to open doors. Once those rules are established, director Sang-Ho levels the playing field by turning tunnel drives into game cheats, washrooms into sanctuaries and luggage compartments into unlikely safe passages.Train to Busan may not reinvent the zombie sub-genre per se but director Yeon Sang-Ho has a clever use of technique for this film to work both as a grisly form of entertainment and as a potent social allegory as well. For that, he solidifies his spot as a go-to- director when it comes to zombie films. The buzz for this film is totally worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lots of fun,"""Train to Busan"" is an amazingly entertaining movie, with a few missteps that stop it from being truly great.The story is pretty simple. Yoo Gong's Seok Woo is a man that only cares about his job. His wife has left him and lives in Busan, while his relationship with his daughter is becoming more and more strangled. The daughter (a quite amazing Soo-an Kim) wants to visit her mother for her birthday, and Seok Woo ends accepting. They decide to take the train from Seoul to Busan.At the same time a zombie-outbreak happens in South Korea.Cue lots of violence, running, blood and surprising moments, with a huge dose of feelings (but without falling into the cheesy).The movie keeps things simple: train, zombies, stations, and a bunch of people that will try to survive (some of them will do anything to do so). In that respect it is not especially original. The plot is thin as it comes, but the direction keeps things fast and breezy, and plot developments keep happening non-stop. The direction is a little bit video-game style, but fits the movie. The originality in the fights between the zombies and the survivors is one of the strong points of the movie, with some surprising moments. On the other hand, it can't help but fall into the ""I-don't-want-to-live-without-you"" moments, or some extra saccharine situations. Also, some of the characters' decision-making is just silly, and even if a couple of moments are clearly comedy, the line between comedy and action-horror is not clearly drawn, and some laughs are more on the ""wrong-time"" side. Actually, the movie is not very scary, but it is quite the ride.The acting is quite good, and some, as charisma-oozing Dong-seok Ma, or selfish-as-hell Eui-sung Kim, do a great job. And the music, scenery, and effects keep a good level thorough the film.There is also a quite obvious social commentary, but it does it in a way that it hits target more than misses, and brings its ideas clearly across the screen. This commentary elevates the movie in its lowest moments.""Train to Busan"" may not arrive on time, but you won't care.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
All aboard!,"Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe zone.""Train to Busan"" is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to succumbing to genre clichés, such as the one cowardly individual who will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time. Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous, but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be compassionate.Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not the best horror film of 2016, but it gets the job done","This film had me at a crossroads; one the one side, I am a lover of South Korean cinema, and I feel that the country is doing more to advance the art form than any other country. On the other hand, the movie was tame, simplistic, and devolved into a typical Hollywood style blockbuster, with none of the nuance and tact usually found in S.Korean movies. I had heard such great things about this film, and as excited as I was to see it, I just could not shake the feeling that it was limited by either the producer, the country, or the creative team. Where it could have been gruesome and disturbing, it aimed to be tame and heartfelt. I don't care about the human condition when it comes to Zombie films. I care about the Zombie's, who they kill, and how vicious they could get away with showing it.The acting was superb, and the cinematography was indicative of a very talented creative team. Why this didn't yield a more transcendent and original film, I will never understand. It really did seem like the team wanted to do something grandiose, but kept their reigns pulled back in order to not offend, disturb, or frighten their audience. Basically, a Zombie movie that isn't frightening just isn't worth your time. While Train to Busan was a great film (even by South Korean Standards), it could have been so, so much more. At it stands, it is simply an entertaining film from a talented team of creators and actors, and I suppose that this should be enough for any fan of horror films to give it a watch.FYI; If you want to see a truly entertaining, graphic and unique Zombie film, I would suggest watching the Japanese movie ""I Am A Hero"". It is objectively the best Zombie film of 2016, and deserve any real horror fans time and attention. It blows this movie so far out of the water, that it is not even a contest.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Climax after climax with smooth progress of the story line make this movie one of the best thrillers with emotional mixture and full of excitements and curiosity.I would rate it 10/10 ...If you have watched an extended trailer, it would be 9/10 I would say it is in the category of ""must watch""",,Anonymous,Horror
"A Truly Original, Creative, Awesome Zombie Film","This really is an awesome zombie flick. And what's even better, it seems to be on all the best free movie app's (Tubi, Pluto, Peacock, At the very least), and has been for months. Considering it's similarities, I'd call this a far superior version of World War Z, which was pretty much a disappointment.The acting was all top-notch, THANKfully, because that seems to be where so many horror movies fail the last 20 years or so.. There's just such a plethora of horror movies that have come out since 2000 that aren't just b-movie quality and low budget, but the acting is just AWFUL. And that's what I don't understand... Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead were made on shoestring budgets with all local Pitt actors and friends of the director, respectively, yet the acting was on par with most any other horror film of the time... So why, these days, are the low-budgets so terrible? Does the directing have THAT much of an effect on the actors' abilities? Or have the b-list actors really become THAT terrible?But I digress... There was literally only TWO things that KIND OF irritated me about the movie... no spoilers... First, there was too much STARING. You'll find yourself either screaming in your mind or actually screaming at the screen for whichever character TO DO SOMETHING! So instead of taking action and doing something in the best interest of survival, they'll just be standing there, staring at whatever threat for WAAAAY too long. Second, just like in a lot of horror or action movies, there's that one scumbag that really deserves to get it, and you look so forward to seeing it happen... and normally, the more scumbaggery they commit, the so much better you know it's going to be... Well, that's half right in this case... All I'll say is this turd really just keeps adding to your apathy towards him by constantly making choices that make you wanna smash his face in. And when the time comes, he... well, suffice it to say, I was extremely let down... like watching the entire 6 hours of the movie Gettysburg and the DVD showing the error screen right before the ending.Regardless, this movie is EXCELLENT. This and Night Eats the World are the two best SERIOUS zombie films in a very long time. Makes great use of tension throughout, and has plenty of moments that make you jump, not really from scares but more from little shocks. Very well done character building, bc you're either shocked or very bummed out when certain characters bite it. Check it out, you won't regret it.Side note: If anyone is looking for GREAT new horror movies, I STRONGLY suggest...
Host, Terrified (Spanish), Veronica (Spanish), Life After Beth, Braid (one of THE GREATEST, MOST ARTISTICALLY BEAUTIFUL endings of all time), Horsegirl, Kuso (AMAZINGLY warped), Let's Scare Julie, and Skins (Spanish, another wickedly bizarre and brilliant film)... Host is only 60 minutes but it's probably the only film that ever actually scared me for over 3/4 of it. I promise, you will really dig these if you love true horror, not mainstream trash.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The pacing of the film, to me, seemed very well done. It knew when to slow down and allow emotion to hit.

Train to Busan does exactly that.It takes every single trick in the book (might as well be a two hour edition of Robert McKee's ""Story"") and puts them all together, nicely wrapped in a bow of constant-zombie-action-engagement.You end up so engrossed in the action that you forget that you're taking in incredible story beats and an impeccable character arc that makes for a massive emotional payoff.Great acting.

Must watch!,"Just finished watching this (and whilst a few years later to the party) I can honestly say that Train to Busan was perfect. 10/10 easy. Amazing. Intense. Realistic but also controls a very confronting zombie-esc story line. Action packed from 10 mins in and never lets go. Heart rate went through the roof and in a good way. Powerful storytelling and for a South Korean film, amazing.

For a Korean film it's very Hollywood,"It was a good action film, a very good zombie film. But lacked the quirkiness or charm of the best Korean films.

This film LITERALLY raised the bar for zombie movies.,"If you have not watched Train to Busan..... go and watch Train to Busan.This is everything a zombie movie should be..... 99% of the time you are sitting at the edge of your seat. Yes, I can admit that there were a few wonky decisions made by some of the side characters at times, but for the most part, the acting in this film was stellar (not just for the main cast, but for the zombie actors too, they were terrific).I think people these days have grown to anticipate a protagonist that is selfless and immediately likeable, but South Korean cinema often transforms their lead characters through experiences, or sometimes would just outright highlight the 'dual' aspect to human nature, which is to make 'good' or 'bad' decisions depending on the circumstances.I gave it a 9/10 because it is in my all-time top 5 zombie films list, and because it can be re-watched many times and still be entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Zombie Film Out There,"This is certainly the best zombie film I've seen. Like most such films, this one avoids the classic but little-used-now voodoo or necromancy explanation for the reanimation of the dead, but unlike most others it does give an explanation for the phenomenon. This could have taken up half the film and weighed it down considerably, but the writers introduce it through a few deft touches which both explain what is happening and fuel the tragic plot. The cast does a good job (from what I can tell without knowing Korean), and both the action sequences and quieter moments are engaging.Horror fans will mostly like this, but it should appeal to others too, since its central characters and their predicament have universal resonance.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Utterly entertaining,"Train to Busan is an uber-entertaining action-packed, not-a-minute-of-rest Zombie Korean movie. No time to get bored, the zombies are like rats coming out of nowhere, with a healthy appetite for human flesh, and our heroes are bunch of normal good people stuck on the carriages of a train heading to the city of Busan.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which has nothing to envy to any of Hollywood zombie movies. The film might pass as an American film except for the message, because the message is definitely not Anglo-Saxon culture is Asian culture - individualism sucks, you care and you take care of your people, your don't just look after yourself, that is egotistical and inhumane. You are an hero for the love of your people not a hero per se. On the other hand, as always happens on this sort of movies, one questions who is more savage, the zombies, who became so against their will, or the humans not infected treating other human beings inhumanly out of suspicion.The actors are good in their roles but the beautiful girl Soo-An Kim is really the best of the lot. Her face is uber-beautiful, but without her mix of innocence and her dramatic qualities as an actress the film would have not worked or been so impacting. One really believes that what is happening to her is real. I also loved Yumi-Jung as the pregnant fragile Seong-kyeong, and Eui-sung Kim is excellent as the quintessential baddie Yon-suk.The main downside of the film is not what is in the film, but what is not in it. What was the origin of this zombie outbreak and how was controlled? That is never properly explored or explained. I could forgive the first question, but the second I thought it was unavoidable.Original? No. Good, Yes. Entertaining? Very. Satisfying, just partially.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

South Korean Film Industry is the Next Big Thing!,"What differentiates ""Train To Busan"" from the rest is its immaculate character expansion & a profound piece of social commentary!
It may insinuate as another generic Zombie feature but trust me when I insist it's more than that.'Zombies' when you hear the word, you may be prodded by the never ending Resident Evil Franchise or some individual ventures by Hollywood studios! No matter how you got your firsthand experience with this type of Horror but I'm certain; you either have lots of fondness or a box full of disgust for these.
Zombie Movies have always gained traction from audiences'. Especially for its exaggerated Tonality. Albeit a tried & tested formula for box office success.
Yet most of the times makers get it totally wrong. They fixate so much on its extravaganza that they kinda forget about fundamental nuances.'Train To Busan' is evidently diverse in that case. Crafted by utmost maturity, this not only showcases usual tropes of the Sub Genre but also provides an underlying Socio Political attire which considerably indicates our Class partite society.
All of the characters in here, portrays distinctive thoughts and ideologies! They all come from different backgrounds resulting a versatile input into characterization aspect!
Their convincing acts had helped in that regard as well.
The storyline showed its efficacy in emotions! Teared me up good, not gonna lie.
Cinematography is great, for a South Korean production they undoubtedly nailed on the technical front.Except the Soundscore!I might be in the minority here, but the soundtrack didn't seem impressive to me at all! It felt highly incapable of generating fitting emotions in certain sequences!
I'm not saying it's trash; could have been miles better though!
Another negative would be its marginally stretched screenplay which caused its necessary momentum to break oftentimes.
It also had inconsistencies throughout the plot in terms of writing & detailing.
Bearing in mind possible spoilers, I'm staying away from any sort of explanation but you will understand.Still I can comprehend all of your affection for it! This is more than a mindless Zombie execution which had strong sentiments underneath unlike any iterations we might have watched previously.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Unorigianal, but entertaining South Korean zombie movie","The highest grossing film in South Korea of all time is a routine, but well made zombie thriller. The story begins at the outset of a zombie outbreak with a father and daughter finding themselves on a train to the town of Busan, hoping to escape the zombie plague around them. Unfortunately, the train has a number of folks who are slowly turning intro zombies, so the survivors aboard the train find themselves having to fight their way through the infected cars to get to the safe ones. This story may sound similar to ""Snowpiercer,"" but ""Train to Busan"" lacks that film's smart political subtext. ""Train to Busan"" is simply trying to entertain and it does quiet successfully achieve that with tons of fast zombie action, some interesting set pieces, and solid special effects, which is all fine and good if you're into zombie movies. On the downside, I'm not a fan of fast zombies and prefer the slow lumbering Romero-zombies, just as I also prefer my zombie films to have a Romero-style political subtext. So overall, ""Train to Busan"" manages to come up with some interesting situations and set pieces and does them well, it's all pretty vapid and you'll forget most of the film an hour after you've watched it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Forgettable, Generic Horror","If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like ""Return of the Living Dead,"" (1985.) or ""The Beyond"" (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. ""Road To Busang"" is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like ""28 Days Later."" Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the ""Goddess"" is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. ""Train To Busan"" is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as ""throwaway entertainment."" Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it. I also doubt that anyone over the age of 18 that has more than 5 brain cells will think highly of this extended TV show.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tense ride that's well executed and even manages genuine emotion.,"This is one of the best zombie/virus outbreak movies ever made. The tension is palpable and builds throughout. By the end I was feeling like I had been running/panicking along with the characters.During the whole movie there was a perfect balance between the terror and panic, and the fear and distress and emotion that would come with such occurrences. At many points the execution of the zombies and how they move, react, attack was superbly directed and felt far more professional and well thought out that many U.S. movies that churn out the crap rubbish. Often in these kind of movies something happens which breaks you out of your watching because you think 'that wouldn't happen' or 'that's not realistic'. I don't think I thought that once during the whole movie.By the end I had a tear in my eye (as did the person I saw it with) - I won't say anymore other than the writer, director, crew, actors, all deserve a round of applause for a fantastic effort.I would suggest that zombie and horror movie lovers in the West DON'T WATCH THE U.S. TRAILER as it reveals too much - it won't ruin the film, but some of the scenes are really great and would be better as a surprise.",,Anonymous,Horror
Train to Busan,"Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The train to Busan,"The Train to Busan is a thrilling horror unlike any I have seen before. Director Sang-ho Yeon puts his own spin on a large scale zombie outbreak, after a chemical lab releases a deadly virus. Unsuspecting passengers board a train that will cause them to see much more than the little girls mother. Innocent passengers must endure the seemingly never-ending train ride to Busan as they watch the cities of Korea fall around them, after a plant known for making mistakes releases the airborne virus. Although it as an apocalyptic style zombie fight-for-survival type movie, I wouldn't put it in the same category as some of the other prominent titles in the genre such as I Am Legend, or even World War Z.Sang-ho Yeon added a new twist and stayed away from the typical 'tough guy gunning down zombies to save the world' approach of many similar movies, and focused on capturing the chaos happening during an apocalypse in the dense modern urban setting of South Korea. The characters consistently keep the audience on the edge of their seat because of the deeper emotional connection we are able to establish at the beginning by being able to relate to them. Because the language utilized in this movie is Korean it allowed me to focus more on character's emotions and facial expressions; this, however, does not take away from the film in my opinion. One of the key strengths of this film is the breathtaking camera work and shot choice, that helps engage the audience on a new level as we are immersed into their world. A large range of film techniques are used in this film and the utilization of subjective point of view shots greatly add to the already immersive film. South Korea being the setting of the film gives the audience an inquisitive urge to keep watching as each turn and bend is foreign to us. The director's definitive choice of setting for each shot aids the suspense and ""on your toes"" feeling for the duration of the movie. Unlike many of the other apocalyptic movies many of us have seen, the acting in this film is absolutely phenomenal. Going into this movie I had very low expectations for quality of acting, especially since I did not recognize any of the cast from previous movies. Each actor elegantly played their roles and spared no emotion. This blew me away as most other movies I've seen like this have focused on making a few characters look badass as they power their way through crowds of zombies, but this movie was different. Each character felt real and as the audience we really connect with them, feeling like we would have made the same choices.A combination of intricate detailed set pieces, carefully chosen shots, and remarkable acting took this seemingly average zombie apocalyptic movie, to an invigorating emotionally engaging thriller that contracted my attention throughout. Not once did I feel like checking my phone or going to the bathroom, as this movie had me completely immersed from the opening scene to the the final credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Idealistic Idiocy,"Finally got around to watching Train to Busan. Its a movie that has been hyped up greatly and absolutely love horror movies. Despite the great reviews I tempered by expectations because it is a foreign film.The movie starts out promising with an interesting premise of a zombie outbreak progressively getting out of control as our main characters begin a journey by train to Busan to see their wife/mother. But throughout the movie, the theme of helping self vs others is routinely and bluntly placed before viewers without any subtlety or situational queues to make it seem natural.The father representing a take care of you/yours point of view and the daughter always choosing to help others. But there isnt any nuance and its a childish dumb presentation. Like yea ok, the daughter offers her seat to an elderly woman...all fine and dandy but when she questions lift threatening decisions her father is making she always make it seem black and white morally and thats just not the case. This is my main problem with this movie. Its dumb and tries to present literal survival decisions as black and white morally rather than the incredibly complicated decisions they really are.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tired of zombie movies.,"People aren't going to like my opinion in that zombies are easy mode bad guys and that some how they can do everything superman can now.I enjoyed the movie.

The zombies became cartoonishly silly by the end.The end had moments where the previous movie sort of got lazy. Wounds not making any sense and incredibly stupid mistakes that you would not ever do just to force the desired ending.I'm a nit picker and noticed that right away. Had to take a star off for that one moment that mucked the story up.It is definitely a movie worth seeing. That's if you still like zombie movies.

Korean cinema is a curious beast; I love the films of Park Chan-Wook, but other contributors have a tendency to get a bit mawkish and oversentimental as the drama unfolds, and I'm afraid that what was otherwise a beautifully paced and entertaining ZOMBIE film ended up this way. I'm all for character development, and being made to care a bit who lives and who dies, but....IT'S A ZOMBIE FILM! It starts out tongue-in-cheek, with some genuinely squirmy horror vibes, and I think it would've been best if it managed that balance throughout, but it lost its way tonally a bit in the last 20 minutes.

"Decent zombie flick. Fresh, but not spectacular. Worth a watch.","I thought this was a pretty decent zombie flick. The pacing was good, but this is an action film more than a horror film. This was more World War Z than Night of the Living Dead. Some of the scenes were a bit of a stretch of the imagination, but it is a zombie film, not a biopic. There were quite a bit of ""feels"" which is usually hard to accomplish in a zombie film, and it actually felt pretty fresh without completely rewriting the genre. The movie effectively made you like some characters, love some characters, hate some characters, you get the point.Something that bothers me about zombie movies is the inconsistency of the zombie mechanics. How fast and strong a zombie is, how fast people turn, etc. This movie is pretty notorious for this. One minute, people take what seems to be up to 15 minutes plus to turn, then next minute people are turning immediately. Zombies are jumping over objects and mangling a group of people, and then in the next scene one man can hold back an entire zombie hoard by himself without a scratch. It definitely pulls you away from the story for a moment.Overall though, this was a decent film, and I had fun watching it. In the end, this is an action/horror film that should be treated as such. Don't expect everything to make perfect sense and don't expect stellar dialog and acting, although the acting is very decent for an action/horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Train to Busan' might well be the only apocalyptic zombie action-fest to be openly inspired by Charles Dickens's immortal Christmas parable 'Scrooge'!,"Director, Yeon Sang-Ho's almost absurdly locomotive 'Train to Busan' might well be the only apocalyptic zombie action-fest to be openly inspired by Charles Dickens's immortal Christmas parable 'Scrooge'! The doom-laden drama begins immediately after an allegedly benign chemical spill, along with massive civil unrest increasing exponentially there are wild & woolly reports of rioting across the country, and as the societal collapse swiftly spreads, various amusingly stock characters board the last train to darksvillle, along with one recently infected soul, who proceeds with laudable alacrity to scurrilously spread this especially vicious, bloodily viscous, universally eye-bleaching, zombie-making contagion! Unthinkingly aggressive, pack-like, dangerously nimble, this ferociously fleet-footed legion of relentlessly single-minded, flesh-craving savages makes for an especially unruly morass of terminally toxic humanity, and it will take all the available brawn, guile and collective humanity of our hastily organised zombie-resistance squad. A boisterous teenaged baseball team, an especially muscle-bound, Bolo Yeung-esque pugilist and his bulbously pregnant wife, a deliciously despotic, self-serving C.E.O, two immaculate, sit-com ready, octogenarian ladies plus the glacially aloof, hedge fund-manipulating estranged father of an implausibly cute, 'Spielbergian kid' desperately stave off this hellacious horde of hastily reanimated death, as their terror-beleaguered train wends its tumultuous 453 km journey to the hoped-for sanctuary of far flung, Busan. While the flighty film's non-stop, claustrophobic hysteria is frequently distracting, there's a singular sentimentality which felt incongruent; especially the existential, Dickensian emancipation of our handsome, young, estranged father protagonist, dramatically turning from callous, money-hungry 'Scrooge' to empathic, zombie-slaying super-dad! Another niggling irritant was the inevitable repetition of frequently frantic, door-fumblingly, 'oh-so narrow' escapes by our preternaturally plucky, carriage-bound protagonists, but, curiously, while only running at a lean 113 minutes, this celluloid exodus dragged on a wee bit, and could have richly benefited from some judicious editing, excising much of the saccharine sentimentality and enlivening the rather pedestrian script with additional fright-leavening flourishes of zesty repartee would have sped things along nicely, as more than once I could hear myself wearily ask the overwrought driver, 'are we were there yet?' 'Train to Busan' is a mixed bag o' rotten bones, while extraordinarily polished and well made, its momentary lapses of déjà vu, the timorous lack of practical gore FX and the film's grisly excesses of Spielbergian soul searching, perhaps, making this particular zombie apocalypse far more suitable entertainment for mainstream audiences than jaded, hardcore horror fans like me!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent infected horror and one of the better examples,"A group of terrified passengers fight their way through a viral outbreak while trapped on a bullet train ride to Busan.Train to Busan is a blood-drenched South Korean zombie/virus horror, director Yeon Sang-ho and writer Park Joo-suk offer a serious zombie apocalypse yarn. Interestingly most of the bloody, milky eyed and black vein thrilled story is set in the daytime. Joo-suk offers a novel take on the infected, which cannot see in the dark, this makes for some interesting viewing during the more tense scenes especially as the train travels through darkened tunnels.Sang-ho's twitchy infected are a fast moving reminiscent of 28 Days Later and WWZ at one point there are piles of clambering dead hanging from the locomotive. In addition, this is a decent looking film, not a straight to video, DTV offering, the production values are high and the special effects are impressive. The locations are grounded which adds to the tension and you buy into the characters plight along with the punchy surprise deaths synonymous with the genre. With mistrust between the players there's a social commentary about the division of class and its pecking order, its only apt it's set on a train.There are some action packed segments in stations and some subtler moments in tunnels and the city as the survivors encounter the army and contaminated. Surprisingly there's plenty of emotion especially between workaholic Seok-woo played by Gong Yoo and his young daughter, Soo- an, delightfully played by Kim Su-an who wants to see her mother. Notable is Ma Dong-seok who plays Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man. Dong-seok delivers some memorable zombie head bashing moments.Sang-ho balances the intense infected action and drama perfectly.

Smart, well written characters you actually want to survive because they don't act like blow up dolls with jello for brains. The most annoying part of any horror movie is the main characters responding to situations in moronic ways that no normal person would ever respond. No doubt Hollywood will soon remake it and lose everything that makes this movie believable/awesome. Regardless, this is a GREAT movie. This is an OUTSTANDING zombie movie.

Beyond the zombie cinematic, and great and atypical action scenes, Train to Busan contains some critics to the western culture.

"Finally, a terrific zombie movie.","In the last few years, especially about a decade ago, we were extremely flooded with zombie movies, both horror, comedy and even drama, however, a large majority of these ended up being mediocre movies and completely forgettable. Years later, in the middle of 2016, the fantastic South Korean filmmakers decide to change that and give us an entertaining, brilliant and original zombie story.Filled with fantastic scenes, fast-paced action and fabulous performances, Train To Busan is a great zombie movie full of emotional moments and well-built suspense, set in what is a modern city and at the same time, the claustrophobic atmosphere of a train. The film is made to entertain, from beginning to end does not bore, finally a film of this type that is really worthwhile to pass the time.

"Has the look and feel of a B movie, but this zombie movie turns out to be a rather good one. Great frenzy and gore. Riveting suspense and unnerving fight for survival.","Didnt expect much of it at first. Looked like a cheap B movie, because of the low budget for special effects. But that low budget for special effects turns out to be a good thing, because what we get instead of boring CGI effects is great real life mass pursuits of zombies. And instead of boring CGI we get a lot of real life unnerving close up fights for survival with zombies in a high speed train.Yes, the bloody zombies dont look particularly convincing, but their frenzy is terrific nonetheless. Yes, for those nitpickers who complain about apparent loopholes in the story, there are indeed some, but they dont affect the movie's suspense. The actors arent particularly great either, but their characters are quite convincing nonetheless.Despite all these minor let downs I got really swept away with this suspenseful story about a korean dad, who wants to protect his young daughter from zombie attacks on a train. The ""zombies on a train"" theme is rather interesting as well. All in all a really surprising, enjoyable and even emotionally touching zombie movie. 7 stars, but I will upgrade to 8 stars if this movie still stands strong after a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"High-Speed Horror: ""Train to Busan"" is a One-Way Trip to Genre Greatness","Don't expect your typical popcorn horror with ""Train to Busan."" This South Korean genre-bender from director Yeon Sang-ho injects fresh blood (pun intended) into the zombie apocalypse narrative, offering a thrilling ride brimming with social commentary and surprising emotional depth.Fans of fast-paced zombie flicks like Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" will find plenty to chomp on here. The film boasts relentless infected with a rabid hunger, masterfully shot chase sequences within the confines of the speeding train, and enough gore to satisfy even the most jaded horror aficionado. But Yeon Sang-ho goes beyond mere thrills.Similar to George Romero's classic works, ""Train to Busan"" explores the societal breakdown during a crisis. It compels us to question what truly makes us human and the importance of compassion, even when surrounded by the living dead. The film masterfully weaves this social commentary into the narrative, offering a stark contrast between those willing to sacrifice for others and those consumed by self-preservation.The film excels in its first hour. The set-up is brilliant, with a workaholic father and his young daughter embarking on a seemingly ordinary train trip that becomes a desperate fight for survival. The confined space of the train creates a claustrophobic tension that amplifies the terror. The characters, from the selfless heroes to the self-serving villains, are well-developed and engaging. There's even a subtle social commentary with the portrayal of a ruthless businessman reflecting a potential future for our protagonist.Train to Busan isn't flawless. The middle section can feel a bit repetitive at times, with the constant struggle for survival against the infected offering diminishing returns. However, the film recovers nicely, delivering a memorable and suspenseful finale that ties the emotional core of the story together.Train to Busan is a must-see for fans of the zombie genre. It's a thrilling ride with sharp social commentary, well-developed characters, and enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat. Even if you're not a die-hard horror enthusiast, this film offers a refreshing take on the apocalypse, reminding us of the enduring power of human connection in the darkest of times.7.675/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bullet Train Of The Dead...,"TRAIN TO BUSAN is a South Korean horror / zombie film set -mostly- on the titular transport. It's probably the best, most exhilarating zombie film since the 2004 remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD. What sets it apart are its extreme action and gore, mixed with humor that actually works, as well as healthy doses of effective pathos. We actually care about the characters, especially, ultra-driven businessman, Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his young daughter, Soo-an (Kim Su-an).Director Yeon Sang-ho has really refreshed the genre, with some inspired touches, including the way the undead function like a maniacal unit, swarming like fire ants, at one point even using each other as a bridge to their escaping victims. Also, watching zombies pile against safety glass until it explodes out, releasing a mass of bloody, snarling zombies, is a wonder to behold!An insanely entertaining, at times hilarious, ultimately satisfying movie for those who've given up hope on zombie epics...",,Anonymous,Horror

Korean cinema, as always, invests a lot in emotion and is superior to everyone else. A film, slightly superior to which I consider only ""I am Legend"", which far exceeds the average of the genre. The train to Busan, a journey during which the zombie epidemic begins, and among the last passengers is an injured and infected. It's already too late after turning into a zombie. Where is it safest as the epidemic is underway? Inside the train on the move or outside? Survivors try as hard as they can to keep the zombies restricted in some wagons of the train, but for how long? An endless journey, where the destination is doubtful. Very good script development, building some characters, others with ideals, others altruistic and others extremely selfish. Who will finally manage to survive? Will there be justice? Very good performances, good direction and makeup, and a great ending, with a lot of emotion.

Zombies on a train.,"Zombie film. Surely there's too many of these. This one though I've heard is rather good. Not snakes on a plane, but zombies on a train. Bear with me... We're in Seoul, Seok-woo and his young daughter Soo-an are heading to see his ex-wife, who lives in Busan. Even as we leave Seoul, something isn't right. A sky-rise on fire, partial reports of a leak at a plant. We know zombies are imminent having seen a deer reanimate in the opening scene... looks really cool actually. The train pulls away, but not before one of these now human zombies that we've half spotted in the periphery gets on board. Seok-woo isn't the most attentive father and falls asleep as their journey begins, leaving his inquisitive daughter to roam the train, just as things are getting weird. Now let's get to the point... are the zombies any good? Well yes, yes they are! They're quick, coming to life in bone cracking yoga poses, all snarly, rapidly covered in convincing looking blood and the camera cuts are choppy at breakneck speeds. Add lots of flesh ripping and screaming and we're on the right track, so to speak. It quickly becomes clear that life outside the train is a bit buggered. Zombies everywhere, standard apocalypse. Thanks to YouTube clips viewed on phones and a government news broadcast on the trains TV, urging people to stay home to remain safe (that sounds familiar), the passengers realise the scale of the situation and panic accordingly. So we've a microcosm of society on board, half the train infected, half okay. Separated by a barricade of luggage, a door and the zombie stupidity at not attacking because they can't see their prey. If that were it I'd say this film was in trouble, but an ill-advised stop does manage to rid the train of a few zombies, provide respite for the now few survivors and add some meat to the back story bone. It's here too that the film takes on a disaster movie tone. There's a plan now. Back on the train, there are people trapped in random cars and toilets, including Soo-an now separated from her frankly quite useless father. It gets a bit more inventive and this is accompanied by some of the characters stories getting fleshed out a little more... but only a little. It does look cool, there's some great sequences and the characters although a bit one dimensional are good enough to carry it. There are clear favourites you want to root for and those you can't wait to be zombie fodder. I think though that I was expecting more and expectations are always dangerous. If you like zombie films, you will love this, but if you're after something a bit meatier, this I think comes up short. Su-an Kim, as the young Soo-an really is the stand out. Some of the other performances are good, but she brings her A-game and really is the glue that holds it together. A good zombie film is always worth a watch and this is, but it's only that, a good zombie film, nothing more... and that zombie deer in the opening scene really does look cool.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pleasantly surprised.,"By now I have extreme ""zombie fatigue"" between all the movies and shows about it, and I really wasn't looking to watch one more. I had heard about this movie before and how good it was supposed to be but didn't feel like watching yet another zombie flick, until one of my sisters made a case for it. So I had to check it out, and I now can see why it is highly rated. It definitely has some fresh elements compared to all the Hollywood productions and that's definitely a plus from being a Korean movie. However there are a few things here and there that bothered me, like the complete ""overacting"" faces and movements from the actors becoming zombies, which I feel were too ridiculous and comical for the tone of the movie; also the acting was pretty uneven.So all in all I would recommend it even if you're pretty over zombie movies at this point.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than most zombie movies,"I generally do not enjoy zombie movies with few exceptions, like World War Z, 28 Days, and now this one. Train to Busan has a little more depth, and tries to answer basic survival questions , such as everyone for themselves vs try to help others. The actors do a fair job, but the stand out was the child Soo An. She steals the show for sure. The story is ok, but not spectacular. I think it might have benefitted from some trimming. There is also the matter of some plot holes and some actions that do not make sense even in a zombie flick. Even so, it is worth watching. It gets off to a slow start, but after the first 20-30 minutes it takes off like a freight train.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

But exactly this makes it great, seing today can be good reference to recent pandemic, offering the taste of revenge , reminding force of sacrifice for help other, proposing seductive final..The ambition of young business man, discovering what real matters, and the wisdom of his daughter, this is, for me, the main virtue, not ignoring the fair dose of humor.",,Anonymous,Horror

Don't Listen to Negative Reviews,"I just saw this film at the theater as part of AMC's Thrills and Chills Surprise Screenings.

I would be surprised if this film was not influenced in any way by those two films or at least one of them.On another note, sitting in the theater, not knowing which movie was to be played, it was a bit eerie seeing the subtitle ""Quarantine"" whilst watching a film occurring in East Asia, as we are still in the midst of the pandemic.

"Train to Busan: Action, Horror, and Sadness.","Train to Busan is a movie that you probably haven't heard about. I didn't either until my dad forced me to watch it with him. He didn't tell me much about it, except that it was a zombie movie. We've seen zombie movies, the cliche walking corpses and the race to survive. I figured it would be just like them, and wasn't prepared for much. Boy, was I wrong. If you can get past the subtitles, you should brace yourself for an emotional, action-packed and morally challenging adventure, as there is nothing like this movie and I doubt there will be for a long time. Unlike well-known zombie-horror films/shows like The Walking Dead or World War Z, Train to Busan manages to create an emotional attachment to the characters. Even though the main character starts out as a prick, we still feel for him and want to see him improve. It kind of reminds of me of the movie Shaun of the Dead, in the sense of a unique approach to the cliche. Shaun of the Dead takes a more comedic and wacky approach to the cliche, with some hints of seriousness, and Train to Busan takes a serious and somewhat realistic approach, with some comedic moments, which is a good balance. The movie somehow packs in these emotional attacks with exciting unique action into a two-hour film, making it hands down the best zombie survival movie along with providing a unique and enjoyable experience.The film starts with the main character Gong Yoo (It's Korean) sitting in an office space and is depicted as a supervisor or administrator of a large corporation. He returns home for his daughter's birthday, late, and gives her a Wii U, which she already got from her mom. He also missed her singing performance, causing her to lose confidence and stutter out of singing. Right off the bat, we know that he's not the best father, but he still cares for her. Things get serious when they board a train to the city Busan to see her mother, as a strange and hysterical woman sneaks on board. Of course, that woman is what you would call a zombie, and thus the classic virus spreading action begins. While their whole city is worrying about their own zombie attack, we get to see it from the point of view of train passengers who are cramped in a small linear passage trying to survive.If you were to just look up the movie and take a glance at it, it would look silly. It's hard to make a zombie movie not look ridiculous. Now before you say ""Well it's a zombie movie, isn't that silly?"" While that is true, the movie somehow takes a silly and cliche concept and magically turns it into something serious, exciting, and original. Of course, there are some inescapable unrealistic moments; such as train security not noticing a clearly strange woman without a ticket board the train, or nobody regarding the woman while on the train. Those are just nit-picky things you can't avoid.Every movie has its faults, yet the faults in Train to Busan don't even come near to how amazing the film is. As I've said before, the pure emotional value packed in with exciting action makes it so great. I don't know exactly how they did it, but I can tell you that the two ""Us vs Them"" and ""Me vs Us"" themes play a big role. Us vs them is pretty obvious; a group of strangers banded together to fight the evil zombies outside, sharing resources and information. However, the Me vs Us theme goes a bit deeper. Would you sacrifice everything for a bunch of strangers you just met on a train? Or would you abandon them in hopes to survive on your own? We witness the characters go through these decisions and change as the story progresses. Gong Yoo was a businessman who wouldn't raise a thumb to help the poor, yet later on, he risks his life for a homeless man by turning back to help him up to run from a horde of zombies. After watching the movie I felt the effects of its message.Along with moral challenges, by the end of the movie, you will shed a tear. Trust me. You will feel sorrow for the characters. This is one of the few movies where I actually felt sad after watching it, and that's saying something for being a zombie movie. I definitely wasn't prepared for it, and it hit me like, well, a train. A lot of movies you will forget about after a couple of weeks, and some you will hold on to for a very long time. This is one of those that you will hold on to.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the better recent zombie films.,"Train to Busan (2016) is a movie my fiancée and I watched together on Netflix. The storyline follows a zombie outbreak and a father and daughter's escape from a city and onto a train. The storylines continues with how the train deals with it's world around them and the father's commitment to the daughter's survival. This movie is directed by Sang-ho Yeon (Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula) and stars Gong Yoo (Guardian: The Lonely and Great God), Yu-mi Jung (Our Sunhi) and
Ma Dong-seok (Eternals). The storyline for this is very compelling and way better than it should be. The audience becomes very invested in the characters and you can't wait to see what they do next. The acting is very good and the daughter/father bond is well portrayed and delivered. The zombies sequence are also well done and you feel the intensity of the scenes. I would strongly recommend this movie and score it a 9/10. One of the better recent zombie films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan","I guess this might be referred to as a 'popcorn movie' in as much as it doesn't set out to change the world but just entertain, trouble is I'm just not sure at what point you would have the time to grab a handful and amidst the mayhem there are moments of seriousness and cause for reflection, especially in the midst of our own, very real pandemic. Director Sang-ho Yeon was known for animated films before plunging into this immaculate and superior example of the action movie. There is a brief introduction with scenes of work and private life showing considerable signs of strain even before we plunge into the most devastating and excitingly constructed runaway train with zombies. I guess they are not really zombies but persons rapidly infected in such a way as to display zombie like symptoms. Cleverly we are introduced to the main characters and then shown in terrible and frightening clarity the bloody and warped reality of such a victim. Such is the detail and believability that when more and more and even more are so transformed we are only too aware of the detail. Indeed the director's animation background makes him perfect for using (I assume!) CGI in such imaginative and convincing ways we really believe piles of zombies and tumbling over each other like great waves of living dead. At two hours the film is just about right and I think, looking back, that the reason this almost single set film maintains its momentum so well is partly that it is so well shot. The imaginative use of the camera, as well as the editing, help enormously, as does the restrained but effective emotional involvement achieved through minimal but well judged dialogue between the main protagonists. Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original and Intense,The movie started off slowly for me but then I found myself really getting into it. The hero is at times hard to like but starts to redeem himself as things go on. The action scenes are great. The story arcs of the characters quite bold and and I was shocked at times as to the casualties. Nobody is safe in this movie. I found myself towards the end quite unsettled. Not because of the gore or violence but because of the deaths of some of the characters and also the horrible and vile nature of the baddie executive and the other commuters on the train.

Train to Busan,"Seok-woo is a workaholic fund manager living in Seoul with his mother and Su-an, his young daughter. She is desperate to see her mother, who lives four hundred and fifty kilometres away in Busan. Eventually her father agrees to take her and together they board the train to Busan. As the train prepares to depart we are introduced to a few other characters; a man and his pregnant wife; a pair of older women; a school girl and her boyfriend a wealthy business executive; a homeless man who keeps saying 'everybody is dead!' and a girl who is behaving strangely. Soon after the train sets off this girl attacks a train attendant... it is clear that she was infected with something that causes extreme violence. It isn't long before more and more become infected and survivors are barricading themselves in the remaining safe parts of the train. If that weren't enough it is clear that the infection is affecting people throughout South Korea.I really enjoyed this South Korean zombie film; it provided tension from soon after the start right to the final scene. The zombies are more like those infected in '28 Days Later' than classic slow shuffling ones some people might not be keen on that but I think so long as they are scary all is good... and these provided the scares. The film nicely establishes rules that these particular zombies follow. Inevitably there are plenty of gory scenes, but nothing too excessive, and it isn't entirely obvious who, if anybody, will survive. The key characters are introduced well and fairly quickly; they include a good cross section of society and both heroes and cowards. Setting the film in the confined space of a speeding train adds an extra danger as there are limited places for survivors to hide safely for any length of time. The cast is solid and make us believe in their characters; similarly the special effects are pretty impressive. Overall I'd say that this is definitely a film to watch if you like zombie movies.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really fun,"I love Korean horror movies. Right when the action and horror is at its peak they insert this home like humor that makes you feel for the characters and understand that while the plot might be ridiculous, so is real life.This is not a comedy, like Gowemul, which I really liked, but has some of these moments that make it fun. The scene when the guy apologetically tells his pregnant wife ""Honey, can you run?"" while a horde of zombies approach was priceless.So, yeah, it's a zombie movie. And while it feels fresh, it's nothing you haven't seen before. It's Korean, so it has some specific idiosyncrasies and some of the jokes or social issues it hints at might pass over your head, but it's not that deep.I liked the actors, the kid was really good. The special effects were OK most of the time, but there was one ""explosion of zombies"" effect they used twice without it being needed and it looked kind of stupid. I liked the scene where the ""villain"" kind of explains how he feels and why he did the horrible and stupid things he did. It is important to care about your characters, including the bad guys and the sacrificial lambs. Americans might want to learn from that.Bottom line: I had a lot of fun watching it. Even my wife was hooked by the end and wanted to watch the ending. Keep fresh horror coming, Korea!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally Recommend It-One of the top Zombie films I've Ever Seen,"This is not ""just"" a zombie film, it is a film with a message, carefully crafted, and with outstanding production value. When I was looking for a scare on Netflix, I saw this ""Korean Zombie Film"" I have never watched Korean Zombie Films before and decided to give it a look...and man...I was in for a thrill!The camera angles and framing are on point, character development and human emotion and psychology is in it for good. It is mostly action with the drama side of it to get stronger with perfect timing. There is a thing in it I considered a bit ridiculous, but I still give it a 10 out of 10 because this film is definitely art; specially something that happens by the end and the way it is portrayed...

Train to Busan resembles with Snowpiercer in which both film main setting was on the train but twisted with Zombie Apocalyptic Plot.,"Before Train to Busan became popular when it reaches big screen across the globe, I thought It will have a resemblance with Snowpiercer a film which was also directed by a Korean director, Bong Jon Hoo. What's differ with this Train to Busan film is, it is purely Korean made from director to language and it became popular over the social media because of the uniqueness of the Title.Train to Busan resembles with Snowpiercer in which both film main setting was on the train but twisted with Zombie Apocalyptic Plot. However, just like previous zombie horror sci-fi film, there's nothing special with the zombies in Train to Busan from how it was spread and how zombies reacts with uninfected ones. I loved how the train gives major role in the film however, despite they are inside the train, the story is something that so usual among zombie horror film. One bad point is, they are always in a group; a group with different personality and objectives which for me is platitude to give a thrilling rising in action. Story is not that unique, cliché, plot holes and impossible scenes are present in the whole duration of the film. It's the same as usual zombie apocalypse with no major changes of plot.Train to Busan is definitely a simple Zombie Horror Film that do not gives adrenaline satisfaction of it's common and bad story line. But still a must watch movie for Zombie Lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
it's not a zombie movie,"Yup, it's different. although zombies are the central element of the storyline, this movie just about zombies and survival and that's what i loved about this movie.

Way overrated zombie flick with stupid characters,"'m a zombie movie fan, all the way back to the original. I even love the fast hoarding ones of today. So when I heard about this Train to Busan one and saw the high ratings, I rushed to watch it. And what a joke!I'm not going to recount the plot as they're pretty much all the same with apocalyptic zombie movies. What makes them different are the characters and how they act in such situations. This move, the characters are all just spineless morons. Imagine all the dumb teenagers from any horror movie that repeatedly do stupid, unrealistic things over and over and over until they all get picked off one bye one. Now transplant them into a bunch of teenagers, adults, and senior citizens and stick them all into a train. Yes, this is a zombie movie, so I can suspend reality for a bit, but c'mon! At least have somewhat sensible people. The repeat offenders of bad choices are all over this movie.Watching this was annoying and frustrating. Was it scary ever? Not at all, just a bunch of people with painted on veins and bad hair. We've all seen better ones in Dawn of the Dead and the 28 Days/Weeks ones. Did I care about any of the characters surviving? No, if they keep doing dumb things then they sure as hell deserve to die.Don't believe the hype, this movie is complete pass for horror fans.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best zombie movies of recent years.,"'Train To Busan (2016)' is one of the best zombie movies of recent years, boasting a frenetic energy and the ability to create pulse-pounding tension thanks to an astute focus on fast-paced yet clear action sequences that feature several well-developed characters.

Good but no Masterpiece,"Lots of praise by other reviewers so I will play the advocatus diaboli here - Train to Busang is a good flick with fast running zombies/infected like portrait in 28 Days later etc. A couple of ppl are in a train as the outbreak hits the nation (South Korea). The fight of these survivors on the train and on some stations is the main plot, centered around a father and his little daughter and a man and his pregnant wife as the main heroes. I liked the movie - camera, acting everything is pro but the movie lost for me a lot cuz some figthing scenes were just not well executed - for example three guys fighting with baseball bats and fists their way through train wagons filled with dozens of infected. No bite, no blow, no wound, it's just simply impossible, it looks like a little bit of a Chackie Chan movie here - trained forces with guns etc. turned cuz they their overruned by the infected but our heroes just get them down with one fist-punch... If u ever had to fight with a mad guy you know what a strength such a man can execute even if you are of more strength and weight. Also the gore level is for my taste rather low - lots of blood yes, but no limbs or guts etc. flying around or flesh bitten out by hungry maniacs etc. So yes, this movie is far far better as all those wanna-be zombie flicks from pseudo-filmmakers with no talent and/or budget but can't beat the elite movies of this genre: a good movie but not in all aspects (some terrible hollow Asian drama scenes) really convincing and in no way the ""best zombie movie ever"" like some other reviewers stated.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable overall but a bit too long,The movie's enjoyable thrilling and emotional at the end but didn't need to be two hours long.Also the rules of how long it takes for an infected person to become a zombie were not clarified and it took different amount of time for different characters who were infected to turn which is annoying because it felt like they change the time required to turn depending on the character and the situation.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
zombie express,"Another zombie movie? Yes, and Yeon Sang-ho's ""Busanhaeng"" (""Train to Busan"" in English) is a cool one. The plot involves a zombie apocalypse overrunning South Korea, while a group of train passengers tries to contain the infected passengers. Just as most zombie movies give their living dead unique attributes, this one does: the zombies can't see in the dark, so they have to rely on their hearing (meaning that the living can sneak past silently when the train passes through tunnels).It's not a masterpiece, but fun. I suspect that it's fun to play zombies, or whatever the infected people are supposed to be. The subplot about the absentee father and his daughter trying to reconnect gave the movie a more human side than most zombie movies out there. I hope that Yeon continues making movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Thrilling and Heart-Wrenching Cinematic Triumph,"Train to Busan is a cinematic triumph that explores the horrors of a zombie apocalypse in a unique and impactful way. The film's visual effects and cinematography are nothing short of stunning, with well-executed action sequences and a palpable sense of tension that pervades the entire story. The film's tight pacing keeps the audience engaged, and the realistic portrayal of the characters and their emotional struggles makes it a truly unforgettable experience.The actors in Train to Busan deliver outstanding performances that further elevate the film. Gong Yoo is particularly impressive in his role as a workaholic father who learns the value of family and selflessness as he fights for survival in a world overrun by the undead. The supporting cast also shines, with strong performances from Ma Dong-seok as a brave and heroic man, and Kim Su-an as a young girl who provides the film's emotional heart.What makes Train to Busan truly exceptional is how it uses the zombie genre to explore complex themes of humanity, morality, and sacrifice. It is a film that is both terrifying and deeply moving, and it will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.In conclusion, Train to Busan is a must-see film that showcases some of the best elements of modern cinema.

This one were a bit different yet again, but Korean, and also a different setting all together. The movie does contain all the cliché character types of a zombie movie. But they were very dynamic and all of the main characters seemed like they did perform well in their roles.Even without subtitles I enjoyed the movie, and still understood the plot, but I would have preferred subtitles to understand all the conversations.The train idea, actually worked really well, and made for some interesting sequences, with drama and a claustrophobic feel. Most of the scenarios seemed plausible, but there were a couple of times where I think the CGI were unrealistic, but surely put in there for a more dramatic feel. I think the ""passive bystander"" suspense, were a bit overused, maybe again to try and draw on the drama. Other than that, the movie were overall quite well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Zombies on a train,"Zombie films have been hitting our screens since the dawn of time. Well, it certainly feels like they have anyway. Popularised by George A Romero's terrific Dead trilogy, zombie films have since been rearing their heads like hordes of the undead themselves. Whilst they can be a lot of fun, more often than not, they can also be cliché ridden and trashy. We have had some quite enjoyable zombie films recently such as, Cockneys Vs Zombies and The Horde but we haven't really had a properly great zombie movie since 2004's Shaun of the Dead. Train to Busan changes that.I saw Train to Busan on a whim. I'm travelling in Singapore and had a few free days so I thought that I'd check what's on the cinemas here. Train to Busan caught my eye but I had never heard of it, however I saw that it was Korean and that it had zombies in it, so I was sold! To my surprise, I came out of the cinema having just viewed easily the best zombie film in a decade. Korean films have hardly ever let me down and Busan is no exception.As there's very little coverage of this film on the Internet, I'd better give a rough plot outline. It basically follows a selfish father who is cold and neglectful towards his cute young daughter. For her birthday, she wants to travel to Busan to see her mother so he reluctantly takes her on the train to Busan (creative title) however, a rather inconvenient zombie outbreak occurs as they board the train. The rest of the film is a claustrophobic and thrilling fight for survival as the survivors desperately try everything in their measure to get to Busan on a undead-infested train.What makes this film so great is the characters. Most horror films (particularly ones with zombies in) sprinkle a load of disposable characters in who all die in a predictable order. We don't often particularly care when they die, in fact we're more likely to relish the gory death shown in all its bloody gory. In contrast, Train to Busan focuses in on a line of memorable characters who we actually care about and want to see survive. They're developed in such a way that when someone cruelly perishes, we feel a great sense of loss and emotion. This is where the film's strength lies. What's also interesting is that they're not all stereotypes either. The protagonist isn't your typical hero, he's a character who is grossly selfish and unlikable at the start, but he subtlety develops into someone you begin to care about and admire.The film starts off as a good little zombie thriller. There's a sense of realism to the whole situation as we're made to watch the panic unfold on the train in an effective way. There's also a nice comic touch to the whole thing with some witty dialogue so it never takes itself too seriously. It also somehow never gets boring even though the film is essentially two hours set on a train, which is no easy task. There's always tension and a sense of peril. You get the feeling that anything could happen to these characters at any given moment. Once the film reaches the mid-way point though it stops being good and starts becoming great.Things get going fairly quickly so the characters develop through the action, making the film all the more gripping as it goes on. It's an unpredictable ride with lots of thrilling set- pieces to keep you on edge. The final half hour is essentially non-stop action and it becomes exhausting to watch without ever feeling too ridiculous. What really impressed me though was the emotional charge in the second half. There are a few scenes which had me welling up with tears, which I wasn't expecting. I just got so absorbed in the characters and their intense situation. The use of music and editing is also hugely effective in pulling at your heartstrings.There's really very little which Train to Busan does wrong. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that I would've liked more gore. Zombie films always give a good excuse to give us an array of fun, gory effects but this film is surprisingly restrained. There's a lot of hand-to-hand combat and nothing else creative. However, this does sort of add to the realism of the situation as you're not going to find many axes or chainsaws on a train. It's still not as bloodless as World War Z.I can't urge you enough to watch Train to Busan, especially if you're a fan of Korean cinema. It doesn't just offer plenty of nail-biting thrills and impressive special effects, It offers emotion and splendid characters whom you can properly invest in. It's a powerful film which wears its heart on its sleeve and contains more character development in two hours than The Walking Dead has in six seasons. Once the film was over I became overcome with emotion. I felt like I could just break down and cry at what I had just watched. This is so much more than a zombie flick, at its heart it's a devastating drama about family and the importance of human kindness. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really Emotional!,"First, I have to say, the mark 10 I gave here is just because of my own emotion to this movie. This movie makes me cry a few times while watching it. The plot is normal, we could probably guess almost the movie. However, all the other things are great! The music, perfect! The cinematography, amazing! There are some really great scenes in this movie which I highly respect the director! This movie reaches all our emotion, all at the highest level like when it comes to the action scene, it makes me worry and follow all of them, my heart is beating fast like them; when it comes to the emotional scene, I cry and feel really sad.. So, in general, if you're a ""emotion guy"" like me, you could probably like this. If you're kinda strict, you could just give it mark 7. It's all depend on your type of person.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I have had it with these mf zombies on this mf train!!!!,"Korean Zombies (think World War Z) on a train packed with passengers desperately trying to get to Busan. A decent supply of heroes and villains are whittled down in what provides a claustrophobic environment. The limitations of the train are often cleverly exploited with fewer contrived moments. Pace plays a massive role in the movie, that of the zombies and the train, this is balanced with elements of stealth and quiet. As with the best apocalyptic movies the reactions of those in peril and the challenges to social norms are well explored. The characters are earnest and sympathetic, if at times a bit one dimensional.
It does a hell of a lot with must have been a meagre budget, and there's plenty of fun to be had on this rollercoaster. The result may not be up there with the best (28 days/weeks later) but there's something undeniably cool about watching a foreign language action movie, so you can bracket this one with Nikita and The Raid. Not necessarily in terms of quality but in kudos earned. SEVEN",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.","'TRAIN TO BUSAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A South Korean zombie apocalypse horror flick, about passengers on a train to Busan that are trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It was directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who's only previous experience is in writing and directing animated horror and thriller movies), and it was written by Park Joo-suk. The film stars Gong Yoo, Kim Su-an, Jung Yu-mi, Kim Eui-sung and Ma Dong-seok. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was a blockbuster at the international Box Office (breaking multiple records). I really enjoyed it as well.Seok-woo (Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who's obsessed with his job and has made little time for his young daughter, Soo-ann (Su- an), in recent years. Seok-woo has promised to take Soo-ann to Busan, to see her mother, but of course things don't go as planned. A zombie outbreak spreads throughout the train, and seemingly everywhere in the area. Seok-woo, and his daughter, must work together with other passengers on the train, to survive the trip and hopefully make it somewhere safe. At the same time Seok-woo tries to prove to his daughter what a good father he can still really be (by becoming a badass zombie fighter).The film has some great special effects, and awesome (brutal) zombie action scenes. It's a great dark horror movie, with biting social commentary on the battle of the rich verses the poor (despite how cheesy it might sound). It's also a surprisingly emotional character study, with a pretty diverse (and well developed) group of characters. The film is a lot of fun, it's satisfying to horror fans, and it's even got some decent drama in it (and acting). I think it definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Enlightens the zombie formula on a mass level.,"Train To Busan (2016) :
Brief Review -Enlightens the zombie formula on a mass level. The zombie formula has been haunting audiences since the 1960s, and almost every major film industry in the world has done at least one film on this subject. Train to Busan was South Korean cinema's attempt to explore the scary formula, and as I can see, they have truly taken it to a mass level. This film has reached audiences across the globe and is quite popular in India too. Why? The reason is simple: They have just managed to make it easier for audiences to understand it. No complexities, no realistic, brutal theories of human nature, which are two of the most respected themes in Korean cinema. There are no medical statements or research either; hence, it goes to the mass level. There is one more reason to look at this film differently. Most of the zombie films made before this were set in cities or towns, some in public areas, which can easily be used as a reliable source for the infection to go viral. Here, we have a running train. A running train or a flying plane would always feel more scary because the chances of survival are the lowest there. The passengers can't easily get out, unlike the cities or towns where you see them running away in their cars. Also, the mass-level presentation of zombies is pretty interesting, even though the basic formula is too dated. You know it right: the person gets bitten by a zombie, and within a few minutes he/she will turn into a zombie. But before the transformation, he/she will do whatever is possible to save their loved ones. Train To Busan couldn't overtake that cliche, but it's not that big of an issue. The ending could have been better, I guess. Rest; it's a very busy film and doesn't bore you at all. Watch it for that smooth ride through horrifying events. It is worth those two hours. One of the most glorious zombie flicks ever, if not the best.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impression Gained through Zombie,"In South Korea, a zombie virus breaks out. The threat of the virus strikes even on the train to Busan. One after another, more and more people are infected and more people die. The danger is of being attacked by zombies over and over again so the survivors also suspect each other of being infected. Especially after the first stop, a series of betrayals and rescues await you. Will anyone escape the zombie virus and make it to Busan?In this film, we see the human character in the process of escaping the virus. Will they betray or help? Struggle to the end or give up? The expressions and movements of the characters are wonderful, as is the urgency of the crisis. That moment when the characters turn into a zombie is really heartbreaking. The film is a mixture of horror and emotion. So I recommend it and you should see it once.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, but lacks any real innovation.","This movie was quite entertaining, but really lacks any innovation or originality. It's pretty much just another zombie movie. It really adds nothing to the genre. I just wish there was more about this movie to take in, but there's not. I don't see myself ever rewatching this movie, it just isn't that great.The characters are all just okay. As most would agree, the big Jackie Chan-looking guy was the best. The main Dad character was pretty bland. His ending arc was kinda cheesy, like a typical Korean Drama.Then we have the typical over-the-top d-bag villian. The writers went out of there way to get the audience to hate the guy as much as possible. I don't know, just seems cheap, in my opinion. Th villian was pretty lame and cliche.But what's up with so many people gushing over the pretty cheerleader? Don't get my wrong, she is quite pretty, but too many people are making a huge deal out of her beauty when it's not even nesscary. Guys acting like virgins who's never seen a pretty girl before. I've even seen reviews that just talk about this girls looks, and barely review the movie itself, then they rate it like a 9/10 or 10/10, LOL! Why would someone base a movie review off the looks of just one character? That doesn't make sense for a movie review.But for all the characters, they lacked real actual character development. They are all kinda bland, one-note, and with not much real growth. But the movie is more focused on just them escaping zombies. This movie would've been amazing if they developed the characters more and had some originality for the zombie genre.The movie is still worth seeing for the amazing special effects and suspense. It's best watched with friends or girlfriend. But movie is nothing of substance that will stick with you, for me at least.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The suspense and thrill also keep you on the edge. BUT and this is a really big but, how the characters take decision here is what infuriated me the most. They are - to put it nicely - UTTERLY STUPID.The story started nice and sound. All good until zombie arrived and suddenly all characters decided to be the stupidest person in the world. Yes, I know zombie and any other life-threathening situation will clouding your judgment. But in this movie, it's just unbelievable idiot. I lose interest through the end of the movie but keep watching (though with high blood pressure).Yes, yes there are touching dramas here and there but the drama doesn't need to occurred IF the stupid decision was not taken at the very first place.

Incredible how people gives such high marks for this mediocre film...!!,"I am surprised to see this film got such a high marks on IMDb!!! i found the acting of the actors mediocre at best...their reactions are quite fake, unbelievable...they cant convey the feeling of hopelessness, desperation and the decor could be hundred times better: nothing is in disarrayed, no litters found, no smokes, no debris except for few things...everything is so clean and i don't feel at all scared or anything.....It is such a huge let down. The worse of all is that the acting of the actors: main as well as supporting actors: they are not real enough and their emotions are forceful...i feel like they are all amateur....I have never seen a zombie in my life but i think the zombies in this film run too fast and very coordinated when they jump or chasing after people, it means when necessary to run after the uninfected ones. But when the uninfected ones fell, well, the zombies started to walk clumsily and slowly toward the fallen....like they knew their preys could not run so they, the zombies, do the ""zombie walk"" just to impress them !!!

Zombies on a Train,"The action of ""Train to Busan"" is so intense and the set-up excellent that the movie's faults may almost be overlooked. Others have, rightly, compared the fighting aboard a train, moving through carnage from car to car, to ""Snowpiercer"" (2013), also by Korean filmmakers and also including a heavy-handed message on socio-economic inequality. The cinematic potential of trains, which partly came of age along with motion pictures at the end of the 19th century, was realized early on, though: as coinciding movement with the Lumière brothers' ""Arrival of a Train"" (1896), as framing movement with the phantom-ride views that displayed shifting scenery from the point of view of a moving train, and, with action as a third layer of momentum, as early as Edwin S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). So, here, in ""Train to Busan,"" we have zombies instead of bandits. Zombies running down aisles after their fleshy prey, zombies seen outside shifting views from the windows, and zombies thrown into windows. Even the effects for their piling up when a large enough herd is in pursuit works well enough.The father-child dynamic is effective, too. But, the prospect of the fund manager investing in a company maybe responsible for the outbreak adds nothing. And, as if it weren't enough for this ""bloodsucker,"" as another, lower-class character (played by Ma Dong-seok, the most charismatic actor of the bunch) calls him--such terminology putting him in league with the flesh-eating zombies, to learn his lesson, to treat people with respect and egalitarianism, an insufferably irredeemable baddie is introduced. This leads to a contrived class structure between the train doors that's ridiculously oblivious to the undead threat surrounding them. Plus, there are other melodramatic contrivances and repetitions in the characters' quest for survival. As a zombie action flick, however, ""Train to Busan"" is, indeed, a thrill ride, and the ending nicely threatens a reference to that first modern zombie film, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A fresh ride abroad the familiar zombie flicks,"First of all I really enjoyed this fresh zombie movie.Let me clear of the way some nasty points I think you will have to overlook in order to enjoy the movie.First of all it is for sure not ""the best zombie movie ever"", basically it is a nice zombie movie, what is, at least for my taste, really good for this kind of movies. Furthermore, the makeup and/or masks of the zombies is not realistic or cool at all. For sure you won't miss the blood stain in the orange color. This movie doesn't follow the same rules as the usual Hollywood movies. It seems very important to the director to point out some ethical views, unfortunately the same aspect over and over.So what's left?I think some pretty nice and fresh ideas. I really like the minimalist setting with the train. This doesn't give the story that much space and I think ""not that much of space"" is a key point in Zombie movies. Despite the expected little space for storytelling the Story is not getting boring at all.At the end you may say ""Well, this was an enjoyable movie"" but you will also report some scenes of the movie to a friend with a surprisingly high motivation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent as most Korean productions.,"By the time there are a lot of zombie movies out, and many of them fail to impress. And it is understandable, how can a movie be interesting if there are hundreds of movies about the same topic? Well, this movie, thankfully managed to impress and keep my eyes open every single second. As most Korean productions I have seen, special effects are top tier. The plot is not only about people running away from the zombies, but it tells a particular story a little bit different from what we are used to see on these movies. And, oppositely to what we are used to watch or expect on zombie movies, Train to Busan provides a soft moment that touched my heart and made my tear-up a little.

Surprisingly good...,"""Train to Busan"" is an Action - Horror movie in which we watch some passengers on a train from Seoul to Busan trying to survive from zombies.

The interpretations of Gong Yoo who played as Seok-woo, Su-an Kim who played as Soo-an, Ma Dong-seok who played as Sang-hwa, Yu-mi Jung who played as Seong-kyeong and Eui-sung Kim who played as Yon-suk were very good and the combination of all those different characters worked very well and the result was simply outstanding.

"snakes on a plane, zombies on the train","The 'zombie apocalypse' genre has a long history of packing social commentary alongside the scares. I would even go so far as to say the best movies always have a point they are trying to make. But that being said, you need a light touch or it risks becoming a glorified lecture. To paraphrase Futurama, when you do things right, people won't be sure you did anything at all. Unfortunately, with this movie even the dimmest audience member will know exactly what the movie is doing by the five minute mark because its messaging has all the subtlety of one of its Zeds.But I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie, set in South Korea (dialogue is also Korean so native English speakers like myself will need subtitles), follows the passengers of a train headed to Busan which starts off just as the news starts getting a little weird. This part of the movie is done quite well, with the characters observing emergency vehicles speeding towards distant fires, odd crowds at the train station, and the occasional person running past in a panic without any obvious source for their distress. Things escalate quickly, however, and soon the characters are in the classic survival scenario.The movie follows the perspective of several characters, but the ""main"" character is a young overworked father taking his daughter to see his estranged wife. Exposition scenes inform us that despite the wealth and stature he's achieved as a hedge fund manager, his familial relationships are strained due to his heavy workload. His daughter in particular wastes no opportunity to reject him or badmouth him to strangers for his ""selfishness"".In broad strokes this theme of ""selfishness is bad"" isn't completely foreign to American cinema. In a western film the guy who refuses to stick his neck out for fellow survivors or hordes resources would probably be expected by the audience to face some comeuppance, but the version here is pretty strict. Just having the job of hedge manager earns the scorn of other characters because it made him wealthy, and his own daughter rejects him openly after he attempts to use his influence to keep her safe without also trying to help everyone else. Even his investment strategy earns him a call accusing him of responsibility for the actions of a company in his portfolio.The movie keeps hammering on this point the whole way through. For example, there's also a scene that takes place after the main character has 'learned his lesson' that showcases a whole group of 'selfish' people which ends very predictably. My problem is that after a while it begins to feel contrived, like they are forcing characters to act in ways that aren't logical or reasonable just so they can line up another parable for the audience.Fortunately, a lot of the other aspects of the movie are well done and make up for the weaker elements. The movie is deeply atmospheric and beautifully shot, really conveying the unsettling feeling of a society in full breakdown. Simple things like the conductor communicating with traffic controllers effectively spread unease as the conversations gradually reveal the isolation of the train and its passengers in a world going dark. Dialogue is minimalist but efficient, portraying fear and grief but sprinkling in enough humor to keep it from becoming overbearing. And the main danger, the zombies, are well designed and executed, being scary enough to keep you on edge and utilized for more than simple jump scares.The ending kind of made me sigh, and the little girl wasn't so much cute as grating, but the ending was earned by the story. I would say that as far as these types of movies go, it was fairly original and interesting. Expect to feel a little lectured at but mostly still have a good time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
YES !,"Train to Busan is the revival movie that Zombie films needed to get back on the map of respect. This was such a great zombie movie for more reasons than one. First the zombies look amazing and they're the fast kind which makes everything more exciting for the audience, especially with survivors being stuck on a train with the living dead adding even more thrill and excitement. The characters we meet in the film are all great characters for their own reasons, this film does a great job showcasing what survival looks like on different people and the decisions they make to ""survive"".

Molecule Review: Train to Busan (6 Stars),"Just like any other zombie film, Sang-ho Yeon's Train to Busan starts and ends like you would expect it to be unless you deep dive into the dialogues between the characters that create a much more emotional impact on you. There's a biomedical threat engulfing the city of Seoul and its neighboring areas when a selfish fund manager has to take his daughter to her mom (they are separated) in Busan. But they don't know what's coming to hunt them. How these two characters plus a bunch of other ones try to save themselves from the impulsive zombies forms the crux of this horror thriller that has some insane CGI work to keep you hooked. I watched the Hindi dubbed version (with English subtitles), so naturally the effect was a bit low if you are not a Korean native.

"Kinda Reminds Me Of Dead Rising. In Other Words, It's Insane!!!!!","I explicitly refer to Dead Rising in this instance because this film certainly gets so far out of hand when it comes to how many Zombies appear in here. I once saw this on Netflix and I was rather stunned at how impressively well-constructed the concept, plot, and character interactions turned out to be.It's as simple as a train ride to another part of Korea gone awry due to a Zombie Infestation. Most of the main characters do quite amazing work at staying alive. But as you'd expect, the majority end up dying eventually. Even the Main Protagonist ends up biting the dust towards the end of the film.

"Zombies, Trains and Automobiles","Train to Busan is written and directed by Sang-ho Yeon and stars Gong Yoo, Su-an Kim, Yu-mi Jung and Ma Dong-seok, among others. Train to Busan was released back in 2016 and became one of the most successfully South Korean films ever made, the film tells the story of the early stages of a zombie apocalypse, centring on a divorcee returning his daughter to his estranged wife from Seoul to Busan.I had little-to-no expectations going into Train to Busan, outside of a couple of recommendations from friends who were fans of the film and after seeing it I was pleased enough with the final results. The zombie subgenera of horror has been one that has fallen out of favour with me for years now; it's not that I don't respect the classics (like George A. Romero's original 'dead' films) and I haven't enjoyed the genre in the past, it's just something that I have lost interest with. With that being said, Train to Busan is an entertaining film even if I wasn't head over heels for it.I'll first start with the acting which I found to be great, although I don't understand Korean so I'm unsure how well lines were delivered, the performances still felt captivating. Eui-sung Kim who played the film's central antagonist was a character that I haven't disliked as much as him in a very long time - in the best way possible. He oozed an intensity that made it hard to take my eyes off of whenever he was on screen, the character's selfishness and ignorance towards the ongoing situation was equally frustrating to watch as it was engaging and it made me anticipate the character's fate. Similarly, to the performance of Yon-Suk, Gong Yoo and Su-an Kim who played father-daughter were also fantastic and helped to carry the film along, even when the story slowed to a halt. The pinnacle of their performances comes near the end during an emotional finale that really highlights both actor and actress. Lastly, Ma Dong-seok was also great and his character served as a useful foil to to Yoo's Seok-woo, that helped to bring some development to the Seok-woo, even if the story only takes place over a few hours.Speaking of the story, it is mostly good however has some faults that cannot be overlooked. The setup to this movie is great and the initial outbreak scene on the train is thrilling, along with other segments throughout the film that I'm sure will keep you on the edge of your seat. My problems with the story arise with the film's rules as far as the time takes for the change to occur in the undead, as there are a couple of instances where the story seems to stretch its own rules to the limit, creating for times where I was taken out of the film. Furthermore, my final gripe actually comes from the pacing of the film, clocking in at just under two hours Train to Busan is a film that feels like it can drag in places, aiding in an experience where one might feel the runtime. There are moments throughout the movie where scenes could have been edited down or cut altogether, most notably around the second act.All in all, Train to Busan is a decent zombie flick that I can recommend if you are interested, as mentioned from the top I am not the biggest fan of the zombie subgenera so I can't speak on what this film does differently to shake things up and if you are a connoisseur of undead flicks take what I say with a grain of salt. Train to Busan is a film filled with suspenseful moments, which are aided by great performances however falls short in the story department and overall editing. Although the first act does a good job setting the stage for what's to come and the third act being an emotional conclusion to the tale, Train to Busan still left me wanting more and for that reason I am giving this film a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

So much untold plot,Many people wrote as a one of the best horror movie and heart touching movie etc etc. But from my point of view it lacks plot holes in many ways. Many things are not very clear. Like why suddenly people become zombie? And only two people from a whole train survive and manage to go busan? How they managed rest of the country? World War z was far better story line than this one. But i like acting all of the characters. It was intense. And during this kind of situation you can able to see the evil side of humans.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visual storytelling at its best.,"Train to Busan is proof that with effective visual storytelling, you don't need exposition. I watched this movie in Japanese with Japanese subtitles, and despite my Japanese being just ""Ok"" I was able to understand everything the movie was trying to convey. Sometimes simple is best.The film starts off with a protagonist who comes across as selfish and unlikeable, but slowly becomes the hero as the story progresses. However Train to Busan manages to do this without shoving it down the viewer's throat. None of the characters seem like important people with special knowledge, they're all just normal people in a bad situation trying to survive.The choice to confine the story on a train, for the most part, helps the viewer feel a sense of claustrophobia throughout the film and it makes every action the characters make a little more nail biting.While Train to Busan may not be the most original idea, it proves not everything has to be. When done well, even the oldest stories can still make a viewer feel fear, tension, and apprehension for 2 hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

How people like it? The movies does not have any logic. It's not even terrifying; not even at one scene! People even laughed at some scenes, I remember! It is funny the way the movie wants to have dramatic and comic flavors while awfully trying to be terrifying. That was one of the worst movies I've ever watched at the theater!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
a horror film and a drama in one package,"Actually a very good one in both categories. Korean cinema has given some very good movies in the past -starting from the excellent ""old boy""- and has already been recognised as an asset in movie industry, so it would be rather foolish to undervalue its films as coming from a country far too remote, far too culturally different, far too unknown to pay some attention to its productions.
I started watching this film with no prejudice but also not been sure of the quality of what i was to watch. Right from the begining it was apparent that it was a serious production and not at all a cheap cartoon style film from a ""third"" country. And so it proved to be till its very end: A very well made zombie/horror film and not at all only. Through the story line and using the zombie issue as an excuse and cause, there was a very clear and interesting effort to point out the contrast of ""good"" and ""evil"" in human nature, and that is among living humans themselves. You add to this the really tender family drama unfolding along a very well and quite realistically made adventure and you have a film which captures your attention from the very beginning and finally leaves you very moved and in tears.
Last but not least: The excellent acting -the little girl will break your heart especially in the final scene- and the amazing, musically simple yet really imposing, epic music score in the ending credits.

Best Zombie Film EVER...Period,"Train to Busan ReviewThis was THE BEST zombie flick I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). It's hyper intense, emotional and heartbreaking all at the same time. I've never seen anything quite like it.I absolutely LOVE how it shows the rapid decline of civilization. One minute people are just normal people. The next minute those same people are leaving children and the elderly for dead just to save their own skin. It's visceral, disturbing and ABSOLUTELY realistic (which is something zombie movies rarely are).The movie is extremely fast paced and rarely takes its foot off of the accelerator. This keeps you on the edge of your seat, and always wondering what's going to happen next.The director did an excellent job at painting a scenario where no one was safe. You feel the same way about the characters too. You really don't have any clue who's going to die next, and that's SO refreshing to me.If you're like me and love all things zombie related then you HAVE to watch this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Action-Packed Zombies - Heavy-Handed Storyline,"There are good and bad things about ""Train to Busan"". It's a claustrophobic zombie movie that makes the most of having its protagonists trapped on a speeding train with a horde of ravenous zombies.It doesn't milk that situation of being trapped quite as effectively as ""REC"" but the action sequences are spectacular and the zombie attacks are very well-staged.Other reviewers have praised the social satire element of the film. Hmm... I found it might have worked better if it were not laid on with a trowel. The ""douche"" fund-manager, the evil executive who just NEVER MISSES an opportunity to screw someone over. I found it painfully sentimental at times and ""Yes, I get it"" obvious at others.At this moment in history, when the rich and powerful are turning us against each other in order to further their own interests we do need films with messages like this. And on the whole I enjoyed ""Train to Busan"" more than I didn't. But if there is to be remake, I do hope the film-makers allow for a little more subtlety in there.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Overrated movie, even for zombie-standards","##No specific spoilers here, but this *is* a zombie movie.##That should be a dead give-away that:The fighting scenes will be be weak and nonsensical, mostly involving lots of people getting bitten for no good reason. (They are.) - The characters are completely retarded and suicidal. (They are.) - The whole zombie deal is going to be left without proper explanation and for every bit of plot, we'll be getting 2 giant plot-holes. (It is, and we do.)I actually started watching the movie with these as my only expectations, hoping to get some cheap entertainment. But Train to Busan fully lived up to these negative expectations, and then proceeded to add to them by taking itself way too serious. In addition to the above we get:Serious, pathetic attempts at character development. (along the lines of ""I used to be a jerk but not anymore because zombies."") - Horrible social commentary. (Oh really, we should help each other, not be complete egocentric bastards? Wow thanks movie, I'd never thought of that...) - Dull dramatic scenes. (Loooong, cliché, and really only serve to get some extremely flat characters who basically have only *one* defining characteristic, who we're then supposed to be emotionally attached to.) - 4 points where the movie should have just ended. (Honestly, I'd given it a 4 or a 5 even, if it had just ended after the first 45 minutes. But it keeps dragging on and on, only ever getting more boring.) - Lack-luster fighting scenes. (Mostly just people getting bitten without doing *anything* back, because... zombies. ""Oh will you look at that? A blood-covered man with ripped clothes and white eyes is sprinting towards me growling loudly and flailing his arms. Should I at least raise my arms maybe? Naw, I'll just stand here and do absolutely nothing."")I stopped watching it 3 times, and tried finishing it 2 times, but after last time I was done. I've seen like 80% and I really don't care for the ending; it's just not enjoyable in the slightest, nor is it 'deep' or in any other way worth watching.

Overrated Korea,"""28 Days later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", and both George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead""and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (And also Zack Snyder's remake) – these are the great movies of the horror-zombie genre; although we could all agree that Romero started it all. Then in 2016, in the south of Korea, we got another zombie flick. I can't tell on how this movie was being received worldwide, but here in Singapore, the 'praises' for it is a bit overdone in my opinion. The result is predictable as neo-musical genre 'K-POP' is popular here. So, any entertainment that shows intimacy with the mentioned phenomenon, will get extra attention.A young fund manager (Gong Yoo) agrees to bring his daughter (Kim Su-an) to Busan to visit her mother. Since the child's parents are separated, I assume the two parties occasionally meet one another. From the start to the point upon the boarding of the train for Busan, the movie is well made. 'Zombies' in norm only needs one infected for the thrill to start. Hence, in ""Train to Busan"" an infected manages to secretly board the train.Director Yeon Sang-ho's effort in exploiting small details can easily be admired. The images of emergency vehicles, the all- encompassing violent fires at the near top of a building and ashes steadily settling down from it – all allow audiences to sense something unsound had happened, although we all know that it is the omnipresent of zombie outbreak.That's it. After the first zombie begins to bite, the movie goes into a nosedive motion. Action sequences are surprisingly bland; I cannot specifically describe on what's lacking but it lacks genuine excitement. The writing for the characters too shares the same fate (especially the villain) as they are clichéd. What ""Train to Busan"" tried to depict on the 'colours' of its characters had already been done by dozens of movies before; worst when it lays out that idea before our very eyes and never challenges the audiences. And visual style is straight terrible. The only element which remains to be positive is the effective use of suspense throughout the movie.As a zombie-genre fan, I quickly got for myself a ticket to experience it at the cinema but only to leave the hall feeling disappointed. My criticism does not mean I abhor Korean movies. Movie fans in general would know that Koreans had made great films for the past years. One of them is ""I Saw the Devil"" by Kim Jee- Woon, which is a masterpiece in any way. But unfortunately this ""Train to Busan"" is vastly overrated.Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A MUST WATCH!,"An emotional thriller which will not fail to keep its audience engaged until the last.
It has perfect mixture of emotions(especially the last scene will leave you crying). I really loved how certain small scenes also portrayed different emotions very well.
The casting is awesome, everyone has done the best job and correctly understood the character, especially the little girl has done fabulous work , having all expressions to the point. The makeup artists are also an important part in its success giving a real look of zombies.

the most famous zombie movie,"Train to Busan may be primarily known as a zombie horror film, but it's packed with heart-pounding action from start to finish. The story follows Seok-woo, a workaholic father, and his young daughter as they board a train from Seoul to Busan, unaware that a zombie apocalypse is breaking out across the country. What sets Train to Busan apart is its unique setting-the confined space of the train. This forces the characters into close-quarters combat with the infected, creating non-stop tension. The zombies here are fast, relentless, and terrifying, making every action sequence gripping. The film's strength lies not only in its action but also in its emotional core. The strained relationship between Seok-woo and his daughter is the heart of the movie, and as they navigate the chaos together, their bond deepens. Themes of sacrifice, morality, and humanity's resilience are explored throughout the film, adding layers of meaning to the high-paced action. Whether it's Seok-woo battling zombies in cramped train cars or the characters desperately trying to escape the undead hordes, the film never lets up in terms of excitement and emotional impact. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and adrenaline that leaves a lasting impression.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Collision course with zombies.....and emotions,"Train to Busan is a decent zombie movie that focusses less on horror/gore, and more on people and emotions. Without a real intro, the watcher is thrown in the middle of the movie, already overrun by zombies, while a group of survivors try to escape by train. But the horrors continu on the train, as it seems that zombies are not the only monsters.The effectiveness of this movie is thanks to the great actors who portray the spastic and quick zombies, without relying on gore. Another effect is the amazing acting by father and daughter, pregnant woman and boyfriend, and the ""evil"" rich man who doesn't care about others. The movie obviously focusses on humanity, choises and effects.That's also the flaw of the movie. After a while it becomes repetitive and the roles become cliche. The ""evil"" rich man becomes a cliche to a point that it becomes caricatural. This doesn't bring the movie down, because the pacing is so fast, that you'll never get bored or stuck in a situation. Train to Busan is still one of the better zombie movies in years.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Train to Busan,"Train to Busan follows some pretty simple character arcs and story beats, but it's so much fun and so well crafted that it doesn't really matter.There are some predictable key plot points from the beginning. We know the father, stuck in business mode so often he can't even remember what gifts he's given his daughter over the years, will become more compassionate and present by the end. And we know that the evil characters will get theirs before the credits roll. But you know what? Those are the kind of story elements that can be very exciting in the right place. I want to see evil people get what they deserve. I want to see the business man become a good father. And I want to see the kind hearted child survive despite the selfish adults who surround her. These are moments that have me cheering the movie on even if I kind of already know where it's heading. It's like a warm blanket covered in zombie guts. I feel comfortable and disgusted all in one.Even with all this said, the movie is undeniably exciting. Action scenes are well shot and never feel too closed in to see what's happening. This is a very real concern for a movie that takes place predominantly on a train.There was an honest sense of loss when some characters died too. While most of them were underdeveloped there were a few that I felt like I really got to know in just under 2 hours. I think that was mostly due to some really great performances. It's all in their faces. Dong-seok Ma knocked it outta the park. He came off so smug at first but then evolves into your manly, trustworthy dad who doesn't know how to change his ringtone. It's so good. Su-an Kim is another standout. She is so quiet and reserved at the start, then as things continue to fall apart around her she has so much opportunity to show a range of emotions like anguish and fear. She killed it. This is a great child performance.The cg and make up effects are phenomenal. Some that were especially impressive were the zombie movements and the zombie deer in the opening. They sometimes looked a bit off but that only added to the charm.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A whole lotta murder on an Orient Express,"Intense and engaging but overlong and occasionally overwrought. The music, apart from some interesting use of train whistles, is melodramatic and at times jarring. Some great set pieces-the sneak sequence as well as an arrival that goes awry stands out when credits roll-but Jack Nicholsons concise drive-by-critique of Jacksons ""The Return of the King"" comes to mind:""Too many endings.""There are precisely two end points in the last 15 minutes that would provide a better ending than the one we finally get. Emotional, ambiguous, beautifully shot. Plus, we would have found at least 10-15 of the 20-30 minutes that needs to be shaved off to elevate this from a strong 6 to a pulpy and Cormanesque 8 or 9.It never comes close to the grandeur and thoughtfulness of Snowpiercer (South Korean directors seem to have a thing for trains), nor the sublime poetry of the train ride in Spirited Away, but arrives in better time than Unstoppable and Bullet Train.

I also liked how they somewhat had a basis on what happened.
What I didn't like were the first 15 minutes. When the man ran over the deer and the deer got reanimated I never understood it's purpose rather than the zombies are rising.

I'm genuinely satisfied with the execution of the movie overall. the acting was superb along with the pacing. My only gripe is the slew of sudden character deaths at the end, most felt a little unneeded but they achieved the goal of making me sad. but that aside I genuinely had fun watching this, my heart was beating fast with certain scenes, and I was invested in the characters. I can even look past some of the obvious CGI since it isn't bad, just obvious. Honestly, it depresses me that it's this hard to come by a good piece of zombie media. They always take the main focus from the zombies to make it something like the nature of man or the origin of the outbreak. You see a lot of zombie media having evolved forms of zombies because the writers don't think flesh-eating zombies can keep your attention. save for games that usually execute evolved infected well. Essentially I come to a zombie movie/comic/manga/anime for the zombies, and I want my zombies, Train to Busan is one of the few if not the only one to do it right.

One of The Most Sound Inspections Inside Horror Sub-Genre,"Current walkers' genre arises from horror/survival films chiefly, which located its golden years at the end of the 1960s, where the sub- genre genesis was cemented with a brand new and unique solvency, the same one that slaughters the audience as genuine vultures without any substance. Although there's not an accurate date about when it was considered preeminent in the celluloid world, but we do know the three men who reflected heterogeneity and universal depth that an undead horde may originate. The first man was who took the chance to emit an uncommon conception at that time, where demise was not the conclusion in the lifeline, but one cycle more for transfiguring itself into testimonial detriment. George A. Romero, he was who opened the pathway with a must-see crowning work, essential for anyone who is adept to the heterodox category. A few years later, Danny Boyle built a task titivated with ingredients with which we were already getting familiar, however, they were endowed its work with collective and psychological idiosyncrasy; the above made us apprehended the same nature viewed from an opposed and eccentric perspective. And finally, three years ago moderately, Marc Forster propelled zombie theme to extremist and utter crippling visual dimensions —it's so like Hollywood, — nevertheless, he also managed to impregnate it a relevant dramatic connotation. It is, in fact, a shame that among hundreds of projects which are both crowded together on the small screen as on the big screen, only these three cases truly get to be more than an ephemeral film; a film with justifications, rudiments, soul and laconic structure.Yeon Sang-ho's ""Train to Busan"" or ""Busanhaeng"" (original title), glorified formidably by key contests in the issue, exposes and pours strategically concerning and globally significant thesis into a top- level artistic and choreographic majesty, nonetheless, the movie expressed neither something substantially divergent nor fresh in cinematic terms, what categorizes it as an entertaining, effective and somewhat nugatory film. Cannes and Sitges opened the doors to the director, newcomer in live-action movies—since his previous works have been clearly animated, among them is the initial part of this story, ""Seoul Station"", screened at BIFFF, serves as outbreak and exordium within this atmosphere, — to testify his assiduity and supremacy in this classification; These festivals intensified significantly commercial splendor through Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) around the film, drawing more than 11 million in attendance just in Korea.In essence, the storyline takes place inside of a train which departs from Seoul; place in where an opportunist and self-centered father is constricted by his daughter to buy two tickets for a prolonged travel in the carriages; she longs vehemently for visiting her mother in Busan, South Korea's second most-populous city and in where this public transport has delimited its arrival.The quandary is that in the morning, an abnormal virulence, stirred up by main character's biochemical corporation, charges against Korean residents of an intense and enraged way, originating a hair-raising maelstrom territorial.While they thought that in comfort of their train indemnity was infallible, one infected sneaks in the rear coach inducing an out-of-control derangement; the only hope for passengers is to arrive as soon as possible to Busan, site where a hypothetical military shelter sits, however, the walkers are not the worst catastrophe, human begins' apocalypse and corruption is it.The film is closely influenced by two antithesis managed of clever way at least mostly: in the first place, narrative proposal is fully foreign along with comic and western popular culture references; and in the second place, characters are significantly oriental, which connect with other factors correctly, among them stand out superb mise-en-scène—which no longer has any reason to ""envy"" American cinematic mecca, —an impetuous soundtrack supplying exuberance, a relevant dramatic talent and a final act that derails its film and plot ambitions beyond its own limits, to a certain point.The huge and mundane obstacle is it adjusts and stretches on genre clichés, providing entertainment without offering something little know, equally, the slow-pace beginning and over-the-top sensitive moments reduce the fantastic results from the first 45 minutes.Once again, it argues unexplored—or at least, unseen— aptitude of oriental cinema. ""Train to Busan"" is a well-made rail travel with zombie thematic which subverts in its narrative threads individualism, disparate social conditions, selfishness and lack of concern for the welfare of the other, issues punching our contemporary society every morning. ""Busanhaeng"" represents all what a roamer film lover aspires to see, however, manipulates the used components with one different hand, creating a splendid visual beauty to generate such feeling. Refreshing, captivating and even entertaining; the film is as frantic and direct as the same train.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie did not just bring up intense actions, but it also implied some life lessons by portraying how selfishly some may behave when disasters occur. Totally recommend this film to everyone if you are not too scared of bloody scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as Resident Evil movies, but the main actor is the sexiest man I've seen!","It has some flaws, specially some scenes are a rip-off of War World Z movie, and predictable jumpcares like trash movies, for that I took some points off, it's not like many people say that it's the best zombie movie, but it's pretty entertaining, the main actor is extremely sexy by the way, and the acting are pretty good.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that good,"A farmer is stopped at some decontamination checkpoint. There's some leak at a biotech plant.Next we meet the boss of some investment firm. He's of course too busy to pay attention to his young daughter who wants to visit her mom in Busan. The dad finally agrees and they make it to the train station. On they way there's something going on, lots of emergency vehicles are driving somewhere. As the train departs zombies attack the train station and one actually makes it on the train.This zombie attacks some train attendant who bites another one and so on. Here the transformation into a zombie is near instantaneous. Depending on the needs of the script it may happen right away or it may take a minute or two. When eventually the passengers catch on what is going on, they run to the front of the train while the zombies end up in the rear. But by now the condition is spreading all over South Korea. The train isn't allowed to stop somewhere, communications are interrupted.We meet several characters: a pregnant woman and her tougher husband, two older women, a young baseball team, an even more arrogant and selfish business guy, and the train conductor.They do stop in some town where people would be quarantined by the military. But when they arrive and leave the train the military personnel is also infected. So it's back on the train but this time a group is in the back another in the rear. The ones in the back--our heroes--have to make it to the front where people are so freaked out they won't let them in.Things get grimmer and we'll have to see who actually survives this disaster as they get closer and closer to Busan.Train to Busan is a long, slow, melodramatic thriller with zombies piled up--I guess that's going to be the new trend thanks to World War Z, piles and piles of quick zombies. Despite the penchant for drama there's little dialogue and the characters' behavior often doesn't make a whole lot of sense mainly because for some reason they have nothing to say to each other. The zombie action is quick, somewhat unclear, individual zombies matter little but masses of zombies falling out of train cars like cockroaches are emphasized. None of it is particularly scary or frightening, which it should be given that the humans in a train have only two places to go- to the front or to the back. There's not a whole lot of gore or violence. What is good though is the setting of a zombie movie in a train; and I also liked that the movie takes place mostly during the day.It's surprising that while this movie does point out the soullessness of business people it also makes one of them the hero. We do get some sense of Korean values--rigidity, deference to authority, overemphasis on education as a solution to all ills.I can't quite understand the high score of this movie. It is perfectly mediocre and stands out in no way whatsoever.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Train to Busan,"This movie is like a ""common"" fiction movie about zombies, but it has a fantastic drama because it is not just about zombies and how a group of people try to survive and find a safe place, it has some sad moments and that's one of the reasons that it couldn't classify like a typical kind of zombie movies.
When you are watching Train to Busan for the first time, you think about some scenarios, all about how to survive of course, but it doesn't at all; at the beginning you watch a family problem, and it introduces how the apocalypse start, when all the apocalypses' zombie, it's a real problem in the movie, it's not the only reason that why the movie can get your all attention, because when you think all are going well, something sad happens. But the end is something that you can imagine when you are in the middle of the movie, but not the way what we predict.

A Masterpiece,"Just saw this for the first time on Netflix. It has instantly entered into my top 10 films of all time, maybe top 5.It's tough to gather my thoughts, but my biggest takeaway is that this is a film about the importance of persevering through fear to protect what and who you love the most, even if it means that you become the victim to a an unthinking mob. It's about having the strength of character to do what is right and sacrifice yourself for your family and friends and to fight to the death against odds you know are impossibly against you.A very inspiring father-daughter story set against a backdrop of a zombie apocalypse happening in South Korea, Train to Busan is much more than just another zombie movie.Something I also liked that this movie pulls no punches and respects for the viewer's intelligence. The characters solve problems through clever means. There are no deus ex machina elements present. The gore and violence is shown with a disturbing steadiness rather than being over the top. The zombies themselves are portrayed moreso as humans with rabies than anything else. They don't run super fast, they don't have super strength, and they are not exceptionally durable. In this sense, the zombies are more believable. The female characters in the film are not endowed with Hollywood-ized GIRL POWER. Some of them do demonstrate bravery, but scenes are not written purely to push feminist agendas.The acting of everyone in the film was great. Exceptional credit must go to the little girl who plays the daughter of the lead actor. She was amazing and executed every scene she was in perfectly.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Must Be a Zombie to Enjoy this Film,"How does a movie that takes itself so seriously manage to be so campy? Other than camera work, lighting, sound-design and minor practical effects, no competence was employed in the making of this movie. The acting is amateurish; the scripting is cliched; the plot and pacing are contrived; the blocking is choppy; the material physics are inaccurate; the characters are idiotic (the more central to the plot, the more foolishly they behave, and they do NOT stay in character); and the zombies are inconsistent in every single way. It's worse than the Battle of Winterfell from Game of Thrones. At least the undead horde in that abominable episode converted and moved in a uniform fashion, and not in whatever way served the tropey franken-plot of this nonsense.Why does anyone with a functioning brain praise this movie? I do not think that they were paying attention. By every technical metric beyond the actual filming (great job, camera crew!), this movie is a failure on the level of Justice League, which at least had a few compelling actors and some beautiful costume design, even though it was equally unintelligent as this slop.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie is also not afraid to get rid of main characters and unlike movies like WWZ no main character has ""Hollywood immunity "" to getting infected and that makes the movie a lot more tense and exiting.

Still some life in zombies,"This is a great zombie film for several reasons. Firstly pretty much all of it is filmed in broad daylight so you can see what is going on. Secondly it's pacey without going completely over the top in the action scenes. Thirdly there is characterisation and not just gore. You care about these people and want them to live. Fourthly it is quite well acted (the little girl is fantastically good and will break your heart) and very well directed. Yes it is a bit silly and overlong and is more of an action adventure film than a horror. The infected have not died so are not really zombies and there is none of that ""let's see how many ways we can destroy their brains"" which seems to be the only raison d'etre of most zombie movies. The effects are great without dominating the picture with the hordes of infected pouring out of glass windows and doors extremely well done.I will definitely seek out more Korean movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

what a legend korean movieeee,"Train to Busan is a high-octane zombie apocalypse thriller that takes place almost entirely on a moving train. The story follows Seok-woo, a workaholic father, trying to protect his young daughter during a zombie outbreak while they're on their way to Busan. The action is relentless, with terrifyingly fast zombies and tense moments as the survivors fight their way through each carriage. What makes this film unique is not just the action, but also the emotional undertones that come with it. Each character's struggle for survival is coupled with personal sacrifices, adding emotional weight to the chaos. Beyond the zombies and the pulse-pounding scenes, Train to Busan is about humanity in the face of catastrophe. The film explores themes of selfishness, sacrifice, and redemption, with Seok-woo's transformation from a self-centered businessman to a protective father being one of the most heartwarming elements of the story. The emotional climax leaves a lasting impact, making it more than just a typical action film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One-Way Ticket to Busan, Fear and Sweat Included","Imagine a packed Korean train where every stop is a new sprint into hell. Train to Busan takes the zombie concept and throws it at you at 300 km/h. No fluff here, just hordes hungry for human flesh and characters sweating panic, with no time to breathe. It's not a stroll; it's an emotional crash test.Korean cinema isn't just stylish - here, it hits hard and direct, with no frills. On a budget far from US blockbusters, Sang-Ho Yeon has turned his train into a stage for pure dread. Sure, it doesn't shy away from clichés, but it elevates them. The characters are so vivid that you dread seeing them die. Merging the personal with the chaos? That's a masterstroke.These zombies aren't Romero's slow walkers. They sprint, they're aggressive, tearing into flesh at high speed. Each train car becomes a survival challenge. And then you've got twists that land like slaps. This train is a pressure cooker, with tension building at every moment. Hang on tight; you're on a one-way journey with no return.A stellar cast brings characters that feel real, even if some, like the ""businessman,"" are straight-up caricatures. But you still get attached. You love them, you hate them, and every loss is a punch. The film plays with us, manipulates us, and we can't get enough.Some will see a social critique here: selfishness, sacrifice, solidarity under extreme pressure. What's certain is that it hits hard. While other films might deliver speeches, here it's visual, brutal, and sometimes even moving. You leave feeling exhausted but glad to have survived until the credits.An absolute success, with no concessions. Sang-Ho Yeon has created a masterpiece that blends catastrophe, tension, and action like we rarely see. If you love films that keep you on edge, Train to Busan is a ride you won't want to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's just what I say lazy writing. No character development (urggh I know this is a zombie movie but still) Somehow few small events are supposed to define the characters present in the movie. But that's not how things work. If you are selfishly saving your ass and then suddenly if a girl lectures you to ""always think about others"", you can't become the Hero of the Humanity in a second. You can't write full character arcs in a film which is just showing events of few hours. (I mean you can but you need to be a very great writer to pull that off, in this case it wasn't). And just because of this lack of character development, I wasn't entirely rooting for anyone to get saved (to be honest there were times when I was wishing no one survives in the train).And what is this obsession of killing each and every character in overtly melodramatic way? I get it people are dying. But if that is happening so frequently as in this movie then I can't cry for every character's death.The only thing which was impressing were the zombies. No back story. Lethal. Ready in no time (But yet there were some convenient exceptions). And dumb. Just like the entire film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Last Stop: Survival,"Train to Busan, directed by Yeon Sang-ho, is a relentless and emotional journey that redefines the zombie genre, blending high-octane action with a powerful story of survival, sacrifice, and humanity. Set aboard a speeding train from Seoul to Busan during a sudden zombie outbreak, the film follows Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), a workaholic father traveling with his young daughter, Su-an (Kim Su-an). As they and other passengers fight to stay alive in the confined spaces of the train, the story explores the human cost of survival, highlighting both the best and worst of human nature in a crisis.Gong Yoo gives a standout performance as Seok-woo, capturing the character's transformation from a self-centred businessman to a protective and selfless father. Gong's portrayal is grounded and empathetic, making his character's journey all the more impactful. Kim Su-an's performance as Su-an is equally remarkable, bringing a sense of innocence and emotional vulnerability that heightens the film's stakes. The chemistry between father and daughter adds a deeply emotional core to the action, grounding the intense scenes with moments of tenderness and humanity.The direction by Yeon Sang-ho is masterful, keeping the pace relentless while maintaining clarity in the action. The tight, confined setting of the train amplifies the tension, creating a claustrophobic environment that heightens the fear and desperation of each encounter. The cinematography captures both the adrenaline-fuelled chaos and quieter moments with precision, while the dynamic camerawork brings viewers into the heart of the action, immersing them fully in the characters' fight for survival.What sets Train to Busan apart from typical zombie films is its rich character development and exploration of social themes. The film delves into themes of selflessness, family, and the sacrifices made in the face of tragedy. The script skilfully portrays the moral struggles of each character, emphasising the importance of solidarity and empathy in a world torn apart by fear. Through its diverse cast of passengers, Train to Busan examines human nature under extreme pressure, revealing the courage, cowardice, and compassion that define us.Train to Busan is more than just a thrilling zombie film; it's an emotionally resonant story that reminds us of the power of sacrifice and the resilience of the human spirit. Its perfect blend of action, horror, and heart makes it a standout in the genre and a powerful cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It is a masterpiece that has set a new standard for zombie films, capturing audiences worldwide with its intensity, heart, and humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Ferocious Bite Of Living Dead Excellency,"I had this movie sitting on my ""YouView"" box for quite a few months, even though I had been originally excited that Film4 had decided to air this ""little"" Korean gem of a horror movie. There had been rave reviews and more than a slight ""buzz"" about the picture. The trouble with me is that I've been let down by hyped movies before - The Blair Witch Project, a major case by example. Another trouble is my own little foibles. I don't want to be reading subtitles when I'm tired (and I do so love to watch horror flicks after the sun has set with the lights low... or off!) and I cannot stand dubbed films (too many Jackie Chan movies in my youth...). So one night, not so very long ago I was feeling awake enough to read a movie so I hit play on ""Train To Busan""...By the time the end credits rolled I was amped up and wide awake. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a movie and one hell of a tangle of modern-day lives story. This is not your basic Zombie flick.You start out really slowly and pretty sedated. A farmer is on his way to the market when his van is stopped by men in hazmat suits. These tell him that there's nothing to worry about. There has been a slight leak at a chemical plant. After quickly decontaminating his vehicle they send him on his way... unluckily for the dear he runs down and kills. More angry at damaging his van than killing a dear he drives away leaving the carcass in the road... yeah... you know what's going to happen. Sure enough, the dead animal thrashes about and shakily gets to its feet... with a dead look in its eyes...Even though this section only takes a few minutes it's one of the most superbly shot sequences I've seen in a movie. The director Yeon Sang Ho manipulates each set perfectly give the audience a creepily eerie atmosphere, which did start the shivers running up and down my spine. For that I thank them... it's been a long time since that's happened. There's nice steady sweeping camera pans. Effortlessly worked lighting. Superb control of sound... or lack of it. Even better is that all of this artwork and skill doesn't stop here it runs throughout the whole movie. It screams skill and class.Then the writers, Park Joo Suk and Yeon Sang Ho, get to work weaving together tales of modern-day living. The main characters are Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Kim Su An). He is a busy, work-comes-first-to-support-family guy who was already lost his wife to divorce and is now bringing up Soo-Ann, with the help of his mother. Soo-Ann is a young child who doesn't understand or appreciate her father's outlook on life. All she knows is that she doesn't see either him or her mother as much as she wants or should. She wants more time with both of her parents. So, on her birthday, after her dad buys her a repeat present (who doesn't need two Nintendo Wii's(?)) she gets him to promise to take her to see her mum for her real present. As is the usual case it's Su-An Kim's performance that steals the show - and this is as it should be.This then brings them into contact with Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong Seok) and his very expectant wife Seong-Kyeong (Jung Yu Mi). Sang-Hwa and Seok-Woo do not get on at all and it's this juxtaposition in ideals and prerogatives that add more depth to the story; especially when they have to work together to survive the train ride. It's Seong-Kyeong that provides the glue to their relationship.Add to this a mysterious homeless man (Choi Gwi Hwa), a couple of romantic teens getting to grips with their feelings towards each other - Yong-Guk (Choi Woo Sic) and Jin-Hee (Sohee), and officious self-centred train manager Yon-Suk (Kim Eui Sung), you have a set of characters which can create some volatile or sentimental storylines... and this is before we get to the best Zombies... EVER!One of my favourite zombie flicks is Return Of The Living Dead. Two of the reasons were the zombies - they were dead and very icky (most were skinless)... and they were fast. The brain-eating buggers didn't shamble after you. And you have the same here. Though these dead aren't so skinless they are damned fast and furious.This adds to some pretty spectacular action scenes in the movie which Yuen Sang Ho directs magnificently. But, whereas, most directors would opt for action over horror and story Yuen is proficient in all styles. The scenes where the dead reanimate are both startling, invigorating, eerie, and full of style and strength.This is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, let alone horror filmmaking. Everything in this movie is excellent, from the story to the acting to the directing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT'S INTERESTING!! LET'S WATCH IT,"Actually, at first I'm not really interesting about this movie. Almost all of my friends talk about this movie a lot. Although a little bit late, finally i had watched this movie and i like it so much.
This is a Korean movie which about zombies attack in the train. The story is amazing and I as a viewer can't guess anything during I watch it. During watching this movie I also can feel the emotions felt by the actors and actresses. That fear, worry, and disgust when I see the zombie.
And I think, this movie is not just about a zombie movie. There's a implied message that tells us about humanity. How to be kind each other even though you don't know that person. How to helping each other in urgent circumstances. And how not to think just about yourself.
I am also surprised that I had cried when I saw one of the scene I feel really touched my heart. It teach that love between a children and their parents is truly pure. Although sometimes their actions show otherwise, but that is only to cover up their pride.
I just want to say, I RECOMENDED THIS MOVIE!! So don't you dare, you're not watch this movie hahaha",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's very interesting to think about your actions you would do if you would be in the same situation. Every person in this movie has some characteristics that you can identify with.

One of the best zombie movies every made,"Fantastic riff on World War Z, Train To Busan never lets up long enough for you to catch your breath once it gets going. The movie's gore is surprisingly tame, but it's so well placed that you might think it's bloodier than it actually is.At its core, it's actually a beautiful film about a father reconnecting with his daughter after he spends most of his time chasing his career rather than caring for his family. It's exciting, tragic, and often heroic as he fights to get his daughter to safety. I can honestly say it's the first zombie movie that made me both bite my nails AND cry at the same time. It's more action than horror, but when that action is meshed with suspense and horror it's an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. See it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Because hollywood has become sub-garbage doesn't mean you should give everything foreign a 10?,"I'm French and I watch movies from all over the world - if it's good, it's good. If it's bad, it's bad. Simple, right?A movie is not 'incredible' because it's 'made in (insert country)'. Sure, Holly-Bolly-wood(s) cornerned the markets, and sure, it's nice in an age of absurd globalization to see a movie left untouched by the 'screeching minorities' of SJWs complainign about under-representation of whatever (insert 'thing of month') Try that crap in China, Korea or well, anywhere outside 'the west'. Good luck.But because it's not the rock-bottom garbage from Netflix, still doesn't make ""Train to Busan"" not ""I Stand Alone (1998)"" while neither is Yeon Sang-ho the Korean Lars von Triers. Because a Korean director can ape Hollywood and even beat it at its own game on a shoestring budget, doesn't mean the movie is 'great art' or even 'memorable'.Sure, ""Train to Busan"" saves us from the habitual k-wave of 60fps, cheap drama/romance from Hallyu 3.0. But make no mistake: it's just jumping from one mold (K-drama) to another (Hollywood blockbuster) to rake in the $$$ just like in LA. No difference there.In fact, I'd go as far as saying that it's not even to the zombie genre what Hard Boiled (1992) was to ""Lethal Weapon"". Because at least Chinese ""gun-fu"" was original and fresh back then, while the 'fast zombie' trope had more than welcome its welcome by 2010. And ""Train"" was shot in 2016.Finally, while the end scene is a solid tear-jerker because it has the odd particularity of tying the movie together, the same cannot be said for everything that preceded that ending and , if you were to think about it for more than 3 minutes, just a by-the-numbers ""coureageous hero"" vs ""cowardly vilain"" dichotomy without much interest.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Absolute masterpiece!,"Man, South Korea has got it going on! I happened on this movie randomly, completely unaware of its fame and awards offshore. I watched it simply wondering what is a Korean zombie movie like because I had been long over the genre and especially The Walking Dead. What I watched was character development at its most refined fineness.Seok-woo starts as a typical father working much harder at his job than at his relationship with his daughter. The quickly unfolding and non-stop dangerous turn of events reveals what is most important to him, and shows he is not cold, that he does have a heart. The flashback at the end...as a father, I cried.Sang-hwa's crass, rude nature initially paints him as a selfish oaf who thinks he's better than everyone else. The quickly unfolding and non-stop dangerous turn of events reveals that he is quite the opposite. He is selfless, has a great sense of humor, and is the kind of person you'd prefer at your side if you were dealing with a zombie breakout.What director Sang-ho Yeon focuses on is not the action or the scares, but the characters. How they respond to the circumstances that challenge their ability to survive and care for others is like seeing a flower bloom. I feel like his whole point of the movie was to make us ask ourselves ""Who are we truly?"" We got bogged down with our careers. We take relationships for granted. We act hardcore in non threatening situations. But what happens when hysteria and danger overwhelm your atmosphere? Who do you care about most then? What's the absolute most important thing in your life? I'll tell you again...the ending. Ugh, I cried watching a zombie movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

train to busan,"Train to busan was a great change in a already very stoic and familiar formula and koreans were able to make zombie film to feel brand new and fresh,that is maybe because we are not watching some random people fighting the infected on a streets on some city but rather we feel connected to all characters that are put in a very awkward situation in a very claustrophobic train,when we talk about fight scenes and chases they were made in a very good way,acting was also very good expecely since this genre isnt know very much for great acting,in movie there were two great scenes that i will remember for some time,first one is in beginning with deer and second one when infected were trying to climb train,train to busan is defienetly one of most fun movies about infected people or zombies but it lacks more quality to be on par with some old classics",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The claustrophobia and emotion is still amazing and recommend to watch if you love zombies and action pack films that waste no time kicking off the plot.The sequel wasn't great but wasnt bad but there no way it would be on par of this film and neither that of the animated prequel.

another level of zombie movie,"This film is more than just a standard zombie thriller-it's a deeply emotional and gripping narrative that explores the lengths people will go to for survival and the bonds that are forged during catastrophic events. The pacing is relentless, as the action kicks off almost immediately and rarely lets up. Director Yeon Sang-ho masterfully balances high-octane action sequences with poignant character moments, especially between Seok-woo and his daughter. The film effectively uses the claustrophobic setting of the train to heighten the tension, making every encounter with the infected feel like a ticking time bomb. There's a real sense of danger in every scene, and it's not just from the zombies, but from the desperation of the human survivors as well.On top of the action, the film also touches on important themes such as selflessness, greed, and the power of community. The relationship between Seok-woo and his daughter adds a touching layer to the story, making the stakes feel incredibly personal. Each character has a distinct role and brings something unique to the table, and the sacrifices made throughout the movie are heart-wrenching. By the time you reach the emotional climax, you're not just scared of the zombies-you're fully invested in the characters' fates. Train to Busan is a rollercoaster of emotions and thrills, delivering both scares and heartfelt moments, which is why it's often considered one of the best zombie films ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Stuck on a Train with Zombies and Nowhere to Escape,"""Seok-woo"" (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter ""Soo-an"" (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

This emotionally charged and zombie filled train is worth boarding,"Train To Busan (2016)
Rating: 4/5When you are about to watch a film in the zombie genre, you have two things in mind:
1) A lot many are going to die.
2) Zombies will provide us much gore.
Well ""Train To Busan"" has all that in plenty, but what it has which many zombie films lack is: Emotional depth. Throughout the film we are able to connect to each character. A fund manager, who is estranged from his wife, and fails to live up to his daughter's expectations; A strongly built man and his pregnant wife; a baseball player and a girl who loves him; a selfish as hell man; two old women who are sisters and many more form characters who are fighting for survival from zombies, in a train which is travelling to Busan. Will they survive?Director Yeon Sang-ho makes sure that while he shows the undead masses of bodies attacking the passengers of the train, we are connected to each of them. ""Train to Busan"" is a story of survival, compassion, sacrifice. It shows us how human beings act together to fight something bigger, which felt timely as we are in the midst of a pandemic ourselves. Then there's ones who are selfish. Take this scene as an example: The fund manager and all are trying to enter another compartment of the train, but the passengers of that compartment are paranoid that they might be infected, and they try to stop them from entering.While there's gore, but the film doesn't overdo that. There's some humour sprinkled, like the scene where the pregnant woman's husband asks the fund manager's daughter whether he's her real dad, as he initially didn't like her father. There's humour, but there's the seriousness which runs throughout the film. From the opening scene where a dead deer comes back to life, we know that things are about to become tense and the entire film is very tense but entertaining.There was a scene in the film which I found a bit absurd: the fund manager, the pregnant woman's husband and the baseball player deciding to fight their way to reach their people felt a odd choice that a person would make in such a situation and I wanted the film to make more impact. But, this emotionally charged and zombie filled train is worth boarding.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
