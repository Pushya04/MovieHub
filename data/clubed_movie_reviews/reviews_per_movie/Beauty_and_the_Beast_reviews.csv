One of Disney's Best!,"Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores. You will enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Transporting Experience,"Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply:  love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.'  And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation.The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep.  Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.  Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him:  If he will release her father, she will stay in his place.  The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever.  And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.  There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly.  A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster).  There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made:  As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.  And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.  It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films.One final note:  Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The cream of Disney,"This is a classic movie. We have breakthrough films like Snow White and Fantasia, and we have other greats like Aladdin and The Lion King, but this definitely tops them all. There is so much here that is missing in other Disney classics. This film has emotion, incredible music and animation, characters that you admire, laugh at, and despise. This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives. The way we can identify with the characters sucks us into the story. Don't miss this classic...the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Be our guest,"Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.Bell is just a simple girl in her town in France, she reads books constantly and her father is an inventor. They are sort of the outcasts of their town due to their ""oddness"". But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have. One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner. Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts. Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken. They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean. The songs are just so lovely and perfect for the scenes that they are performed for. Beauty and the Beast, the song, was just one of the most touching songs ever. This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of my all-time favourite movies.,"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one ""Beauty and the Beast"" is worth a thousand ""Akira""s. And ""Shrek""s. And, I'm willing to bet, ""Treasure Planet""s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - this is the real best picture of 1991.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Perfect mix of music and animation...a solid achievement...,"I've not seen the newly added song sequence (Human Again) featured in the latest IMAX version so my comments are based entirely on the original theatrical and VHS release.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is Disney at its peak. From the stained glass window at the opening and the beautiful narration, the viewer is drawn into the story by the appealing music and clever lyrics (""Belle's Song"") which gets the picture off to a bouncy start. The opening sequence showing Belle and the townspeople in song is masterfully handled and choreographed for maximum effect, setting the tone for the entire story.The plot becomes thicker once Belle's father enters the castle grounds where the Beast resides. The castle interiors are brilliantly Baroque and the odd characters inhabiting the grounds are delightfully rendered by a perfect blending of art and voice talent. Cogsworth, Lumiere and Mrs. Potts are delightful creations, each with strong, consistent personalities. David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury cannot be praised enough for their contributions.Two of the musical highlights are Orbach's dazzling job on ""Be My Guest"" (with French accent) and Angela's tender rendering of the title song, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Unforgettable movie moments. As Gaston, Richard White's robust baritone voice adds greatly to the effectiveness of his villainy.It's no wonder the film was the first to receive recognition by the Academy with a Best Picture nomination. Outstanding in every department, including the end title song sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in a more ""modern"" style.Along with SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY, a top-notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults and children--as well as the child in all of us.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
the story ever told,"a great movie story done with wondrous animation and lovely music.  the pacing was perfect, the music blended extremely well with the action, and each character was developed charmingly.  the contrast between the mean but insecure beast plays very well against the lovely but bright and secure belle.  the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow.  except for pinocchio, I don't know any disney movie more lovely. It's a movie that appeals to children of all ages, especially adults : )enough of the ""technical stuff""  let's get on to my emotional attachment to the movie.I remember the first time I saw B&tB so vividly; I was completely enthralled by the movie that all I could do on the way home was smile and cry.  I've seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps. Angela Landsbury as Mrs. Potts sings the title song with so much feeling that every time I hear the song, I'm swept away back to that ballroom.I was also moved by Belle's strength of self worth and generosity.  She is a heroine I'd love girls to emulate.  She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal.  She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.I've loved this movie from the start, and it has grown into an obsession. I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift.  So I know my opinion is strongly biased : )  but I hope you get a chance to see this film and judge for yourself.  I realize it is difficult to get access to the videos or laser discs (check out the spanish version cover imdb is using in B&tB's page) but it is well worth the search.  The first time is most magical.  I envy you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Plot is flimsy but the music is iconic, duh","I forgot how flimsy the plot of this is. Very little that happens in this adds up or makes sense when you stop to think about it. And the romance between beauty and the beast is thinly drawn and problematic. You are supposed to just accept it when the movie says so.The songs and score are iconic for good reason; there's more soul and feeling in the lyrics and music than there is anywhere else (it is a musical after all). It all works, the animation is stellar, though personally this is a good not great film and its Best Picture nomination in hindsight is more than a little perplexing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Perfection.,"This is, without a doubt, the best film Disney ever made. Now that's saying a lot, as the studio also made ""Bambi"", ""Little Mermaid"" and many other great films. ""Beauty and the Beast"" represents everything they could do right in a movie. The music is fantastic and couldn't be better (mostly because many of the songs had a great sense of humor), the characters wonderful and the story promoted some of the most wonderful values you could want. Belle is a completely admirable young lady--and I was thrilled that my own daughters could watch her and learn about her strength and integrity. And, the film is fun--yet will also bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer. Not surprisingly the film was nominated for Best Picture--it's just a shame that an animated film will probably never take home this Oscar. Well worth seeing and owning--a truly great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A very popular Disney movie,"The 30th animated Disney ""classic"" is, without a doubt, one of the most famous Disney classics, which is a good and a bad thing either, because its success tends somewhat to overshadow other very good Disney classics (often better than this). Or maybe what happens is that this movie gets the deserved attention, while others sadly do not have the same luck (such as ""The Rescuers"", ""The Aristocats"", ""The Fox and the Hound"", ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", ""Robin Hood"" and others). That is the worst aspect of this movie's success. So, as one can see, it's not all roses.Nevertheless, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of Disney's most original movies. To a point, it is every bit as creative and imaginative as ""Alice in Wonderland"", except that it isn't as eccentric as that one.One thing that is very obvious from the beginning is that this is a french tale. It's quite easy to understand that because all the characters have french names. Plus, they often use french words such as ""Bonjour"" (which means ""Good morning"" in french). Lumière even uses the word «Sacré bleu» once. However, it's not very clear the exact place of our story. All we know is that it's somewhere in France.As much as I don't like all of the movie's characters, some of them are very charming. For example: Lumière (the candelabra), Cogsworth (a clock), Mrs. Potts (a teapot), Chip (the cute little teacup), Belle, Maurice (Belle's father, who is also an inventor) and Philippe (the horse). It's funny that a horse is named Philippe (Philip in french) - LOL.Belle is one of Disney's most beautiful chicks, together with Jasmine, Ariel and the Blue Fairy. Belle is also classy, charming, carefree, nonconformist, conservative and nice. All of this makes her an interesting character and, above all, different from the rest of her village's population, who see her as a strange girl because she likes to read and also because she can't stand Gaston (unlike the rest of women) neither the idea of being his ""little wife"". Belle is appropriately named like that (her name means beautiful in french).Gaston (who is considered the villain of the movie) is a character who's got no culture at all, being the epitome of pure strength and no brain (like Biff Tannen from ""Back to the Future""). Gaston is a tall, muscled, vain, arrogant, snobbish and chauvinistic guy with a heart of stone.On the other hand, Gaston's follower and helper, Lefou, is more of a goofy guy than anything else, nearly like a comic relief. No wonder he is named Lefou (which means ""The Fool"" in french).Monsieur D'Arque is a strange man with a sinister appearance that makes him seem to come from a terror film. For some children, he might be a bit of a creepy character.My favorite character is Chip (he is the cutest of all, besides, his natural sweetness and innocence helps). However, Lumière and Belle come incredibly close to Chip when it comes to my favorite characters of this film.The soundtrack isn't entirely spectacular, but the romantic ballad ""Beauty and the Beast"" is beautiful. It has 2 versions. Angela Lansbury's version is good, but the original one by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is extraordinary.As for the cast, it is brand new comparing to older Disney films and most of them do well. Paige O'Hara and Angela Lansbury are among the best ones, but those who steal the show are Bradley Pierce as Chip and Jerry Orbach as Lumière. Jerry Orbach gives so much life and energy to Lumière, with such a convincing french accent.The best part of the whole film is the famous ballroom dance sequence, which is wonderful, brilliant and very artistic (the graphics also make it look incredibly close to a live-action ballroom).Generally speaking, this film has the main ingredients of an animated Disney movie: great picture quality (good designs, backgrounds, sceneries and colors), very good animation, creativity, originality, some charming characters, some romance, adventure, darkness, suspense, classic humor and so on...The Prince (that is, the Beast as a human being) almost looks like Jean Michel Jarre with that long hair. That said, his change of heart during the movie is amazing. From a person who is spoiled, selfish, unkind and with an explosive temper, he becomes kind, gentle and even romantic.Although the sequence ""Human Again"" was originally gonna be included in the movie, it was removed in the final version. It was recovered for the DVD. Yet, the version I consider the true one is the one without the sequence ""Human Again"", even if that one is not *officially* the movie's true version. But for me the true version is the one I know since 1991. It's the way I always knew it, so it makes perfect sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Romanticising Stockholm Syndrome,"Really, I don't understand what people find so romantic or compelling about this film.It is a hostage situation where the hostage has ""fallen for"" her captor. The Beast has captured Belle, holds her prisoner (in a gilded cage, perhaps, but it is still a cage), mistreats her, emotionally and verbally abuses her.Then she falls in love with him and begins to defend him.Stockholm Syndrome. This is a film that tries to turn a psychological maladjustment into romance.Pah!1 / 5 stars, only because of the music.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside!

Another Disney masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Breathtaking,"When I saw the first advertising for Beauty and the Beast -- a cardboard stand-up in a movie theater -- I nearly burst into tears. Just the ADVERTISEMENT was hauntingly beautiful, tapping into some deep human reality. Hasn't everyone, at some time, felt like a hideous beast hungry for someone to love us as we are and in doing so, transform us into something beautiful?The film itself more than delivered. Belle was the first Disney heroine who wasn't either boy-crazy or a doormat/victim. She has brains, heart, and above all, character. The Beast's transformation from monster to hero is believable and poignant. In a world where possessiveness has become the norm (witness the selfish custody battles of birth parents tearing children from the only homes they've ever known), the Beast's heart-wrenching insistence that he had to let Belle leave because he loves her is a breath of fresh air.The music is perfection, the animation astonishing. Together they raise filmmaking of any kind to new challenges. The ballroom scene is heartbreakingly beautiful.If you've been in a coma for ten years or have some other excuse for never having seen this gem of a movie, correct that omission as soon as possible. And have a hankie nearby.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One word=F-L-A-W-L-E-S-S!,"This movie is without doubt the best animated movie of all time. The artistry was perfect. I was spellbound at the animated sequences to the songs ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" especially. The characters were very well drawn, and because of the dark and colourful backgrounds, the film looked beautiful. The songs are fantastic. Another movie with great songs is ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""(which has the best beginning to a Disney movie). In fact, all the Alan Menken scores are brilliant, with the exception of Home On The Range, which is one of the weaker Disney efforts. My personal favourites, were the songs I just mentioned, and ""Gaston"" was great fun too. The incidental music was the best in any Disney movie, and that is the same with the other Menken scores. The music in the transformation of the Beast was phenomenal, as well as the animation, and reminded me of the last movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which is really frightening. Another Disney with great incidental music is ""The Lion King"". The story is quite simply one of the best love stories ever, and the characters are wonderful. Belle was voiced beautifully by Paige O'Hara, who has a beautiful singing voice. I love Belle, she is beautiful, clever and strong, and is one of the best Disney characters for those reasons. Gaston was made into a complex villain, and quite narcissistic(great idea Disney). When he was nasty he was quite frightening, and Richard White can really sing. Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers were really entertaining as Lumiere and Cogsworth,(I just love how witty, elegant and debonair Lumiere is) and Angela Lansbury gives a brilliant rendition of the title song. The best voice over was that of the Beast, who was very frightening, and there were some parts that were truly sensitive. Why are some people fussed about him as a human? Remember, true beauty comes from within. In conclusion, an essential to your Disney collection with a very poignant ending. 10/10. Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"An exceptional, beautiful animated film","Anyone can tell you that 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed animated film from that year, is a modern-day classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is an animated Disney fairy tale, but it's an animated Disney fairy tale like no other. The film came out during a time that is often regarded in film history as the Disney Renaissance period, when the company was putting out top-of-the-line animated features that were of the highest degree of excellence after a nearly-30-year decline in quality, had stellar production values and animation, stellar star/no-name voice talent, and the films were just of overall better quality than in times past. As a result, Disney was beginning to see critical acclaim and box office profits that at the time were unprecedented in the company's history, or animated-film history, for that matter.It supposedly began with ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and ended with ""Tarzan"" in 1999 (and I also don't want to forget about 1992's ""Aladdin"" or 1994's ""The Lion King""; ""Beauty and the Beast"" is easily the best film from this time.""Beauty and the Beast"" is of course an adaptation of the classic French fairy tale, and the animation screenplay here (ultimately penned by Linda Woolverton and co-directed by Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise) is credited to no less than 11 writers. In the film, an unnamed and selfish young prince (Robby Benson) is transformed into a Beast by a beautiful young enchantress who had disguised herself as an old hag. This curse has not only transformed him into a monster closely resembling a humanoid lion, but it has affected his entire castle - turning it into a darkly ominous and Gothic house of horrors (that is obviously meant to match his inner turmoil, hatred, and contempt for the world) and turned his servants and everyone else in it into everyday household items like silverware, furniture, and other decorations.In the nearby town, Belle (Paige O'Hara), the town beauty who is regarded as somewhat of an oddball and a goof - due to her love of books and gaining knowledge (my kind of woman, personally!) - is growing tired of her assigned lot in life and wonders if there's anything better out there. Still, she is generally pleased with what she already has, living with her eccentric inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart). When Maurice leaves town to attend a nearby science exhibition, he gets lost and winds up at the Beast's castle. The angry Beast takes him prisoner, but agrees to let him go in exchange for letting Belle remain in his castle forever.Although Belle is initially repulsed by the Beast, not so much by his looks but by his violent temper, she gradually begins to warm up to him and his kindly staff who begin tending to her every need. Underneath his horrid exterior, she begins to see that he is indeed a kind and gentle soul, and a very lonely one at that, and predictably begins to fall in love with him and vice-versa. Meanwhile back in town, forces led by the town's ultra-vain hot-shot alpha-male, Gaston (Richard White), are conspiring to get Belle to marry him at any cost, while also masterminding the Beast's downfall.""Beauty and the Beast"" is an extraordinary motion picture event, which had the distinction of being the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (that was until Pixar's ""Up"" in 2010). It was also one of the earliest pictures to make use of hand-drawn imagery that was seamless integrated with computer-generated special effects. To me, while I usually detest musicals and even though ""Beauty and the Beast"" has some musical numbers in it, by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, the songs don't slow the film down at all. In fact, they actually enhance the film by actually continuing to tell the story (and they are in fact pretty catchy, which is a rarity in films like this - I might actually go out and by the soundtrack pretty soon).Another aspect of the film that makes it so extraordinary is how dark it is, and also worth mentioning is the fleeting violence of the film's climax (which does include a slapstick showdown at the Beast's castle between the household staff and Gaston's goons, but I'm specifically referring to the climatic fight between the Beast and Gaston on the roof of his castle). And the Beast himself is actually quite scary, especially in the film's earliest moments. I'm quite surprised that ""Beauty and the Beast"" didn't receive at least a ""PG"" rating considering how dark this picture is, both in its subject matter and presentation. Notice how ugly and how drenched in darkness the Beast's castle is when the story begins. But the story is also about beauty, specifically the love of inner beauty. The film and Beast's castle begin to brighten up and come back to life once Belle arrives and begins falling for the Beast.It may be rated ""G,"" but it's still a mature-minded animated feature that doesn't play dumb to its audience and spoon-feed them crappy, sugar-coated moralistic messages about the true ugliness that is sometimes referred to as life.""Beauty and the Beast"" is very easily one of my favorite Disney animated films, very easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, for sure. I especially appreciated its message about inner beauty, a theme that has always been particularly of interest to me in the few love stories I actually like but has never been realized so brilliantly as it has been here.A true Disney classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.","It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but when this age-old phrase is converted to modern times, it translates to ""the desktop is mightier than the pencil."" There's no denying that the computer has become a tool used across the world, whether for political reasons, or for business or especially for educational purposes. Computers have also been adopted by the film industry to give their works of art a shinier feel and along with the visual effects wizards, the filmmakers who use these electronic devices the most are the animators. After a while, it was uncertain whether the cel-based animation used to create such classics like The Little Mermaid and Pinocchio would be completely dropped in favour of the quicker and slicker style. While studios like DreamWorks may have given up on them, the folks at the world's pioneering animation studio are still behind the pencil-and-paper animation that has enchanted families for generations. Looking back at one of their essential works, Beauty and the Beast brings back memories of not only nostalgia, but also warmth. Quite possibly the greatest love story ever told, this ""tale as old as time"" has always been told by bringing pen to paper. From its candle-lit beginnings by a French writer many years ago to the Disney animators who brought joys to people of all ages, Beauty and the Beast has always touched the heart.The main part of what makes Beauty and the Beast such a brilliant film is the fact that the relationship between the two title characters doesn't feel artificial or one-dimensional, even though they're drawn on paper. Unlike other famous fairy tales, Beauty and the Beast feels quite realistic in its definition of love. The story breaks all conventions by not going the ""love at first sight"" route and letting the romance progress at a reasonable pace. Belle also proves to be the most interesting Disney heroine, as she doesn't fit the norm of typical princesses like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Unlike the aforementioned characters, Belle is not bland, but actually as a personality. She defines individuality and seeks to do more than just marry a prince. Her annoyance at Gaston is not only humorous, but also shows that her ideas of romance don't consist of ""a rustic hunting lodge... my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife, massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs... we'll have six or seven,"" as Gaston puts it. The Beast is also a rather stubborn, but loving personality. Despite his tough exterior is a nice person at heart which Belle begins to realise the more into the relationship they enter.Adding to the brilliance of the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast are the songs from Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Although both did terrific work on The Little Mermaid and their cult musical Little Shop of Horrors, the music in Beauty and the Beast stands as their best. The title theme song is quite possibly one of the most romantic songs ever written, combining beautiful lyrics with a very memorable melody. This song enhances the film's famous ballroom scene to ever impressive heights, already helped by the breathtaking animation in the sequence. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was not written as just a way to sell soundtracks and win Oscars. It adds another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other. It is both moving and deep. The other songs provided by the team also contribute wonderfully to the film, from a show-stopping Broadway number called ""Be Our Guest"" to the very funny ode to ""Gaston."" They're bursting with energy and humour made even more poignant by the fact they would feature the last lyrics written by Ashman (who had also already contributed some work to Aladdin). It's a brilliant way to end his career and the end credits homage him perfectly: ""To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)""Probably one of the most important ingredients that make Beauty and the Beast such a success is the startling animation. The animators at Disney did a terrific job at making everything absolutely perfect, from the character designs to the sets. Each character has their feel, whether comedic or dramatic, and the animators allow them to breath, seamlessly combining the actor's voice to the moving drawings. The sets are also worthy of mention, particularly the look of the Beast's castle. The Gothic castle is drawn and painted beautifully from top to behind, so much so you're forgetting you're watching an animated film. The film is bright and colourful, but also dark and dreary when necessary. As mentioned before, the ballroom sequence combines Menken and Ashman's music with the animation flawlessly, giving a completely magical feel to it. When computers are brought into the scene, it seams in perfectly, not feeling distracted in the least. Beauty and the Beast most certainly stands as Disney animation at its finest.Some of the best animated films in the world have come from the Walt Disney studios and Beauty and the Beast is deservedly one of their crown jewels. At the film's release, it was honoured with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, a rare feat for an animated film. It proves that like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Did no one Making it see the Hypocrisy of the Story?,"Yes, this movie has excellent art and animation (certainly a contender for the best-looking 2D movie), some of the best songs in a Disney musical (and that's high praise considering their excellent repertoire), and the voice acting leaves nothing to be desired.Most of the supporting characters have charming personalities.The battle scene is thrilling despite the fact that it's basically a horror B-movie setup (a bunch of furniture in a castle attacking peasants). The development of the romance between Belle and ""the Best"" is also tastefully done.In short, the film is a great achievement in cinema from a technical standpoint, but it's all mixed up in terms of the messages it sends:1. It's about how people should look past shallow considerations when falling in love (particularly appearance). Belle falls in love with the Beast despite the fact that he's... well, a beast, so it's not shallow at all, right?Wrong. Not only does he end up turning into a handsome man, but he appears to be fabulously wealthy and has a bunch of magical devices at his disposal. This completely unwinds any supposed moral high ground.2. And what does Belle fall in love with anyway? She's shown to love books but the Beast doesn't seem to even know how to read. She implies she wants to see the wide world but by all appearanes the Best is a local boy who's tied to the castle. She doesn't like Gaston presumably because he's arrogant and aggressive but...3. The Beast is extremely abusive, jailing a lost old man, kidnapping Belle, terrorizing her on screen throughout the beginning of the movie, and treating his servants as slaves. Not only that, but he got into the predicament he did for being shallow, entitled, and cruel.Side Note: the servants apparently LOVE to serve. It's not just a job for them but their passion. I find it strange.Disney's playing with fire here. The Beast is shown to be pretty rotten and now suddenly he meets Belle and becomes a nice guy why?I'm surprised this story keeps getting retold and has survived so long unmodified. Morally, it's a dangerous mess. Logically, the plot doesn't add up.Honourable Mentions: Shrek (2001). I'm sure the movie has its flaws, but it's basically the Beauty and the Beast story with most of the inappropriate hypocritical bits fixed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Disney, Why Can't You Make More Movies Like This!?","I still remember watching this movie when I was very little. I did not appreciate it as much then, but now because I am older, I can cherish this blessed masterpiece. The music in this movie is one of the best film scores ever and contains the catchiest Disney tunes. Who could ever forget the ever-popular ballroom scene? This movie, in my opinion was Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's best! I also think that this is the best Disney movie made after the great Walt Disney passed away.I had the opportunity of seeing the Special Edition on IMAX. What an experience! The scenes were breathtaking to see on such a large screen. I even found the new song ""Human Again"" very entertaining.It's such a shame that Disney hasn't made a movie like this since ""Mulan"". ""Beauty and the Beast"" will be forever remembered as the epitome of modern-day Disney movies (and should have won the Best Picture Oscar instead of ""The Silence of the Lambs"").

Decent adaptation of the classic fable,"Decent adaptation of the classic fable.A prince is turned into a beast by a witch. He is doomed to spend the rest of his days in that way unless he experiences true love by a certain age. Meanwhile, in a nearby village a beautiful girl, Belle, is being harassed by the local casanova, Gaston. Then one day her father is imprisoned by the Beast...Sweet movie, though dull in spells. Part of the problem is that you know how it is going to end. There is some originality though - the animated pots, candlesticks etc - and these generally provide the most entertaining moments.Unfortunately, it is a musical. No particularly good songs: some are okay, some are quite forgettable and some are even a bit irritating.

Classy piece of animation,"When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time  only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However with this film I was quite taken by how classy the whole affair was, with great effort being shown in every area from the animation, to the songs through to the emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with a nice sense of wonder throughout. The story doesn't really hit many bum notes (I thought Gaston's sidekick was a bit too obvious and half cooked) and it is interesting and enjoyable for the vast majority of the time. The story and comedy is aimed at both adults and children  but the stuff for kids is not basic pratfalls, nor is the adult material just a load of references or suggestive jokes. Instead the two are quite well blended with good physical comedy and plenty of wit. Again, it is the sense of spectacle and wonder that came through that I really appreciated.The animation feels more impressive for the reliance on mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects  in fact the computer effects look a bit dated now, even if they do still produce the goods in some key scenes. Mainly it is the feeling that every frame has had a lot of effort and love put into it that makes the whole affair feel classy. The songs are also great and feature quite a few memorable songs that stick in the mind; meanwhile the choreography of these scenes is generally very imaginative (Be Our Guest was my favourite). The cast don't feature many big stars and perhaps this is good because the real people don't distract from their characters. That said, I thought that Benson, O'Hara, White and a few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough for the film. Orbach, Stiers, Lansbury and others provided comic work in the support characters and everything worked well.Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Should have won best Picture,"The first and possibly last animated movie to be nominated for best picture, and it should have won. This is an absolutely beautiful movie, and it makes me miss the art of hand drawn animation. Don't get me wrong Scilence of the Lambs was great movie and its really a tough choice but i think this one should have won. I hate to admit it but it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. If only Disney could get back to the likes of this film, and stop dicking around with the boring cgi movies. I hope someday we will see an animated movie win best picture, but sadly i think it will not happen, the only one in my opinion that came close was spirited away, and thats still no Beauty and the Beast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Life Before and After ""Beauty and the Beast""","To date, my favorite animated Disney film.In 1938, Walt Disney received a special Academy Award for producing ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and bringing a new standard to motion picture cartoons. Then in 1941, the Academy gave ""Fantasia"" a couple of special awards as another watermark animated film. ""Beauty and the Beast"" deserves to stand along side both of those films as one that changed animated films forever. For me, there are animated films before ""Beauty"" and after. Not since Disney's very first animated films (""Snow White,"" ""Pinnochio"") had one blended music and story so masterfully. But what sets ""Beauty"" apart from others is, strangely enough, the acting. The voice work is so perfectly matched with the way the characters are drawn that it's almost possible to forget you're watching two-dimensional creations.An enchanting film.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"This film, to me, is one of the finest Disney films ever made!","This film, from it's opening narration, to the end credits, is a beautifully animated adaptation of a well known classic.When I first saw this, I was captivated by both the animation and the story. It's a nice tale, and as always, has something to teach us.The songs are really great too. Every one in this movie, is beautifully sung and well orchestrated. Everyone knows the song ""Be our guest"" and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear/see it.The villain of the piece is of course Mr Universe with his bulging biceps and pearly white teeth, and we as an audience can't wait for the inevitable confrontation between him and the Beast.But to me, the real star of this film is Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury). She sings THAT song wonderfully, and sends a shiver down my back, and brings a tear to my eye every time!!This is, I must say, Disney at their best, they don't make them like this anymore, and it shows that when people care about something that they make, it'll all work out, and everyone will be happy ever after.10/10Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best Disney movie EVER,"This movie has been my favorite Disney movie since I was three years old. It is filled with humor, magic, suspense, and heart. It tells the story of a teenaged girl named Belle, whose father Maurice has been captured by a hideous beast, who is actually a selfish prince with a spell put on him. She makes a deal with the beast: The beast releases her father and takes her instead. She eventually warms his cold heart, and the two fall in love. But, a selfish man named Gaston, who has been in love with Belle, doesn't approve, and his plans almost prevail in an excellent climax.

"Whilst covering a couple of genres and delivering an interesting study or two, the film retains a heartfelt and innocent quality that still works.","Beauty and the Beast is a classic fairytale if ever there was one. It's a film about discovery; about adventure; about venturing off and away from home or a comfort zone to explore and discover. This exploration will be littered with danger and threat but it will evoke an element of magic and the unreal for equal measure although the smart move Disney make in Beauty and the Beast is that they do not clearly define who the 'villain' is and nor do they dumb down this role. In fact Disney bring an air of study and greater extent to the material other than shoddy metaphorical content, something that they very rarely did so before this and thus; Beauty and the Beast earns its place amongst the circles when talking about some of their best films.The film could be read as if told to us aurally, that is to say the immediate beginning is being narrated to us and we have rough sketches that look as if they're straight out of the Medieval era presented to us in story book fashion. These still images confirm to us of a Prince's back-story of how he became so hideous in appearance and how his castle and its inhabitants became so equally physically deformed, some of which are transformed into items that resemble their role in the castle whereas some others are not. Here is an interesting study of character 'bodies' within film, a brief reference to centuries ago during which what you wore would immediately tell others of your 'role' in the world ie; Royalty, jesters and peasants would all clearly be labelled by the clothes they wore  this is significant due to the various items the castle's workers are transformed into and the manner in which the 'style' of the early images are presented to us in that mock, Medieval fashion.So if characters like Mrs. Potts (Lansbury) are transformed into a teapot because she's the maid that makes and brings the tea; the Stove (Cummings) is transformed into his namesake since he is the chef and the flirtatious French maid is transformed into a brush to signify her job as a cleaner then it's possible to read into the fact the two individuals we the audience follow more often than not, those being Cogsworth (Ogden Stiers) and Lumiere (Orbach), are of a certain elevated level since it's difficult to place a candelabra and a clock into a realm of profession within the domestic environment. If there's one thing people have had fun in reading into over the years then it's Disney and their particular animation styling they choose; characters with lean or fat builds can signify one thing; characters with very astute or pointed expressions another whereas a rounded character with a big smile and bright blue eyes could easily be associated with heroic tendencies.The Beast (Benson) himself is not necessarily transformed into something as he is turned inside out. The character of the Prince is an unkind 'beast' on the inside and has these psychological characteristics switched so he must physically resemble a 'beast' or a monster, cruel and consuming none-the-less. But Beauty and the Beast is more so a character study of the mind rather than just how fancy Disney can make and force us to identify with each character's animation. As a character, Belle (O'Hara) plays the protagonist and like most female Disney protagonists, she lacks a motherly figure but does her very best to figure out what's right anyway. As a character with a persona she is smart and outgoing, an independent woman who will not conform to stereotypes but will maintain an attitude that has an element of feminism throughout.Her mission through the film changes a few times, on one occasion actually reverting back to a prior one. Initially she sets out to rescue her father, Maurice (Everhart), after he is kept in the very castle the Beast inhabits following a similar exchange comparable to that of the enchanted woman at the beginning when she also requested shelter from outside forces. Things take a turn for the worst and Belle's new goal having achieved the last one is to stay behind with the Beast after which she must get used to. Belle begins the film within the filmic space that is 'the farm'; a simplistic and rural setting which is located within 'the village', a setting in which all inside is 'good' and everything outside is 'evil' or at least unknown and mysterious. Belle doesn't conform to the caricature she should do within these spaces and this is highlighted with a wonderful early musical number in which the villagers call her 'strange' and 'funny' because she's a free thinker and she reads books.Completing a future love triangle is Gaston (White), a physically powerful and space dominating character who possesses so much love for Belle, it leads to obsession  you get the feeling in the real world if Belle had developed a relationship with someone else in the village, Gaston may well have challenged them because of it. He dominates his assistant Lefou (Corti) in the same manner Beast dominates his assistants initially within the castle planting a seed in the audience's mind to do with power struggles and what would happen if these two came up against each other. But Beast becomes more human when he seems to treat the assistants with more respect and is presented in compromising situations such as looking daft following a bath, whereas Gaston goes the other way. The film is a great study for certain things and will no doubt remain highly rated in years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Most Beautiful Story Ever Told,"I saw this movie as a child, and liked it OK.As the years passed, the VHS sat in the corner of my room and collected dust. We moved, and my family lost the copy of it. Strangely, one day, while opening an unopened box, I stumbled across some old Disney movies, and a beat up VHS player. So I hooked it up, and put in Beauty and the Beast on a whim.The only word I could use to describe the experience is: stunning.From the low drone of the tuba at the start of the movie accompanying the enchanting story of a selfish heart, to the triumphant end with some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen... I was astounded.The artists from the movie were brilliant. The beast was Perfectly scary enough to still be human, and Belle was normal enough to be beautiful. The colors used throughout the movie are perfect. The use of warm, dark colors moved with the story, creating a very atmospheric setting, relaxing enough to lull one into a dream.Aside from the art, the music is impeccable. Every catchy tune repeatedly pops into my head just thinking about the movie. The orchestration flows smoothly throughout the movie, blending remarkably with the art, and the story.Finally.... The story. The story is one of the most beautiful love stories of all time. The idea that a beautiful (stubborn) girl could ever fall in love with a hideous, but troubled beast- even with an evil man trying to split true (yet, perhaps, undiscovered) love apart- is so pleasing and encouraging to everyone with a heart. Whole, broken, or mended.So, whether you watch the movie every day, or just remembered that it was in a box in the attic, you can surely appreciate the beautiful art, music, and message which is presented in this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Don't kill me please,"Look, I understand that this is one of the favorite animated movies in the public eye and I can mostly see why. However, I just don't feel the same way. Belle is a very bland character, her personality is just she like-a da books. She doesn't really have anything going on. The romance between her and Beast is extremely rushed and out of place, just like ""haha stockholm syndrome now they kiss"". Gaston is great, of course, as is his song, but the rest of the songs in this movie that DON'T include Gaston for some part of it are mid at best and annoying at worst. Be Our Guest gives me a headache with how little there is going on, and the animation has some spotty moments. The whole movie does in a way, some spots where you can tell the movie still has some of the old era of disney in it. Detailed backgrouns which clash hard with the simpler character designs, it just doesn't look good to me. It's obviously still lavishly animated, a good looking movie. I just wish this movie came a little later into the disney renaissance, the age in its animation shows more than I wish it did. Even outside of its age, a lot of the designs are slacking. LeFou is a whole topic on its own, but even outside of him some of the other background characters (AND EVEN HUMAN BEAST) look really bad. Don't wanna knock it for its visuals too much because it is quite fine in that department and it's not the movie's fault. There's one part of the movie that does genuinely exceed the rest, and that's the aforementioned Gaston. He's a perfect antagonist, contrasting with the story and characters in a way that makes him a threat and a perfect thematic match. I'm gonna rewatch the movie to see if the rest of the movie can match my thoughts on him, but I'm not getting my hopes up.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out.The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are: -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more ""provincial life"" and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves himWhat really makes it the best is the voices too.

I think it's one of the best in Disney,"Beauty and the Beast is a beloved classic that tells a timeless story of love, redemption, and the importance of looking beyond outward appearances. The most famous adaptation is Disney's 1991 animated film, which brought the tale to life with stunning visuals, memorable music, and strong characters. At its core, Beauty and the Beast is about the transformative power of love, and how it can change even the most unlikely of hearts. Initially, the Beast is cold and angry, but over time, Belle's kindness and compassion begin to change him. As they spend more time together, the two develop a deep connection, and the Beast learns the meaning of love and selflessness. Their bond is tested when Belle must return home to save her father, but in the end, love prevails, and the Beast's curse is lifted.One of the most striking aspects of Beauty and the Beast is its animation. The film was groundbreaking for its time, incorporating both traditional 2D animation and early CGI techniques to create a visually stunning experience. The ballroom dance scene, in particular, is a standout moment, with its seamless blend of animation styles that create a magical, dreamlike atmosphere.The music in Beauty and the Beast is another key element of its success. Composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Howard Ashman, the film's songs are iconic. Tracks like ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" have become synonymous with Disney magic, adding depth and emotion to the story. The title song, performed by Angela Lansbury in the film, perfectly captures the heart of the story - that love can bloom in the most unexpected places.Belle, the film's heroine, is also a standout character. She is intelligent, strong-willed, and compassionate, breaking away from the more passive princess archetype that was common in earlier Disney films. Belle's love of reading and desire for adventure make her relatable, while her kindness and courage make her a role model for audiences of all ages. She is not waiting to be saved but instead plays an active role in the story, choosing to sacrifice her freedom to save her father and ultimately falling in love with the Beast based on who he is, not what he looks like.The Beast's character arc is equally important. At the start of the film, he is bitter and angry, consumed by the curse that has trapped him in his monstrous form. But as he opens up to Belle, he begins to change, showing vulnerability and kindness that he had buried for so long. His transformation is not just physical but emotional, representing the film's central theme of inner beauty and redemption.At the heart of Beauty and the Beast is the idea that true beauty comes from within. The Beast's appearance may be frightening, but his character development shows that love and compassion can reveal the true beauty in anyone. This theme resonates throughout the film and is what makes the story so enduring. It reminds us that love is about seeing someone for who they truly are, beyond the surface, and that everyone has the capacity for change and growth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Living the fairy tale...,"I agree with the commentator who mentioned that we should ""live the fairy tale"" because Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that teaches the viewer not to judge a book by its cover. This movie is my favorite movie of all time because so much of it applies to myself. I am very much a bookworm, and I used to keep to myself a lot. Eventually, I met my prince and am now living happily ever after. I hope that everyone can live this way or live the fairy tale. A lot of Belle's attributes are worthy of praise: intelligence, kindness and bravery. At a young age, I was taught to value these characteristics and to incorporate them into my own personality. It is probably these three attributes that my friends like about me, therefore Belle is an excellent example of a role model, especially for young girls. She also teaches everyone, and not just children, that perserverence pays off in the end with love and happiness. The objects/servants are a colorful lot, much like your friends, family and everyday acquaintances. They add color and meaning to your life and offer humor: the best medicine. Overall, the scenery and the animation are incredible. I especially loved the details in the castle!

Tale as old as time...,"This animated masterpiece is and will always stay one of the best romantic movies ever created.This is one of those rare movies in which everything comes perfectly together.

Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere and of course Belle and the Beast are highly memorable and very well constructed characters. Also the villain role Gaston which is always one of the most important elements of a Disney movie is a good one. However the villain isn't as prominent to the story as in most other Disney animated movies is the case. This movie truly is about love and the beauty inside. The movie its love story is nicely supported by the very good songs composed by Alan Menken and with lyrics by Howard Ashman. Unfortunately this was Howard Ashman's last project and he died before he could receive his well deserved Oscar for this movie. Unique fact is that this movie was also even nominated for the 'Best Picture' Oscar. Something that was really well deserved by the way. The story is quite 'mature' but also there is still plenty to enjoy for the little one's here. The movie is filled with lots of humor and imaginative characters. The movie is told in very good quick pace and features some of the best editing I have ever seen in an animated movie.The voice cast consists out of some good actors; Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach are especially perfect for their roles.The movie features some unforgettable classic moments and is a milestone in animated movie making.

Such a Belle after All These Years,"You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty & the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a ""tale as old as time"" – they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating ""she's the one"" to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.Those are just two things of, I dunno, 50 great things about this near-masterpiece of filmmaking. A beautiful score, fantastic and timeless songs, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious dialogue and ""sidekicks"" and secondary characters, a story very moving, strong leads, adventure, suspense, love, funthis movie is all of those plus so much more.Watching it (for the 20th+ time but) now in the usual-Disney ""We Want Even More of Your Dollars"" way, the re-release, of course in 3D, it still held up for me. My friend and I in the theatre were rocking back and forth with the wonderful musical segments while mouthing the words – trying desperately, albeit probably failing, not to disturb other movie-goers.I will say this, despite my 10/10 Star ratingthe movie did look 21 years old, unfortunately. Some of the background characters did not move while the foreground was in motion. This was, sadly, unintentionally humorous. That said, I am a huge supporter of hand-drawn animation, or, movies people put their heart, soul, sweat & tears in VS clicking the mouse. This was old-school animation and I am fine with that. I just think this was better served, in 2012, at home to appreciate.Sure, I love re-watching classics or even movies I just like a lot, on the silver screen, but this wasn't one of those. Anyone that knows me knows I do like 3D, but I have NOT seen a single Disney 3D movie that impressed me. Especially converted ones. The ONLY good 3D imagery here was the rain & snow, and I said the same thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas's re-release in 3D. Sad, there were a lot more 3D to choose from, but I ONLY liked the rain & snow which, to me, was the only 3D that had depth.So I will NOT recommend this to be seen in theatres. I will NOT go see another Disney Classic on the big screen converted to 3D and I am no longer upset I missed The Lion King's same 3D re-issue last year. I will, however see Finding Nemo's 3D re-release later this year for several reasons: I DO NOT consider that Disney, it's my favorite Pixar film – though I haven't seen it since the original release in 2003 and the less than 2 minute preview before Beauty & the Beast looked far better in 3D than ALL of Beauty & the Beast. (On a side note, it's absolutely easier to convert that – it was 100% digital and computerized.)Stick with this classic on BluRay. I just hope they put that fantastically hilarious Tangled Ever After short (shown before this movie in the theatre.) It was a lot of fun and had us cracking up.For the movie itself: 10/10 Stars. For the 3D conversion: 2/10 Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Funny, Frightening, and Powerful....Oscar Worthy In Every Way....You Too Will Fall Instantly Under The Spell Of This Beautiful Story","This is Disney's greatest achievement. From the first shot of the castle right on to the end view of the stain glass window it is funny, frightening, and powerful. Every shot is even more enchanting and fantastic than the last. Walt Disney would be very proud of this film.Howard Ashman and Alan Menken have done what most composers can only dream of. To create a ""script"" in every lyric and every note that is heard. This film is nothing short of spectacular.Every voice is flawless. Robby Benson in particular reminds us all that you do not have to be in front of the camera to give off a believable and touching performance.The film is Oscar worthy in every way. The viewer would be well advised to bring a box of tissues during some of the films more tender moments. The ballroom scene is an example of how seamless the animation really is. Other tearjerker moments include a fight between Belle and The Beast which ends with the Beast leaving the protection of his castle to rescue the one who could break the spell from a pack of savagely monstrous wolves, the transformation of a monster into a man, and a dedication to the late Howard Ashman. You too will fall instantly under the spell of this beautiful story. If there is ever anything you will miss out on don't let this movie be it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A very well-made cartoon love story, alas, it wasn't quite what I was expecting","Too much comedy and stupidity, too little enigma and darkness is what strongly lets me down about this love story. However, I DO NOT hate it!THE GOOD POINTS OF ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"": 1. The Stunning Animation 2. The use of CGI for the ballroom and the title song that combines with this amazing scene 3. Belle's appealing character 4. The Songs 5. The Enchanted Rose glowing, spitting out sparks of magic 6. That emotional scene when the beast is severely injured and Belle holds him in her arms and dies. She tells him she loves him when it's almost too late after he dies (the last petal of the rose is about to fall). It's sad but, you know what? It cuts down on all that unwanted comedyTHE BAD POINTS OF ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"": 1. The opening scene in Belle's village - the townspeople are incredibly idiotic! 2. Belle's father Maurice seems more of a wacky, fiery person rather than a warm, comforting old man who makes such awful inventions 3. Gaston has got to be the most annoying and thick-in-the-head Disney villain ever (at least, until the last 15-20 minutes of the film when he turns nasty and mentally jealous) 4. LeFou drives me MAD! 5. The pub sequence when a party is held for Gaston - IT'S JUST PLAIN PATHETIC!!!Well, well, well! I think that kinda proves I love it more than hate it! And why should I hate it? It lacks the brainless stupidity of ""Hercules"" (not a good film AT ALL) and I'm surprised that according to Channel 4's ""100 Greatest Family Films"" ""The Lion King"" was more popular than this! This is MUCH better! And furthermore the ""Lion King"" is just plain depressing and, again, stupid. I still know that this film has already become a treasured classic after just 15 years - it's younger than ME! It's popularity is not surprising, if you ask me! The ballroom scenes with the sweeping camera-motions combining with breathtaking CGI and rich cartoons! Before I go, I will say that, while 6 good points outshines 5 bad points and while there are scenes that'll amaze you, there is no cherry on top of the cake (if you see what I mean) because, like I say, I am not too pleased with the amounts of times sheer dumb comedy comes into this movie - so I won't give ""Beauty and the Beast"" the highest rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Delightful Disney romance,"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in my opinion, is a delightful Disney romance. If you ask me, Gaston (voice of Richard White) was truly diabolical. Still, in my opinion, he was very good-looking. On the other hand, the songs were truly superior. Well, despite the fact that every song in this film was good, I would have to say that the title song was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in delightful Disney romance to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beauty and the Beast,"by Ashley Chewning.The movie The Beauty and The Beast is a heart-warming production by the Disney family. The movie was about Belle (Paige 0' Hara) who was trying to make a beast (Robby Benson) very lovable for him to change back with his friends: Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansburg), Chip (Bradely Pierce), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers, who is also the narrator for the movie), Wardrobe (Jo Anne Worley), Bergman or Babette (Mary Kay), and the stove (Brian Cummings). If the beast and his friends don't change back before the last rose petal falls, then they would stay like that forever.I thought that The Beauty and The Beast was a very good movie. I thought it was dramatic because there was a lot of fire that threatened the Beast and other people. There were many scenes that made the movie action-packed. For an example, at the end of the movie Gaston (Richard White) and the beast fought with each other at the top of the castle. I thought that was a cool thing to watch.The romantic part was the best part out of the whole movie. It all started at the dance in the middle of the ballroom floor. The song came on and they were dancing and having fun. Then it went to near the end of the movie when the Beast and his friends turn back to normal, and Belle and the Beast live happily ever after.I think that this movie would be good to watch with a family member or with your best friends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Be our guest.,"'Beauty and the Beast' remains the first, and likely only, animated film to ever be nominated for the Oscar's Best Picture. It is perhaps the highest accolade ever bestowed on the world of animation, that they could compete with the best of Hollywood's live-action batch. It was and still is an honor very much deserved by this Disney classic. And years later, 'Beauty and the Beast' stands as a remarkable testament to the power of cinema.In a scene where Pixar appropriately dominates the field with stellar computer animation and heart-warming stories for kids and adults, it takes a film like 'Beauty and the Beast' to remind us all of the wonders Disney was able to accomplish. Of all the classics they have churned out throughout the years, this must be one of their finest. It is a simple story, but one that will sweep you off your feet with magic and enchantment.A classic story of unexpected love, a tale as old as time. One prince's curse to find the inner beauty leaves him a hideous beast, trapped to a lonely life in a vast castle. The arrival of Belle, a charming local, in a quest to find her father sparks the beginning of a true fairytale as she herself struggles to find the tenderness beneath the Beast's thick skin. It is a story for the ages, with sparks of magical imagination found in every beautiful frame of Disney's animation. It is not limited only to the youngsters, as 'Beauty and the Beast' has enough carefully constructed layers that will appeal to viewers of all ages.Touched with treasures of charm, romance, wit, and dazzling musical numbers, 'Beauty and the Beast' is an unforgettable portrait of love filled with memorable characters. From our two main characters to an castle full of enchanted objects. The brilliant presence of Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Chip light up the screen and bring a smile to your face. 'Beauty and the Beast' is a film to be cherished time after time, a truly great film with a warm message of love and acceptance. A breathtaking and spellbinding experience that remains a timeless classic.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast are still beautiful,"As a child I didn't quite liked ""Beauty and the Beast"", because I though it was a too serious and adult cartoon. But I like this movie now as an grown up. From a child's perspective it is a ""girl movie"", cause I knew many girls instead of boys who liked this film.""Beauty and the Beast"" is considered like the real Disney classic of all times, who is understandable. Personally I think it's a little bit overrated, but still a beautiful and charming film. No wonder that it got nominated for Best Picture (it's a shame it didn't won).Like I wrote earlier, this movie it's more darker than you usually expect from Disney because of the subject matter of the story and it makes the movie a little more adult, even it's watchable for the kids. But the youngest audience may be frighten.Belle is a wonderful Disney heroine. As a kid, I though the secondary characters were pretty annoying, but now I think they're enjoyable (exept Le Fou, Gaston's sidekick and Maurice, Belle's father).The script is well written. Most of the songs are beautiful and so is the animation.I must admit that I think the climax scene it's a little bit weaker comparing to other Disney climax scenes, so that's why this movie doesn't get a higher vote from me. Besides that, it's a great Disney masterpiece.And for instant: Watch the ""Human Again"" sequence and make you'r own opinion about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
a terrific film with a fabulous heroine,"this is one of my all time favorite films.  the story is classic and can be related to any time period.  it contains a terrific moral, as well as the most beautiful and wonderful animated creation in all of film.  she also has a wonderful voice, a definite plus.  the music is great as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
stunning animation,"The best thing about Beauty and the Beast is the stunning animation, particularly the ballroom scene. This scene really makes you feel like you are there; the movement is superb. Disney again takes an enjoyable and popular tale and weaves it into a magical film. Unfortunately, this is one of the last Disney films that has charm, particularly the charm of some of the old Disney films. It's enjoying to watch, and the characters are not annoying in the slightest, unlike some of Disney's other films. This film is worth a watch and should be enjoyed by the whole family. Captivating, romantic, and packed with action and good lessons - this is definitely a family film (though maybe with a slight preference to females).",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Typical superficial Disney fare,"I've finally discovered what happened to all the bad boys who were turned into donkeys in Disney's ""Pinocchio"": they went to live in Belle's town. Disney's anti-male bias is very much in evidence in ""Beauty and the Beast"": the perfect heroine is surrounded by the most grotesque collection of males ever found in one movie.  Most of them are slobby-looking pigs, the ones who aren't dried-up old scarecrows.  Even the lone good one, her father, is a bumbling, fat old fool incapable of even driving a broken-down farmhorse to the fair without getting lost. The one goodlooking man she knows is Gaston, a selfish, narcissistic brute, which leaves only the Beast, whose table manners leave much to be desired.  But eventually he learns to ""behave like a gentleman"", which is all that is necessary to win the heroine in this very superficial retelling of the fairy tale.  Watch the Cocteau version if you want a real story with some depth.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast,"Only second to ""The Little Mermaid"" on my list of favorite Disney classics, I have been captivated by ""Beauty"" ever since seeing it in the movies in 1992 (I was 7). The film combines the best of Disney: stunning visuals, appealing characters, great music and a timeless story. The first thing you notice about B&B is the gorgeous artwork - the film opens with an eye-popping shot of a forest and remains a visual delight throughout its 90 minute run-time. B&B includes some of the best Disney songs as well, most notably ""Belle"", ""Something There"" and the title song. I own the soundtrack and the score is just as good (""The West Wing"" and ""Transformation"" being my favorites). I also think Belle and the beast make a great couple. There's chemistry between them and their romance doesn't feel forced, but natural and genuine. I was very pleased with my 1993 LaserDisc so I was quite hesitant to obtain the blu ray, fearing it would ruin my enjoyment from the film (wasn't too familiar with the format just 2 years ago). Gladly, I was wrong and the film looks breathtaking in HD (although I do reduce the saturation, given the colors are a little too garish to my taste). Now we just have to wait for my other favorite Disney classic to arrive on Blu Ray, The Little Mermaid.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"""The Perfect Animated Movie""","In the opening of Beauty and The Beast, we find out more about the characters in the first five minutes, then many movies tell us in half an hour.  Taking a risk, and opening an animated film with a long musical number was a risky move, but as it turns out, a perfectly wonderful idea. From the opening to the end, we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement in music and animation as we have never been before.Unlike many animated Disney movies where a song may be thrown in here and there, and do little to move the story along, each song here is directly related to the story line, moves the movie along, and leaves us anticipating the next big number.  Alan Menken and Howard Ashman deserve every bit of the praise they received for this film, and then some.All the characters in this film are so well animated and voiced, you never once think about the fact that you are watching an animated movie, as is often the case.  From the town that Belle lives in, to the Beast castle, the backgrounds are beautifully rendered in detail, and vibrant alive colors. In 1991, this was a ground breaking, animated film, and over ten years later, as much as I enjoy many of the new computer animated movies such as Shrek and Toy Story, none has come close to the accomplishments of Beauty and the Beast, which mixes romance, music, comedy and drama, in a perfect blend that may never be seen again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A classic fairy tale for everyone.,"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is one of the greatest Disney films to ever grace audiences. A personal favorite, the story of Beauty and her growing love for the Beast is one that people have enjoyed through the years, from the theater to Broadway.I first saw Beauty and the Beast when I was a little girl, around the time that I watched the other Disney classics. And, like I did with the others, I fell in love. The stunning animation and soundtrack coupled with the captivating story kept me in my seat till the very end.This movie is thrilling, with it's message of how love can happen even if the people in question aren't incredibly beautiful. Although the idea of the Beast changing to a prince doesn't sit well with me-- Beauty fell in love with the animal, not the man-- the film is a treasure from Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"It was Good, but kinda overrated","I first saw Beauty and the Beast when the Diamond edition came out last year, when I was 17 years old. Maybe that's the reason I don't like this movie as much as everyone does, but I doubt it since I also saw Wall-e the same night and absolutely loved that film. Now when I first saw it, I was prepared to give this film a 6/10, but after thinking about it and listening to many peoples reasons why they love it I think it deserves at least a 7.The story is of two opposites that have a bad first impression but eventually fall in love. Simple, but it works. There are a few things that bother me about this film though. For one I feel that when the beast wasn't a jerk, he was really boring and bland, sorta the same thing that happened with Simba in the Lion King. I hate Lumiere alright, he is just a prick. And the songs aren't what they're hyped up to be. Be our guest is the only song that I loved, the rest are good, but I wouldn't sing along, and to be honest I don't see myself singing to Be our Guest either.But there are more good things, the love isn't just love at first sight, the rest of the characters are cool and the animation is stunning. Overall, good film, but not my favorite in the Disney Movie library.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Best Disney Cartoon Movie Ever Made!,"Words fail me as I try to express my feelings about Beauty and the Beast, the best cartoon movie ever made! Praise is all that I can find for it and anything that I or any fan writes about it simply cannot do justice to this tour-de-force of top-class animation and elegant story-telling.Beauty and the Beast marks one of the first and best uses of digital animation for the range of human emotions that it captures. Even today, there is no sequence as memorable as the ballroom sequence where Belle and the Beast dance to the strains of the title tune. Speaking of tunes, no mention of this movie's artistic merits is ever complete without a mention of the songs. The lyrics written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are absolutely poetic (Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme) and the voicing of the songs by Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and others is simply incredible!The two best song sequences in the movie are 'Be My Guest' and 'Tale as old as time'.The script is excellent taking the old but fairly well-known fable and developing it into something modern yet touching and poignant. The new innovations of the scriptwriters to the original story such as putting a feminist touch on Belle, the development of the relationship between Belle and the Beast, the talking cutlery are fully fleshed out and have been integrated into the pace, moving the story forward and never slowing it down.The characters are sharply developed. Belle is a vibrant bookish girl who lives in a world of fairy tales, yet dearly loves her wacky but likable inventor father. Also it is worth mentioning that she is shown to have an individualistic bent of mind who sees the handsome but shallow Gaston for what he is and spurns his advances. She has the spunk to wear the type of clothes and act the way she wants unlike the other dumb village girls.At first she fears the Beast, but when he saves her she appreciates him and finds the prince within the Beast. She is intelligent, compassionate and has a mind of her own. She's also very outspoken and courageous as is evidenced by her opting to take her father's place in the Beast's castle and in her tirade of reason against the Beast when he rebukes her for putting herself into danger by trying to run away from the castle. With her strong personality, she makes a terrific role model for young girls everywhere. Long before Titanic, this was the first successful attempt at female empowerment. The Beast is a fierce ape-like creature whose short temper stems from his frustration at being unable to find true love. Gaston the narcissistic village champion who thinks that brawns are more important than brains is ridiculed by the movie and eventually exposed as its villain. Even minor supporting characters such as the clock, the lamp and the teapot are fleshed out and will enchant both kids and adults alike.I actually started crying during the movie's finale when the Beast dies after the struggle with Gaston and my sorrow was turned into joy when the curse is broken and the Beast gets transformed into a handsome prince. The transformation effects are simply mind-blowing (for a cartoon movie!).Some eighteen years after its release this movie only gets better with time. Cynics who normally dismiss cartoons and G-rated fare should see this movie and experience a change of heart. If this movie does not move them, then they should go admit themselves into a morgue!My Grade:A+!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
not a classic Disney film,"Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's songs provide the cornerstone of this cartoon, inspired in part by the 1940s film by Jean Cocteau. Much of the settings mirror those in the classic film.This film was a major money spinner for the Disney corporation, but for me wasn't up to the standards of the days when Walt Disney was alive. However, it was an enjoyable cartoon with interesting characters and a Broadway feel - indeed, it enjoys a second flush of fame as a stage musical today.I think 'Beauty and the Beast' was the last really good Disney film - 'Aladdin', which followed, was just disappointing. The legend survives intact - Belle and her Beast dance in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers; the teapot and cups sing a welcome when she arrives; and the girl gets her Prince to the swirling sounds of musical Americana.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney discovers feminism (sort of),"Belle is a beautiful, innocent, intelligent and kind young girl bored with her life in her small village. Her lovable father falls in the clutches of the Beast who is really a handsome prince under a spell. She trades herself for her father's freedom. The Beast agrees. Also the spell on him can be broken if someone loves him--but time is running out. Since this is a Disney film you probably know how it ends.This was a blockbuster success for Disney. It was also the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It's beautifully done with some jaw-dropping animation--the ballroom sequence is already a classic. Also it's a musical and it's one of those rare occurrences where EVERY song works! This was a well-deserved Oscar winner for Best Song and Score. I saw the extended version with one new song--""Human Again""--which fits in seamlessly with the original movie. All the voices match the characters perfectly--it's quite amusing to realize that Robby Benson does the Beast's voice! Also this was (for Disney) a step forward in portraying female characters. Their previous film (""The Little Mermaid"") got some heat for how the mermaid NEEDED a man to live. In this film Belle doesn't need anyone--she's strong, self-willed and can fight back. She does fall in love with the Beast but not because she needs him--in fact he needs her! For Disney that was feminism.Basically one of the best Disney cartoons ever. Also it's perfect for the kids--only really small ones might be frightened. Perfect for everyone--a 10 all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney as its most 'classic'... whatever it means...,"Because she was unfairly judged by her horrid looks, an old witch casts a spell on an arrogant prince, turning him into a horrendous beast, and the spell extends to every person working in the castle, turned to the furniture they usually handle in their respective job. The ways of magic are impenetrable in Disney's world. But like any Disney spell, it can be broken if the Prince finds true love: if he's capable to love someone and in return, inspires similar feelings. This is a doomed-to-fail mission as no possible girl could ever love a beast.But Belle isn't any girl; she's a French village's local oddity, a free-spirited, fresh and charming girl who keeps her nose stuck on books while wandering on the streets, attracting all the astonished reactions. Belle doesn't care for material stuff, she's a dreamer, in reading, she seeks escapism in its most extraordinary forms, and that she's the daughter of a goofy inventor accentuates her peculiarity, and her charm. And one man fixed his choice on Belle, his name is Gaston and he's the village macho icon, a colossal brute whose strength equals his stupidity, and who can't stand seeing Belle playing ""hard to get"".Gaston slowly turns from a comical buffoon to a more sinister villain. And this is what ""Beauty and the Beast"" is all about: transformations, evolution, but never at the expenses of disbelief.This is the magic of Disney, we can accept a teapot with the voice of Angela Lansbury, a candlestick with the facial features and unmistakable accent of Maurice Chevalier or the failed jokes of a clock-shaped butler. We can accept the extraordinarily horrific face of the Beast who's an improbable combination of a lion's mane, wolf's legs, buffalo's face and boar's mug. But there's one thing that all the 'Fantasy' can't buy and it is the growing chemistry between Belle and the Beast. We know when she becomes the hostage in the castle, it's a matter of time before the romance blooms but it's all in the way this is handled. There's indeed more than 'Stockholm Syndrome'.""Beauty and the Beast"" takes an old classic theme but turns into a serious and legitimate drama: to earn the princess' love, the Beast will have to risk his furry neck, to learn to accept his mistakes, and even to let 'her' leave the castle as sometimes, this is the greatest proof of love. On her side, Belle will also discover the strange attraction and its final blossoming at the film's climax. The romance is handled in such a way that it never feels like a rehash of the older Disney. But if I had to mention the previous movies, I would say that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is to ""The Little Mermaid"" what ""Pinocchio"" was to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", the proof that the former film's success wasn't just a strike of luck and that the animators still got it and could surprise you when you thought it was impossible to match the delights and thrills of the previous one.With ""Mermaid"", Disney inaugurated the Renaissance period and established new grounds, that only Disney could ever break or surpass. And with ""Beauty and the Beast"", they created a formidable precedent by making the first ever animated feature to be nominated to a Best Picture Oscar, along with such other prestigious titles as ""Silence and the Lambs"" and ""JFK"". Many Pixar movies achieved the same stunt (""Up"" and ""Toy Story 3""), but it's easier to sneak in when you have eight to ten available spots. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was certainly no filler.I insist on these Oscar considerations because ""Beauty and the Beast"" is really one of a kind, it is such a big-scaled prestigious visual feast that it might leave smaller audiences craving a bit underwhelmed. Speaking for myself, as I had the chance to be the target core of the Disney Renaissance, ""Beauty and the Beast"" has never been one of my favorites, not in the sense that I disliked it but because I would always find better reasons to enjoy ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"" or ""The Jungle Book"". Revisiting this classic 25 years after its release (time flies), I understand why: this is a great film on its own right, and not just as a Disney animated feature.And it wasn't just nominated for Best Picture, but it was also included in major lists from the American Film Institute: Songs, Romances but is the only animated feature to have made it in the ""Musical"" category, which says a lot because all the previous Disney movies have been musicals. But in the case of ""Beauty and the Beast"", the musical moments are staged like in Broadway comedies, the opening song even borrows from ""West Side Story"" and Belle has something of Maria from ""Sound of Music"". But ""Beauty"" didn't just reused common staples of musical, it became a staple itself as the film would be parodied countless times, from the unforgettable ""See my Vest"" where Mr. Burns reveals his devilish puppy scheme to the ""Mountain Song"" in ""South Park"", and one can even see similar plot lines between the film and the movie ""Shrek"".""Beauty and the Beast"" is an instant classic and the living incarnation of Disney's magic, it doesn't have the zaniness or little spice that can create an extra appeal, but that's because the film had more serious ambitious and doesn't even deny it in its titular song, as the tale is 'as old as time', stories or 'seemingly impossible loves'. And maybe like Belle, now, I can see the beauty of ""Beauty in the Beast"", if only because it's so magnificently hand-drawn and Belle looks more expressive than any 3D princess.(And don't get me started on that moment where we get to see the real 'Featherduster', perhaps the Disney moment that most turned me on)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A review of the original (1991) & the 3D version (2012),"I remember this as Disney's first breakthrough cartoon, boldly crossing demographics between children & adults. It's a cute, digestible story with some silly laughs for the young'uns, and it's also packed with some subtle, witty, almost suggestive zingers for the grownups.After seeing it again for the first time in 20 years, in glorious 3D no less, I thought I'd give a review on how it has aged over the years.First, let's talk about the 3D. Well I may be easily impressed (considering the last 3D movie I saw was ""Space Hunter"" in 1983), but the 3D experience really brought this story to life and made me feel like a kid experiencing something new again. No, it's not quite as dazzling as the modern, computerized 3D films like I saw in the previews. But I don't know if we'd want it that way. The modern upgrades shouldn't upstage the timeless simplicity of this classic work of art, much like we wouldn't necessarily want to hear the old Beatles recordings remixed in bowel-busting, pelvis-pounding 5.1 surround sound. But some tasteful upgrades here & there can effectively liven up the presentation to today's standards. Here we get a nice enhanced depth of vision and a few spectacular moments like in the song ""Be Our Guest"" and the ballroom scene. But I still remained immersed in the story instead of thinking ""wow this is 3D!""The material... Given that this is a vintage fairytale, it can feel a little dated and, well, ""cartoonish"". But isn't that the point? The good guys are unquestionably good. The bad guys are unquestionably bad. There is no moral ambiguity, and all personalities and situations are greatly exaggerated to make it clear to the audience. That's the part that may seem ""dated"" in light of today's more complex, irresoluble story lines where good blends with evil and the universe isn't always fair. No, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of the last true fairy tales & about as idealistic as it gets. So be sure to leave your cynicism at the door.The music & performances are first class. Songs are fun & playful, and I can imagine little kids squealing with delight as well as adults cracking big smiles. This film and ""Aladdin"" stand out in my mind as being Disney's most entertaining musicals. There's a certain edge to the music that separates it from the old school Rodgers & Hammerstein type of songs and puts it in a new class of songwriting like Danny Elfman's work on ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". Beyond that, it's hard to describe. You just have to hear it.I was shocked to see the theater completely empty except for one couple hiding in the back. I suppose a lot of people are reluctant to pay the heavy price tag for a 3D film that was never intended that way. Make no mistake, I don't think the visuals will blow you away, especially if you already own your own copy of B&tB on DVD or Blu-Ray. But if, like me, the last time you saw the movie was 20 years ago, I think you owe it to yourself to revisit this great flick, and be sure to go for the full presentation. Who says you can never be a child again? For us old timers, 3D gives us the fresh novelty we need to make it happen.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Best Disney movie of all time....no questions asked,"No other Disney movie in my oppinion, except for some of the classics from fifty years ago can compare to Beauty and the Beast. Disney hasn't made any good movies really in the past fifteen years except this. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Disey, Musicals, or movies at all. It is a true classic!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"One of Disney's best, and my favorite.","This is what I think one of Disney's best animated features, either cartoon short or full-length animated feature film. It is also my favorite Disney movie, about a Beast (an enchanted prince) who has been losing hope to learn to love and be loved in return in order to break the enchanted spell, until he meets Belle. Belle offers to stay in the castle with the Beast in exchange for her imprisoned father to be set free. What follows is a beautiful love story in how Belle attempts to tame the Beast as he learns the proper manners to be a gentleman from her, and attempting to learn to love and be loved in return.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a marvelous job directing this movie, providing a solid plot that offered a captivating, exciting and heartwarming story of adventure, courage and love. The chemistry between Belle and the Beast will capture your heart and probably put a lump in your throat; it is captured in a way that sent a strong message of changing one's way for the better, humility and acts of selflessness.The characters, especially the enchanted objects, are very lovable and extraordinary, each one giving his/her own unique charm, including: Lumiere, a lovestruck, suave-talking candelabra; Cogsworth, a pompous and prim table clock; Mrs. Potts, the kind-hearted and warm teapot; and Chip, Mrs. Potts' son and an inquisitive teacup. I love the constant competition between Lumiere and Cogsworth as they try to win Belle's liking and command of the castle's duties. All the objects provided the right touch of humor and comedy for a dramatic love story.Alan Menken did a great job on the music score - very spirited, lively and moving. And, my hat is off to some of the greatest songs, by Menken and Howard Ashman, in cinema history: Be Our Guest and Beauty and the Beast. Lumiere and Mrs. Potts (Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury) sang ""Be Our Guest"" during a grand dinner for Belle. As the enchanted objects performed dances and acrobats to the song, it gave what I think are some of the best pieces of animation work in history. Just the unveiling of the chandelier and the Eiffel Tower forming under a bevy of wineglasses are breathtaking. And, the song ""Beauty and the Beast,"" sung by Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), is a beautiful and stirring song that basically summarizes the entire movie - ""tale as old as time,"" ""sweet and strength,"" ""finding you can change,"" ""Beauty and the Beast."" Other memorable characters I like to mention are the conceited and villainous Gaston (Richard White), the slapstick and somewhat clueless LeFou (Jesse Corti) and the brilliant and bold inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart).There is never a slow or dull moment in this movie - it is thoroughly entertaining and exciting from start to finish. This movie definitely has that ""Disney touch,"" which makes it that much more special. It is the perfect one for audiences of all ages, one to watch again and again and, for myself, will remain my favorite Disney film, animated feature in general and one of my favorite movies of all time.Grade A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A classy affair,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is that rare example of a vaunted Disney movie that really works; on pretty much every level. It says a lot that I - averse to musicals - gravitate toward the songs in this movie. They're all good . . . Even the Celine Dion ballad. The requisite puzzle pieces come together just right here. It's got a (genuinely) strong female protagonist, good humor, very nice animation, and even a message about not being a douche. Also, the weirdest-looking prince I've ever seen in a Disney movie.But here's the bottom line: If Disney applied that ""Lion King"" prestige to this movie, it'd be well-earned, and they'd actually be right on the money. There's not a whole lot (any?) about this that turns me off, and it's a legitimately entertaining movie. Worthy of high praise. And as Disney Renaissance movies go (a phrase that gets thrown around with reckless abandon), this is right up there at the top.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Just as I remembered it, as always","I remember first seeing this on VHS when I was four years old at a friend's house (my family couldn't get this on VHS because this is older than me), and, no surprise, I loved it. We also saw this in the IMAX a few years ago, and not only did I love it, I adored it, too. Since then, it renewed my love for Disney musicals. And now, watching it on DVD, it just keeps getting better and better every single time I see it. They say that most Disney movies are meant for kids, but they're really meant for the entire family, no matter how old you are. The only thing though, the beast might be quite scary for littlest kids, so make sure you're supervising them when they watch it. Oh, I neglected to mention that this film will be re-released again next year, in 3D! (Is this enough to grab your attention?)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Even after two decades, this classic remains strong!","What a gorgeous and unique Disney movie this is.When an inventor is imprisoned within a cursed castle, his daughter Belle goes to rescue him. But upon doing so she is trapped herself, and slowly learns of the castle's mysteries and its prince; a man under a monstrous spell.1991's Beauty and the Beast walked away with two Academy Awards (for Original Score and Best Original Song) as well as the Golden Globes for the same awards but also for Best Picture (Musical or Comedy) and for me, as much as I love 1992's Aladdin, I would say Beauty and the Beast marks the end of the classic Disney era. What do I mean by that? Everything afterwards had a distinctly angular animation style, as well as an assortment of pop culture references or contemporary humour. This film however is heavily entrenched in the fairy tale, storybook formula that Disney-of-old relished in.The film's greatest ingredients have got to be its three primary characters: the Beast, Belle and Gaston. They have such great layering and complexity for Disney characters. Belle may be ""the girl wanting more from life"" but we learn early on in the film that she is no fool; she sees straight through the narcissistic showboating Gaston instantly. She even bravely rescues her father from a monster, opposes Gaston at every turn and defends those she cares about from adversity. The Beast is a fantastic mix of incredible rage, sadness and childish stubbornness and reluctance. He is a great comedic foil with his assortment of servants-turned-household objects, a scary monster with a lovable buffoon inside. While Gaston he has comedic yet surprisingly human motivations for his actions; he isn't powered by magic or gadgets, he's just a thick-skulled jock. The perfect villain for such an intelligent girl and her sensitive love interest.The film is lovingly animated. The castle is both grand and full of foreboding, the servants are lively and charmingly designed. Who doesn't love Lumiere? In fact there's a lot of evidence of inspiration from Disney's third cinematic event in 1940, Fantasia. What with the living mops cleaning the castle to the fantastical dining song with Lumiere where plates and dinnerware fly around creating patterns and abstract motions. The film even includes one of Disney's first CGI interventions (technically The Great Mouse Detective's clock sequence was first) the ambitiously grand ballroom scene. It is all very colourful and exciting.The songs, even for me and my lack of enthusiasm for musicals, are all enjoyable and very memorable! Even the villain's song, which often in Disney is a point of contention, is very entertaining. I can absolutely see why the Academy and others awarded the film so highly. Belle and The Beast's relationship is great too. With Belle's incarceration answering the question as to ""why she doesn't run away"", the two are forced to mingle and interact, making for great comedic and dramatic chemistry as the story continues.There is one point that sticks out amongst this chemistry and excitable pacing, upon the beginning of the final act, the tone radically shifts as the plot is forced to escalate suddenly. It isn't bad, and it gives us a great climax, but it is a tremendous gearshift in pacing for a film that's only eighty- four minutes long.Beauty and the Beast is a gorgeous film and I hate myself a little for abandoning it for over two decades. But it remains true to itself, in that I had fond memories for all those years and it has withstood the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
All-Time Classic,"Beauty and the Beast in in the top three of all time Disney films in my book. Everything about this movie was spot on. The storyline of falling in love with the Beast despite his appearance and being repulsed by Gaston in spite of his handsomeness was inspiring and rings true today. The special effects were amazing, and I absolutely LOVED Chip. And, finally, the songs. What can you say but, WOW! Disney films always have a good soundtrack, but Beauty and the Beast(both versions) are simply put, perfection. This movie is just as great today as it was in 1992 and it deserves its status as a classic and I would love to see it appreciated by a new generation of kids and adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
B&B,"Old school Disney movies have been tricky for me. They just don't seem to hold up well when going back and actually watching them, expecting them to stand upon reality rather than memory. Beauty and the Beast? This one was still enjoyable though. I loved how independent Belle was. She got imprisoned by this monster and she didn't just immediately roll over and decide to love the jerk. Now, eventually she did develop some pretty strong feelings of Stockholm Syndrome, but I appreciate the journey taken to get there. Gaston is a monster, one that I think pop culture has weirdly downplayed into a comic oaf, but no this dude is straight up awful.All in all, fun movie. Glad I rewatched it. Will not be able to get the songs out of my head for a while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
20+ Years Later and it's Still one of the Best Disney Movies!!!,"Beauty and the Beast is Disney's 30th full-length animated feature released in 1991. Following the successes of ""The Little Mermaid"" and the much underrated ""Resucers Down Under,"" Beauty and the Beast succeeded all expectations and made motion picture history by becoming the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1992 (it lost to Silence of the Lambs). Even though it didn't win Best Picture from the Academy, it's still a classic Disney film that is a favorite of many (including myself). It is the story of Belle (voice by Paige O'Hara), a beautiful young girl who, after her father is taken captive and imprisoned by the Beast (voiced by Robby Benson), goes to find him and take his place as the Beast's prisoner. While imprisoned, she meets a whole host of enchanted objects that were all once human but, because of the Beast's stubborness, he and the entire castle were placed under a spell that could only be broken if the Beast learned to love another and earn her love in return before the last petal on the rose fell. Some of the characters are: Lumiere the lovestruck candle (voiced by Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth the pompous clock (voiced by David Ogden Stiers who was also narrator), Mrs. Potts the kind-hearted teapot (voiced by Angela Lansbury), and Chip (voiced by Bradley Michael Pierce) who is your typical 8-year old boy. Every Disney movie has its antagonist (villain). Here it's Gaston (voiced by Richard White) an arrogant, heartless hunter who wants Belle at all costs. Once Belle falls in love with the Beast, Gaston's jealousy grows and Belle realizes that he's the true monster and Beast is more humane. This is a true classic: great story, great characters, great animation, and great music score/songs composed by Academy-Award Winning composers Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, who sadly died of AIDS six months before the film was released and never got to see how successful the film would become. I love the tribute to him at the end of the credits: ""To our friend Howard, who gave a Mermaid her voice and a Beast his soul. We will be forever grateful."" The song that will stick with you is ""Beauty and the Beast,"" sung during the ballroom dancing scene (Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson did a good job singing it too). This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of gender. I grew up loving this movie (and all the other Disney classics on VHS), and I'm a guy who loves sports! All that being said, this is definitely one of my top 10 favorite Disney movies!!! Rating: 9/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast!!! Best Animated movie ever done!!!,"Beauty and the Beast is truly the best animated movie of all time. Tonight I watched again after 4 or 5 years and it just opened my eyes. If all of my brothers weren't watching it with me I would have cried so much. The story is incredible, but what really makes this movie so wonderful and beautiful is the music. The songs are great, especially "" Beauty and the Beast"", Alan Menken did a great job on this movie( Songs and score). I'm very happy that it won 2 Oscars, and got nominated for best picture, I think it should have won. Beauty and the Beast is a movie for all ages, it will make you happy when you're child, and make you cry when you're older. In conclusion, I believe that this movie is one of the greatest ever made and I'm surprised it's not in IMDb's top 250 'cause it really should be, anyway, to all of you who still didn't get the chance to see it or thought that it was to silly and childish, believe me it's not, it's a true masterpiece.

There are other things about this movie that you might want to mention, however, is the story, the plot plot the foundation on which this movie turns out to be so despicable in my eyes that I love the beauty and the beast with all the attention to detail and the visual Glamor performance can never count so my positive movie experiences in.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The epic love story ever told,"As Mrs Potts rightly sings- ""Tale as old as time"", the story of 'Beauty and the Beast' lives on forever and ever. Never, ever in my life, in my opinion, have I ever seen a film with such complex themes, with such a message to keep the audience thinking and such depth to its story. Of course and rightly Disney has presented this film beautifully and poetically, so all the audience, who have seen the film from old to young, will understand the message and directed by Gary Trousdale, he shows this amazingly.When a selfish prince is turned into a he is hideous beast by a beautiful enchantress, disguised as a beggar women, he is forced to be confined to his castle, along with his faithful servants, who have been turned into common house-hold objects. The only thing with him is a single rose, which will bloom until his twenty first birthday. Until then, if he doesn't find true love, then he is doomed to remain a beast forever. However, there is little hope, when a lovely young woman comes, looking for her father, who is kept hostage in the castle she seems to be the solution and the one to break the dreaded curse. ""For who could ever love a beast?"" Disney really delivers the message of never judging anyone, simply in this fairy tale, in which everyone can keep in their hearts. With characters with such depth, 'Beauty and the Beast' never fails to entice the audience, with the theme of love, finding what really matters and looking deep to what really matters.With the best actors, providing the voice for the characters including Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston, Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice). With Mrs Potts singing the legendary title song, we see the Beast becoming the man that he has hidden all those years.Overall, I cannot stress how much this film touches everyone's hearts. A must see to see... again and again and again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's beautifully animated twist on de Beaumont's famous fairy tale,"Beauty and the Beast is one of my favourite French fairytales. I am particularly interested in stories from different countries.Based upon Madame Le Prince de Beaumont's famous fairy tale (with a few twists here and there), this film is about a beautiful young peasant woman named Belle, who is considered strange by the villagers because of her preference for reading books and dislike of being courted by the local hero, Gaston, who is an egomaniac and 'positively primeval'. At one point, Gaston offers his hand in marriage to Belle, but she rejects it, and this serves as a hard blow to Gaston's ego.While travelling to a fair, Maurice, Belle's father and an eccentric inventor, becomes lost and loses his horse, Phillipe, in the night as wolves chase him. Cold and tired, he stumbles upon a mysterious castle and enters it. One by one, the enchanted household items-Lumière the candelabra, Mrs. Potts the teapot, and Cogsworth the clock-warmly welcome him and shelter him from the cold. But a horrifying beast discovers Maurice and, in a fury, locks him in a dungeon on top of the castle's tower. Belle, who worries when Phillipe returns home without him, decides to seek out her father. Eventually, Belle winds up at the Beast's castle. She finds him in the tower dungeon and tries to break him free, but the beast catches her instead. She offers herself in exchange for her father's life, against his wishes. The beast agrees and releases her father. That's all I could tell you, folks; you will have to see the film for yourself to see how it ends.I love the film's prologue, told in stained glass windows, with David Ogden Stiers' (Cogsworth's) narration. I also love the scene where Belle asks if she can see her father, and the magic mirror reveals that Maurice is lost and sick in the forest. The Beast, having fallen in love with Belle, releases her to rescue her father, even though his heart is breaking and he would give up his humanity.I do love Belle; besides being a bookworm (just like me, my mom, and my grandmother), she is strong-willed and not a slave to petty, superficial things like being a housewife and raising children. She is also independent and allows herself to see inner beauty without sacrificing her own values. Belle is a perfect role model for girls. Beauty and the Beast was also the first animated movie to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Movie of 1991, and it had an equally successful adaptation for Broadway in 1994.Overall, I loved this film from beginning to end, and you know, it's kind of hard to choose which film version of the story is the best. I would say this version, the French version made in 1946, and the 1987 ""Canon Movie Tales"" version are the best to me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
My all-time favourite animated movie.,"Beauty and the Beast is probably the closest to perfection of any film I've ever seen. It's such a beautiful love story, full of suspense, humour and emotion.The animation, as usual with Disney, is stunning. Every frame of the movie has very detailed, beautiful artwork. Special mention goes to the animation of Ms. Pots, Lumiere, Cogswarth, Chip and all the other objects who manage to move naturally without any limbs. And of course there's the Beast, who starts out very menacing and scary and gradually becomes more and more human by his posture and facial expression.The voice actors also have exceptional talent. The actress who plays Belle has a very nice voice and is a great singer. Gaston has very deep, manly voice that suits his character perfectly. But if there was an Oscar for best voice-over performance, it would go to the Beast. He gibes such a powerful, tortured performance, that I really wish I looked up his name before writing this.And also usual with any Disney movie, the songs are ridiculously catchy. I especially love that fun, energetic song about Gaston, and the very beautiful title song ""Beauty and the Beast."" The latter song is sung during a very beautiful sequence where Belle and the Beast are dancing in a CGI room. The CGI maybe dated, but it's still a timeless scene.Another thing Disney also does greatly is mixing romance, comedy and suspense. The movie has lots of funny scenes, especially the parts with Cogsworth and Lumiere, but there are also very intense scenes that will keep you in suspense, like the exciting climax. And of course there are a couple scenes that will have you reaching for the tissues.With interesting characters, catchy songs, nail biting suspense, a beautiful love story and stunning animation, I recommend this masterpiece to just about everybody who watches movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

With stellar animation, wonderful songs, fantastic characters and vocal work (Orbach's Lumière being a true standout) and an array of genuine emotions, this charming, well-crafted little feature is a real treat that can entertain just about any fan demographic.

Beauty and the Beast,"This film is truly a wonder to behold. An excellent film in every aspect. For me, this is the only Disney movie in which the music is comparable to that in ""The Little Mermaid"". Visually, ""Beauty"" is a great example of how CGI can complement hand-drawn artwork without taking over it, like in later Disney films (most notably ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"" and ""Tarzan""). The ballroom sequence was truly groundbreaking but that's about the only ""computerized"" part in the film, thankfully. Belle herself is a fantastic heroine, one who dreams of adventure and not about a lover. I don't see why so many people were let down by the prince in his human form. I thought he was done very well. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is definitely up there with ""The Little Mermaid"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not exactly my cup of tea.,"There are a few things that's not so cool about this movie. It gets old after watching it more than three times, some of the songs aren't very good, and the beast yelling is disturbing. I like the characters, and Gaston is one of the coolest and funniest villain in any Disney movie. He want to Mary Belle, and kill the beast. Disney could have done better with this movie! There were a few funny moments, like when Gaston fell in the mud, and Belle's father sneezing on a clocks face. There's a scene near the end where Gaston gets into a big fight with the Beast, and stabs him with a knife. A little bit of violence and heavy for a kids flick right there, eh?

A tale on the possibility  of being able to change and become better,"Even if the story itself can be a little controversial (a beauty falling in love with her tormentor), Disney's bring us here one of its best motion picture ever. Catchy songs, well developed characters (especially for the supporting roles), incredible animation, very romantic moments, a good drama, will make your trip into this imaginary world, an unforgettable one. Comparing to most Disney's movies this one is more ""grey"" than ""black of white"" and some may be scared that the message deliver is not clear enough for children but life is grey and rather than focusing on the tormentor part it is the idea of the possibility of being able to change and become better, the hope that this brings, that the Beauty and the Beast is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Tale as Old as Time It Never Gets old.,"Beauty and the Beast in my opinion never gets old! It's always young and magical. I love the characters, animation, music, and story. In the story a Prince gets transformed into a Beast for being selfish towards an enchantress disguised as an old woman. He later falls in love with a girl named Belle who he takes prisoner. His whole household who have also turned into objects from the enchantress also like her hoping that she falls in love with the Beast to break the spell and be human again. My favorite scene in the movie is towards the end when Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) and Cogsworth (David Ogden Siters)argue over who told who that Belle was gonna break the spell. That was funney. I also liked when Gaston told Belle that his little wife (Belle) was going to massage his feet while the little ones (Strapping Boys) played on the floor with the dogs. That was hilarious. Gaston in my opinion was one of the greatest animated villains ever because he's got a lot of comic in him. Filled with great animation, story, characters, and music written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who sadly died of Aids before the film's release) Beauty and the Beast is an animated feature that'll go on forever and ever. I'm glad it's the only animated feature to win an award for Best Picture because I think it really deserved that and I think Walt Disney himself would of been very proud to know of that award. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Simply Charming Film and a True Triumph for Animation.,"When I was younger, this was my favorite film. I remember watching it with my mother in the Theatres when it debut, she was as entranced as I was by the whole thing. The music was delightful, the characters were fun, the animation gorgeous, and the tale simply timeless. However, as I grew older, the true magic of this film began to fade behind walls of cynicism, and it only got worse as I grew older. I completely forgot about this movie over time, until one day, over ten years since the last time I sat down to watch it with my mother, I found my old VHS of ""Beauty and the Beast."" I decided I'd sit down and watch it; after all, all my work for the day was already done. Might as well pop it in as I got ready to hit the sack.I was enthralled by what I saw; this movie is simply delightful. The characters are surprisingly complex for a Disney film. The Romance between the films two main characters is well realized and is achieved with the perfect balance of campiness and subtly, through both small moments which are rather clever, and not exactly something a child would pick up on; and lovely musical numbers in which the characters sing their hearts out to us in true Broadway fashion. This is much preferable to the generic formula of magic kiss/love at first sight we've grown to expect from fairy tales, and the fact that the characters actual have a real relationship with pitfalls adds a lot of appeal for the movie's older audience. In fact, of all Disney's animated films, this one is the most mature. The two primary characters, Belle and the Beast, are wonderfully three dimensional, as is their relationship. Belle, is quite unlike the typical Disney female, in that she seems more womanly and less blandly asexual, and overall is a much better realized character than those Disney heroine's which came before (or after) her. She's quite modernized when compared to Cocteau's version of the story (read: She's a feminist); The idea however is very well realized, and the end result is one of Disney's best characters to date. The same thing could be said of the other films star; The Beast, who also boasts an... um... interesting design.Even the supporting characters are interesting, and quite hilarious, especially the suave-talking Lumiere, his musical number is among the best in the film, and Orbach's performance is fantastic. Unlike many other Disney movies, these supporting characters are well integrated into the film and don't feel like tacky add ons; they have part in the Beast's plight, and try to help him win over Belle for their own benefit. Though they provide fantastic comic relief, they fit into the film well enough that they aren't annoying, unlike some other ""Comic"" relief characters. (Timon & Pumbaa)While the film is an interpretation of an age old story, it's simply so well done that it doesn't seem like another mindless fairy tale simply devised to instill morals into our children. The moral message in this movie while quite obvious, is never stated or ""overdone"", thus increasing it's effectiveness tenfold, and even though the tale is as old as time, Disney's has taken given the story a unique twist, through such additions such as the Handsome villain, Gaston, who just so happens to share all the qualities of a beast, something which deviates from the formula typical of this sort of story. This richness extends to every part of the film; from the romance, to the comedic elements. Unlike so many films which ""appeal"" to all age, the ""children's"" comedy in this movie is never overly stupid, and rather than interject out of place sexual innuendo to appeal to older viewers, the mature comedy in this film is often more involved and poetic (An example would be the comical exaggeration of the films villain, Gaston's manliness in literally every way.), or Belle/The Beast's facial expressions during certain scenes. The comedy fits into the film so well that it never seems contrived at all, which is a welcome change.The films musical score is no doubt one of it's greatest strengths (Though it has no real weaknesses in the first place). The background music is extremely well written and a pleasure to listen too, as are the Broadway numbers. This is no doubt Menken and Ashman's finest work for Disney; there isn't a weak track in the whole bunch. Aesthetically the movie is simply beautiful; the gorgeous hand drawn images don't look the least bit dated, and the colors are vivid and vibrant. The artwork is also incredibly detailed; and the characters faces portray a fast array of emotions throughout the film. Belle herself expresses at least ten different feelings without the use of words, which isn't typical of animation and is once again a prime example of what makes this film a classic.In summation, this movie is well made on all fronts, and cliché as it may sound, the movie truly is a timeless classic that really has that Disney Magic which is so often referenced. In the end, the wonderful characters, beautiful animation, incredible original score and unusually smart scripting come together to create a great film, by any standard. Quite possibly, the greatest animated movie ever created, and I've no doubt that if you give it a watch, you too will fall under it's enchantment.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great by Disney's style!,"The film that officially signaled Disney's animation renaissance (following The Little Mermaid) and the only animated feature to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, Beauty and the Beast remains the yardstick by which all other animated films should be measured. It relates the story of Belle, a bookworm with a dotty inventor for a father; when he inadvertently offends the Beast (a prince whose heart is too hard to love anyone besides himself), Belle boldly takes her father's place, imprisoned in the Beast's gloomy mansion. Naturally, Belle teaches the Beast to love. What makes this such a dazzler, besides the amazingly accomplished animation and the winning coterie of supporting characters (the Beast's mansion is overrun by quipping, dancing household items) is the array of beautiful and hilarious songs by composer Alan Menken and the late, lamented lyricist Howard Ashman. (The title song won the 1991 Best Song Oscar, and Menken's score scored a trophy as well.) The downright funniest song is ""Gaston,"" a lout's paean to himself (including the immortal line, ""I use antlers in all of my De-co-Ra-ting""). ""Be Our Guest"" is transformed into an inspired Busby Berkeley homage. Since Ashman's passing, animated musicals haven't quite reached the same exhilarating level of wit, sophistication, and pure joy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best animated movie ever,The only animated movie to receive the best picture Oscar nomination and indeed it deserved it. The songs are very good and perfect for the scenes.

Unbearable movie,"As a children's movie, this movie fails utterly. It is way too serious, children's movies should have some humour in them, and this one doesn't. The beast is always scary, and never is likeable. And the musical aspect of this movie is just infuriatingly annoying; a Disney feature-length cartoon is to some extent expected be a musical, but they just took that concept way too far in this one, almost every major scene is carried out in song; one bad song after another.I don't know who is giving this movie such high marks, I know it certainly can't be children.

This film captures the true essence of what animation should be.,"From the time we could walk we would all hear about films such as The Little Mermaid or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and how they changed film-making forever. These films helped bring animation to life (Snow White being the first animated film and The Little Mermaid reviving the genre after it had almost died) while there are films which keep it alive. Beauty and the Beast is one of (if not) the best work of animation there has ever been.The story is about a girl named Belle who wants to have a better life than the ordinary one she got stuck with. In the beginning we learn of the prince who got turned into a beast for his heart was cold. And if he couldn't find anyone to love and love him in return before the rose he was given had wilted then him and all of the people who live in the castle (turned into house ware items) would remain the way they were forever. And that is where Belle comes in, as she goes in search for her father who went missing she finds herself at the Beast's castle and her father as well. In exchange for his freedom she would remain there and never leave again or see her loved ones again. So now a chain of events has been set into motion that will determine the fate of the Beast and all who inhabit his castle.Beauty and the Beast is obviously one of the most romantic, funny, charming, and enchanting films ever made. The characters are funny, loving, and beautifully made. The music is perfect along with the animation. Because of the animation we can see many charming characters do things that hasn't been done before in animation. The choreography moves everywhere and leaves us all just wanting more. This film is an instant classic filled with beautiful animation, great choreography, timeless music, and a love story to make your heart melt. Beauty and the Beast is one of the most enchanting films ever made, people will want to watch this over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I love this movie!  (go see it in IMAX!),"I absolutely love this movie.  I have to disagree with some of the people who said not to see it on IMAX...  I saw it on IMAX, and yes, it's more expensive, but I really enjoyed it.  It allowed me to see a lot of details that I didn't notice before, good and bad.  The only bad part was at the end where people are standing still while Belle and the Prince are dancing... but that wasn't a big deal to me.  I thought watching it on IMAX was great, but it's probably better if you've seen the movie before because you'd appreciate it more seeing it on the super-huge screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Film promotes the sensitive male of the 90s,"This timeless fairy tale has been reworked to respond to specific gender preoccupations of the day. Disney's Beauty and the Beast addresses the contest between two types of masculinity, aggressive and gentle, targeting young boys to socialize into the new sensitive male of the 90s. The representation of femininity plays a minor part in the story.Because Disney films are targeted to a younger audience, the sexual implication of the `Beast' is replaced with a coarse, boorish and unrefined type of masculinity. This film is about the socialization of young boys, and the audience learns through textual analysis what behavior the film deems appropriate. The Beast is 11 when he is put under the spell and 21 by the time it is broken, which covers the formative years of the transition from boyhood to manhood. The most obvious lesson he has to learn is to love, and to be good enough to have that love returned. Heterosexual love sets everything right and is the definition of the manhood he has to attain. The rest of the film reads as a transcript of proper behavior, and Lumiere, the dating etiquette expert, is his teacher. The Beast is expected to find more suitable accommodations than the dungeon, walk Belle to her door, say something to fill the awkward space on the trip to her room, and invite her to dinner. As a man, he is expected to control his temper, eat in a civilized manner, and learn gentleness with the birds. In the scene depicting his table manners, Belle switches from the role of date to that of nurturing, instructive mother. Belle recognizes his effort with the spoon and compromises with him by sipping her broth from the bowl. All of the characters have a part in his instruction. Especially informative is the scene when Belle sings about how he was course and unrefined, and now he is dear to her because he is unsure. It is the self consciousness and insecurity, in eating and getting dressed in bows, that sets the Beast apart from Gaston and makes him the ideal 90s (less masculine) man. In fact he has physical prowess but he represses it, and appeals instead to Belle's mind with the library. The film reassures boys that one can be both gentle and manly. The key to winning the girl lays in his evolution; he overcomes his selfishness. The Disney film leaves no room for competing versions of masculinity. Only one would survive; the bad guy dies.Gaston and the Beast are quite similar rivals, analogous in their social worlds. Either the entire town or all of the appliances cheer their respective protagonist. Gaston is beastly as shown by his shadows, bestial shape, and pride that every last inch of him is `covered in hair.' Their fight in the tower marks the emotional high point of the film and is essentially a rivalry between two types of masculinity. The sensitive male that the audience has witnessed evolving, or the 100% pure testosterone laden Gaston who is aggressive, has a thick neck, eats to excess, is not an intellectual (he knocks over a chess table) and is a model to which all those in the village aspire to. Belle drops out of the equation entirely, as the major lesson of the film is the contest between two versions of manhood, with the sensitive male of the 90s the victor.To a lesser degree, the film is also about the new woman of the 90s. Belle is the new heroine that Disney produced, though she is just as skinny and wide eyed as the heroines before her. She does read books, but they are fairy tales and her idea of `something more than this provincial life' is prince charming. She is really not all that intellectual. She does have two physical saving scenes, when the Beast is attacked by wolves, and before he falls off the tower and she catches him. However, overshadowing Disney's attempt to create a modern, liberated woman, Belle ends up faced with a choice that is really no choice at all. She has to get married in the end whether it is to one man or another.Belle simply settles for the best type of masculinity, what she a `new woman' is looking for in a `new man.' She has little choice, since she doesn't like Gaston and she does want to get married. The lesson is that one type of masculinity not only triumphs and survives, but it also gets the girl. It is surprising that a more recent film, after the women's movement, and one self-consciously trying to create a new heroine, actually takes more power out of the female's hands then older versions of the tale. Animations oftentimes reinforces stereotypes, and the `happily ever after' genre conflicts with any real independence Belle could have shown, resulting in no choice other than marriage.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Bad Singing, Bad Pacing, and No Concept of Time. But the Animation is Pretty","Beauty and the Beast follows a woman who, after trading her life for her father's, is imprisoned in the castle of a beast. Ultimately, they fall in love.The animation is beautiful. It's all hand drawn, and it opens with a beautiful scene right away, immersing the audience into the movie without so much as a line of dialogue or anything. And this continues. The animation stays beautiful, and unfortunately that beauty doesn't transfer into the rest of the movie.Before we get into it, I'll also say that most all the voice acting was great. Those who voiced these characters were almost all perfect, and gave just enough to make their characters believable and more interesting.Also, as far as music goes, the instrumental is great. Can't say the same for the lyrical aspect, but the instrumental alone is something I can see myself returning to. It's pleasant and it's fun, and that doesn't tend to be a bad thing. In addition, Paige O'Hara has a lovely voice. Unfortunately she sings no more than twice in the entire movie, but when she does it's a real treat.In continuation of the music, the rest of the cast sucks at singing. It was truly horrible to listen to every lyric, and even worse knowing that these wretched voices were distracting from a beautiful score. I hated listening to every single one, and honestly couldn't wait for them to end. Even when Paige O'Hara sang, she was accompanied by trash singers. As such, most every song is practically unbearable.Earlier I said the voice acting is mostly great. Where does it falter? Paige O'Hara. That's right. The only cast member who can sing can't voice act. She's either overdone or underdone, and she never hits the happy medium that everyone seems to have reached with relative ease. And moreover, her voice just doesn't suit Belle's character. So basically her singing is cancelled out by her acting, and everyone else's acting is cancelled out by their singing. So where does that leave us?The pacing makes no sense. Not that it's boring, it moves rather quickly. Too quickly, actually. So much so that none of the characters receive any real development, and as such none of them are that interesting. And the relationships that form are even worse. The ones that matter aren't focused on enough, and those that aren't as much simply aren't important. And moreover, the timeline of the movie makes no sense. We're left to assume at one point (for example) that either Belle lived in Beast's castle for several days and that another character lived in the woods without food or water for those several days, or that Beast and Belle were together for all of one day and formed a relationship through that, meanwhile the other character runs around the woods. Really? There are plenty of these problems throughout the movie, where logic simply ceases to exist because plot convenience. I get that animations like this were hard to make longer because each panel is hand drawn, but at that point maybe Disney should have just avoided a story requiring development and good pacing.Overall I really didn't enjoy Beauty and the Beast. I know I'm the minority here, but regardless, the perks of this film are cancelled out by it's flaws, and ultimately it settles at being less than average in my eyes. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie. It makes me wonder just how low standards were in 1991 for this to be nominated for Best Picture, or even considered to be a great movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Disney Movies, Just for Kids?","Iv'e heard the comment before and I definitely would never believe it.Classic Disney Films have a certain unbeatable magic that gives you such an emotional feeling if your like me, and I would never say that these movies are just for children.Think about it about 75% of Classic Disney movies (im not talking about the emperor's new groove, Hercules, etc) I'm talking about Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Alladin, The Lion King, Bambi, Snow white, The little Mermaid, and Pochahontas, are all romances (or have a portion of romantic moments.When I was little I loved those movies so much (I grew up a Disney baby I'm now 13) because they were colorful, bright, happy, fun, and magical, but somehow they mean even more to me to this day.Beauty and the Beast has definitely become my favorite Disney film (I also love Aladdin, the lion king, Bambi and the others I mentioned VERY much).It's easy for me to understand now and there's something about Disney that now means so much more to me.It's not just about fairytale princesses and fun animated little objects, Beauty and the Beast is a beautiful tale of romance and acceptance.Showing you that love comes from the heart, not the eyes.I cry every time I watch it because the significance has an amazing effect on me and my entire family.This movie (and many other classic Disney productions) is a masterpiece and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool, this movie is beautiful, original, and very heartwarming so anyone that says Disney films are for children can't appreciate the message they really send out, just because they're animations and not some sick bloody gross-out horror movie or crude sexual comedy or blow up action film, it doesn't make them childish.It makes them meaningful by their stories not their appearance, just like the whole theme of Beauty and the Beast ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A beautiful, timeless Disney masterpiece","If I had to choose only one Disney movie from all that were ever made, this would be the one I guess.The first time i saw this was back when I was a little child, and this movie just hypnotized me. Since then, I grew up and gave up watching animated films to ""harder"" genres, like action, horror, sci-fi etc., but this is one of the few exceptions. The first movie which made me shed a tear (as a boy).The overall story is simple but perfect, a lesson of love, understanding, the ability to make a change inside. The movie has its comical, ironic and bizarre moments, but the main subject is quite deep and it makes you think, makes you feel. The characters are well-written, the story is perfectly built-up, it has all the elements a film for young viewers requires: jokes, singing, suspense, love, happy ending. But all of it is just perfect.And now the technical: the pictures are insanely beautiful, millions of colors, shades, a real drawn masterpiece. Best Picture? Yes please! There's no need to start an elaborate review: just go watch it, it will leave you breathless for sure! Besides the catchy and heartwarming story and the breathtaking animation, the third factor that contributes to the film being a masterpiece is the music. The songs fit the scenes extremely perfect, and some of them will move most of the viewers. The prologue scene with the narration and the instrumental would deserve a prize on its own, as well as the ballroom scene.If you want to show something to your children, or (even as an adult) you feel like you need something different from today's movies, something other than sex, gore and bad language, go ahead and watch this.

"Much grand showing-off, but more magic might have helped...","Young woman sacrifices her own life to save her elderly father from imprisonment by a greatly feared beast, but she's able to tame the creature with charm and they come to love each other. Famous romantic story given opulent Disney-animated treatment, complete with bombastic Broadway-styled musical numbers designed to bowl viewers over with showmanship and sassy humor. Of course it's unfair to compare this colorful package with Jean Cocteau's black-and-white live-action French version, but Cocteau was working with actual sets, costumes and actors and yet was still able to conjure more magical wonders on film than the Disney animators. It's certainly well-made and well-voiced (especially by an undetectable Robby Benson as the Beast), but it takes about 30 minutes for the pacing to pick up (and it does, leading to a nicely directed nick-of-time finish). The editing is gratefully not slambang and the narrative does have the chance to unfold and allow us to get our bearings, but even when the pots and candles and utensils come to life, there's nothing intriguing about the Beast's castle. This Disney enterprise plays it predictably safe. For a movie about curses and magic, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is too uncomplicated and polite.

More Than Meets The Eye,"We all know that animations tend to get overlooked, as many believe that they are directed towards the children audience. Well, in some cases that is true, but this one is anything but. The Lion King is widely considered the best animation of all time, and it certainly is spectacular, but Beauty and the Beast elevates the level of animations to an unprecedented level. To be honest, it doesn't feel like a child's tale at all, with some themes being rather mature (although there is no inappropriate for a child). As with all Disney animations, imagery and symbolism is frequent, but in this case it works flawlessly. Characterization is utterly spectacular, and the characters themselves are perfectly designed. The music is enthralling, and the character songs are once again top notch. While children will certainly enjoy this, adults will be even more astonished at how masterfully crafted this animation is. To this day, it is the only animation to be nominated for Best Picture, and it should have won that as it truly was the best film of the year. Believe me, this movie is that good. If you haven't seen it, do so as soon as possible, because there are only a handful of movies that are actually better than this.

A masterpiece for movie lovers of all ages,"I reluctantly attended the showing of this film with my grandchildren, and sat through the entire movie absolutely mesmerized. Not only does this film retain its charm and appeal throughout every frame, it faithfully expresses the human condition as all great fairy tales were meant to do. While the songs are top notch and energetic, Paige O'Hara's voice is picture perfect as Belle, the girl who doesn't seem to fit in with her surroundings. I was blown away when I discovered it was Robby Benson doing the voice of the Beast, and he is perfectly cast. However, it is the story which kept me in rapt attention. Fully encapsulating Carl Jung's theory of depth psychology, the theme of the movie is psychological wholeness, that every man has an inner female (the anima) and every woman has an inner male (the animus), and that wholeness can never come into fruition until both male and female compliment one another. This isn't the story of two separate individuals, it is the story of one person -- the viewer -- being given the chance to explore their feminine/masculine inner self, and becoming complete. Nominated for Best Picture, it should have won, if not for the dreary nastiness of Silence of the Lambs. Hollywood will never be ready to admit the cartoon is as valid a movie art form as live acting, and that's a shame. Don't miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Be Disney's guest in one of the greatest animated movies of all time; Would Recommend,"Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk WiseStarring Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson and Richard WhiteBeauty and the Beast is both Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise's feature length directorial debut which stars Paige O'Hara in her acting debut as well as seasoned actor Robby Benson. We follow Belle(Paige O'Hara) who substitutes in for her father in a castle prison after he was taken by a mysterious beast. As time goes on, and events unfold, Belle realises the Beast may be more than what he appears to be.Beauty and the Beast is easily one of Disney's most recognisable and treasured classics, and for good reason. It's a visually stunning movie that includes one of the Best Disney songs in existence AND one of the Best Disney Sidekicks. For those reasons alone you must watch this movie and witness a 'tale as old as time' in its full animated glory.The story is exactly what the song suggests('A Tale as Old as Time') but that doesn't make it any less special and any less magical. This movie was released during the Disney Renaissance and is easily one of the Best movies released during that period.Both Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson do fine jobs as Belle and The Beast respectively but its the pure, unfiltered chemistry they share on screen that elevates the characters and makes them so much better. Richard White was great as Gaston and made him a truly iconic, memorable and dastardly Disney villain that ranks among the best. Both Jerry Orbach and David Odgen were great as Lummiere and Cogsworth respectively, and made the characters rival the greatest Disney sidekicks as all time. That is definitely an achievement, especially compared to other movies released during the Disney renaissance. Jesse Corbiti was great as LeFoue. LeFoue is so likable and you just can't help but like him, despite being a villain.From a technical standpoint, the movie is absolutely gorgeous with a very distinct and artistic style. My one flaw with the animation is the background of the Ballroom scene which, in my opinion, doesn't hold up at all.The basic requirements for Disney movies are to deliver good songs, good humour and good characters. The songs and characters are all great but I will say the humour was more directed at children and I laughed once during the movie. That's not to say it removes all enjoyment from the movie(I still love the movie) but having a greater variety of humour would have probably helped.In conclusion, this movie is very enjoyable(and definitely stands as one of the best Disney movies of all time) but I feel it does lack some Disney standards, such as humour which doesn't necessarily ruin the movie but inclusion of would have definitely improved it.9/10Would Recommend",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Masterpiece from Disney,"Beauty and the Beast (1991)**** (out of 4)Disney never technically went away but there was a couple decade period where they were turning out but not great movies. All of that changed in 1991 when BEAUTY AND THE BEAST hit theaters and became a huge success with both critics and fans. It's hard to believe that we're now celebrating its 25th Anniversary but there's no question that it remains one of the studio's greatest pictures.I would argue that the 1946 version is the greatest that has ever been filmed but this Disney one is certainly right up there with it and I'd argue that you could also place it among the all-time greats that the studio ever released. What is so remarkable about the picture is that they really got everything right. From the beautiful animation to the catchy songs and the terrific cast of characters, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has a timeless story and everything works out perfectly.I really think the characters is what makes the film so special and it's the main reason why it has survived all of these years. The Belle and Beast characters are both extremely likable and you can't help but root for them to find happiness. You've got the love interest all there but we're also given a terrific villain and one of those ""ugly people hiding under beautiful looks"" that the studio was so great at. Then you've got the magical castle full of terrific characters who just help give the film an undeniable charm.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST also features some of the greatest animation that Disney ever did. I really loved the look at the Beast and the various details in his body and face. The castle looked terrific and had a certain menace to it. Then, of course, you've got the beautiful looking colors of the opening sequence that just leaps off the screen. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is certainly a masterpiece for the studio and one that hasn't lost anything over the years.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beauty is found within:),"'Beauty and the Beast' truly is a wonderful ""Tale as old as time"", that enchants audiences to this day with a terrific Disney classic.1. The story itself is adapted from the classic French fairy-tale of the same name, but of course things are modified to fit Disney's interpretation. Some of the best things include the wonderful added characters to the tale; Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts and of course the adorable Chip. Although not included in the original tale, Gaston is by far a fantastic addition and perfect villain for the film. He is the complete opposite of the Beast, who is hideous on the outside yet has a heart of gold and kind soul within, unlike Gaston who is beyond handsome on the outside, yet ugly and cruel within.2. The focal point of the entire film, is of course the beautiful Belle (Paige O'Hara) and the Beast (Robby Benson) himself. Disney's infamous animator Glenn Keane does an exceptional job creating the Beast. He is impressively combined with other animals to fit his build, such as; the arms and body of a Bear, the legs and tail of a Wolf, the mane of a Lion, the tusks of a Boar, the sloping head and horns of a Bison and the eyebrows and expressive eyes of a Gorilla. You can't help but fall in love with Belle, due to how humble and caring of a young woman she is. Hence the reason she's the undeniable Beauty who tames the angry Beast.3. As with most Disney animated films, the musical score and numbers are simply incredible. Disney veteran Alan Menken, is responsible for the wonderful musical compositions heard in the film. The two most outstanding numbers are; 'Be Our Guest' and of course the forever classic 'Beauty and the Beast'. The latter song (sung by the talented Angela Lansbury) is first heard in the incredible ballroom dance sequence. Back in 1991, the visual animation in this film was by far ahead of it's time, the ballroom in particular. The 3D version of the film is highly recommended since it emphasizes (even more) the gorgeous imagery.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a directorial job of sheer perfection. Everything about this film works on all levels, and I dare anyone to find a single thing wrong. My only regret is that Walt Disney himself passed away before this wonderful tale was released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This film truly is a beauty,"Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film. The animation is beautiful, the emotional power is huge, the writing is great, the characters are memorable, the songs are all classics, and when I say this is one of Disney's best I really do mean that when I think of the best Disney film I think of this a lot. It moves along at a perfect pace. It never moves to fast, and never feels slow. Voice acting all around is really good. Jokes do work really well in the film too. I love ""The Hunchback"", but I thoughts its main flaw was that the one comedic gargoyle always took away so much drama in the dramatic moments. In this they have comedic moments that don't take anything at all away from the drama. The jokes also are nice. The Beauty and the Beast is a true masterpiece classic.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney ruined this movie,"This movie was amazing before they changed it. The movie was updated for some reason. It looks different and voices are different than they were before. It's not the same. It looks like some lame cartoon. I don't even wanna watch it anymore. I turned it on to watch it, and I realized the way it looked and turned it right off. The point was to watch it. It looked romantic and old-fashioned. It was made a long time ago. Don't remake it. That's weird, especially for people that have seen it before like adults.

A great Disney classic animated film!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear.

In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do!

"Spectacularly beautiful, if anachronistic.","It's hard to imagine a more delightful telling of a fairy tale. Sure, there are some anachronisms, but this is fantasy: clocks did not exist until the Renaissance, and modern eating utensils (knives, forks and spoons) are decidely not medieval. Above all, Belle is a feminist and a bookworm, two rarities of the Middle Ages, and above all a person more sophisticated and mature than the typical denizen of the Middle Ages. Then again, so is the curse that turns the Prince into the Beast...Characters are well-defined. We see Gaston, the rival for Belle's affection, a man who could supposedly have any woman of his choosing and can't appreciate his pretty toadies, as a crude, boastful, male-chauvinist pig and as an organizer of mob violence against The Beast.Disney's trademark anthropomorphism of animals and even such objects as plates, candles, knives, forks, and spoons reaches the zenith in ""Be Our Guest"", a dance sequence that would have put Busby Berkeley to shame, to music reminiscent of the first movement of Mahler's Third Symphony. (If you don't know who Gustav Mahler was, he was merely the greatest symphonist since Beethoven).Realistic? No -- it's a fairy tale, one very much in the canon.  The best-established fairy tales have lives of their own. An absolute must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

things totally change after you see Cocteau's version,"I saw ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the theaters in 1991 and just interpreted it as a nice Disney movie. I now see that it started what seems to be a trend in animated features: the villain has a doofus sidekick. And ever since I saw Jean Cocteau's version earlier this year, it's been hard to take this one very seriously (his version seemed to be commentary on the very idea of fairy tales). To me at least, the main redeeming quality here is that ""The Simpsons"" spoofed ""Be Our Guest"" as ""See My Vest"", as Mr. Burns boasts of his clothes being made out of animals.As for other things, it's surprising to see that Jerry Orbach was Lumiere's voice. I mean, who would ever imagine the ""Law and Order"" guy lending his voice to a Disney movie? Ditto David Ogden Stiers. Angela Lansbury is the only one who doesn't surprise me here, her roles in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Harlow"" notwithstanding.So, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is OK for some brief entertainment, but it is a Disney movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Should've won best picture.,"best movie period. first to be nominated for Oscars as a animmated film. thats awesome. trying to fill up 10 lines of space. yadiyadiyadiyadi.Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated musical-fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. The 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and the third film of the Disney Renaissance period, the film is based on the fairy tale La Belle et la Bête by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont[4] and uses some ideas from the 1946 film of the same name.[5] The film centers around a prince who is transformed into a Beast and a young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, the Beast must love Belle and win her love in return, or he will remain a Beast forever. The film's animation screenplay was written by Linda Woolverton with story written by Roger Allers, Brenda Chapman, Chris Sanders, Burny Mattinson, Kevin Harkey, Brian Pimental, Bruce Woodside, Joe Ranft, Tom Ellery, Kelly Ashbury, and Robert Lence, directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and produced by Don Hahn. The music of the film was composed by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, both of whom had written the music and songs for Disney's The Little Mermaid. Beauty and the Beast was released on November 13, 1991. The film was a significant commercial and critical success during its initial release, and has now earned $418 million in box office earnings throughout the world as of January 2012. Beauty and the Beast was also nominated for several awards, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, with two other awards for its music. Famously, Beauty and the Beast was the first ever animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and was the only animated film to hold this honor until 2009, when the Academy Awards switched from 5 Best Picture nominations to 10, and Pixar's animated film Up was nominated. Beauty and the Beast received a total of six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and three nominations for its song. It ended up winning two, for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for the song ""Beauty and the Beast"". A direct-to-video midquel called Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas was released in 1997. It was followed in 1998 by another midquel, Belle's Magical World, and later by a stage production of the same name and a television spin-off series, Sing Me a Story with Belle. An IMAX special edition version of the original film was released in 2002, with a new five-minute musical sequence included. After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, the film returned to theaters in 3-D on January 13, 2012.[6]",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great music and fun simplified story,"A rich and powerful prince dismissed a beggar who turned out to be an enchantress. She turns him into a Beast unless he can learn to love another and earn her love in return before his 21st year. Or else he shall live as the Beast for all times. Belle lives a quiet life in a small provincial town. She's a bookworm fighting off the advances of the conceited arrogant Gaston. Her father is a struggling inventor. He gets lost taking a shortcut to the fair. He seeks shelter from the wolves in the Beast's castle but he's taken prisoner. Belle comes looking for her father and offers to take his place.The songs are catchy and the story has been simplified. There are great animated characters. The film makes some great choices. It starts with the great song from Belle. There are at least 3 great songs when most of the time, two would be amazing for any movie. The simplification of Belle's home life is probably for the best. It leaves more room for the romance between Belle and the Beast. It also gives a great opportunity for these terrific fun characters in the castle. The animation is terrific with a good use of early CGI. It is one of the icons of Disney animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Winner This Time For Disney,"This was a well-done Walt Disney animated movie.

The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little ""teacup"" is the cutest of the characters.The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's Beauty and the Beast is still the most enchanted of their animated fairy tales,"Just rewatched Beauty and the Beast with my movie theatre-working friend at where he works. This was actually my first time seeing it on the big screen and in 3-D, to boot! What can I say except after 20 years, it's still one of the most wonderful of the animated Disney fairy tales to be depicted in movies. No wonder it was the first of its kind to be nominated an Oscar for Best Picture. And the songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman like ""Belle"", ""Be Our Guest"", and the title song were also worthy of the nominations with the last one deserving of the win. And those voices, ah, what voices! I mean, Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts) just make the picture perfect with their line readings and singing. The last one, especially, when singing the already mentioned title song which would also be lovingly rendered by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson during the end credits. Really, all I'll say now is Beauty and the Beast gets a very high recommendation from me. P.S. I also loved the dedication at the very end ""To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A classic Disney film,Disney continued their 90's revival with this lovely film that really does highlight all the elements that make Disney films so great. It is one that clearly caught the imagination of people the world over and that is why we've had a couple of inevitable spin-offs and 3D re-releases. It also of course is the basis of the hit musical.With great voice talent and lovely songs this film can be enjoyed by all the family.

A True Musical,"It's interesting that for a time, the best music written for the stage was being introduced in animated features, mostly by Disney. This is one of the best and it translated well to Broadway. From the opening sequence of Belle, with her strong character, to the dancing household items at the Beast's castle, this has got to be one of Disney's finest productions. It has heart and soul. It has Gaston, a great villain, with a great song bearing his name. He is the epitome of male chauvinism. It is remindful of Miles Gloriosus in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum."" The fairy tale plays itself out with delightful pacing. The beast is a complex being who has a second chance for rebirth and reconciliation. That there are forces in the universe makes this a positive film. The scare factor is there as well, with the thorny forest of the Beast, providing a barrier to all who dare enter. It shows that love can be easy, but true love without sacrifice is empty. Until the Beast knows this his lot will continue on. The songs are complex and varied, some of the best every. All the characters have purpose. This is an outstanding film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"""Beauty And The Beast "" is Disney animation at its best.","In a time where hand-drawn animation is a thing of the past and computer animation is the dominant form of art, it is necessary to reminisce to a time when Disney animation was at its peak instead of at the sorry state it is in now. Beauty and the Beast retains the charm and elegance of the old Disney films such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Peter Pan. If anything, the music is phenomenal, often being hailed as the cartoon Broadway musical. Songs such as ""Be Our Guest"" are brimming with soaring string melodies and punchy brass chords, while the latter song even provides operatic aria vocal talents if listened to closely enough. ""Battle On The Tower"" is possibly the best form of orchestration from any Disney film ever, capturing the dramatic urgency of the final battle between the beast and Gaston as well as the humour of the animated characters. Apart from the music, the characters are naturally funny, likable and charming. In particular, the voice talents of Angela Lansbury create a comforting,touching, motherly atmosphere as Mrs Potts in the film's most moving musical number, ""Beauty And The Beast"". Even Gaston is almost a comical caricature of the baddie, creating moments of humour with his arrogant and hilariously naive belief that Belle will be his wife. The charming nature of the characters is a far cry from the characters in recent cinematic features (such as Chicken Little) where the writers are almost trying to make the characters funny and faltering embarrassingly. There doesn't seem to be the natural ""charm"" present in Disney films anymore. Rather, children seem to be interested solely in the modern visual representation of things, with Home On The Range being the last hand-drawn animated effort from Disney. Disney is now trying to ""wow"" youngsters with impressive special effects rather than trying to tug on their heartstrings, and not always with success (remember Treasure Planet?). Furthermore, Disney is trying to aim their films towards kids more and more and so there is not the ""family entertainment"" factor anymore. Beauty And The Beast seems to provide humour for the children with animated characters such as Cogsworth and lumiere, while the love triangle between Gaston, Belle and the Beast provides humour for the adults (in particular, Gaston's arrogance and chauvinistic view towards women, while appalling on some levels, does provide light adult humour). In contrast, the recent film ""Chicken Little"" may have used some form of humour for adults but was yet too juvenile to be enjoyed by an adult audience. It now appears that adults are taking their kids to the cinema for their kids and not for the whole family anymore. There are some advantages to modern Disney cinema; the computer animation is spectacular and Disney must also pertain to the times. With more and more computer games around, kids want to see computer animation more and more in films; Disney are simply trying to serve a modern audience. The sad thing about this is that Disney films now seem to lack the rich deep colours present in ""Beauty And The Beast"" to accommodate a warm, rich, deeply satisfying and charming cinematic experience. Disney computer animation seems somewhat colder and as such the humour and characters seem cold. What a shame that the new generation of Disney fans will only be fed visually rather than through the soul with the charm and poignancy of Disney at its best; Beauty and The Beast.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
a true classic masterpiece from Disney.....the old times were great.,"This is an animated film that stands the test of time. Even now, it still is as magical and enchanting as it was when I was a kid, and the reason it works so well is its simplicity and witty humour, unlike the animated films nowadays which rely too much on forced slapstick humour without any real heart into it (Shrek an exception). The animation is superb, the voice acting done brilliantly and the storyline captivating, exploring the theme of love and being able to change for someone because of it.This is a film future generations of kids should watch and cherish, giving them a true sense of magic and wonderment.

"This Should Have Won Best Picture, And Not Just Get Nominated.","In the 70s and 80s, Disney's animated movies were considered good but not at the quality of Walt's features. To give you an example, The Rescuers and The Black Cauldron were not on par with Snow White and Cinderella. Even critics did not like these as much as their predecessors.Then in 1989, a game changer came out-and that film was The Little Mermaid. From then, a ""Disney Renaissance"" was born, and Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King proceeded.While I haven't seen some of these in a while, I love Beauty and the Beast the most. After Hunchback, this is my next favorite Disney movie. In fact, it was my favorite movie when I was 17, and I had a brief obsession with it then.Anyways, it's clear that this movie has been beloved by many for the last 29 years. In fact, it's quite surprising if you haven't seen this movie, since it's such a classic.If you live under a rock and have never seen or heard of this movie, it's about a bibliophile named Belle, who is rejected by everyone in her town for how strange she is, except for a snobbish and selfish man named Gaston, which SHE rejects not only as a date, but as a husband.Her father is later locked away by a beast-a prince who's castle is cursed for his own selfish heart, and Belle takes his place and lives with the beast. Then they must love each other before a rose fully wilts to break the castle's spell.This is simply one of Disney's finest movies. One reason why is how beautiful the animation is. Take the Be Our Guest scene. With the colors, it's a gorgeous sight. From the food, to the dishes, to the setting, the musical number is astonishing. Forks are even animated to kick-line near the end of that song!Another beautiful musical number is the title sharing Beauty and the Beast, which was drawn to look like a real camera was filming the 2 of them dance. That is much more impressive when you are an adult!Even non-musical parts can be awe-inspiring, like the Beast becoming human again. Every shot, every scene, and every part of Beauty and the Beast is simply gorgeous. As an animated film, it's perfection.This movie was so acclaimed when it came out that it made history in the Oscars. In 1992, it became the very first animated movie ever to get nominated for Best Picture. Let me re-phrase that: Hollywood said that this animated movie was among the best movies of the year, along with the live action ones!This was the only animated feature to do this for 18 years, then Up was nominated for 2009 and Toy Story 3 was nominated a year later. Sadly, they all lost. In fact, back to BATB, it ended up losing to...of all movies...THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!Don't get me wrong, SOTL is not a bad movie, but this movie is so much better. Being animated aside, it's a great love story and musical, and it was a bigger box office success than Lambs. Therefore, BATB had more Oscar qualities. It's a travesty that it lost to a movie about a cannibal.I have given Beauty and the Beast lots of praise, and I could give it more. As an animated movie, or movie in general, it's a masterpiece. No matter if you are young or old, this is a movie to always cherish. This ""tale as old as time"" will forever be timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

In my opinion, this piece of magic is the very best that cinema has ever offered us.I was not a big fan of animated movies at all before I watched this movie. I found them to be childish, shallow, and detached. However, as I walked dizzily out of the theater for Beauty and the Beast, I was struck immediately with the sense that I had just watched the greatest spectacle of all-time. It usually takes me a good 2-3 days after I watch a movie to really appreciate it. I appreciated THIS movie even before the end credits showed up.Never before have I seen a movie so many times...28 times and counting. To me, this defines perfection in movies. There is no movie to date that can match B&B's splendor, from the beautiful music to the breath-taking animation, this film is chock-full of emotions.

The animation is choppy at best and flat out random images flashing on the screen at worst. It's so bad at times it will give you a headache.  In the fight scene with the Beast and the wolves, all you saw were flashes of the Beast's body parts with wolves appearing and disappearing at random.  It's like watching TV with your nose only an inch from the screen.  What you can see is the lack of detail in the characters and almost monochrome appearance to all of the colors in the characters(i.e. all of the colors appear as a single shade there are no gradients).

I like Belle because she loves reading and doesn't want to marry Gaston, that stupid boaster who doesn't have any manners. I really can't bear the scene in which Gaston ""helps Maurice out"" of the tavern. When I saw the film for the first time, I had to confess that hearing the Beast's voice really frightened me although I knew no-one needs to be afraid of him.

Visually stunning and with a fantastic score, it deserved the 'Best Picture' Oscar for which it was nominated. The high point? That unbelievable ballroom scene, where the beautiful title song and some clever computer animation combine to make me cry every time I see it.Altogether a great movie for romantics everywhere.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Arguably Disney's best animated film,"Rating10/10One of Disney's greatest achievements and one of the all time great animations. Nearly every frame feels lovingly crafted, the songs are tremendous and the animation holds up after all these years. There is hardly any superfluous scene. Belle is given prominence in a strong role. the macho villain gets his own song. The beast is interestingly drawn and works well on the screen. Despite the scenes in the castle being obviously inspired from the Cocteau classic this film feels fresh. One can feel the romance in the passionate romantic title track and the climactic embrace is heartfelt.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A True Disney classic,","Beauty And The Beast is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. It's an absolute classic, and it became one almost immediately, it's one of Walt Disney Animations greatest films and it still holds up today as a movie that is both beautifully animated and has an inspired story. I felt like the film could have shown us more of Beast's origins, it describes it at the beginning very quickly, it should have jumped in to this back story more seriously and shown us how Prince Adam turned in to this beast, I would have also liked to see how this effected characters such as Lumiere and Cogsworth. The characters is in this film are terrific and are some of Disney's most memorable, Belle and Beast are great of course, but the stars of this movie for me are the talking cutlery, I love the movement and voice-over work of Lumiere, Cogsworth, Chip and Mrs Pott, and whenever I watch this they are always what I look forward to the most. Outstanding animation and voice cast, beautiful music numbers and a breathtaking story, Beauty and the Beast is fun for all ages and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.A woman is trapped away in a castle with a prince who has turned into a beast, after a relationship begins to develop between the two, it looks as if the curse could finally be lifted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Enchanting with beautiful Music, and Develpoed with an Emotional Story of Love & Darkness, this Disney Classic stands out Perfectly","This Disney classic is truly one of the most darkest but most loving films I have every seen. I don't want to say to much cause we all know that this film is very impressive no matter what level it's on.A young prince is rude to an old lady who's trying to get out of the cold. He rejects her again and she turns into a beautiful princess (Godest) and then she transforms him into a Beast and he must have love in his heart and he must learn to love another. The other person (who is the gorgeous Belle) must love the Beast. The Beast looses all faith and keeps himself in his black, darken castle for many years.Maurice then goes to the fair and gets lost in the woods and then Belle (who is the daughter of Maurice) goes out to look for him and ends up being a prisoner instead of her father. As the film progresses on, the Beast & Belle end up falling in love and we do have a magical ending.i can't on how much I love this film. I think there where two sequels and they both sucked a lot of ass. The 1991 classic has a deep, emotional, loving story, characters are great, the settings are awesome and the music score of coarse is done well with both the themes of passion and darkness.After the Lion King, this would be my second favorite.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The story is just... stupid with ridiculous thing after ridiculous thing... awful characters doing nonsensical (contrary to their characters) things just to advance the plot, a dumb plot by the way.In the end, all the bad I found could've been saved by the music and a great ending... and yet the ending just betrays the ""messages"" of the story in my opinion and the music.... my God is bad. Every single song is either boring... bad or boring and bad.I hated it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"An Absorbing, Magical Piece of Art","I, like several others, grew up with films like this as a child, and this was one of those that always stood out. When I first saw it I was about five and I think you can tell that a few of the scenes scared me quite a bit, given the Beast's anger-filled scenes with the darker parts of the film. But seeing the film again for the first time in over ten years it was both refreshing and easy to still remember.The story, style and execution all feel like something out of a Shakespearean play, and while I've never been much of a fan of old William I do tend to like other stories that have similar styles to him, which I will admit to being both a testament to this film and Shakespeare. One of the film's strongest points is that it easily manages to make several emotions arise out of the viewer, ranging from laughter to sorrow and several others (with a fair number of these instances coming out of the most briefest of scenes, a very rare case for any film). There are several scenes in the film that are both serious and dark with others that are light and funny; it seems that for every serious moment there's a scene of clever comic relief to balance the mood out.While I was certainly curious and excited to see this film once again now that I would understand it much easier, one part that I wasn't looking forward to were the singing sections, with me not being a fan of musicals. There actually wasn't as much singing in the film as I remember, I'd say about 40% to 50% of the movie is singing with the rest being dialogue. Even though I can't say that the songs were exactly necessary to the film they do compliment the given scenes very well and while this may be the case with any musical film, the singing sections of this film give it a personality in a positive way, unlike several others.If there was any word I could really use to describe this film it would likely be ironic, not due to anything in the movie itself but more how it compares to others. What's ironic is that this film has a heart and the characters, despite being computer animations and creations with little visual detail (compared to the CGI-heavy films by companies like Pixar) and half the characters being enchanted utensils they still come off as far more human than countless actors in several live action films. Heck, even the Beast comes off as one of the more human characters once his inner feelings and emotions start to come out. If it's not clear by now, the voice-acting in this film is simply superb and, along with the film's beautiful and magical art style is probably its strongest point.Of course that's not to say every other aspect is any less worthy of praise, because this film is one that almost feels like no number of compliments would be enough to justify it. The story, style, acting, score, music, pacing and really every other aspect you could pinpoint in this film are nothing short of superb. If there really is anything that I could say holds the film from perfection it would be that the ending feels rather rushed. While there really isn't much more they probably could've done with the last five minutes beyond what there was it still felt like it went by rather quickly compared to the rest of the film.But this is really the smallest of complaints and something that really does little to detract from the film. When you hear someone say that this is a film for all ages, they're not lying, anyone of any age can love and appreciate this film with ease. This film, along with a number of others, show that Disney were truly at their best before 21st century. With the exception of maybe Pinocchio and The Lion King I can't think of any other film with the same style and genre that is as magical and marvelous as this. If you haven't seen this film in a while or at all and are struggling to find a good film for the whole family, be sure you keep your eye out for this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Best Disney Movie Ever!,"Introduction:If you ask most people, their favorite Disney film is ""The Lion King"". Well, my favorite is ""Beauty and the Beast"". Because it was really my introduction to this company. And for a kids film, it has what is still one of the best romances in film history.The Story & Characters:The story of Beauty and the Beast is based on a fairy tale that follows a girl named, Belle. Who turns herself in as a prisoner of the Beast. After her father stumbles upon and angers him.And both the Beast and Belle are two of the best characters to come out of Disney. The Beast is a man who feels great rage and pain, and is kind of an outcast, after being turned into a monster, however, under all of that anger lies a good, kind person. And Belle sees that, as she is a bit of an outcast herself, very different from everyone else in her town. Exemplified by the fact that she's the only one that wears the color blue.And steadily, over the course of the film, grow closer to each other, the film taking it's time, and never rushing. This is one of the best romances in movie history.Gaston is also a descent villain, as he wants to marry Belle, because she is the most beautiful woman in town. And it would help his inflated ego. He also has a great song.And for that matter, all the songs are great, from ""Be Our Guest"", to ""Gaston"", to ""Beauty and the Beast"", all the songs are memorable and help in telling the narrative a creative way.My only issue is some of the world building that doesn't add up. The pots and pans that are alive, really raise a lot of weird questions. Like, ""If one of the tea cups is eight years old, and the curse lasted 10 years, how was he born?"" and other questions like that. It's not a big issue, and it's a fairy tale after all, so I really don't care. However, even with that small issue, I think this is the best fairy tale adaptation of all time.The Animation:Beautiful, the way that they are able to animate the expression on their faces, and the way the world is animated so well. The colors pop off the screen, and every frame of this film looks so beautiful is drawn so well. And while it may look like average Disney animation. It's still damn good animation.Conclusion:This is an excellent movie. Easily the best of Disney animation, and without a doubt one of my top 3 favorite animated pictures. Great romance, great drama, great animation, and a great film. What else can I say? It's a classic, it more than deserved it's Best Picture nomination, and more than deserving of all kinds of praise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Quite possibly the most beautiful love story ever told.,"An absolutely beautiful movie.  By far the greatest Disney opus ever made.

Clever but Clumsy,"Having one of the better female protagonists, 'Beauty and the Beast' sits in a golden era for Disney films. The overall conception of the movie is good and the animations, especially facial, are terrific.Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson do their lines well, although there is a posh tinge to it that doesn't quite work.The main criticism is with the darkness of the movie, in particular its first act. The pace is incredibly plodding and the introduction to the sets are unspectacular and boring.Another big problem is with the villain Gaston. He barely qualifies as a villain, instead being a chaotic neutral idiot who acts with very little information just because he wants to own the woman who he fancies - it's paperthin, cheap and unwieldly.The songs this time around are also rather middling, feeling more like padding than actual character development.Its strengths lie in the progression of the main relationships and the secondary characters who are funny and portrayed with charm.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Tale as old as time,"A rude Prince refuses a poor elderly woman's present of a rose, and he is cursed to look like an animal, until he shares love with a woman, and if he doesn't make it before his 21st birthday, his appearance will never change back. When he finds a man trespassing in his castle(seeking shelter from the weather and the pack of wolves that always seem to hang around right outside the gate), he locks him up in his prison. The daughter finds out about this, and offers herself in his place. Belle is beautiful and could have anyone in her village for a husband, but she loves books, doesn't want to settle down, and wants adventure(...yeah, she does come off slightly ingrateful for the quite nice life she has for herself, anyway, she's interesting). Meanwhile, Gaston, the best and most handsome hunter around wants to marry her, which she isn't open to. The main theme explored here is, of course, that one should look underneath and not judge superficially. And as such, aforementioned Zapp Branigan type would be the hero in any other Disney piece. He isn't even really the villain right away. He doesn't look like a monster, his behavior makes him one. And the opposite is true(at least in time), of Beast(albeit his manners and temper need work), who is treated to a magnificent design, that allows him to be terrifying as well as express insecurity. That goes for his voice, as well, which is pitch perfect(literally). The underlying softness to it is fantastic. This keeps to a great pace, the plot is moving, characters are developed, things are never standing still(and humor is injected all over, without it costing(much) dramatic effect... whether you find it funny is like with much else from this studio, and for family films, a lot of it is for, or at least meant to also work for, kids). It's genuinely exciting and you want to know what happens next. The moral lesson is present without it being preachy, and it comes across rather well. Roles are all well-cast. This is a musical, and the songs can be pretty catchy. The dialog is good. This is animated well and with passion and energy. There aren't a lot of negatives. I would argue that LeFou doesn't look like he belongs, he's too cartoony among all these realistic-looking humans. There are the usual points about fairie tales and the conventions belonging to the genre. As an example, the romance is out of necessity, first and foremost(the magic has to be reversed, and within a set amount of time), as relationships tended to be back when this was originally conceived(hundreds of years ago, not the development of this interpretation). I personally can't help notice the disturbing(and not the only thing in this that is, either) nature of all the living furniture. If you drink from the living mugs, are you kissing the people they used to be? What if a plate is dropped on the floor, does that kill the person it is? And in the sequences where there are hints of hundreds of items that are alive, do they just sit around doing absolutely nothing when not being eaten out of or the like? Does the bottom cup in the pile get a bad back from the weight of the others? These are questions that shouldn't be asked, of course(and then one can choose to apply psychology, and wonder if this is a case of Stockholm Syndrome). I think a bigger issue is the timeline... from what happens in the small town, it comes off as this all happening over two, maybe three days. Is that really long enough for all that takes place in the fortress? Still, these are not big enough problems to take away from this being a remarkable piece, that hasn't aged a day in 20 years. The Diamond Edition 2-Disc DVD set comes with an amusing and informational commentary(with directors, composer, producer), a Sing-Along track, the well-done, tightly edited and compelling(somehow, the special features garner far more laughs than the flick itself) documentaries Beyond Beauty(51 minutes, it goes into the people who created this), The Story Behind The Story(26 minutes, and since it has its own page here on the site, I will be reviewing it there), Composing A Classic(19 and a half minutes), ""animation""(13 and a half minutes), Broadway Beginnings(12 and a half minutes), deleted scenes(27 minutes, the first two thirds of which completely change the approach and render it darker), deleted song(7 minutes, and 1 and a half minutes intro), alternate version: ""be our guest""(5 minutes), 2 music videos(3 and a half minutes and 4 and a half minutes), early presentation reel(3 minutes), 4 TV spots(2 minutes), camera move test(2 minutes), alternate score: the transformation(2 minutes), games(Simon, and a personality test), Trailers(Tangled, Toy Story 3, A Christmas Carol, Hannah Montana Forever, Bambi, two for this(4 and a half minutes total, with intro by Don Hahn)) and a promo for BluRay. I recommend this to essentially everyone, as almost anyone will be entertained, engaged and endeared. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Awesome movie,"I probably never would have seen this movie if my mother hadn't persuaded me to take my little brother to see it. I enjoyed it a lot the first time, but it was only when I saw it again a couple of years later on video I realised just how superb a movie it is. It's not a clever or complex movie, it's not the kind of film which works on an adult level as well as on a children's one. However, three aspects of it make it truly great: 1: The music. Beauty and the Beast' richly deserved its Oscar, but 'Part Of Your World' deserved it even more.2. The animation. Quite simply, it's absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes in particular take your breath away.3. The Story. How can you resist a love story that touching?

Tale as old as time,"Song as old as rhyme. In a way that's the perfect way to sum up this film. In many ways the magnum opus of the Disney Animation Studios. The first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Picture category, still considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, a classic beloved by children and adults alike, a timeless tale about hatred turned into love, love twisted into hatred, about redemption, determination, sacrifice and willpower. An all-around good film, easily one of my favourite Disney films, and one of my favourite films in general.You all know the story. You know Belle, Beast, Gaston, Lumière, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts. You know the songs, the castle, the quiet French village. You know about the rose and the mirror, about the curse. You've all seen this movie already. And if for some baffling reason you haven't, you probably still know how the story goes. So I'm not going to talk about that. It's a great story, one of the best. That's all you need to know.Instead, let me talk about what this movie has taught me. Belle taught me about being different, about being the odd one in a crowd. She taught me that it's okay to read, to dream, to stand up against the opinion of the many. Beast taught me about the importance of what's inside. He taught me that no matter who we are or what we look like or where we come from, it's what we do, how we act, how we treat others, that matters. Gaston taught me about the meaninglessness of public opinion. His popularity taught me that I had to make my own choices, that leaders are fallible, that good looks can hide twisted morals and empty souls. The servants of the castle taught me about loyalty. Maurice, Belle's father, taught me about not giving up. Belle and Beast together taught me about love. Their romance is considered to be one of Disney's finest for a reason.Beauty and the Beast, to me, is one of those perfect films. Yes, you can nitpick and say, for example, that the CGI effects have aged a little bit in certain scenes. But what truly matters is the quality of the story. And I adore this story. It shaped me, as a child. It helped me grow into a better man, a better human being. And for that it has my eternal gratitude, respect and love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A genuine, bona fide animation masterpiece","BEAUTY AND THE BEASTAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo(35mm and 70mm release prints)An unfulfilled country girl (voiced by Broadway star Paige O'Hara) falls in love with the owner of an enchanted castle (Robby Benson), a handsome prince transformed by witchcraft into a monstrous Beast...Produced in the wake of Disney's smash-hit THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) and helmed by debut animation directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST combines animated spectacle with vivid characterizations and exuberant musical numbers in a confection which ranks alongside the very finest 'golden age' Disney classics. Returning to the European folk tales which inspired many of their earlier animated features (SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, etc.), scenarist Linda Woolverton leavens the essential romantic core of the film with exciting set-pieces and well-judged comic relief, and there are several stand-out sequences, designed and executed with breathtaking flair: A terrifying battle between the Beast and a pack of wolves; the spectacular and life-affirming 'Be Our Guest' number (voiced with remarkable dexterity by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury); and the climactic assault on the castle, all of which are guaranteed to impress audiences young and old. The film - which is dedicated to the memory of co-songwriter Howard Ashman, who died before the film premiered in 1991 - was subsequently adapted to great acclaim for the Broadway stage, only to be sullied by an unnecessary TV series and a number of direct-to-video sequels.

Live your own fairy tale,"Belle is a young woman who has arrived at that age where budding dreams and fantasies begin to well up inside her young heart and yearn for a form of release.  The world of the small French town where she lives revolves around the dreary hustle and bustle of everyday life, with the fate of woman's domestic life waiting to entrap her.  She alienates herself from her fellow townspeople with her quirky and aloof nature, and instead transmutes her desire for escape into a love for books.  We see her passionately singing to a passing herd of sheep of her adoration for tales of romance and adventure, yet later when she sits alone in her house feelings of loneliness and depression begin to surface.Despite the importance literature holds in her heart, the film develops the theme of going out and living your own adventure.  This message really strikes home in the closing scene of the movie, when an image of Belle and the Prince transfigures into artwork in a stained glass window, a grand gesture of how this small-town girl with big dreams has changed into a symbol of fantasy and magic that captured in the art of the stained glass attains a sense of immortality and truth.  I think it is important in this sense to realize that both Beauty and the Beast undergo their own separate form of transformation.The Beast is somewhat underdeveloped, for we never really learn much about him other than that behind the rough, animal facade is something warm and benevolent that Belle brings to life.  We learn more about him through his actions, rather than through dialogue or song, yet there are certain moments in the film, such as when Beast decides to let Belle go, when the magic of the animators really shines.  Beast has the largest, most expressive face of all the characters in the film, and the animation team really brings it to life.  After he transforms, though, he becomes just another pretty blonde face, which has a subtle resemblance to Aladdin (a later Disney character).Enjoy the film, then go out and live your own fairy tale.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

One of Disney's masterpieces of Animation films,"Beauty And The Beast is one of those films I saw in the 90s and often times during school back when we were allow to watch movies in school if we did well.Anyhow the 1990s were a good decade for animation films and from Disney it was nearly always going to be a promising motion picture. Beauty and the Beast is the third film in the Disney Renaissance series and it is praise for a lot of reasons.For one thing the movie feels like you're watching a play the animators and cast gave us the impression that they set it up like you would be watching a Broadway show and looking at it now I say it is very clever.The animation in this film remains one of my favorites in any animation films because they really did a wonderful job with the backgrounds and the attention to detail goes to show how much they wanted to take the time to make the film magical also the characters are very well design.The voice acting is very powerful each of the cast help bring the story to life and you could tell in their voice work that they were all in for giving their best. Again it feels like you were seeing a play unfold in front of you the cast really did a strong job. Songs written for the film help bring the characters out and the story because you could tell the songs would be hits when the movie came out. Each song does something special to make it well know for Disney fans.Music score in the film is nearly perfect and really helps brings the film to the fold because each piece of music written just does in it own way bring the movie to where it is I just really respect the music and it is one of my favorite movie scores.Overall Beauty and the Beast does a very well done job with making it one of Disney's best motion pictures. With super animation, great voice acting, superb music and a great story you can't not go wrongI give Beauty and the Beast an 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast,"Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated Disney films ever created. The songs of the film were the best out of all of it, including, "" No one fights like Gaston,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Be our Guest!"" and other magnificent songs in this film. These songs made the film become very successful and enjoyable as hell. The plot of the film was truly amazing ever in a disney movie. I think this movie actually almost made me cry. I mean it!! I don't think a disney movie has ever made me cry except Fox & the Hound. This was a beautiful disney movie that entertained me costantly. Yes, it is a classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A magical Disney classic,"Amazingly, up until now, I had never seen this movie. I'd seen The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, but not Beauty and the Beast. I'm really disappointed I never saw this movie till now because it's pretty great. I can certainly see why it is one of the 3 animated films that was nominated for Best Picture. The whole film feels extremely grandeur and epic in scale, especially the scene where Belle and the Beast dance. All the side characters are entertaining, and I'm really glad none of them were obnoxious and overbearing. One of the best things about this film is the fact that Belle and the Beast actually spent time with one another and developed a connection. At least more than other Disney films anyway. They felt more real than say Aladdin and Jasmine or Ariel and whatever that guy's name was. I'm really jealous of anyone who got to see this in the theater. It's a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, but until they hopefully re-release it, I'll keep watching it at home.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

My favourite film of all time.,"My parents bought me the 2003 special edition when it came out. I have watched it happily since I was two years old and still do to this day. Belle is my favourite Disney Princess and thanks to her I have lived a life loving Disney.The score by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman is moving, intelligent and also whimsical and fun. The songs are such a delight to sing along to, especially ""Beauty and the Beast"" that is sung by Angela Lansbury. I think the musical, too, is excellent. I have it the stage adaption three times. Twice in the theatre and once on Ice.The characters never get old. As you get older, the story only resonates more and more and the meaning becomes deeper. Hand drawn animation is definitely, 100 percent, the best. I think that the computer generated drawings that they use now are good, I'm not putting them down, but they do not have the same personal feel as the hand drawn animations on films such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid.I think that the film teaches a message on being true to yourself and to be helpful to, love and respect others, but also a lesson about how different people are/can be seen by society. That is a lesson, through watching the film as I get older, and reading many incredible fan theories, I have come to discover. I believe that this film is definitely one of Disney's gold renaissance features. This movie is deserving of every single one of its ten stars.May this film live forever in everyone's hearts. I know it will in mine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

One Of The Best Films Of The Disney Renaissance,"Disney has created a few classic princess fairy tale films in the past, so does Beauty and the Beast still matter? Simply yes. In comparison to the other princess films in the Disney Renaissance, this tops it but overall it isn't my favorite. The Disney Renaissance was film after film executed with brilliance and there are four films that would almost always be chosen either one as the best of the pack; The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. I fall in the group that thinks Aladdin is the strongest film but either one are great enough to be number one.The story team for this film, did a great job as they meshed the melodramatic tale ,that is commonly found in the Disney princess films of the past, with modern dialogue and humor that appeals to the newer generation. With Disney animated films, I expect to see funny side characters. The difference between the old Disney and the new Disney is that somehow the most memorable element of the cast is the supporting cast rather than the main star. With Disney's old films, the main characters were the memorable ones for me. The film is an endearing, feel good, romantic story; with hilarious dialogue; that will appeal to all ages.This film was directed by Gary Tousdale and Kirk Wise, and this film was their debut in directing a Disney animated full length feature. What a great way to start, they created a film that is now regarded as a classic and was the first animated feature to be nominated with Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I think they took the best things about The Little Mermaid and added other things that work. Their next directorial efforts for Disney did not achieve close to what they have done for this, although those films did gain a cult following.I felt that The Little Mermaid and The Rescuers Down Under in comparison did not have that beautiful cinematography that Beauty and the Beast shows. It's cinematography is one of the main reasons why so much of this film work, whether it's the beautiful and dramatic lighting or the way the ""camera"" moves in a particular scene. An example would be the scene where both Belle and the Beast had a romantic dance in the ballroom; the scene was lit gorgeously and the iconic moment when the ""camera"" starts from the chandelier and glides its way down to them dancing. I felt that this aspect of the film should have been awarded with something.As expected from a Disney film, it is going to contain musical numbers in it. I don't usually mind it as it allows the animators to show off something daring and outrageous. I feel that the songs in this film are much more accessible and beautiful, like 'Be Our Guest' and 'Gaston', rather than something grand and iconic, Lion King, or as fun and daring, Aladdin. Be Our Guest and Gaston are definitely the favorite of mine. Be Our Guest due to it feeling like a Broadway musical and Gaston because it is so ridiculously egotistic that it is entertaining. Also pretty much who has seen the film, would remember the words ""Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme"". The soundtrack is wonderful but I don't feel any of it out trumps Aladdin's 'A Whole New World' or Lion King's 'Circle of Life'.The voices of the film fit well for the characters and certainly gives the characters a bit of personality. The animators did a wonderful job drawing the characters as they look very clean and attractive. The animators pushed hard on this film as large amounts of objects or people move in one shot, and each movement has a personality of its own. Cogsworth and Lumiere are one of the best character duos ever animated on Disney.The film is an icon of its own and definitely ranks in one of the top romance films of all time. Beauty and the Beast is a film that would be competing against films like Casablanca and Gone with the Wind in deciding which melodramatic romance film is the best. If you are looking for a great romantic film or a Disney film that hits all of its marks then this is that film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Best Disney movie,"This is without a doubt Disney's best movie ever.  It was almost the first animated movie to win a best picture Oscar (Silence of the Lambs deserved to win).  It is a beautifully animated movie in the tradition of the great Walt Disney.  Everything about it is top-notch from the acting to the story, to the direction.  I just wish Disney would do more movies like this.A word about the current state of Disney.  There are now other studios (namely Dreamworks) that are willing (and able) to throw money into big-budget animated movies, and many have succeeded.  Movies like Titan AE, Iron Giant (a Fox movie), and Antz are all examples of great animated movies that have features that Disney animated movies don't.  First and foremost, these movies (and others like them) are NOT movies for just kids.This is one thing that made Beauty and the Beast so wonderful, and also what has made Disney movies after it so terrible.  PLEASE Disney make more movies that appeal to both kids AND adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
To date my favorite Disney movie of all time,"Basicly this a typical Disney movie, a good old fashion fairytale that got the Disney treatment in the most classic sense. But for me peronnaly there's something about the message of this movie spoke and speeks to me like no other Disney movie ever.What make Beauty and the Beast stand out for me is that usually a Disney movie is about finding inner strength and beauty and using this to be the best and most beautiful you can be. Beauty and the Beast I believe is about knowing this strength and having the selflessness and courage to transfer this to your fellow man just for the sake of helping them, if it helps you, that's a bonus.So, there you have it, not realy a cinamatic review but let's be honest you can find those all over and I'm not a filmmaker so I'm not even going to pretend to be able to tell you something intelligent about that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I would definitely recommend this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Lovely Disney film!,"While The Little Mermaid takes my number one spot on favourite Disney animated films, Beauty and the Beast is a close second. Jodi Benson has a beautiful voice as Ariel and Page O'Hara is just as incredible as Belle.What makes me love Beauty and the Beast so much is not the musical aspect, although Howard Ashman's lyrics are genuine and Alan Menken's scores are some of my favourite, beside Danny Elfman, it's the plot of Beauty and the Beast that wins my heart.Beauty and the Beast is a typical story of the ugly duckling (Beast) winning the affections of the beauty (Belle). While in most cases back in the day, the roles were reversed and it would be Belle who was unattractive winning the heart of a handsome prince. In these modern times, it's so rare to see a beautiful girl with an average looking or under-average looking guy.Disney goes beyond the normal lengths of this basic premise and really touches our hearts. Belle comes to love the Beast's inner beauty. Sure, it's not realistic as a beast like a bear cannot speak, nor could a human fall in love with an animal. I put aside the realism need I have, and just enjoy the film for it's entertainment purposes.Musically, this is my top film from Disney. It's not Page O'Hara alone that wins me over, but it's the entire cast. Alan Menken is my second favourite composer and each one of his film scores are different. Aladdin and Mermaid aren't anything alike, but it's by him. Howard's lyrics are unforgettable. I think the great part of Beauty and the Beast, musically, is that out of ninety minutes of film, eighty-five minutes have some form of music in it.Aside from plot and music, Beauty and the Beast is well-crafted animation-wise. It's so perfect and gives me chills at certain moments. I love to listen to the soundtrack, but when I watch the film, I get all tingly. Angela Landsbury's performance is outstanding, my favourite scene has got to be the transformation. It's depressing and lovely. It's a hauntingly beautiful and tragic scene that lifts your spirits when the fireworks kick in.It's a great film for the family, especially the kids. It's not just for kids, though, because at the age of 21, I'm giving it an eight out of ten and I still love it to this day and I still listen to the soundtrack all the time. Disney is meant for everyone. Beauty and the Beast is a classic and will never be forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Best Disney Movie of All Time!!,"Ever since I was little, Beauty and the Beast was my favorite Disney movie. Everything about it is perfect!

Now this is my favorite Disney film of all time when I was a kid.,"Ahh yes, the nostalgia and atmosphere out of this beautiful fantastic animated feature. Me, Jacob and Liam really enjoyed quoting dialogue and songs from this fantastic classic, Beauty and the Beast. Oh, how beautiful it is, how wonderful the adventure is and how amazing the animation is. It's speechless how great this film was and it still is. Why? Because this is the first Disney animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture. I've watched from years ago and says so itself. Remember when I said in The Silence of the Lambs Beauty and the Beast is nominated for Best Picture but lost to The Silence of the Lambs. The actors and actresses won and nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress but I forgot to mention the directors for Best Director. That's Oscars worthy. When I think of Best Pictures I can rate them a 9/10 and 10/10 because THAT'S a promise to the people of all country. If they rate them a 8/10 or whatever that's fine. Much like Best Picture though I have looked upon IMDB's Top 250 films of all time but I think it haven't rated it anymore but hey I just rate them 9 and 10/10, you guys just rated them whatever you want, your opinions. Now I will talk the characters, the animation, the story and the visuals. By god! The visuals are amazing! The ballroom scene is just beyond fantastic and beautiful! People who watch this scene will heartwarmed and chilled when Mrs Potts singing Beauty and the Beast tagline ''Tale as old as Time''. The songs are catchy and wonderful. My friends Liam Fleming and Jacob Dimmock and I were singing those songs. These Belle the town song, Gaston which is my favorite, Be Our Guest, Beauty and the Beast aka Tale as old as Time and the catchiest song ever the mob song Kill the Beast. The theme song Beauty and the Beast sung by Peabo Bryson and Celine Dion it's so beautiful and so wonderful. It's just BEYOND! When I was a kid I listen to it a million times and never gets old. I talk about the others when I review this. The characters are so memorable and never forgettable, Belle is wonderful and independent, Beast is an horrifying beast who is human who had no love in his heart and the enchantress turned him into a beast, Gaston is a villian who wants Belle to be his wife, Lefou is Gaston's sidekick. Actually just looking at these two certainly looks like us. I look like Gaston with the muscles and personality and Jacob looks like Lefou cause he's a little short but yeah, Gaston and Lefou are one of my favorite characters. The side characters for example Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts and Chip are funny too. I think again me and Jacob look like these two as well. I look like Lumiere and Jacob looks like Cogsworth because of his personality. And last but not least Maurice Belle's father. People always make fun of him because he's crazy because he saw the beast. That's why he's crazy just like Gaston and Lefou says but Belle thinks he's not crazy so people laugh at him and send him to the asylum. There's a scene where Maurice and his horse on the trip to the fair but got lost in the forest but Maurice makes me laugh. Actually when I was a kid the movie scare the hell out of me much like The Jungle Book though and yeah it's a kids film and it's suitable for all ages. When the beast turns back into a human and him and Belle lived happily ever after. People fell in love with the beast because you call him Beast. What's his real name? Do people just keep calling him Beast when he was turned into a human? When I was a kid I don't know his real name. Oh well. The animation is just beautiful and fantastic like I said to the ballroom scene, the animation is amazing. The animators use the animation called Traditional animation. That's means hand drawn animation and computer animation. Mix together to make the animation look amazing. Now I know what you're thinking. Traditional animation is dead. Yeah, I know that because I've watch the Animats reviews. There's a lyricist called Howard Ashman Alan Menken's friend who died years when he worked on the product. There's a disclaimer at the end of the credits saying ''TO OUR FRIEND, HOWARD, WHO GAVE A MERMAID HER VOICE AND A BEAST HIS SOUL, WE WILL BE FOREVER GREATFUL''. Wow! He really is a really good man. Anyways, that's all I can say about it. It has been a pleasure to review this wonderful Disney animated feature filled with lovable characters, beautiful animation, storytelling and directing and producing which really makes the best Disney animated feature to ever be nominated for Best Picture. The voice acting is great, the singing is great. It's just frigging fantastic! No movie collection is complete without Walt Disney Classic Beauty and the Beast. Be Our Guest and enjoy this wonderful and beautiful entertainment with your friends and families. This is one my favorite Disney animated classics of all time.

My favorite Disney flick as a kid,"Beauty and the Beast is more than just a Disney classic that I have fond memories of. As I previously mentioned in my Aladdin review, Beauty and the Beast was my #1 favorite Disney animated movie when I was younger, and for many reasons.First of all, the story is ravishing. Beyond one miniscule plot hole (it's mentioned in the prologue narration that the last petal on the rose would fall when the Beast turned 21, and then it's mentioned later on that 10 years had gone by, so that would mean the Prince was 11 when he was cursed), this fairy tale story of a selfish Prince, cursed as a Beast (voiced by Robby Benson), who must learn to love and, in return, earn the love of a beautiful young woman, appropriately named Belle (Paige O'Hara), is a magnificent and well-executed premise. One that'll enchant you, enthrall you, even as an adult!Likewise, the animation is spectacular beyond belief that I can barely describe it! The backgrounds are so lush and breathtakingly gorgeous. Every set piece, from the beautiful French countryside, to every massive, extravagant room in the Beast's castle, is, what the French call, magnifique. And every character is designed to perfection. Belle is very fitting to her name, on account of her exotic and mesmerizing, well, beauty. Even the Beast is very handsome, even in his Beast form. What the heck, literally, EVERYBODY in this movie looks amazing, especially the Beast's servants, namely Lumiere the French-accented candelabra (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth the British-accented mantel clock (David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts the teapot (Angela Lansbury) and even her cute son, Chip the teacup (Bradley Pierce)! And every little character movement is smooth and ripe with expression. Not to mention, there's lots of shading in every character, that gives the perfect three-dimensional feel, and it really blends with the backgrounds and other effects animation. But the most visually breathtaking sequence in the movie is the iconic ballroom dance between Belle and the Beast! The character models blend so perfectly with the CGI-rendered ballroom and the dynamic camera moves. Probably the single best use of Disney's CAPS system.And the characters, pretty much all of them, are great on so many levels! Belle is kind, polite, strong-willed, free-spirited, and very no-nonsense, and unsatisfied with her routine life. The Beast is initially flawed, ill-tempered, mean and nearly unlikeable, but he gradually learns to control his temper, and as a result, Belle learns to look beyond his monstrous demeanor, and they gradually develop feelings for each other. The result is that the chemistry between the two really works. On the third side of the love triangle, we have our villain, Gaston (Richard White), a strong and handsome, but very vain and rude hunter that everyone in Belle's hometown fawns over, except Belle, who he keeps pursuing. Gaston is a FANTASTIC villain, the kind that you can't help but hate and love simultaneously. He starts as a restrained jerk jock type who constantly courts Belle and tries to get her to marry him, and gradually builds into a legitimate threat. His blindly devoted lackey, LeFou (Jesse Corti), is also very enjoyable, due to his chattiness and clumsiness. And of course, Belle's inventor father, Maurice (Rex Everhart), is very delightful, since he's a really good father, and very caring, and at times, very funny.The voice-acting is sublime, and everybody plays their characters perfectly. Paige O'Hara voices Belle beautifully, and really embraces her character. Robby Benson gives the Beast an excellent gravelly voice that matches his looks, and warms accordingly as he develops and becomes kinder. Richard White absolutely NAILS Gaston! He gives him a resonant baritone, that matches his villainous nature and muscular appearance.And along with great drama, and touching moments, the movie supplies lots of great humor when necessary. Cogsworth and Lumiere's banters are very entertaining, and the exchanges between Gaston and LeFou are very comical at times. Maurice also has his share of comical moments, like getting bonked on the head by a flying log, and also sneezing on Cogsworth.And finally, there's the music. Disney maestro Alan Menken's score is amazing and mystical. And the songs that he cowrote with the wonderful lyricist Howard Ashman (who, amazingly, wrote this movie's songs in a hospital, while AIDS ate him away) are also masterpieces, ESPECIALLY ""Be Our Guest""! But there's also the title song, sung beautifully by Angela Lansbury (may she rest in peace) as Mrs. Potts. It's very lovely.All in all, Beauty and the Beast is a true Disney classic, probably even the highlight of the Disney Renaissance, and quite deserving of its Oscar nomination. Highly recommended!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Timeless tale of enchantment,"""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991) remains one of Disney's most beloved animated classics. This enchanting film captures the timeless story of Belle, a bright and independent young woman, who finds herself in the mysterious and magical castle of the Beast. The animation is breathtaking, blending hand-drawn artistry with computer-generated imagery to create a visually stunning world.The film's music, composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Howard Ashman, is one of its standout features. Iconic songs like ""Be Our Guest"" and the titular ""Beauty and the Beast"" add depth and emotion, making the movie's narrative even more compelling. The voice cast, featuring Paige O'Hara as Belle and Robby Benson as the Beast, brings the characters to life with warmth and personality.What sets ""Beauty and the Beast"" apart is its ability to balance romance, humor, and drama seamlessly. The story's themes of inner beauty, redemption, and the transformative power of love are universal and resonate with audiences of all ages.While some aspects might feel dated compared to modern animation standards, its charm, memorable characters, and captivating story make it a timeless classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beautiful,"This has to be the best Disney animation picture ever. Nearly all the other Disney heroines have ready-made Prince Charmings, but Belle learns to love a Beast (so she hated him at first - that wasn't because of his physical appearance, it was because he'd imprisoned her father). All the songs are lovely, but 'Tale as Old as Time' crowns them all. This film can be described in one word: beautiful.PS I only have one minor criticism of this film: that when Disney had a heroine that was a bit strange and very bookish, it offends me that they chose a brunette. It's basically saying: 'Blondes are the pretty ones'. But that did no way spoil the movie - it was pure perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beauty and the Beast is one of the most defining animations in Disney's filmography.,"The 80's were tough for the animation studio, with several films facing mediocrity. But wait, what's that glistening in the early Renaissance era? It can only be the most magical, whimsical and classic fairytale of them all. The most beautiful girl in town gives up her life of freedom for her father's sake and is imprisoned in an enchanted castle for eternity, eventually forming a close bond with a cursed man who is turned into a ferocious beast. Only true love can break the spell! The pinnacle of musical animations, the epitome of true romance, the magnum opus of singing candlesticks! It's a sweeping love story that conveys the all important message of ""personality over looks"". No one likes a vain narcissist, instead we much prefer a gentleman who, at first sulks like a prepubescent teenager, yet learns to treat the ladies correctly. Then we throw in Disney magic ranging from anthropomorphised household objects to musical numbers. Those songs...I haven't stopped singing them. Every time I watch this I randomly exclaim ""Be...Our...GUEST! Be our guest, put our service to the test!"" in a French accent (naturally) which is a testimony to the staying power of this musical. It's so delightful and nostalgic that I can't help but gleefully smile. The animation itself is beautifully hand drawn with extremely vibrant colours. The dark monochromatic castle juxtaposing the vivid colourful town. The voice acting was spot on, particularly Lansbury and Orbach. The pace is incredibly swift moving, perhaps slightly too rapid for its own good. Beast's human form cracks me every time I watch the transformation scene, he just looks so...fake? Like he has had tonnes of plastic surgery. Also the final few minutes of Gaston were slightly underwhelming, I wanted more from him. It's by no means my favourite animation, yet it's safe to say it's one of Disney's most accessible and a strong contender during the Renaissance period. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to finish performing...",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Gorgeous, moving film","When Walt Disney chose as a fairytale the subject for his first animated feature: `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.  The result was first screened in 1937.  He revisited fairytales with `Cinderella', in 1950, and `Sleeping Beauty', in 1959.  He never made another.  Nor did his studio, until the release of `Beauty and the Beast', in 1991.It's odd: because the fairytales Disney chose are poor ones, and the films I just mentioned are of value mainly because of the valiant way they overcome the limits imposed by their subject matter - and they don't always do so. The story of Beauty and the Beast, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful folktales around.  Somehow the studio managed to avoid it for fifty-four years.  Perhaps it's a good thing they waited.  `Beauty and the Beast' is a triumph, almost on the same level as the great films made in Disney's heyday (up to 1942), and considerably better than `Snow White'.It's hard to say what makes it so good.  It's just a touching love story with neither cloying sentimentality nor jarring irony.  The animation is mostly very good - and the animation (and character design) of the Beast, the most important character, is inspired.  Trousdale and Wise pace and shape the story in exactly the right way, adding detail to the original where necessary, leaving the heart of it unaltered.  The occasional clumsiness is more than made up for by sheer sincerity.  For the most part it's anything but clumsy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Breathtaking,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is a breathtaking movie, not just as an animated feature but as a movie. Along with ""The Lion King"" this is the pinnacle of Disney animation. This film does however have a better story than ""The Lion King"".

Disney Magic At It's Finest,"Beauty and the Beast has and will always be my favorite Disney movie. What is there to say that hasn't already been said? The 2D animation is beautiful, the music is incredible, the pacing is perfect, and while the story is simple it's coherent and meaningful. Belle is a queen among the Disney Princesses and will forever be my favorite. The romance is almost too perfect and cute for its own good. And frankly the castle servants are underrated among Disney sidekicks. And while Gaston has no magic powers like Maleficent or sinister manipulation tactics like Scar he is easily my favorite Disney villain due to how he represents society's shallowness towards attractive people. This movie was easily Walt's greatest masterpiece and I will gladly fight anyone to defend that point.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not as enchanting on Imax,"Before going on, let me say that this is one of my all time favorite films. In its original release was is truly magical and richly deserved the awards given to it and I treasure my VCR tape. BUT IT LOSES MOST OF THE MAGIC IN IMAX.On the huge Imax screen there are so many things that were not evident in the smaller version, characters not fully drawn or animated are totally distracting. It is simply too overwhelming and the intimacy and magic are now missing.The only sequences that are truly effective in the Imax format are the opening sequence panning through the forest going to the castle and the two big musical numbers, ""Be Our Guest"" and the new ""Human Again"". The last mentioned song is terrific and was a highlight of the live stage version. Now it is in the film and illustrates that it should have been there from the beginning.The scenes with the wolves in which their mouths are so big a viewer feels as if being eaten, are simply too intense for younger audience members.The only good thing about the Imax release is the hope that this version with the new musical number will be released to regular theaters on the size screen it was created for when the giant screen runs are over and that a DVD will soon be available.

A Renaissance Film Like No Other,"""Beauty and the Beast"", one of the hallmarks of Disney's renaissance era, is an animated masterpiece that excels in utilizing complex characters and aesthetics while remaining simple at its core. Combined with an unforgettable lineup of songs (such as ""Be Our Guest"", ""Gaston"", and the movie's namesake) and wrapped within a beautifully-drawn world, the film's narrative has an excellent stage to unfold on within the streamlined duration of only eighty-seven minutes.Concerning the plot, the story opens up with a narration chronicling a fateful curse that enshrouded the castle of a selfish prince and all who lived there, setting the stage for the motivations of the film's first main character. It then transitions to a musical sequence introducing both the second protagonist, a beautiful young woman named Belle, and her current source of conflict: the town's brash ""hero"", Gaston. After encouraging her father Maurice (the town's resident ""crackpot"") with his current invention, the story continues to follow his journey as he eventually loses himself within the nearby woods before happening upon the cursed castle; forced to intrude to wait out the inclement weather and ravenous wolves that pursued him. Shortly after discovering that the twisted bastion is home to many enchanted beings, he is confronted by their beastly master and thrown into the dungeon for his trespass. Back in town, Belle learns of this emergency shortly after turning down Gaston's marriage proposal and rushes to save her father. Upon finding him and the intimidating Beast, she bargains for his life in exchange for her own, and the Beast agrees. The two understandably don't see eye-to-eye, and Belle eventually breaks her accord and leaves after she visited the single place of the castle the Beast forbade her to go: witnessing the magical rose (the film's visual hourglass for the curse) in the Beast's possession. Quickly finding herself at the mercy of the same pack of wolves that hunted her father, the Beast swiftly steps in to protect her, driving them off at the price of a ghastly wound. It is at this point where Belle's contempt for the Beast begins to soften, with his anger toward her diminishing in turn as the two gradually grow closer as the seasons change. Ultimately falling in love with her, the Beast freely releases Belle to see her father again despite suspecting that she will never return if given the choice. As Gaston's sinister plans come to a head, the story soon reaches its climax with a battle to save the Beast and his servants from both the frenzied villagers led by Gaston and the curse itself becoming permanent.Easily one of the strongest points of the film is its use of meticulous development to simultaneously enrich the characters of each scene while setting up future story points to unfold. Several examples of which surround the character of Gaston and the actions he carries out to ensnare Belle: starting from his abrupt proposal and delusions of how an ideal marriage should work and culminating with his scheme to use the imprisonment of Maurice in an insane asylum as a ploy to ""win"" her hand. These situations not only push the plot forward, but allow Gaston to exhibit a more monstrous personality to feature as a foil to the Beast's more gentlemanly mannerisms as the story nears its end.As mentioned previously, the film also does an exceptional job of pacing itself within the confines of less than an hour and a half of runtime. No scene is wasted on needless exposition or lollygagging, and the musical numbers that are neatly woven in here and there are purposely meaningful to the narrative. If anything, a little more time would have been welcome if it was added in the right places.The art style and early integration of 3D animation is stunning to behold, with the facial features in particular lending that extra modicum of depth to each character in compliment to the strong voice acting from the likes of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Angela Lansbury, and Richard White.In conclusion, Disney's original version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" will always stand out as one of the company's most iconic films for its timeless combination of unforgettable components. It is a shining example of how well a simple story and premise can juxtapose with more mature concepts at a level that can appeal to (and entertain) every range of viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The most visually amazing animated movie not created by Pixar,"If you have the chance to see this movie in the current Imax format, I highly recommend it.  It fills in some of the plot holes from the original (there were a couple after a scene was removed).  A great story for kids and adults.  Teaches kids a lesson about appearances.  The dance scene in the movie is my favorite animated scene in a movie.  Not because of its romance or anything, but because of the animation.  Watch the floor as the 2 of them dance.

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,"""Beauty and the Beast"" slipped around all my roadblocks and penetrated directly into my strongest childhood memories, in which animation looked more real than live-action features. Watching the movie, I found myself caught up in a direct and joyous way. I wasn't reviewing an ""animated film."" I was being told a story, I was hearing terrific music, and I was having fun.The film is as good as any Disney animated feature ever made - as magical as ""Pinocchio,"" ""Snow White,"" ""The Little Mermaid."" And it's a reminder that animation is the ideal medium for fantasy, because all of its fears and dreams can be made literal. No Gothic castle in the history of horror films, for example, has ever approached the awesome, frightening towers of the castle where the Beast lives. And no real wolves could have fangs as sharp or eyes as glowing as the wolves that prowl in the castle woods.Roger Ebert

One of the greatest animated movies and one of the greatest movie musicals ever made.,"With the release of director Bill Condon's live-action remake already among us in DVD and Blu-Ray form, I figure that it'd be appropriate to look back at the original animated musical released in 1991 and directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. The Disney Renaissance was just kicking off with the releases of ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and the wildly underrated ""The Rescuers Down Under"" (1990), the latter not being a musical. Regardless, those two movies, along with the invention of CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), opened up a new wave of motion picture animation that would give Disney's animation studio a new breath of life after a long slew of mediocre successes and failures at the box office, their biggest flop being the animated fantasy film ""The Black Cauldron"" (1986). It wasn't until 1991 when their next project really pushed it to the limit.Based on the French fairy tale, ""Beauty and the Beast"" first opens up with a prologue about a selfish prince and his refusal to help an old woman in need. It turns out that old woman was really an enchantress, who decides to teach the prince a lesson he would never forget. How? Turn him into a hideous monster, of course, with his subordinates who also live in his castle sharing the punishment. Then we cut to Belle, a young country girl who's the talk of the town, and the vying target of local hunk Gaston (our villain). Belle's father, an inventor heads off to the fair to show off his work, only to be ambushed by a pack of wolves. He becomes the prisoner of the prince, now a beast, after seeking shelter in his castle, and when Belle gets wind of her father taken captive, she goes to try and free him. She offers to be his prisoner in exchange for her father's freedom, and as we soon find out later in the picture, she's his only hope of breaking the enchantress' spell if the Beast plays his cards right.Looking at this film in 2017, this movie still holds up just as well as it did back when it was first released 26 years ago. The animation is still as crisp, smooth, and as impressive today as it was back then. Keep in mind that this was a time where artists still had to draw frame after frame, even though they used computers. The ballroom scene in particular is still one of the most iconic scenes in cinema history. The songs and score by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, who also worked on 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"" and 1986's ""Little Shop of Horrors"", are some of their best work to date, with the title song (sung by Angela Lansbury) and ""Be Our Guest"" (sung by the late ""Law & Order"" star Jerry Orbach) being the highlights.Being a child of the '90s, I had the opportunity of seeing this film at a rather young age. After all, I was a hardcore Disney kid, and I remember this as being a spectacle at the time. I wasn't alone in that regard, as this movie was turning the heads of both audiences and critics, including the late Roger Ebert, who quoted it as ""one of the greatest movie musicals ever made"". Even the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (a.k.a. the Oscar people) made an exception to the ""no animated films for Best Picture"" rule and made it a nominee in that category for 1991. Let's just say that if your animated movie can change a rule that the A.M.P.A.S. set in stone, you've done something right.Overall, this is a movie worth looking at again before the release of the live-action remake starring Emma Watson later this month. In my opinion, though not my number one favorite Disney film, it is one of their greatest animated pictures and in a spot somewhere in my top five. It is a must-see for any film lover, and even if you're not a fan of these kind of movies, there is something you can at least admire about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Beautiful film, but not for IMAX","I want to say one thing right off the bat; I absolutely love this film. But I was less than thrilled with the results of blowing it up to IMAX size. The additional sequence, ""Human Again"" was fun, and it was novel to see it on a huge screen, but so many of the background characters were so huge on the IMAX screen that it was apparent that they were a lot less detailed than the main, foreground characters.  The final sequence, where Belle and the restored Prince are waltzing was a good example of this; they waltz, everyone else stands perfectly still, un-animated and it was so much more apparent on the large screen.  It was my understanding that Disney was going back to re-animate some of these background characters.  Well, apparently, they missed a bunch of them.  Once again, great film, but the large scale format does it a great injustice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Best,"From the opening music, I was engaged. By the first song, I was loving it. By 'Be Our Guest' I was dancing.

Only with Alan Menken, Howard Ashman (and a little help from Tim Rice). It is also a dawning, as this is the only villain in any film that I have fallen in love with. Gaston rocks, and if he was real, I would marry him without a doubt.

And with the modern fluid presentation of the ""Be Our Guest"" number (with elements very reminiscent of DUMBO's ""Pink Elephants on Parade""), and the big ballroom title number.I love the way the personality of the characters comes through; especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, the Featherduster, Chip and Lefou.

The Second in the Nineties Golden Age,"Film-Beauty and the Beast Rating-G Creator-Walt Disney Feature Animation Release Year-1991With it's classic story, memorable characters, dramatic songs, and under toned villain, this film is one that absolutely deserves it's place in Disney's coveted ""Platinum"" line of DVDs. Now come along with me as I explore these three sections of the film-the Villain, the DVD, and instead of comic relief, the Music.Gaston is the rude and conceited man who tries to get Belle to marry him through his achievements and looks, and as a child you wouldn't see that this man is the dramatic villain, until the final sequences. His song, ""Let's Kill the Beast,"" truly captures his intentions, and to me, is what truly made this film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.The 2002 Platinum release of this title was dazzling. The disc offered three versions of the film, a beautiful making of feature, wonderful packaging, and of course, silly games for the kids. It's a DVD worth buying, yet maybe not buying to wait for it's upcoming new Platium release in the years to come.And now for probably the best part of this film, the Broadway style music. Composing the film is Alan Menken, the genius behind ""The Little Mermaid (1989)"" who brings this film to stunning style musically, with it's basis of theatrical dramatic songs, and having the range to do the silly songs as well. And then of course, there is the glue between film and music, the lyricist for the film, the late Howard Ashman. His witty style doesn't dumb down for any age. It's glamor when needed, and fun when wanted, is witty and catchy-these songs will forever stay in your mind. Howard Ashman test HIV positive in production of this film, and died a few months before it's release. Fans of his work know this as his last true film, although he contributed some work to ""Aladdin (1992)"" though the lyricist for that is mainly Tim Rice.All in all, Beauty and the Beast is a golden triumph among the Golden ages, and should not lose it's place in any home. With it's fabulous villain, magnificent DVD, and genius music, it's no wonder that so many fans find this their favorite Disney film.Walt Disney Pictures Beautiful Classic, Beauty and the Beast",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A revelation on IMAX,"So many people have complained about the IMAX presentation of this film that I felt the need to set the record straight. I took my kids to see Beauty and the Beast at the nearest IMAX, a 2-hour drive away, and left feeling like I would never look at this film the same way again. This is a good thing, because I never had the opportunity to see the film on the big screen during its initial release. I will concede that IMAX does show up some of the flaws in the film's animation, but it also does something more important: it shows us just how much hard work goes into making an animated film, as well as how difficult it is to animate those tiny characters present in the background.The main reason I enjoyed this presentation however, was the sound. Disney went whole hog and spiffed this puppy up with a full-fledged 5.1 presentation, which serves to amplify the emotions evoked by the film. I'm not ashamed to admit that this film still makes me weep, and that emotion was not diminished in any way by the IMAX presentation.

Classic,"Looking back, I think I was too easy on the remake in my review, simply because it's a remake. I still contend that it was a good movie, but of course, you simply just can't outdo the original's sheer elegance and originality.Beauty and the Beast is a classic for a reason. The animation and the music is flawless; even though the ballroom scene might be dated by today's standards (inevitable, really), the sheer ambition alone is still astounding today. What contemporary cartoon is even attempting to experiment with grandiose camera angles? The medium of animation also allows for much more expressive characters, both physically and emotionally. The designs are attractive and iconic, and the actors, only getting to showcase their voice, really give it their all to really convey who these characters are.Speaking of, the characterization in this film is super tight, and amplified by great voice acting, really enhances the film. The Beast, for example, is actually a beast. He growls menacingly and stalks around on four legs. It provides an excellent contrast between his initial cold heart and his eventual descent into a romantic. Cogsworth is an OCD sycophant, and Lumiere is a dashing playboy; miles ahead of the watered-down versions of them in the remake.I do wish that we could've spent more time with the characters falling in love; we get a couple great scenes and songs of them bonding, but before you know it, we're at the climax. It's pretty much excused though by the animators' mastery at emotional subtlety that lets us see the Beast and Belle gradually develop feelings for each other.All in all, this movie's flaws are pretty close to nil. It's the best movie of the Disney Renaissance, in my opinion. It's a perfect romance and musical that never fails to elicit strong emotions, whether it be ebullience or sadness. It's a masterpiece of animation and cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Strangely touching,"There was a time when Walt Disney could no no wrong. But then came DuckTales and stuff like that. And things were in turmoil for a while. Seriously, how many people watched ""Oliver and Company""?

This film, and ""Lion King"" are true masterpieces. I cannot say the same about Tarzan, or ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" or ""Aladdin"". But there is something in this film that makes me cry every single time I watch it.What could it be? Maybe that, since the beginning, you learn to care for the Beast and his loneliness. Or you admire Belle for her will to be something more. And you cannot forget the sadness of the inhabitants of the castle, who know that they might be doomed forever.And then... and then Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom sequence, and they glance at each other, and you can feel the love they have for each other. But how? This is only a cartoon, isn't it? Fact is, the drawings themselves have an incredible power in them; the facial expressions are simply perfect, and the terse, beautiful song enhances the feeling.

"Wonderful, but additional not required. If it ain't broke...","Beauty & the Beast is still one of my favourite Disney films. It has a feisty, book loving heroine, a gorgeous beast, entertaining support & a vile villain. Plus enchanting songs & colourful, detailed animation. My favourite character is Chip, the little teacup, who has a vital role to play. Alas, the gorgeous beast is eventually replaced, but that's for sake of the fairy tale. What we didn't need was a new musical number. It's just an unnecessary filler in that spoils the pace of the film. Be sure to watch to the end of the credits. There's a wonderful dedication to Howard Ashman. The voicework is fantastic & best of all, the film is in classic 2d. It's a shame we see less & less of that style nowadays. With notable exceptions like Ice Age, 3d animation lacks the uniqueness & charm of traditional films. CGI doesn't have to flaunt itself. It's the story & characters that truly matter. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the Best Animated Movies of All Time,"Fun fact: this is the first animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Second fun fact: the Beauty and the Beast story also inspired Miyazaki to make Princess Mononoke, one my personal favorites, a movie you will be seeing far higher on this list, the highest grossing movie ever made in Japan and the first animated movie to ever win Japan's version of the Oscars. Kinda weird how one story can inspire two relatively similar great movies on two different ends of the world.But of course, the Disney version is a more faithful adaption. And the version we will be discussing today.If The Little Mermaid started the Disney Renaissance, this movie brought it roaring to life. Many (myself not included) consider this to be the high point of the period, the film where the music, the characters, the animation, and the plot come together to form one insurmountable masterwork. And there is a case to be made for that. You can feel as you watch the movie that this was made by a studio at the top of its game. It may not be the best Disney movie, but I do believe it do be the least flawed. There is nothing wrong with the movie; across the board it excels.Belle is the most fleshed out Disney heroine to this point and arguable the most fleshed out ever. Personally, I prefer Ariel just because while the redhead feels alive and energetic, Belle feels a bit too perfect. But even so, the perfection is not the forced, morality-included kind that makes me hate Superman. It just does seem like she is just a legitimately nice and smart person. I have a friend like that; she's amazing. And just like her, while Belle may be a bit too goody, there is no doubt that she seems real and earnest.Of course, she is not the only character, though I would not mind if she were. The Beast is well-acted. He is able to pull to be fearsome and intimidating without surrendering his humanity. As such, the character development seems natural and flowing. You feel why he does what he does; you emphasize with him. My only qualm is one that many people have had: that his voice after he turns back is underwhelming to say the least. But if that's seriously the biggest complaint I can voice against this movie, and it is, then it is doing something right.Gaston is also done well; there are few villains in movie history who are both able to induce fear and laughs; Gaston is one of them. He walks the tightrope of being over-the-top without losing his human desires and ambitions. The scenes he and Belle share are legitimately creepy at best. But once more, you can see where he's coming from, though you don't agree with him. Great character work here.The plot is basic, but well-done. I've...used variations of that phrase quite often, haven't I? So be it; I guess I just tend towards movies like that. Anyways...it's amazing how few people pick up on the nuances that make films like this work. It's not the grand structure that makes it so effect; but rather the little things that build tension and drama like one line or one extra scene. Creative genius is fickle, but not unpredictable, not unless you aren't sensitive to it.But nothing trumps the animation. While I prefer the stark colors of the Lion King, I will say that this is the objectively best-animated movie in the DisRen. In fact, I say that it is the best-looking traditionally-animated movie ever made in the West. Every frame looks like a million dollar painting. Often, I find myself stopping the movie and just staring at the animation. Belle feels alive and full of vigor. The town feels quaint and peaceful with a tint of unease. The Beast's Castle is foreboding and grand but not cold. This is one of those films that makes me want to turn into an animated character just to immerse myself in the world.If the sterling animation arouses these feelings, the sweeping score amplifies it. While not as majestic as Lion King's, this soundtrack is emotional and deep, making every moment feel earned. I would even argue that no movie has as well captured the magic of the medieval-Renaissance era atmosphere as well as this one. There are scores that are thumping and sprawling, adding scale to the movie. There are scores that are intimate and romantic, letting the moment hang with passion in the air. This film does both.In its most famous song, it declares that the story is 'a tale as old as time.' I think this movie will last as long as that. I can safely say that there is not a film as good as Beauty in the Beast that is as good at doing what Beauty in the Beast does best better than Beauty in the Beast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Inspirational,"I have always had an obsession with films and Disney is the reason for this i have loved every single one of their creations but none of them have touched me in a way that Beauty and the Beast did, This film inspired me to follow my dreams and not to settle for anything that I'm not happy with.The story line follows an average girl (Bell) who feels like she does not belong in the town where she lives, her father leaves to go to an inventors fair and has some trouble along the way, Belle comes to help him and ends up living with the Beast.In my opinion this film teaches you that its not whats on the outside that counts but whats on the inside and if you look hard enough you may just see something that you didn't realise was there.In short I truly believe that this is Disney at their best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
the best disney animation pic,"This movie may not match the popularity of The Little Mermaid, here in the Philippines, but this one is animation at its very best. The movements are so close to being human, that you may sometimes forget that these characters were drawn. This is evident in the dance hall sequence where the Beast dances with Belle. The wonderful musical score is a no-brainer for Disney movies: but who could ever forget the theme song? To stay true to the original material is really hard to do, but this one pulled it off with great success. What also makes this film different, is that it pulled in more adult audiences than kid audiences here in the Philippines. Certainly there are singing spoons and plates but taking into consideration the spell that the whole castle went into, adult audiences didn't have a hard time taking it hook, line and sinker. The thing here is not to enjoy, but to experience. Agree? Be my guest!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated fantasy, romantic, and musical film distributed by Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation.","Beauty and the Beast Featuring the vocal talents of Robby Benson and Paige O'Hara with Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Richard White, the movie displays the story of a prince, whose punishment for his selfish and cruel ways, is turned into a beast and Belle, a woman who willing takes her father's place as prisoner of the castle. To become the prince again, the beast must love Belle and in turn she must love the beast or he will remain as he is forever. The film is directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. Gary Trousdale has worked on the story of Oliver and Company( 1998 film), The Little Mermaid(1989 film) as storyboard artist,Aladdin( 1992 film) as pre- production story developer and CGI, The Lion King (1994 film) on the story,The Hunchback of Notre Dame(1996 film) as director, Madagascar(2005 film) as an additional storyboard artist, Flushed Away(2006 film) as an additional story artist, among many more. Meanwhile Kirk Wise also worked on Oliver and Company as an animating assistant and with the story, The Prince and the Pauper as a storyboard artist, The Lion King with additional story material, The Hunchback of Notre Dame as director, Spirited Away as director of the U.S. Production, among others. Paige O'Hara voices the film's main protagonist, Belle. She also portrayed Angela in Enchanted. The setting of the film is somewhere in rural France in the 1700s. Character development was very well done, therefore solid 3-D characters.Another highlight was the computer animation, particularly the ballroom dance scene, which was impressively caricatured. The songs while a bit childish still are very nice. The score was also pleasing to the ears.The sound was very realistic and you could feel like you were actually there. The special effects were outstanding. The movie wasn't slow or fast, it was nearly perfectly well-paced and that's a lot given that the run time is only 84 minutes. It is the best film by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. Quality wise, it's Kirk Wise's Spirited Away was significantly better. The plot was creative and quite unpredictable. The dialogue was also memorable. The movie flowed incredible scene to scene. The lighting and ambiance was superb. The animation was realistic and nothing looked out of the ordinary( in a good way). The costume design was intricate and realistic. It contributed positively towards the movie's overall tone. The set design was exceptional and it added to the movie experience. If the movie was filmed in an actual location, it would have to be well- chosen while there is hardly place where all of that is nearby. The background music was amazing. It worked incredibly well for the film.Ir was wasn't under-used or used in excess. The music was suspenseful and amusing, obviously in the correct places. All in all, the movie was fascinating and interesting, despite not being Disney's finest film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Absolutely magnificent!  All-Time #1 of Disney's best!,"There are nearly no words to describe how truly incredible this film is in almost every way possible.  Everything is right up front and done beautifully; the cinematogrophy, the graphics, the frame rate, the development of the characters, the voice-acting, the layout of the plot, the music, the emotional impact, everything!  I don't even know where to begin explain the power of this film.  But to start, I am more than impressed with the graphics considering the computer technology that was available through 1989-1991.  We were still running 386 PC's with Windows 3.1!  To continue, the music is awesome and each song comes in at just the right time!  While watching this film, you would say to yourself ""I'd like to hear a song right about now.""  And it happens!  Which is a 1 in a 1,000,000 chance of happening and it does just that in Beauty in the Beast.  And every character has an excellent personality that develops smoothly and you never get bored with them whether you love or hate them.  It is sad, however, that Howard Ashman died six months before the theatrical premiere of the film.  To continue, this film truly teaches you the lesson of understanding people and love them for who they are and not for what they are or how repulsive they can be.  And aside from the characters different from the novel, the heart of the story remains untainted.  And it's truly enjoyable for all ages young and old.  I'll be watching this film until I live to be 80 years old.  The best film Disney has ever made.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Let me Tell Something to You. Come Close *Ushers them Closer*. Don't be afraid.,"This film, unlike the live-action version, is a masterpiece to no end! You'll pretty much also see why this movie is so much better than the last one I reviewed.The songs and soundtrack of this film are so moving! When you listen to the music, you can sense how much commitment & hard work was put into it by the brilliant composer, Alan Menken, and the brilliant lyricist, Howard Ashman. You'll find yourself dancing to them for what can very well be an eternity.The characters, as well as the people who portrayed them, are extremely unique. The voices every actor & actress gave their characters fit perfectly to where you can barely single one person out as the one who stands above all others, even if they didn't sound French enough. The characters also all have a personality & a multitude of traits that make them so three-dimensional, as well as ones that you'll grow up with in a great way.Everything about the story & plot line is so well-thought, as well as so emotionally groundbreaking! There are so many moments in it that could make you bubbly with joy, cry with tears, and laugh out loud.The animation that the film has is truly a breath-taking experience! As you watch the movie, you feel yourself walking into an actual fairytale with the feeling that the world & inhabitants it has are so real.To Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise: If the two of you are reading this, I want you both to know that you truly know how to bring an animated feature film to life, and help revive the magic originated by Walt Disney himself. He'd be very proud of you both for your work on this film, as well as your work on Disney's ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" & ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" (both of which I have yet to review).I deeply hope that the two of you make more of your own animated films soon, whether it's at your current working station: Dreamworks Animation, or whether it's at Disney should you decide to return there.In the end, Beauty & the Beast (1991) is what I'd like to call a timeless classic, and in this time and age, it's even better than the 2017 live-action adaption in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It truly has such a beautiful message about beauty being more than appearances and what's seen on the outside. Beauty comes from within. There's a reason this was the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, in 1991.

The movie is an all around treasure and should be considered among Disney's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A masterpiece,"""Beauty and the Beast"" truly represents a bygone era in animation. Remember when animated films were unabashedly charming and big hearted before becoming obnoxiously glib, crude, and cynical (""Shrek"", ""Chicken Little"")? And remember when just the right actors were carefully chosen to give voices to the animated characters before every animated film became a hollow, ""guess the celebrity"" game (""Robots"", ""Shark Tale"")? ""B&tB"" is filled with emotion, heart, and spirit. The biggest star in the movie was Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), yet ""B&tB"" will remain a classic long after ""Madagascar"" and ""Open Season"" are forgotten. Not to mention that it has the most engaging and likable of the ""Disney Princesses"". Belle isn't a passive ninny like Snow White, a pushover like Cinderella, dull like Aurora, or a reckless fool like Ariel. She's smart, kind, assertive, brave, and resourceful. She owns up to her mistakes, looks out for others, and knows her own mind. You all know the story: Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) is the daughter of the eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart). Her love of books causes her to be labeled as strange by the narrow-minded citizens of the tiny French village in which she lives. Belle is understandably lonely and bored with her ""provincial life"". It doesn't help that she's pursued by town celebrity Gaston (Richard White), an insufferably pompous, trigger-happy, chauvinistic nitwit and his ankle-biting sidekick LeFou (Jessi Corti). Gaston has the classic, sexist mentality that ""no"" means ""yes"", and that Belle will marry him without so much as courtship or a proposal, leading to a hilarious scene where Belle gives Gaston the humiliating rejection he so richly deserves. One day Maurice disappears on his way to an inventor's fair, and when Belle goes out to search for him, she discovers he's being held prisoner in an enchanted castle ruled by a horrifying Beast (Robby Benson). Belle nobly takes her father's place as prisoner, at first devastated at losing her freedom, but is soon comforted by the palace's delightful residents: Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), a maternal teapot; Lumiere (dynamically voiced by Jerry Orbach), an amorous candlestick; and Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), an anal retentive clock. What Belle doesn't realize is that the Beast was once a human prince whose cruelty to an enchantress in disguise caused him to be transformed into a monster as punishment (and everyone else in the palace suffered the consequences as well, becoming household objects). And the Beast now must earn someone's love before an enchanted rose loses its final petal (what is it with Disney and deadlines?). There is friction between Belle and the Beast at first (she thinks he's heartless, he thinks she's difficult). But when Beast saves Belle from wolves after she attempts to escape, a bond forms between them. Beast, tired of being a monstrous animal, begins to soften under Belle's kindly influence. Love starts to blossom, but when Belle is forced to leave when Maurice falls ill, it seems Beast's hopes of regaining his humanity are dashed. And it doesn't help that Belle's feelings for the Beast awaken the green-eyed monster in Gaston. A happy ending almost doesn't seem possible...It's easy to buy into all the ""Beauty and the Beast"" parodies, but when you look past all the Disney trappings, there is something so much deeper. We see a romance develop not due to physical attraction or plot requirement, but because of, well, development. Belle and the Beast spend time together, get to know each other, and share each other's interests. Beast really becomes a terrific guy: he gives bookworm Belle his massive library as a gift, learns to control his temper, and even learns proper table manners (Beast must have earned hundreds of wistful sighs from female audience members). It's a film about transformation in general. We don't have some vacuous Prince Charming, but a complex, anguished male protagonist who could easily be labeled as a villain in the beginning (he does throw poor old Maurice into the dungeon for no good reason). Once the Beast learns to let go of his self-pity and rage can he become more human. Gaston is a creep from beginning to end, but he is loved by all because of his looks. We see him as a harmless jerk, until his jealousy of the Beast winning Belle's love changes him from dumb jock to a murderous bastard. Even dopey Lefou undergoes a transformation, from token goofy sidekick to a demonic little creep capable of doing much damage. And how about that music? Not one song feels gratuitous, and every one is blessed with clever, poetic lyrics (sadly, the brilliant lyricist Howard Ashman died shortly before ""Beauty and the Beast"" was released). ""Belle"" is one of the best character songs ever written, and ""Be Our Guest"" is a lyrical and visual extravaganza, as well as a reminder of what a hell of a singer Jerry Orbach was. The ballroom scene is a masterpiece of cinema magic. With sweeping camera movements, glowing lights, and spellbinding special effects, it's truly a visual stunner. Enough of my hyperbole. You owe it to yourselves to see this ""tale as old as time""...",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The defining animation,"Beauty and the Beast follows a young French woman - Belle - in a small town with her inventor father. In the span of (literally) a five-minute song, it establishes Belle's character and her relationship with the town and the questionable Gaston. Remember when moviemakers were efficient with their time because physical film was expensive and Nielsen ratings didn't matter? The plot moves along with Belle finding her missing father in a mysterious castle and she's forced to make an ultimate sacrifice for the sake of her father. Remember when female characters were written as sympathetic? Most of the plot from here centers on Belle and her interactions with the enchanted household objects around the castle and its master with a few famous song numbers mixed in. What strikes me is the changing of seasons that communicates the passage of time. Another great storytelling technique is the 'showing' vs the disgusting exposition dumps modern movies tend to do. Like Belle seeing a ripped-up painting of a man. On the other side, it shows her father's determination to get her back as Gaston's internal ugliness begins to show. This culminates in arguable classic Disney's best princess dance and song, showing how the beast's ugliness is only on the surface. It becomes less about lifting the curse that plague's him and him just wanting Belle to be happy, even if it means his love is unrequited and it ultimately dooms him. The climax has one of the best villain songs ever and teaches the absolute dangers of mob-think. The final confrontation itself is based on emotion rather than spectacle, though it's no slouch in that department either and it will leave you wondering if maybe, just once, there isn't a happy ending when you need it the most...Voice acting is spot on. It really feels like a storybook come to life and the musical talent of the cast will absolutely keep you enthralled. The movie also really distinguishes its characters with unique voices and personalities to make sure you know who is who. And at the core of it, this movie is about its characters and that's why it succeeds.The soundtrack deserves all its merits. Even when the cast isn't singing, the music is some of the most iconic and memorable in all of cinema. And it's amazing how this musical in movie form doesn't sacrifice its music or its story/characters, finding the most effective and efficient way to blend both without compromise. It will stand the test of time.I cannot believe this movie only clocks in at 84 minutes. I feel like I'm getting three movies of value out of it. It wastes nothing, establishing characters and settings in such a slick manner but never feels like an incomplete film or story. It really shows that you don't need three-hour films to deliver a story.The hand drawn animation is so full of life unlike the soulless modern 3D CGI most animation is now. If you want the best visual experience, invest in a 4K QLED TV to truly take in the vibrant color palette. Without question, it's the difference between animators and people who animate. One is a craft, a love, and a passion and the other is a dispassionate paycheck.The rewatchability is amazingly high. This movie was meant to be rewatched endlessly by people and their children and their children's children and so on. It has good life lessons that are timeless for all generations to learn from but still be entertained.Handing out a perfect score should not be done lightly, but Beauty and the Beast does deserve its praise. Back when the Oscars still had some credibility and relevance, even they gave this a nomination and though it didn't win, the need for a best animation category became apparent. Get your physical copy on this one and if you're craving more, check out the animated cartoon 'Gargoyles' for a different take on the 'tale as old as time'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Disney's finest films!,Beauty and the Beast is a film that doesn't really on the overly cuteness that most of the Disney fans are used to. It also tells a classic fairy tale to the T.Belle is a young smart and independent woman who wants to live an adventurous life. A man named Gaston wants the affection of Belle but she isn't interested in him because he seems more interested in himself than the intentions of her. Here Belle is cast as a very strong female unlike most of the other films that portray the female as nothing more than the typical love lorn princess.One day her father goes out of town. While on his way to where he is going he gets lost in the woods and comes across an enchanted castle that is owned by a prince who is cursed with a spell for his selfish ways and takes the form of an ugly beast. The Beast locks Maurice away in his castle. Belle gets worried after her father hasn't come back and she goes looking for him and finds the castle. While she tries to take her father away the Beast finds her and tells her to leave. Belle tells the Beast to let her father go and in return she will live with him in the castle forever. Belle makes some new friends with the castle staff who are also enchanted under the spell and take the form of utensils and appliances. One of the most popular characters being Mrs. Potts.One day Belle travels to the West Wing which the Beast told her not to visit because it is forbidden although she can visit any other room. While going around the West Wing she finds the rose that holds the spell over the castle and tries to check it out but the Beast finds her and tells her to leave and never come back. Belle leaves and she is surrounded in the woods by wolves. The Beast comes to her rescue and gets hurt in the process. Belle takes him back and takes care of his wound. The Beast starts to have feelings for Belle and thinks that she is the one who will break the spell and eventually he lets her leave because she is concerned for her father. I won't spoil the rest.Beauty and the Beast has catchy songs without being over the top. There are plenty of laughs in the film as well.

The Prince says no and he is turned into a Beast (surprise!) as punishment for his selfish and shallow nature, and the curse will only be lifted if he can get someone to love him before the last rose petal wilts on his 21st birthday.But lets take a closer look at this, shall we?Right at the very end of the film, the last petal falls, and since the film only takes place over a couple of days (thanks to one of the most economical scripts I've ever seen), and the curse has been on the Prince and his servants for 10 years (as Lumiere sings in 'Be Our Guest' – ""Ten years we've been rusting""), I think there is only one thing to take from all this:The Prince was only TEN YEARS OLD when the curse was put on him!No wonder he was scared of the ""old beggar woman"" who came to his castle. He's ten years old, all alone on a dark stormy night, his parents are nowhere to be found, clearly his servants are neglecting him as well as he had to answer the door himself, and he confronted with a hideous old crone. What ten year old wouldn't be scared by that?!And then he has to find love as a beast when he wasn't even old enough to have had a chance to develop any understanding of love as a human! No wonder he's been so angry all these years.Think about that next time you watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The most touching love story ever,"The best animated movie ever, as it is the only movie to get a nominee for best picture. The cast and the characters were excellent, one can only wish that he gets a girl like Belle in real life.

"Brilliant, Beautiful, and Enchanting!","I had recently re-watched this excellent film and I find it even more remarkable now than when I had seen it years ago. Everything about the film from the voice acting to the character design, to the production design and animation and so on is all unsurpassed. But the music, that wonderful music - the songs and the orchestral pieces - is absolutely pure genius. The work done by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman is so effective that when Belle and the Beast started dancing with Angela Lansbury singing 'Beauty and the Beast', yours truly, a 29 year old man who probably has a lot in common with Gaston ('cept I cook my eggs), started to choke back the emotion without great success. And I never cry at movies*. But this is not a movie or a cartoon or a Disney merchandising gimmick. Beauty and the Beast is true art. It is an emotionally compelling, spiritually uplifting, and thoroughly joyous exploration of the human condition. I think it is one of greatest motion pictures ever made.*The end of Millennium Actress by Satoshi Kon, another animated film incidentally, was the only movie that ever had me literally bawling like a little girl.

Middle of Disney's Golden Age,"Belle, whose father is imprisoned by the Beast, offers herself instead and discovers her captor to be an enchanted prince.This film was right in the middle of Disney's golden age, sandwiched between ""Aladdin"" and ""Little Mermaid"", pushing the boundaries of digital animation (just a few years before Pixar blew Disney out of the water). And the songs... definitely quite memorable.For me, Belle is the best princess Disney has had to date. While not an outright feminist role model like ""Brave"" was intended to be, she is a woman whose strengths are not in physical beauty, but in her intelligence. I think that was a great decision. Sure, she is not ugly, but the focus was on her being more than just ""a prize to be won"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best Disney movie ever.,"This film was part of my childhood and, contrary to others, continued to be part of my adult life because it is virtually the best animated film I've ever seen. It adapts a French classic story but we can even say that it has surpassed it. It is a simple but very beautiful story, in which a prince was cursed by his errors and arrogance, living in an isolated castle, condemned to look like a monster until a woman truly loves him with all his faults. The center of the plot is true love and inner beauty vs. exterior ugliness. Considered among the most beautiful love stories, it also addresses redemption and forgiveness, the notion that we can mend our mistakes and be better people. Visually beautiful, its a show of light and color from beginning to the end, punctuated abundantly by songs that became famous, such as ""Be Our Guest"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"". The work of voice actors is simply at the level of the best I've heard. Since it debuted, this film continues without a worthy rival, even among the modern animated films, full of digital resources.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Still one of Disney's finest animated movies.,"In light of the live-action remake coming out, I decided to write-up a review for the original film. Beauty and the Beast: the first ever animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars; and rightfully so. 26 years on, and this film still holds up. It holds up so well, that I think remaking it was basically pointless. I mean it worked; but right here the film is still freshly entertaining on its own, in its original traditionally-animated glory.What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said? I don't know; but I still love it being a fully-grown man and all. And this film competed with The Silence of the Lambs at the Oscars for Best Picture (which Lambs won). Still, THAT competition says something about the power and impact this movie had at the time. Beauty and the Beast was the piece that resulted in the creation of the Oscar's 'Best Animated Feature' award being created.The story's your traditional 'beautiful on the inside' narrative that Disney helped turn into a mainstay thanks to its updating of the studio's fairy-tale medium. Its flipping of the fairy-tale conventions made it a standout of the time, as it did the original story's publication in 1740.Like they say, the original is always the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I really like the vest.,"The Disney plus alphabetical walkthrough again lands me on one of the undisputed classics from that early 90's golden period that Disney enjoyed. Nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, ""Beauty and The Beast"" is a timeless film, with some of the best songs that any Disney film enjoys.Eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart) is imprisoned for trespassing by a reclusive monster who owns a rundown French estate. His daughter Belle (Paige O'Hara) agrees to be incarcerated in her father's place, but comes to get to know and appreciate The Beast (Robby Benson) and his unusual house and serving staff. But Belle has another suitor, the town braggard Gaston (Richard White) who plans to make her his bride, by any means necessary.It's the songs that make ""Beauty and The Beast"". As you watch the film, it's a procession of hits of increasing quality, even though any film would be proud to have just one of them. Belle, Be Our Guest, Gaston, Something there and then the titular song are so impressive - and it's especially sad that Howard Ashman wouldn't live long enough to collect his Oscar for the lyrics. We shouldn't overlook the performers too, including Broadway greats Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach.Visually it's very impressive also, with very early CGI used on the elaborate ballroom scene, iconic character design and excellent backgrounds. Admittedly though, there is the odd issue with the story - timescales particularly being rather a confusing aspect. As an adult I brush up a little against Belle's dismissive attitude to the townsfolk who work for a living, whilst she swans about, being handed books free of charge.Those are niche complaints though, of an old man looking for a hot take, the film itself in undeniable. Two sequels and a remake to come though!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

One of Disney's Most Memorable Features.,"Effortlessly enduring the test of time, Beauty and the Beast manages to retain the same flair & charm that made it an instant classic during its time of release, The story covers the relationship between a beast who once was a prince before he was turned into a monster as a punishment for his selfishness & a young, beautiful woman named Belle who is imprisoned in his castle.Elegantly presented with pleasant songs, heartwarming music & superb use of imagination as well as humour, the film even today manages to grip its viewers into its fairy tale right from the opening moments. The animation is dazzling, voice acting is impressive, each frame is finely detailed plus the story is very well narrated & paced too.On an overall scale, Beauty and the Beast isn't the best ever Disney film in my book but it surely is amongst the most memorable ones. Its message i.e. ""looks never really matter when you own a f*cking castle :P"" is heard loud & clear and makes sense even today. One of Walt Disney's finest offerings that works even better as an enchanting story of love, Beauty and the Beast is a delightful musical that should still appeal equally to people of all ages.

A good fun movie not oscar quality,"First the good points.The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it didn't  deserved it.let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have "" A TALE AS OLD AS TIME""captivatLY and beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear; and Alan Menken's score is his finest work with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman the songs themselves are good,but rather the way they are presented - for example, the opening song with Belle - personally I didn't really get why the WHOLE TOWN was singing about Belle. I know it's called ""suspension of disbelief"", but I still wasn't that fond of that scene.""Like Gaston"" was the best tune, and the scene of course was great followed by ""kill the beast"" for it's fun lyrics. Humor here is fun (the final battle scene between the servants-cum-appliances/whatever and Gaston's mob - such as when the one guy is eaten by a closet and comes out dressed in a bikini with Marge Simpson hair).  Also the way that Lamier and Cogsworth are towards each other is quite funny at times.Gaston, one of my all time favorite Disney villains. Gaston is so complex. One minute, he's just an arrogant, stuck-up bum that is reminisicent of someone we all know and find irritating. Yet, he manages to add a little humor in his attempts to woo Belle. Then, he turns into a real jerk, willing to lock Maurice up to get Belle. And finally, he becomes pure evil, ready to kill the Beast to win Belle. That mocking laugh and look he gives the Beast when he says, ""What's the matter? Too kind and gentle to fight back?"" is one of the greatest scenes in Disney villainry history. A rare few scenes rank up with the amount of evil emotion that this scene has, such as Scar giving Mufasa an incredibly horrifying look before murdering him, or Jafar laughing like an insane lunatic after banishing Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet to the Ends of the Earth. Great moments that illustrate just how dark a villain can be.Now the not soo good points or FLAWS THAT ARE TOLABLE Plot holes: When the enchantress shows up disguised as an old beggar woman, the prince answers the door. Why is he doing this, when he has servants to answer the door for him?  Also here he looks like an older teenager when according to the story he was 11 years old when this happened.How can Bell's father build such a complicated machine (wood cutter) if doesn't know what tools to use on it. Why does it seem the horse is smarter than Bell's father when they get  lost in the woods.  The horse wants to go down the less scary path but Bell's father chooses the scarier path (go figure).I like the homage to ""sound of Music"" when Bell runs up the green hill singing after she rejectes Gaston's proposal' That horse of Bell's must be part hound dog to know where Bell's father ended up in the castle.  (remember the horse took off before Bell's father made it to the castle). Lumier (the candlestick) must be extra magical by the way he can ignite himself anytime he wants.The musical number ""Be our Guest"" is way to ""disney"" in that it's style and presentation has been done in too many other movies.  Although the song ""Human Again' musical sequence was excellently done and a most welcome addition for the movie's special edition release it was done to Disney"" for my liking also.VERY BIG FLAWS THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BEING A 10/10 MOVIEBell must be ""super woman"" by the way lifts up the Beast onto the  horse to take him back to the castle, even though he must weigh about 300 pounds (after wolf pack battle). And again later when she holds the beast so he doesn't fall off the roof at the end of his battle with Gastou.How did chip figure out how to work the ""wood cutter"" and start the fire and control the direction it went when it was parked on top of the hill. (huh?)THEORY: when Bell goes into the west wing and into the Beast's private room, she does notice his human picture (she pulls up the torn sections)  So she knows that the Beast is really human.  So that is why she falls in love with him.  She knows from all the fiction books she read that there must be a way to turn him back into a man.  That is why she acts the way she does toward him.Why isn't  Bell or her father or the towns people spooked by all the ""living"" items they encounters in the castle.Continuity: The seasons change several times throughout the movie. When Maurice is thrown out of the pub, he lands in a pile of snow. When others leave, the pile is not there. Gaston and others are wearing short-sleeved shirts in the snow. When Belle and the beast go outside (in the winter) after dancing, they are in shirt sleeves and crickets are heard.  Also in the final act Bell arrives home (it's still winter) Then later that night apparently,  during the climatic scene between The Beast and Gastou (it's starts raining).Continuity: At the beggining, the Beast scratches his own painting from top-left to bottom-right, later Belle discovers the paint and it's scratched from top-right to bottom-left.Continuity: After the Gaston song, the bear rug moves from behind the chair to under the chair.FINAL VERDICTI see ""Beauty and the Beast"" as one of those movies that you watch over and over  again if you are in the right frame of mind like ""leaving your brain at the door"" and ignoring all the continuity problems and pot holes that show up.  then you can relive the magic and atmosphere of the film  and be taken in by the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper.  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A Tale As Old As Time But Never Gets Old,"Much like Lion King, Disney is releasing another of their traditionally animated films to the 3D big screen. Three guesses which one. Anyway, I figured this was as good a time as any to give this a review.Beauty and the Beast is a tale of a beautiful woman who meets a horrible beast and changes his attitude for the better. Simple, but Disney takes this tale to new heights. First of all, Belle(the beauty) is a very pretty young woman but is seen as an outcast in her village because she doesn't put out like the other girls and rather prefers to spend her time reading books. The most popular man in the village, Gaston, wants to marry Belle because he considers himself the most beautiful creature to ever enter the Earth and Belle to be as beautiful as him. But Belle can't stand him and keeps refusing his attempts at courtship.The plot really kicks off when Belle's eccentric father, Maurice, travels to a fair to show off his new invention. He get's lost along the way and is chased by a pack of wolves to a mysterious castle. There he finds that the household objects are all enchanted. There's Cogsworth(a clock), Lumiere(a candlestick), Mrs. Potts(A teapot) you get the gist. The master of the castle however, is a beast with a serious attitude problem. He locks Maurice in his dungeon and a few days later Belle finds the castle while looking for him. Belle opts to take Maurice's place as Beast's prisoner.What follows is the typical romance formula of two people who can't stand each other at first but slowly come to care and love for one another. Only this is one of those times where it's done perfectly. First of all they don't start really building a relationship until Belle chews Beast out on his temper and Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves when she tries to leave. You start to see Beast's attitude really change for the better. He starts wearing better clothes, his voice becomes softer even his animation seems a little lighter.Near the end of the film Belle leaves to attend her sick father and Gaston finds out about the Beast and Belle's feelings toward him. He leads an assault on his castle which leads to an entertaining climax with the enchanted objects and a pretty intense fight between Beast and Gaston.This movie is great. The animation is great, the characters are well written, everything is great. And I don't think I have to mention the songs. I'm sure we're all familiar with ""Be Our Guest"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"" and they're great every time I hear them. Much like Lion King the only bad thing about the movie comes from an edit in the special edition. ""Human Again"" was designed for the original release but was cut probably for time purposes. It saw the light of day on Broadway and was added to the ten year anniversary edition in 2002. Well it's not a terrible song but it does interrupt the flow of the film.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of all ages. I'll probably go see it when it hits the big screen and I suggest you do the same.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Enchanting,"This is my all-time favorite tale of Disney's since I was a little child. It has a heroine whose brain isn't overshadowed by her beauty. It has a story of redemption and giving another chance. It has exquisite music and memorable lyrics. The antagonist and his sidekick are over-the-top hilarious which is more than welcome. It's a full package of family entertainment with guaranteed satisfaction.This is one of the rare times when I prefer an adaptation work to the original book(s). Having already read both books by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve (1740) and Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (1756), I can bravely declare that the tweaks of Disney's story-line paid off and added a lot of charm to the original old tale.

"With a compelling romance, great characters and some of the best musical numbers, Beauty and the Beast is still magical and enchanting in its 30th anniversary","I remember watching the film on video certain times when I was a kid. I got really scared at the parts involving Beast but the romance between him and Belle helped me get past those parts. Not only that, but it kept me engaged.That being said, I wanna talk about why Beauty and the Beast still holds up after 30 years.The story is well written with a good prologue on Beast's backstory to how he became cursed by an enchantress. Not to mention the Beast had some character development as he goes from an angry frightening beast to a soft and gentle person upon taking more time to get to know Belle more. There's even a haunting atmosphere on the Beast's castle when the Beast got cursed. Also the romance is compelling with Belle and Beast giving some great and believable chemistry together.The characters are great. Belle is one of the better Disney Princesses due to her helping the Beast and for being very smart and strong willed and Beast is one of the better male characters due to his backstory and his character development. The side characters are also great. Maurice is a nice quirky father who became imprisoned by Beast, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, and the other enchanted objects cursed by the enchantress are entertaining and provided some nice comedy while also doing some tender moments. Le Fou makes for a funny yet sinister sidekick to Gaston who is a great Disney villain due to his motivations on wanting to marry Belle. Voice acting wise, everyone did a great job including Paige O Hara, Robby Benson, Richard White, the late actors Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers, Angela Lansbury, Jesse Corti, Bradley Pierce and the late Rex Everhart.The animation is gorgeous and beautiful especially the character designs and the backgrounds including Belle's house and the Beast's castle. Even the ballroom dance sequence is great with some solid use of computer technology making it one of the best in Disney history.And last but not least the music and songs from Alan Menken and Howard Ashman who died from heart failure caused by HIV/AIDS which the movie was dedicated to. Alan Menken provided a romantic and haunting atmosphere throughout the whole film while the songs are some of the best in any Disney musical the best being Belle, Gaston, Be Our Guest, and the title song (sung wonderfully by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson).Overall, Beauty and the Beast is still magical and enchanting after 30 years. Wuth great characters, wonderful musical numbers, gorgeous animation and a well written story, this will always be a tale as old as time.

"A very real, human story about appearances and learning to love someone for who they really are","Beauty and the Beast, the animated film as it was produced in 1991 by the Walt Disney corporation, is a beautiful, nuanced work of art. It's a film that trusts its audience and tells a very real, human story about appearances and learning to love someone for who they really are, not just what they project, which is illustrated so beautifully in its three characters at the center of the love triangle-Gaston, Belle, and the Beast. The simplicity and brevity of the film is to its benefit: the story enclosed is a premise with character archetypes so simple a child can understand and the execution of it is so nuanced that an adult can appreciate and re-examine their own perspectives on life and love... that's almost a once-in-a-lifetime kind of story. I could've done with a bit more character development on Belle's father, for example, or delved a little deeper into some of the castle servants' backstory, but I don't think, say, a live-action remake clocking in an hour longer of finished film is the answer here.

Incredible and Magical,"Of all the movies I have ever seen in my life, none of them have affected me and moved me in a more positive way than Beauty and the Beast.The animation is beautiful, the music is stunning, and the story, which is really why this movie is so good, touches within each of us, an emotion that we can all relate to. Each of us in our own way wants to be loved and accepted, and the way that Belle and the Beast found each other, and how their relationship progressed is something that each of wish would happen to us at some level or another.I tried hard to find something wrong with this movie. I can't. It is one of the few movies I have seen that is flawless. I have always been a huge fan of animation because I believe it allows us to explore realms in our imagination that a live action film simply can't deliver because of its limitations.

Still the best Disney movie after all these years,"It's pretty safe to say that the Disney renaissance is a group of movies that have influenced movies A LOT and made animation what it is today. Almost every single one is filled with memorable songs, characters and settings, and while some aren't very good, the ones that are good are some of my all time favorite movies. And as you might have guessed, Beauty and the Beast is the best one in my opinion. There is just something magical about all of it. Belle is one of my favorite Disney princesses, and the Beast is equally great. Their relationship is so well realized and it progresses naturally, it is to this day the only love story in a disney movie that has given me goosebumps. Something about seeing the 2 doing only what they think will make the other one happy makes for some of the most heartwarming scenes in any disney movie. The movie also has an amazing villain in Gaston, who balances out the touching love story with some great comedy, while also serving as a legitimate threat. The setting is also great and so is the animation. The castle is well designed and animated, and the cgi used for some of the grander shots is pretty good. The songs are all good, the climax is well set up and the ending is satisfying. I cannot think of a single thing this movie does wrong, it's the best movie Disney has ever made in my opinion, and it will continue to be that for a long time I think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The film has not dated well...,"I saw the film on the big screen last night at the Harvard Film Archive and I have to say that it has not aged well. There are odd plot devices with mess with continuity and poor animation at times. Regarding the first point, Belle's horse pops in and out as she conveniently needs it. She gains super-human strength having hoisted the Beast onto her horse and pulling his massive weight back onto the balcony at the climax. I realize the problems of configuring a fairy tale to fit into a 70 minute all-ages format but it messes with the mystery of the fairy tale.'Snow White' was as linear a narrative, but there was intense attention to detail and empathy. You never really know what it motivating characters in 'Beast'. She goes from hating him to loving him from one scene to the next. Her own character comes off as conceited as Gaston at times. (Me?! The wife of that boorish...) Additionally, the attention to detail and consistency in character design now seems like light-years from this film. Each character looks as though drawn by a different hand which shows the lack of control in art direction that exists now. Some of these are down right sloppy in long-shots. 'Beauty' was a transitional film as the studio was adapting to more digital techniques (digital ink and paint, computer animation) and the glitches in hand-drawn techniques help to date the film. At times the Beast is massive in scale and at others (after her befriends Belle) he is only slightly larger than her. It becomes cumbersome to look at him after a while. Once he does 'come into the light', his mystery is broken and the final design feels unsatisfactory. The supporting characters (townspeople, etc.)are not drawn well at all and one needs only to look at a film like 'Pinocchio' to see what solid animation art direction is. I understand why 'Beauty' makes everyone's top movie lists but it deserves criticism as much as any other film especially since the bar has been raised for animation storytelling since 1991.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"This Should Have Won Best Picture, Not Just Nominated.","Beauty and the Beast has always been one of my favorite Disney movies. It was one of my favorite movies to watch with my sister when we were kids, and it's still in my Top 10 favorite Disney movies today.The plot follows a young woman named Belle, a bookworm who comes across a cursed prince who was transformed into a beast by a witch. He has captured her father, and she offers to take his place.Little does she realize that her brave decision will be his redemption from the curse- which also affects his servants (including a teapot, teacup, clock, and candle)- for the curse can only be broken if someone can learn to love The Beast.As an adult, one of the most appreciative elements of Beauty and the Beast is the love story. Most Disney Princess movies have a formula of the girl dreaming of a mystery prince, her finding the prince, and then almost immediately getting married.Beauty and the Beast is not like that. Belle doesn't even like The Beast at first, and she refuses to have dinner with him the first night she lives in the castle. It takes some time for them to actually fall in love, and that's what a great romance needs.Beauty and the Beast also has some great songs- like Belle, Gaston (where the villain's friends boast about how great he is), Be Our Guest, and the titular Beauty and the Beast, sung by Mrs. Potts when Belle and Beast begin to fall in love. There is also a wonderful rendition of the song in the credits by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.The animation is glorious as well- such as the opening shot of the castle and the stained glass images, the musical numbers, and the camera motion-like movements of the dance scene.The cast also does a wonderful job as well. Most of the actors are mostly known only for this movie- but Jerry Orbach (Baby's father in Dirty Dancing) voices the candle Lumiere, and Angela Lansbury voices Mrs. Potts. Mary Kay Bergman voices a feather duster, and she would later do the female voices in the beginning of South Park. Yes, I'm serious.All of these elements- the animation, songs, cast, and most importantly the well told story, were critically praised when this was released back in 1991. Siskel and Ebert both had Beauty and the Beast in their top 10 of the year, and another critic that I admire, James Berardinelli (who created reelviews.net) says that this is the best animated movie ever made.In fact, it's his 58th favorite movie, and the only animated movie he gives 4/4 stars apart from the tragic but masterful Grave of the Fireflies.With acclaim and quality like this, it's no wonder that Beauty and the Beast was the first animated movie ever to get a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. It would also be the only one for 18 years- then Up was nominated for 2009 and Toy Story 3 was nominated a year later.Sadly, while it got such an honorable nomination, it did not win. Of all movies, The Silence of the Lambs won instead. That's a good movie too, but I have always considered that to be the worst decision the Oscars have ever made. Musicals and romances are more Oscar-type than horror movies, so I have always felt that this loss was quite the injustice.In fact, animated movies were gaining popularity in the 90s, and this led to the Best Animated Feature category in 2001, which to me feels like the Academy just views animation as cartoons, and not a unique form of cinematic storytelling.Regardless, Beauty and the Beast did get nominated, and I'm glad that it did. It's one of the best stories Disney has ever told, and this tale as old as time should forever be considered timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Best Disney movie,"Call me a Disney shill, but I have never been able to resist watching a Disney movie, no matter how intrusive the songs, how inappropriate the comic relief, how formulaic the plot. This, however, has got to be my favorite of all of them. Every time I see it, it still creates some sort of magic with me. The story is a good retelling of the original fairy tale, which would have made for a very boring movie. The voices are perfect for their characters, and there is no overtly brash comic relief. The music flows nicely with the story, and I can (and will) still sing many of the songs on demand (or not).

It invites all of us to ""be guests"" to a world full of magic and beauty in moralistic detail. The many songs in this film indicate the saying ""beauty is found within"", reminding us that appearances don't matter necessarily because we are beautiful for what we are.

Beauty and the Beast: A Disney cartoon as old as time,"I always thought that of all the Disney cartoons, ""Beauty and the Beast"" took the cake for being one of the greatest Disney cartoons ever released in 1991. You see, I got a copy of this Disney cartoon on DVD as part of the Walt Disney 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD series that showcases some of Disney's greatest animated films as it was said in some DVD booklets that came with the Disney DVDs themselves. You see, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the very first Disney cartoon to use computer animation techniques, notably the backgrounds.Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and based on the well known fairy tale, it all begins in a peaceful village, and a young girl named Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) takes a stroll around, and at one point when she reads a book by a fountain, one of the sheep tears off a page and eats it. Later on, Belle's father, Maurice (voiced by Rex Everhart), shows her his latest invention that he will take it to a local fair. When he gets lost in the middle of the woods, Maurice escapes from a pack of wolves and ran into a castle complete with gargoyle statues and everything else.When Maurice says ""Hello? Hello? Is someone there?"", he gets welcomed by a candelabrum named Lumiere (voiced by Jerry Orbach), a clock named Cogsworth (voiced by David Ogden Stiers), a teapot named Mrs. Potts (voiced by Angela Lansbury), and a teacup named Chip (voiced by Bradley Pierce). But just as Maurice was about to settle down for a cup of tea, he gets imprisoned by a hideous Beast (voiced by Hal Smith), who happens to be a handsome Prince (voiced by Robby Benson) under a magical curse, and a spoiled, selfish, and unkind one too. The result: many years ago of a winter's night, an old woman came to the castle's entrance and offers Prince a rose, but Prince refuses and tells her to go away. The old woman then changed herself into a fairy, tells Prince that he had no love in his heart, and turns him into the monster of the same name. It's up to Belle to make Beast learn the true meaning of love just by angering him at a couple points, and such.Meanwhile, back at the village, Belle's macho fiancé, Gaston (voiced by Richard White), who is that much of a game hunter, makes several attempts to make Belle his wife, and thinks Maurice is a ""crazy old man"" when Maurice shouts, ""He's got her locked in a dungeon! A Beast! A horrible monstrous Beast!"" And that's not all. In just a couple moments later, towards the end of this Disney cartoon, Gaston wants to kill Beast, and have his head mounted on his wall...The supporting characters in there also include Philippe the Horse (also voiced by Hal Smith), Gaston's goofy looking sidekick, Lefou (voiced by Jesse Corti), a Wardrobe (voiced by Jo Anne Worley), and Monsieur D'Arque (voiced by Tony Jay). In ""Beauty and the Beast"", the characters can be distinguishing just by judging by their personalities as well as their habits. For instance, Beast is a powerful character much like Stromboli from another Disney cartoon, ""Pinocchio"", and Monsieur D'Arque is much like Coachman from ""Pinocchio"" as well.The songs wrote by composer Alan Menken are very catchy, including ""Be Our Guest"", ""Gaston"", ""The Mob Song"", ""Human Again"", and the most memorable, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Everybody loves this Disney cartoon's humorous moments (Wardrobe landing on a villager for example, and a couple others to name a few), as well as touching scenes (at one point, for instance, before turning back into Prince's old self, Beast dies in Belle's arms before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls off) for many years to come just like the other Disney cartoons did.By the way. In the Disney cartoon/video game ""Kingdom Hearts"" series, Belle, Beast (now voiced by Robby Benson since ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" and ""Belle's Magical World"", even with a little help of some equipment and devices that they used in the 1996 film ""Ransom"" which starred Mel Gibson), Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Wardrobe, and Prince (appearing at the ""Kingdom Hearts II"" end credits) cope with Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy as Sora, Donald, and Goofy battle the Heartless, Nobodies, and the Orginization 13.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
a wonderful and timeless musical,"'Beauty and the Beast' is a classic love story that anyone will enjoy, whether you're a small child, a teenager, an adult, or an elderly person. It's a film that's charming, elegant, and sweet, not to mention funny. The songs are fantastic, and share the honor with 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' of having the best lineup of songs. I guarantee you'll remember at least three of them for years to come, including 'Be Our Guest', and the classic 'Beauty and the Beast'. The story follows Belle, a beautiful girl living in an rural area. She has always lived to assist her father, a desperate inventor who seems to be losing his marbles. When he goes off to an inventor's show and gets lost, Maurice's horse returns to Belle, and they set off to find him. Maurice is discovered in a colossal castle, filled with mysterious inhabitants, including the master, a fierce and horrifying beast. Belle persuades the Beast to take her instead of her father, and thus the story begins. Belle soon discovers there could be so much more to this beast than rage and hair (laughs). Filled with excellent actors including the late Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury, B&B is simply excellent, a beautiful romance that will attract any viewer to its unavoidable charm. As quoted in the song, it's a tale as old time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast.8/10 --spy",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Only Animated Film Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar,"""Beauty and the Beast"" may not be the best animated film ever made, but its 1991 Best Picture Oscar nomination puts it in a very select class of films. A class that does not include other great animated classics like ""Snow White"", ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Cinderella"", and ""The Lion King"".  There is something about this film that makes it stand out from other animated classics.  The storyline is superb, the music and songs are perfect, and the direction (yes, the film's direction) is focused and unrelenting.  All in all, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film that was worthy of its Best Picture nomination back in 1991.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
10/10,"Although Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's most beloved movies, it is also one of the studio's crowning achievements, and one of the very, very few that can be ranked up with Walt's movies. This, in my opinion, is the best movie of the so-called ""Disney Renaissance"", and is better than The Lion King. Maybe it's just me, but this film has more of that Disney magic than Lion King ever had. The animation, story, characters, and songs are all top notch.If you have seen some of my other reviews, you may notice that I am very biased towards classic Disney movies, and many of the modern movies don't have the same magic as the ones made by the man himself. But, like I said previously, this one does. It feels like home, with a clean story, but also a grand, classy touch. The animation, obviously using the CAPS (Computer Animation Production System) method, looks stunning, and blends the CGI used in scenes such as the famous ballroom scene perfectly.I think it's worth mentioning the intro, which is one of the my favorite movie moments. Instead of opening with a storybook, the prologue is shown visually with stained glass windows, which already makes the movie stand apart from many others made by Disney. The chorus at the end pays homage to the classics, and the songs are extremely memorable.Of course, although a fairytale, many have considered this to be a ""reverse fairytale"" because the prince is not handsome from the start, and the princess has to ""save"" him. Speaking of Belle, she is easily one of the best Princesses, and is a perfect representation of how to show a feminine woman with both brains and beauty, inside and out. The character development is great, especially with the Beast, and the side characters have wonderful personalities in addition to bringing importance to the story. Gaston is a quintessential Disney villain; right up there with Malificent and Cruella De Vil. He's one of the more realistic ones, and you could probably spot people like him in real life, since his motivations and attitudes are similar to that of Lady Tremaine and even Frollo.Despite all these raves about this fantastic movie, my favorite part has to be the lore behind the curse. The logic of it always fascinated me, and every moment/scene of the movie has a purpose; whether it is to develop Belle and Beast's relationship, or show the dynamics of the supporting cast. The story flows well, and although some may believe that Belle stayed at the castle for a few days or even a week, it always made the most sense to me for her to be there for at least a couple months.I'd highly recommend you to see this movie, but you've probably already seen it, right? Well, it's definitely worth multiple watches, and you learn more about the story with each viewing. The magic is still there as you grow older, and ages like fine wine; it's one of those childhood staples that only gets better with age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It's A Tale As Old As Time,"It has beautifully stunning animation that's gloriously hand-drawn as well as the fantastically painted backgrounds. The main stand-out is Belle and The Beast's dance sequence that has amazing CGI that fits perfectly with the hand-drawn animation. Something to be expected when it comes to Disney movies, especially ones from their renaissance era. Not to mention how this film had a grand total of 600 animators and artists alike working on it for 4 years, so of course it looks amazing.Very excellent characterization for every single character in the film.Belle is a fun-loving action girl who cares deeply for those around her. This is first evident when she decides to surrender herself to the Beast and make herself a prisoner in his castle in exchange for him letting her father go. Her kindness towards the Beast eventually proves to be enough to convince him to change his ways and become a better person.The Beast himself was originally a spoiled and arrogant prince who was cursed into taking a monster-like form after proving his selfishness to a disguised enchantress asking for shelter from a storm. After isolating himself in his castle from the rest of the world, he had given up on hope of ever turning back into a human, but Belle's kindness changes his heart, and eventually is what brings him back from his transformed state.Belle's father Maurice, while he doesn't receive as much focus or exploration as Belle of Beast, is still a likable character. What truly makes him more than just the typical ""bumbling father"" that's already been done to death (even before the release of this movie) is the fact that he's a great source of Belle's motivation as a character.It has wonderful vocal performances from Paige O' Hara as Belle, Richard White as Gaston, Robby Benson as the Beast, and David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth and the Narrator.Gaston is a very good villain, who actually doesn't start out as a villain, but becomes one since he's used to getting what he wants. As in the beginning of the movie, he's just a typical tough guy and a spoiled handsome man who hates books but wants to marry Belle. After discovering that she had fallen in love with the Beast, he recruits an army of civilians to storm the castle and kill the Beast after convincing them all that he was nothing more than a vicious, blood-thirsty monster. It's also worth noting that he actually almost wins in the end after stabbing Beast in the back, killing him at first, but ultimately falls to his death shortly after.LeFou is Gaston's tragic and funny henchmen.All of the main characters in the film have very interesting character developments. Gaston acts a double side of the coin for Beast: the Beast is hideous, and Gaston is handsome. When the Beast becomes kinder and nicer, Gaston becomes more and more evil.It has astoundingly written songs like
""Beauty and the Beast"", generally recognized as the film's main theme, is what truly displays how much Belle and Beast's relationship has grown over the course of the movie. It specifically addresses how it has managed to transform them, allowing their friendship (and later, love) to grow as Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Chip watch on. It is later reprised during the final dance.""Be Our Guest"" may not be a song with a huge amount of symbolism in the context of the story or foreshadowing to later events in the movie, but it's still incredibly enjoyable, memorable, and an easy earworm.Gaston's song is catchy, egotistical, and perfectly established Gaston's character as a spoiled handsome man even better than it had already been earlier in the movie. No one truly does make a catchy villain song like Gaston!""Something There"" is the movie's love song for the relationship between Belle and Beast. Emphasizing how Belle sees something in Beast that no one else does, and recognizes that he's more than just the hideous monster that everybody thought he was.""Belle"", the opening song, is a French and classical-inspired song that incorporates musical elements from both the Broadway and musical theater genres.It also has a lovely score perfectly orchestrated by Alan Menken.Angela Lansbury's (aka Mrs. Potts) rendition of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is nothing short of phenomenal and beautiful. In fact, she managed to perform the entire song in just one take and moved the recording studio to tears.The DVD/Blu-Ray versions contain the deleted song ""Human Again"", if you're more interested in the film's extended cut than the original.The scene where the Beast is killed by Gaston is very emotional, despite the film being rated G, albeit it didn't last long due to Belle's true love for the Beast being able to not just revive him, but also turn him back into a human. However, the scene itself with Belle crying over the Beast's body and declaring her love for him was still absolutely heartbreaking and enough to reduce many audience members to tears.And...We see that Mrs. Potts has other children in the film, but at the end of the film when the curse is lifted, we only see Chip turn back into human, and we never see or know the fate of his siblings.In the scene where the Beast faints right after he protects Belle from a wolf attack, she then covers him, so that he doesn't freeze to death. But in the next shot, we see the injured Beast magically lying across Belle's horse. How the heck did Belle managed to lift the giant Beast off the ground all by herself? This plot hole was essentially fixed in the 2017 live action remake.The story of Beast's curse is that while he was still a prince, it's stated that he was cursed by the enchantress when he was 11, 10 years prior to the film's events, and that the rose would bloom when he turned 21, which is also subtly hinted by Lumiere during the song ""Be Our Guest"" via the lyrics ""Ten years we've been rusting/Needing so much more than dusting"". But recalling the prince's portrait which showed the Beast when he was still human, it shows a grown adult and not an 11 year old boy, which confuses many people to this day.The very beginning of the film can be scary for younger viewers. The eerie music combined with the stained glass pictures, while both beautiful things when you're an adult, can also make kids too frightened from wanting to watch this movie at all.The Beast's first full appearance when he furiously confronts and drags away Maurice for trespassing in his castle. This scene can also frighten young viewers.Lumiere (as a redheaded human) and some of the background male villagers wore some different period costumes, which is quite inconsistent to fit the 18th century setting of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Just wonderful,Despite the serious tone of this tale Disney manages to make this one really kids friendly. Yes Beast is really scary at first and the dark scenes in the woods and castle are really creepy. I was actually really impressed how the movie makers came up with the idea of turning the other people in the castle into pieces of furniture because of the spell. It was genius how each person had become an object close to the task they were fulfilling in the castle. This makes of course for some really funny scenes. The constant squabbling between Pendule and Lumiere is priceless. Belle is pretty different from other Disney female heroes that she is not interested in romance at all (at least not until she discovers she soft side of Beast). Yes it is heartwarming how Beast changes from a coldhearted monster into a loving and tender man. Let's not forget the catchy songs which are pretty much the best parts of the movie wanting you to sing and dance along.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The worst film I've ever seen,"Walt Disney Pictures has had numerous animated trifles ever since the death of Walt Disney and this 1991 release is their worst one of all. I had seen it during its original theatrical run and even then I voted it the worst film I've ever seen. Almost eleven years later no film I've seen since has been worse and I don't expect any other film to take away this film's ""honor."" The lead character Belle is extremely whiny and insecure as well as unsure of herself. The Beast is actually more scary when he's not trying to be scary. His dialogue is mostly ridiculous. The ""enchanted"" objects get increasingly annoying as the film progresses. The so called bad guys are shallow and ""Be Our Guest"" has to be the most annoying song I've ever heard in an animated film. The other songs are no better. Film is only about an hour and a half long but it seems much longer at times and long before it was actually over I knew that I wanted it to end much sooner. Once again, my worst picture of 1991, my worst picutre of Walt Disney Pictures history, my worst picture of animated films history and my worst picture of all time.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The pinnacle of the Disney Renaissance and a near perfect film,"In a small French countryside village, Belle (Paige O'Hara) is the book loving daughter of eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart) who finds she doesn't quite fit in with the more superficially minded townsfolk. While Belle is intelligence, she also possesses beauty which attracts the attention of town hero Gaston (Richard White) who while handsome is also vain, arrogant, and a bully who doesn't let Belle's rejections deter him. When Maurice takes embarks on a journey to take his latest invention to the fair, he ends up lost in the woods and is separated from his horse and seeks refuge in an imposing castle where he finds enchanted objects who were once people and a vicious Beast (Robby Benson) who was once a prince until he was cursed by an enchantress for his cold heart. Angered by Maurice's trespassing he locks him in a dungeon. When Maurice's horse returns to Belle she quickly learns something is wrong and retraces his steps to the castle where she too encounters the Beast. Belle makes a deal with the Beast to trade places with Maurice and believing Belle might be the key to breaking his curse agrees. While initially Belle is fearful of the Beast overtime their relationship builds.The third film of the Disney Renaissance, Beauty and the Beast by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont had been considered for adaptation into animation as far back as the 1930s and 50s by Walt Disney with the project never progressing due to issues encountered by the Story team. Disney animation resurrected the project in the mid-80s with Richard Williams of the animation in Who Framed Roger Rabbit briefly courted for direction only for him to turn them down due to commitments to his work on Thief and the Cobbler. Richard Purdum then became attached as director during the first two years of development with the initial approach to the story being a non-musical take set in 19th century France that was aligned more with the source material such as having Beauty's father be a merchant driven to financial ruined. After Katzenberg saw the storyboard reels for Purdum's version he ordered everything to be scrapped and started over from scratch. After Purdum resigned, the reins were then passed to first time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale. Katzenberg also brought back Howard Ashman and Alan Menken of The Little Mermaid with the two having worked on Ashman's pet project Aladdin in the interim after it was determined the film would be a musical. When released the film became a massive success earning $145 million in the United States and $331 million worldwide making it the third highest grossing film that year behind Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Critical reception was also very enthusiastic with near unanimous praise and four Academy Award nominations including the first time such a film was nominated for Best Picture. Beauty and the Beast is a great film and it's undeniably the height of quality for the Disney renaissance.The central love story between Belle and Beast is great with our first introduction to the Beast being quite threatening as he's in shadows much of the time and the design work on the beast gives him a unique look that doesn't tie back to any particular real life creature looking like a mixture of bison, lion, and dog to create a visually memorable design. The dynamic between Belle and Beast feels very genuine and hits all the right notes that resonate in just the right way so we buy the situation as presented to us without questioning the internal logic or things of a similar nature (I'm aware of the comparisons to Stockholm syndrome). The movie also features a great villain in Gaston who sports a look similar to many Disney princes of past films of this ilk and the chiseled Adonis looks sported by Gaston in combination with his penchant for arrogance, vanity, and casual cruelty makes him a great villain. The music by Menken and Ashman (the latter of whom would be his final project due to tragic death by AIDS) is filled with songs that are as beautiful as they are memorable. Songs like ""Beauty and the Beast"" ""Gaston"" and ""Be Our Guest"" are earworms that will stick with you long after you see the movie. Last but not least the animation is gorgeous. Using the same computer assisted animation process as The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast creates memorable large scale scenes that are epic in scope with sweeping camera movements and dynamic motion that not only pulls you into the story (such as a great Ballroom sequence) but adds life to smaller details in the animation that add to the character.Beauty and the Beast is everything you expect from Disney firing on all cylinders. It's got great characters, great songs, great animation, and it's no question why it was nominated for Best Picture at the time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip.

Beauty and the Beast is fantastic!,"Like many children born in the 90's, I grew up on good old Walt Disney films, so in lieu of the live- action version of Beauty and the Beast coming to theaters in March, I decided to review one of my childhood favorites, the animated, 1991 version of Belle and the Beast's story.The movie opens with the tale of how Prince Adam, voiced by Robby Benson, became the infamous Beast. We learn of his great shallowness and his impending quest to find true love. Flash forward 10 years, we're introduced to Belle, voiced by Paige O'Hara, and the other members of her ""provincial town."" The story continues with Belle's father, Maurice, getting lost in the forest and stumbling upon the Beast's castle. Maurice is imprisoned for trespassing, and when Belle arrives, she offers to take her father's place in the castle. Belle now has to learn how to live with her new captor and his odd housing décor.Beauty and the Beast is truly enchanting. The artistry in every scene is impeccable. Each scene is drawn with a realistic style that maintains a dream-like element. The artists created the gorgeous French backdrop with beautiful sunsets and smooth rolling plains. Every detail is beautifully crafted. Belle's gold dress she wears in the ballroom scene is a great example of this. As her and Beast dance, it flows through the scene as if it were made of real organza. Each moment makes you want to reach out and run your fingers through Beast's fur or cup the snow that's fallen to the ground.The movie finds itself in each beautifully written and wonderfully performed song. From Be Our Guest to Beauty and the Beast, the voice actors do an incredible job with telling their story. The movie also doesn't just take one note with their songs. They vary from having large choruses like in Gaston to being understated and sweet duets like in Something There. These songs and dances evoke a type of joy and love that makes you want to watch them over and over again.Watching Beauty and the Beast brings a smile to my face and a warmth to my heart. I rate this movie two thumbs up. It's a great feel good movie for every age and every family member. I used to watch this movie with my dad, and I can't wait to watch it some day with my children and sing the classic songs together.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Beautiful, a classic Disney masterpiece...","I like Disney movies. Either they're a fanciful adaptation of a fairy tale, or if not, they are visually exciting. Beauty and the Beast is by far one of Disney's best. It's an adorable story with romance, comedy, and a little slapstick action. The characters are really well developed, particularly Belle, the Beast and the many implements of the house that play significant roles. They also provide the humor. The clock Cogsworth and the Candlestick Lumiere have a dynamic friendship with a brotherly knack for irritating each other.The motherly teapot, voiced by Angela Lansbury, is the calm, steady minded member of the house, and more often than not she can sets things straight.This really is a magical, beautiful film, almost more a work of art.

Simplified but beautiful,"This movie is an adaptation of the story from mid 18th century written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The original story is completely different and I prefer it to Disney's version, but I understand why did they have to take a totally different approach and I admit that the result is amazing. Still, I recommend you to read the original text because it will shine a new light on the story and give you insight in its depth and true meaning. Disney's movie is meaningful, but it's mostly just a fairy- tale, while the original has a much heavier background. This is the very first animated movie nominated for an Academy Award for the best picture. It didn't win it, but it won two other Oscars, for the original score and the title song.8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"More relevant now than ever, in a way","Beauty and the Beast is a gorgeous and enchanting fairy tale, to be sure, but Disney packed a lot of subtle social commentary on small town small mindedness in there. The people in the village Belle lives in dismiss her as ""odd"" for being an intelligent and bookish woman, fear the Beast because of his appearance, and worship the loutish Gaston, the very epitome of a musclebound meathead - and toxic masculinity.The latter character, who seemed like a thinking woman's worst nightmare when the film first came out, is now even more creepy, because his continual harassment of Belle reeks of Me Too. This makes him a hundred times more horrifying than more traditional Disney villains like Ursula or Malificent. Evil witches are only in fiction. Gaston clones are everywhere.Ultimately, the film's message is the triumph of open minds over closed ones, and that even society's so-called rejects can hold their heads high and triumph in the end. I can't imagine a more positive message to convey to kids.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An admirable 84 minutes of animation,"I was only five years old when this hit animated Disney flick came into theatres, and don't recall ever going to see any movies on the big screen when I was that young, so I obviously didn't see this one. A while later (I can't remember exactly when), I saw it on the small screen for the first time, and while I don't think I ever liked it as much as Disney's ""Aladdin"", it was enjoyable enough for me to watch several more times. Like many other Disney films, I'm still impressed with this one after rediscovering it.An enchantress casts a spell on a selfish prince, turning him into an ugly beast! She leaves him a rose, which will bloom until he turns 21. In order to break this spell, he must learn to love and be loved in return before the rose's last petal falls. If he fails to do so, the spell will be permanent. In a nearby village lives an inventor named Maurice, and his daughter, Belle, a bookworm who is not happy living in this village. One night, Maurice gets lost in the woods, and searches for a place to stay for the night. He comes across a castle, and doesn't know this is the Beast's castle! When the Beast sees him, he locks him up! Belle looks for her missing father, and finds him there. She begs the Beast to set him free and take her instead, and he accepts this offer, so Belle is now his prisoner. His 21st birthday is drawing near, and with Belle in his life, he finally has the chance try and break the spell before it's too late, but will he succeed?!While I don't like this Disney version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" as much as many others do, I can see why it's so popular. It may not have as much excitement as certain other Disney animated features, but it does have some (mainly towards the end, in my opinion). The movie also contains lot of humour, mainly thanks to Gaston (the rude, nasty man who wants to marry Belle) and Lefou (Gaston's silly assistant), as well as Lumiere and Cogsworth (two of the Beast's servants, one a candle and the other a clock due to the spell, who often get into fights with each other). Of course, the animation in the film is also something that deserves praise. So, while not the greatest film in Disney history, it's still one not to be forgotten!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the best ever!,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of the finest movies ever made.  Notice that I didn't say ""one of the finest animated movies""--it is a great film--period.I still remember how excited I was to see this movie, from the day I saw a cardboard stand-up at the local mulitplex.  I went on the night it opened, and I was moved from the haunting prologue onward.  This is the rare film that exceeded my expectations.  I've lost count of how many time I've seen it, but I did see it twelve times while it was in theatres (hey, it was out for eight months or something!).The animation is excellent, but the real key to ""Beauty""'s success is its wonderfully real characters.  There is nothing false about any of them. The songs, by Howard Ashman (lyrics) and Alan Menken (music), are moving, funny and catchy.  We all lost a great treasure when Howard Ashman died.  His lyrics were never dumbed down and always clever, enjoyable for adults and children alike.Special praise also goes out to the voice cast, who infuse their character s with life and real emotion.  Before Disney starting casting voices just because they belonged to famous movie stars, they actually cast people on the basis of talent.  Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Angela Lansbury, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and everyone else are fabulous!I forever lost faith in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when they gave the Oscar to ""Silence of the Lambs"" instead of ""Beauty and the Beast"".This will always be one of my all-time favorites!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Disney's best since its Uncle Walt was alive, but the attempts at feminism fall flat.","Beauty and the Beast is a very entertaining, very imaginative reworking of the tired old fairy tale.  The animation is great (though it would have been nice if some the musical numbers--namely Be Our Guest--had stayed in the same physical plane as Belle instead of having the backgrounds vanish and allowing the characters to have free, nearly surreal movements), the acting is (usually) great, and the songs are fun.The problems I have with this movie are minor and more political/sociological than anything else. Belle is treated by the writers as more or less a model of modern feminism (normally I would complain about this sort of time-swapping social values without exception, but I've come to expect this kind of PC treatment from Disney, so what can I do?)--she reads, she doesn't listen to other peoples complaints about her reading, and she refuses to marry Gascon.  That's about it, really.  The latter two are truly good personality traits.  The other is more iffy because of what she reads: fairy tales (ones with pictures, though Gascon must be blind not to see them).  As it turns out, she's just dreaming about a prince charming coming to rescue her from her crass rural existence, not a thinker capable of doing that on her own.  She is not much more than the reader of the silly romance novels that true writers like Alexander Pope, Aphra Behn, Samuel Johnson, and Jonathan Swift have been making fun of since the Restoration.This is none-the-less a minor complaint.  I mean, at least she isn't cos-playing Sailor Moon or the Power Rangers.Now, here's a thought: why didn't the writers bother comparing the Beast with Gascon?  Isn't it true that the Beast was just like Gascon before the spell was cast on him?  As such, wouldn't that mean Gascon (though an idiot) could have been redeemed instead of cheaply plunged to his death (what is it with Disney lately, anyway--can't they think of other ways of killing people, or better yet finding a more interesting way to end a movie than killing the villain).  There's just something sick about that sort of thing since he is only a human, and goes completely against the redemptive power of the main story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Overall, a very good movie that truly embodies the Disney Renaissance as the iconic animation, musical numbers, and vocal performances help give the movie more life beyond its short runtime.Very Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale captures the essence of Disney animation during its Renaissance as its picturesque, grand nature comes to life in both a musical and a dramatic sense; the direction on a microscale has the Disney animated charm as it represents the tug and pull between characters (most of the time Belle and what she wants from other characters as she seeks true love without sacrificing her independence); the direction of actors is good as it brings to life iconic characters from the Disney Renaissance; the storytelling was good as it resembled a story-book retelling of an old fantasy tale, which has similar flavors to other movies from the Disney Renaissance; the tension was built using traditional Disney ways with score and action), Very Good Acting (Great from Paige O'Hara (Really embodied Belle and brought her to life with her vocal performance), Great from Robby Benson (Brought to life all the different sides of the beast as you saw his character change as the movie progressed), Very Good from Richard White (Portrayed the over-the-top, egotistical, masculine character that wanted whatever he could take), Very Good from Jerry Orbach (Embodied the French servant well as he showed empathy in trying to be hospitable to his guests), Very Good from David Ogden Stiers (Had a good chemistry, tension with Orbach as both acted as the two points-of-contact between Belle and this new world), Very Good from Angela Lansbury (Filled the motherly figure void as she tried to get both Belle and the Beast to be empathetic towards each other), Good to Very Good from Rex Everhart (Played somewhat of a 'smart' dunce well as he did everything for his daughter), Good from Jesse Corti (Good comedic relief to Gaston), Good from the rest of the cast (Polished and buttressed the main cast in a traditional Disney style; all the singing voices felt polished as well)), Good Story (The concept was good as it is a retelling of a famous classical tale; the plot structure was very typical to other Disney Renaissance films, there doesn't feel like there was a resolution because of how short the runtime was (pretty standard to other Disney Renaissance films so it's not too much of an issue); the flow between sequences was pretty standard to other Disney Renaissance movies; the character writing was pretty good but heavily relied on tropes to paint each character because the runtime was too short to give each character a holistic backstory), Good Screenplay (The dialogue was very good as it felt very polished and emulated both Disney animated movie and the time period/region; the humor was good as it helped give the movie a playful feel (something that would hit for both children and adults); the symbolism was good as it relied on typical fairytale tropes to display its messages; the foreshadowing was good as it laid roots down that come out towards the end (though it does rely a lot on the audiences knowledge of the story/fairytales to predict what will happen)), Very Good Score (Used well to make the movie feel musical and helped accentuate the dramatic moments)/Very Good to Great Musical Numbers (Each song is iconic, with my favorite being 'Be Our Guest', Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Helped give the movie a storybook feel), Visual Effects (The handcrafted animation style was very groundbreaking (especially when it was mixed with CGI in the waltz scene); the art and character designs are some of the most iconic in Disney history), Pacing was kinda an issue because the movie moves incredibly fast (mainly because of its short runtime), Climax was executed well and showed how full circle Belle and The Beast's journeys have come, Tone was very typical to other movies from the Disney Renaissance (while having French and fantasy flavors)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Many pros, 1 con","Beauty and the Beast is arguably one of Disney's best movies. It's like one of the first animated movies to be nominated for best picture (The Jungle Book was supposed to be the first animated movie nominated for that award, but many disagree b/c it's a children's movie and all that & the lion king should've been nominated too). It should have won in my opinion, but I'll save that for another time.This movie has so many wonderful things that make it fantastic. The songs are memorable, I recently watched it and I know every song by heart (except human again). The songs are amazing and romantic and funny. I can't stop listening to Belle (the song) and Be Our Guest! Belle is one of Disney's best heroines (the others being Esmeralda from HOND and Pocahontas). She can read!!!! I've looked up to her so much when I was younger and I love that she saw the beast as a kind man; even though the beast acted like a jerk for half the movie. She's kind, clever, and she can read! I found many wonderful things about this movie like the sidekicks, the animation, the message, etc. Now lets talk about Gaston!Gaston is probably one of the worst Disney villains ever! He's not Scar or Ursula who are actually evil! Gaston is a selfish jerk who just wants a lady. He didn't do anything evil except for the mob scene. But as humans, we tend to want something that we can't have (ie: having Josh Hutcherson as my boyfriend). If you want to see a human like villain actually do something, go watch Cinderella or The Rescuers.Otherwise, this movie is fantastic! It has wonderful songs, a fierce leading lady, a wonderful romance between belle and the beast, and Lumière which is one of my favorite characters.

Excellent but...,"I most certainly agree that this is a wonderful film. Though, in my opinion, not the greatest of Disney animated features (that title goes to The Jungle Book), nor the most entertaining (that title goes to Aladdin), Beauty and the Beast still manages to have all the right parts to make a solid film.I love the score, it is another gem from Alan Menken. Howard Ashman really does give a Beast his soul (it was the end credits if you didn't catch it) with his lyrics.Also, the story is pretty good, with just the right amount of Disney magic in it. Its got great characters, including the house objects that add a lot of fun to the story (especially Lumiere, he's so cool, and his girlfriend feather duster is so gorgeous for an animated lady).And the animation, well what can I say? It beats anything else that Disney has come up with, except for The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, and of course, Aladdin. Its not that the animation isn't as good as in the aforementioned movies, its just that it is not better.However, there is one complaint that I have to make. It is not really about the movie, but about how one of its parts is treated. Though the Beast, Belle, and the castle objects are great characters, I feel that none of them deserve the title of most memorable performance in this film.That title goes to Gaston, one of my all time favorite Disney villains. Gaston is so complex. One minute, he's just an arrogant, stuck-up bum that is reminisicent of someone we all know and find irritating. Yet, he manages to add a little humor in his attempts to woo Belle. Then, he turns into a real jerk, willing to lock Maurice up to get Belle. And finally, he becomes pure evil, ready to kill the Beast to win Belle. That mocking laugh and look he gives the Beast when he says, ""What's the matter? Too kind and gentle to fight back?"" is one of the greatest scenes in Disney villainry history. A rare few scenes rank up with the amount of evil emotion that this scene has, such as Scar giving Mufasa an incredibly horrifying look before murdering him, or Jafar laughing like an insane lunatic after banishing Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet to the Ends of the Earth. Great moments that illustrate just how dark a villain can be.Richard White outdid himself with this role, and I remember his work more than Robby Benson, Paige O'Hara, David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach, or Angela Lansbury. It upsets me that everyone focuses on the other roles in this film, but not so much on White's. When I read up about the great Disney villains of all time, often Gaston is not included. Though not the all-time greatest of the Disney villains, I feel he is greatly underrated and deserves more respect. Nevertheless, I love the film and give it a 10/10.P.S.

Beauty and the Beast,"This is a magical animated interpretation of the Jeanne-Marie de Beaumont fairy tale. A handsome, but vain and selfish, Prince finds himself on the wrong end of a curse - and is condemned to live a life of solitude, hideously disfigured - until someone falls in love with him and breaks the spell. Meantime, ""Belle"" is living in the village trying to avoid the endless amorous attentions of local beefcake ""Gaston"". Her father is travelling through the forest when he becomes caught up in a storm and seeks shelter in the Prince's castle - but he picks a rose and is duly imprisoned. When ""Belle"" discovers he is missing and follows his horse back to the castle, she manages to get the Prince to agree to swap; they gradually get to know each other and... He has an array of servants who all shared his curse and were transmogrified along with their boss - ""Lumière"" the butler/candlestick rules the roost with ""Cogworth"", ""Madame de Garderobe"" and the wonderful ""Mrs. Potts"" (Angela Lansbury) as the teapot/housekeeper with her little ""Chip"". All of these characterisations fit the mood perfectly and as the story develops each one becomes more engaging and sympathetic to their poor inflicted master's predicament, as we build to the really quite tense, but satisfying denouement.

One of the Most Acclaimed Disney Features of all Time,"In the late 1980s, the Walt Disney company took on the task of adapting the 1756 French fairy tale Beauty & the Beast. After going through one slow version that didn't please the executives, the project was given to Little Mermaid song-writer and co-producer Howard Ashman to consult and create the music for. Despite a tight schedule and many of the crew not seeing much potential in the feature, the final product ended up becoming a financial blockbuster, a critical phenomenon and the first animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. 30 years later, it still remains one of Disney's biggest triumphs in cinema history.The film focuses on the relationship between a prince who was magically transformed into a monster, and Belle, a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle. In order to break the curse that haunts the Beast, both protagonists must learn to love each other before the last petal of a rose falls or else the Beast will remain a monster permanently. With a tale as old as the dawn of storytelling, this premise would seem fairly standard on paper, but the execution is what critics and audiences remember this feature for the most. Similar to other Disney heroines of this time period, Belle wants more out of her life than living with her inventor father at a little village with people who find her odd for being a bookworm. Meanwhile, the Beast has been isolated for years in a castle with no one else to turn to for support besides his household object servants. Two outcasts from different worlds meet in unfortunate circumstances, but as they slowly begin to know each other, the film truly exposes its romantic routes in showing how much beauty can truly love a beast.On the opposite side of the characters, the real monster would be Gaston, a handsome looking narcissistic hunter who desires Belle for his wife. While just as egotistical as the Beast was prior to his transformation, Gaston's true evil lies within his cold dead heart in getting whatever he wants. It's no wonder why one of the most popular songs in the movie is a giant ego ego stroke named after this vain jerk. As for the household objects, they all vary in personality from the suave charismatic Lumiere, to the uptight worrisome Cogsworth and the motherly kind hearted Mrs. Potts. Despite their differences, they all work so well as supporting leads in hoping all goes well for Belle and the beast's growing relationship. In addition to a lovable cast, the actors behind them truly shine in each role, including Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson lending memorable performances as their respective protagonists. The vocal and singing talents of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Angela Lansbury and Rex Everhart are what viewers will turn into this movie any day for.Despite making the feature with a smaller budget and schedule than The Little Mermaid, the crew behind the feature pulled off the job extraordinarily. With talented veteran animators behind the feature such as James Baxter, Mark Henn, Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Ruben Aquino, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn, Dave Pruiksma and more, the overall character animation is nothing short of sublime. Although Belle's design does fluctuate a lot throughout the film and most of the side characters do look fairly generic, the appearances of each character have left everyone remembering the cast for years on end. Along with impressive effects work, the production design is reminiscent of its time period, especially with the castle having a pristine Baroque aesthetic and some of the most revolutionary computerized background movements in cinema history. The more polished parts of the castle contrast well with the otherwise grimly black areas leftover from the Beast's destruction and broken heart. It's no wonder why the feature still stands tall in the library of acclaimed animated Disney legends.Finally, right up there with Wizard of Oz, Little Mermaid and Sound of Music, the musical numbers by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken remain staples of pop culture for years on end. In addition to moving the plot forward like the best Broadway musicals, each song works as either solid exposition for a certain character or dazzling showmanship and choreography that anyone can sing along to. Belle works in establishing both the aforementioned character's gorgeous physique contrasting with her well-read knowledge, albeit to the townsfolk's displeasure. In addition, Gaston might be the funniest number in the whole film, giving the antagonist's ego the biggest stroke of any Disney villain. The Oscar winning Be Our Guest showcases the household object's passion for dinner, entertainment and longing for being human again (not unlike a famed deleted song that was included in the film's 10th anniversary edition). Lastly, darlings like Something There, The Mob Song and Beauty & the Beast all show the good and evil in humanity, all from the eyes of the pure and corrupt. With these innovative songs, the film's tribute to Howard Ashman in the end credits still holds a place in everyone's heart (he will forever be missed but never forgotten).After 30 years in the spotlight, Disney's Beauty & the Beast remains an iconic treasure for its charmingly romantic story, unforgettable characters, supreme visuals and timeless songs that people are still listening to and even parodying today. With countless sequels, remakes and even a Broadway adaptation spawned from its success, there's no denying how much this film has stayed in the hearts of people since its original release. Not only is it a tale as old as time and a song as old as rhyme, but it is also a landmark for proving to the world that animated features can be taken just as seriously as any other movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

1991's Beauty and the Beast,"1991's Beauty and the Beast is Disney's original version of Beauty and the Beast. I find it kinda better than the live action with some details seem to be explained a little more in this one. It does also have more humor than the remake which makes it flow more smoothly. As well the characters that are animate inanimate objects look better in animation. The Beast and Lumiere are the only two characters I feel are like on par on their live action counterparts when it comes to character design. Besides them, the animated versions look better. They still are better at live action than the Lion King though. They are still somewhat expressive in live action. This animated version has more singing than in the live action. The live action has some differences between this one, so you're not getting the exact same thing, though it seems like less differences than the Aladdin remake. I find it good to watch both versions of something to find differences between the two and could say which one is better in your opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

This beautiful cartoon reveals one of the very subtle features of love.

Show stopping classic!,"Beauty and the Beast is one of THE BEST movies ever. The story, the characters, the music, everything is pure genious but then what else can you expect from disney? :-) I love the character Belle, created by Mark Henn, she is so unique to the other people in the village, and i love how rebelious she is, a bit like Ariel and more of the modern heroines, as well as some of the older ones too. Andreas Deja did a great job with Gaston, i can't stand him...he is so conceited and you just wanna strangle him for being so egotistic - and the fact that Belle rejects him is fantastic too :-) And as usual Glen Keane did a stupendous job, creating the character of the Beast using a combination of different animals, yet giving him those gentle blue eyes which show his true being. The music is wonderful, another great colabiration between the late Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. Their music is so wonderful, and beautiful that its not really the same anymore. i find it so beautiful and cherishing that they dedicated the film to Mr Ashman, who sadly died 6 months before its release. Thankfully (and it took them long enough) Disney are re-releasing this fabulous film, with an extra segment, the musical number 'Human Again' which is a true gesture and sign of respect and gratefulness to Howard Ashman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney's tale about how beauty should be seen with the heart and not with the eyes,"Beauty And The Beast is a popular tale that has been adapted in different ways in the world of cinema. Disney decided to make its own adaptation, taking some ideas from Jean Cocteau's version, but without losing sight of the essential moral of this story. Despite having a mostly childish tone, the film respects the essence of the original story, leaving the message about inner beauty intact. Belle and the beast are quite different at first until the little time they spend together makes them realize who they are.Belle is a very dreamy girl and her passion for reading is a clue to how willing she is to discover what lies beyond what the eyes see. At first she finds it difficult to do that with the beast, but she ends up seeing that there is goodness in him. The beast is clearly the most long-suffering character who has had to spend years in the dark, fearing the fear that his appearance can instill and being consumed by rage and despair. We know that at first he was human, but blinded by vanity and ambition. Beyond his beast-like appearance being a punishment, he is a sort of representation of the bad personality he had in his days as a human. Meeting Belle is not only a chance to become human again, but it also causes the beast to regain his humanity by letting go of the wild behavior he has been engaging in to suppress his grief. Although Gaston does not exist in the original story, he becomes essential to the film's message. Gaston is someone quite boastful who is willing to marry Belle even if he has to make extreme decisions. What makes this character important to the message is that he is a handsome man, but with an evil side.It is clear that the intention of the message that this film has is that appearances can be deceiving. The beast is actually someone full of pain who because he looks like a monster, feels like he can't be accepted even by Belle. Gaston, on the other hand, is someone vain and ambitious who can look like a heartthrob, but who has hidden bad intentions. The moral would be that those who are not physically beautiful or who may act in an unpleasant way are actually individuals with goodness inside, but full of pain that they try to hide due to prejudices. While those who seem like normal or attractive-looking people may actually have a hidden unpleasant personality. The metaphor with the beast and Gaston is that what is different is treated as something inhuman and that the human beings who resort to that are the true monsters. That's a theme that has even been used in movies like Nightbreed or The Hunchback Of Notre Dame.In the real world, human beings are very superficial and the story of this film is about trying to understand what may lie beyond what the eyes see. That makes Beauty And The Beast still a good story and another great achievement for Disney in animation. Of course, in the movie it seems that everything happens in one day and it is a bit difficult to calculate how long it must have taken for Belle and the Beast to develop their romance. Even so, the story remains emotional and the pleasant characters plus the wonderful animation and songs make this film earn a place among Disney's most endearing animated films and one of the most unforgettable fairy tale adaptations that cinema offers us. Have brought. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Coppola's Dracula for the faint of heart,"Beauty and the Beast is a great love story, not only for the little ones, but for the big ones' as well.

It remained a good film, although without predictability it could have been a masterpiece. Disney somehow never seizes to amaze me with the quality of their animated features and I hope that it remains that way for many years to come. If you want to see a really romantic film with your girlfriend and you're positive that she can't stomach Coppola's Dracula, Beauty and the Beast provides you with an equally dark, yet less brutal fairy tale.

Beauty and the beast,"Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply: love one another, and refrain from judging others who 'seem' to be 'different.' And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, 'Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale. When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return. And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation.The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep. Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey. Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him: If he will release her father, she will stay in his place. The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever. And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in 'non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts. There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly. A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as 'The Fisher King,' 'Fried Green Tomatoes,' 'Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's 'Boyz N the Hood' that year).The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster). There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made: As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed. And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms,",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Disney's best from the 1990s,"A cracker.I definitely rate the 2017 remake higher, but there is no getting away from the fact that the 1991 original is rather magical. It does have some issues, mainly with the premise, though there's a lot to love about it elsewhere.The plot of 'Beauty and the Beast' does have question marks surrounding it, the obvious one being the Stockholm syndrome bond between Belle and Beast - alongside borderline bestiality. However, you could slice it differently and say it's a story about people changing for the better, even those who are bad can become good with the right atmosphere around them.Onto the cast. Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson do excellent in the lead roles, with Richard White supporting well as Gaston. The objects add so much to this film, namely Lumière (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers) and Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury). Jesse Corti is also noteworthy, as Lefou.The animation is simply exquisite, while the musical numbers are tremendous; especially ""Gaston"" and, of course, ""Beauty and the Beast"".To end, there is iffiness with the storyline but the rest of the film helps override any negative feelings from that to produce one of Disney's best from the 1990s.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast,"Special edition version watch. I really enjoyed this, another just really solid entry in the Disney princess ''franchise''. Standout is the art here, the intro is incredible and some of the scenes are just goosebumps educing. Combined with the music it's something special.Directing and animation is top notch. Really loved all the work here and the musical sequences are a feast for the eyes. So much animated work and just a joy to watch.Story wise we get a solid likeable story with good characters. Why Bell get's called weird is still a mystery for me as all she does that could be considered weird is read books, so uh, I guess the French peasants thought that was strange. Also, never expected this movie to be set in France! The beast redeems himself plenty in this and that is great, I feared he would be redeemed to easily but it was done well. Gaston is downright evil, even though his look would say otherwise. You'd expect it to be way more abundant in a Disney movie but they kept it subtle and I liked that. And it also keeps him somewhat passable until the inevitable plan he sets which makes him just a horrible person.Music is fantastic, nothing new here to be honest, impossible to have missed these tracks throughout all the years but now seeing them with the sequences it elevates them even more. Be Our Guest still wins out being the best of the bunch. Though the symphonic main score is strong as well.Voice acting was great, loved all of the voices honestly.

Disney's Return to Glory,"When Disney first started animated films, particularly with its opening trio of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Pinnochio"", and ""Fantasia"", the point was literally to change the way film exists, particularly in a medium such as animation which is generally regared kiddy fluff with little real cinematic value. They succeeded. Watching the early films, with the moveable images, the wonderful swirl of imagination and music, creates a whole new way of experiencing the story.The later Disney features were a little more formulaic, but still outstanding: they found a story, ran with it, and focused on loveable characters with witty voices. Films like ""Peter Pan"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", were all more like elegant pieces of pop art than real challenging stuff.""Beauty and the Beast"" re-wrote the rules. The camera flows effortlessly in and out and around a scene, creating a visual way of telling the story that's almost Spielberg-esque. Then you need a compelling cast of vocal talent, worked together flawlessly with charming music. Check  off all of the above for this film.It really was a Return to Glory for Disney, a film that  touched audiences that last really loved a Disney film when ""Mary Poppins"" was released. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Sometimes i actually forgot this is animation movie and started loving the beauty. The main drawback i felt movie ended so soon because i don't wanted it to end as i was living in that world. So what are you waiting for see the movie immediately. Was this comment useful please reply so that i might improvise thank you for reading my comment",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Did I miss something? Good but not Oscar good.,"I've seen this movie and while it is a good movie I didn't see anything spectacular about it. It is a standard Disney film in my opinion. Good animation, music and characters. It ranks with many other Disney films under the very good category. Nice fairy tale.It is a nice animated but Oscar worthy? When I compare this film with other Oscar nominated films, (American Beauty, Forrest Gump, Schndlier's List)I just don't see it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Best Animated Movie Of All Time And One Of My Top Five Movies Of All Time,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is a haunting,poetic masterpiece of a film that has touched me deeply.I first saw it when it first came out,but now that I am older,I can see how brilliant it really is.Disney will never be able to top this,and they haven't.It's just so brilliant.You must see it soon,if you haven't already,and if you have,see it again.it's wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Herky-Jerky Beauty,"Beauty and the Beast, IMAXDid you enjoy this Disney Cartoon the first time around?  Or didn't you? Either way, there's no good excuse to see it again in this larger format unless you're looking for any excuse to go to an Imax theatre.Personally, I liked the original effort and this translation to IMAX brings out the worst in B&B. Since the move towards economizing in filming techniques, the paucity of distinct frames and the stock-still extras are really highlighted when enlarging it.And what about the added scenes? There clearly was a reason to leave this one on the cutting room floor so save yourself the effort. Reasons to see Beauty and the Beast at the IMAX: 1. You have children or grand children who missed it the first time around and love IMAX. 2. You think bigger is better. 3. You have a good friend that just has to see this one again.WARNING: If #3 is the case, watch the DVD version on a large screen with surround on a cold winter night.

An animated movie that really touched me.,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is the most impressive Walt Disney film I ever saw. It made me laugh and it made me cry bitter tears when feeling so much pity for the sad Beast. The movie has a lot of atmosphere which comes from the fine animations and the great background paintings of the castle. My favourite scene: the Beast and Belle are dancing together. I can't remember having seen such fine and life-like movements of drawn figures ever before. And this atmosphere is strengthened by the award-winning music. The best song, you'll all agree: the main theme, sung by Mrs. Angela Lansbury. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a must-see; also for people who normally don't watch animated movies.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Magnificent and Unsurpassed,"The best animated feature ever made.  Period.  No argument.  The Disney studios pulled out all the stops to create this sublime achievement, using the best animators, storytellers and musical artists in the business. Surpassing any animated feature made before or since this is simple story about a beautiful girl in a small village who wants to escape her ""provincial life"" and the clutches of the handsome town brute who wants to have her for his own.  Told in the style of a lively Hollywood musical, this story is never boring and continuously engaging.  You won't find a better family film.  Even the movie's beginning, telling the background of the Beast through the use of stain glass windows, is stunningly beautiful and original. The musical numbers are alternately fun, hilarious, quietly sweet and rousing.Don't expect the DVD version of this film to last on the shelves very long.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful and Heartwarming.,"An enchanting tale of inner beauty. This classic Disney magic and one of their best movies. I like this one a lot. The animation is good and very smooth.

"Unparalleled ""Beauty""","Disney sure doesn't make 'em like they used to.  These words might sound a little facetious, given that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is only a little over ten years old, but in a way it's true.  No film produced by the House of Mouse since then has exceeded the quality of this one; only a handful (The Lion King and both Toy Story films certainly) can claim equality.All the elements that Disney would employ in their animated features over the subsequent decade are present here and yet there's something in ""Beauty and the Beast"" that the formula has not duplicated, proving that good movies really are more than the sum of their parts.  Perhaps it has something to do with the way the pieces fit together so flawlessly, the manner in which the certain elements combine to create a touching romance with all the right elements of humor, tenderness, and excitement.The visual aspect of the film takes hold at once with a prologue explaining the backstory through a series of stained-glass windows: as punishment for his selfishness and cruelty, a prince is transformed into a Beast by a powerful sorceress.  He must learn to love and be loved in return, or face life as a monster.  Enter Belle, a young woman living in a village not too far from the enchanted castle, admired for her beauty but looked down on by the townsfolk for her bookish ways.  Belle is the grandmother of the spirited heroines of later animated features, and it is easy to see why. Instead of pining over the local hunk, she reads and helps her inventor father; rather than wish for Prince Charming, she desires a true soulmate. More than anything, she is noble: when her father becomes imprisoned by the Beast after losing his way in the woods, Belle bravely abandons her hopes for a better life to take his place.This is, of course, the opportunity the Beast has long desired, but as a servant observes ""these things take time.""  How the romance grows, and how the characters grow because of it, is one of the highlights of the film. The Beast must learn to put aside his selfish ways and hair-trigger temper and think of others while Belle, in the manner of Elizabeth Bennett, discovers that first impressions can be misleading.  Aiding them are the servants of the castle, transformed into various furnature and housewares by the same spell which altered their master.  Far from feeling wedged into the film for the sake of comic relief these characters fit into the story seamlessly, their motivation clear: only by helping the love between Belle and the Beast can they regain their humanity.  Villiany is provided by Gaston, the aformentioned local hunk.  He too has designs on Belle, on the pretext that as the most beautiful girl in the village, she is the only one worthy of his attentions.  At first a foolish peacock of a man, Gaston develops into a manipulative bully and a real threat to the heros.The score by Alan Menken is one of his finest, and also the last one which his longtime lyricist Howard Ashman completed.  All the songs are perfect, but special attention must be paid to the title song.  In addition to winning an Oscar, the touching ballad also acompanies the most stunning sequence in the movie, in which Belle and the Beast waltz around a gilt ballroom.  The camera swoops and soars around the couple, creating chills that do not diminish upon repeated viewings.The recent IMAX re-release of ""Beauty and the Beast"" contains new footage, including a song originally cut from the film in '91.  The large-screen format serves the film well, bringing out details lost in smaller mediums. Seeing it up on the big screen is like falling in love all over again.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Why I didn't like Beauty and the Beast,"I was about 12 years old when I saw this movie. While it wasn't the best movie I'd ever seen, there wasn't anything about it that really irritated me. However, when I last watched it, I was upset at the story line.Why does Beauty fall in love with the Beast? While he is not as conceited as Gaston, he certainly proves on a number of occasions that he is pretty beastly not only in appearance, but in his attitude as well.So this is the message I get. Stick with the guy whose really mean, bossy, scary, and threatening because deep down he's a nice guy. And good-looking.I know that this plot was not conceived by Disney, but Disney did choose it. Belle could have been an empowered heroine, but fails. The woman who sings of wanting adventure and excitement instead falls in love with the man that has imprisoned her. I hope my children have higher standards.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A charming, enchanting and beautiful animated film!","""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991), marked a return to top form for Disney. In this film, excellent animation, characters, story and songs all come together. After Walt Disney died in 1967, the animated films after that had lost that special Disney touch. With this film, Disney re-discovered it's magic touch.""Beauty and the Beast"" is a re-telling of the classic fairy tale. Here, the heroine ""Belle"" is an independent, book loving woman with a strong sense of imagination. The second change made to the traditional story are the castle servants under the spell as furniture and kitchenware.I was very impressed with the film. I felt it definitely deserved it's Academy Award nomination for Best Picture of 1991 (a first ever). It's competition that year were: ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (both very good films, in my opinion). Now there is a new category: Best Animated Feature Film. If it existed then, this is the award that Beauty and the Beast deserved to win.I've seen the other Disney classic films: from ""Snow White"" (1937) to ""Dumbo"" (1942) and believe that this film ranks with them as one of Disney's Best.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Disney's Top 5,"In the 65 plus years Disney has been producing full length animated features, there have been duds, good films, and outright classics.  Beauty and the Beast is definitely in the classic category.  It has drama, comedy, music, and adventure all packed into 90 minutes.  Even the new song 'Human Again' fits into the movie flawlessly.  The animation is at times awe-inspiring.  And unless, you're coldhearted and emotionally dead, the love interest between Belle and the beast will put a lump in your throat. Watching the eyes of the main characters was like watching great performances by live actors.  I can definitely recommend this as a must see.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Classic,"Strange movie. Not subject or evolution of facts are important. But the brilliance of imagination. The small world in a crazy movement and the magic play of objects. The colors and the music. Nice details and love as delicate ladder. And the end as point for the evolution of characters in your imagination. So, the result is only spell. For the smart solution to create a fluid action, for the art to remind childhood areas, for the basic flips and for charming Belle. And, of course, grace new image of Beast - fragile, shy, dizzy, childish, melancholic, coarse, romantic, stubborn. But the best - dance scenes. A fairy tale in new clothes but with old gentle soul. An adventure. And fantastic holiday in the corners of golden age.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Fantastic,"This is one of the Disney greats.  The songs are wonderful, and the voices for the characters are spot on.

One of Disney's best,"Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best animated motion pictures. It tells the classic tale of a selfish and greedy prince who as a punishment for his selfish acts was turned into a beast and would only turn back to human if he found the ability to love... and be loved back before the last petal of an enchanted rose fell. Then Belle, a beautiful young woman becomes his 'prisoner' to free her father from the Beast. As time goes by Belle sees that the Beast is not as bad as he seems and the Beast learns to control his temper.Beauty and the Beast is a true masterpiece and an unforgettable film, that anyone of any age can love and appreciate. It features some of Disney's most unforgettable characters: Belle (beautifully voiced by Paige O'Hara), The Beast (very well voiced by Robby Benson), Lumiere the candlestick holder (voiced very lively to my surprise by Jerry Orbach of Law & Order), Cogsworth the clock (voiced brilliantly by David Ogden Stiers, who has also provided voices for Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas) and of course cinema's nicest teapot, Mrs. Potts (voiced magnificently by Angela Lansbury, who perhaps was the first to provide a 'celebrity voice' for an animated Disney film). And I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention Chip, Maurice (Belle's wacky father) and of course one of Disney's sexiest characters the feather-duster, who Lumiere constantly flirts with. When it comes to bad guys, I would say that Gaston is probably the most realistic Disney villain- He is human, he has no supernatural powers yet he is such a horrible person- he would actually lock Belle's father up in an insane asylum and only let him out if Belle agreed to marry him. I have constantly found myself enjoying Disney villains but I can truly hate Gaston as he is cruelty in it's true nature. Another villain very realistic with no supernatural powers like him is 101 Dalmatians' Cruella De Vil.And as for the music: Well, it rightfully deserved the Oscars for best score (provided by Alan Menken) and best song. It features unforgettable songs such as Beauty and the Beast and Be Our Guest. Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best achievements and most worthy of being called a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Disney's best films,"I used to watch this film all the time when I was little, but after that, I kind of grew out of Disney, claiming it to be nothing but kiddie garbage. Later on, I watched it again as a mature teenager, and I found I was mistaken. 'Beauty and the Beast' is a gem in the sometimes-tarnished crown of Disney films. Although it departs quite a bit from the original faery tale, the voice acting, animation, and all-around feel sill brings back memories of my early childhood, when everything seemed magical. The best and most brilliant preformance is definetly that of the Beast. The songs, especially the title theme and Belle's main song, are unforgettable and some very catchy. The only thing I didn't like is Gaston, who seems a wee bit too flat a character (and he's a jerk, too). Anyone who loves animation, Disney, or just wants to watch a good movie should take a look at this.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Animation at it's very finest,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Howard Ashman (who produced and wrote the lyrics to the songs) was an absolute genius. Its a tragedy that he never saw the movie's completion. He died in March of 1991 of AIDS. 7 months before the film's release. But boy would he have been proud of the tremendous success the film had; and how it touched the hearts of millions with lovable characters and brilliant songs. And the ultimate message ""Love conquers all"" and ""Beauty is skin deep"". The IMAX release in January 2002 only made it better, with a new musical sequence that had viewers scratching their heads over why it was left out in the first place. But without Mr.Ashman this film wouldn't be half of what it is. I leave you with the films dedication.

"""Beauty"" Shines Brighter Than Ever in 3-D","In 1991, when ""Beauty and The Beast"" came out, it has changed the way we have seen animated films. This was a movie that had pure heart in storytelling and a groundbreaking score that could take moviegoers straight to Broadway heaven without going to the real place. Now it's back in theaters in 3-D, and from the first minute, it has never been more crystal clear and magnificent than before in 21 years.Belle{Paige O'Hara} is a daughter of a smart and funny inventor Maurice {Rex Everheart}. She has a love for her father and books but, she wishes for a better life. The town's most handsome man Gaston {Richard White} tries to get Belle's attention, but she refuses. Then one night, when Maurice tries to make a shortcut on the way to the inventor's fair, he is stopped by wolves. Maurice then finds shelter at a castle, but soon he becomes prisoner of the Beast {Robby Benson}. Later, when Belle finds her father in the dungeon, the Beast stops her from setting him go. But then, Belle decides to trade herself for her father's safety. Soon, Belle realizes that she is seeing magical things such as a teapot, a candlestick and a clock come to life. The magical things are really humans that have been cursed because of a spell that turned the prince into a Beast. Now the Beast must find a way to get back to his human self and Belle could be the one thing that could break the curse.Fans of the original will feel like going back to cloud 9 and the brand new generation of kids will be amazed. The animation is like so brighter and beautiful than ever. The ""Be Our Guest"" and dance sequences have never looked better. Plus, the soundtrack has a clearer new sound thanks to today's technology. Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman's songs are so tuneful and hummable that Stephen Sondheim and Cole Porter would give a run for their money.The characters' voices really deliver. Benson gives the Beast a creature that has been long suffering because of a mistake and a strong voice that would have made Clint Eastwood proud. O'Hara gives a marvelous and Streisand-like voice as Belle. Angela Lansbury is a revelation as Mrs. Potts and the late great Jerry Orbach shines as Lumiere.""Beauty"" really shows us why we go to the movies for. It makes us laugh, cry, applaud, learn something and be wowed. It really delivers the same evidence for now in 2012 as it did in 1991.Note: Before ""Beauty and the Beast"", the characters from Disney's recent hit ""Tangled"" are back in a very funny short ,""Tangled Ever After"" showing the wedding of Rapunzel and Flynn. It will make cartoon fans remember the old days of the Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. Also, stay during the end credits for a special treat.Rating: 4 Stars",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great voices and music tie together this masterpiece,"This is an astonishingly detailed masterpiece.  I am reminded in the attention to countless small details of the way Lucas Star Wars team would obsess over seemly insignificant matters such as the ""plop"" of the snow falling back from an impact crater on the ice planet.  Such loving attention to the texture lends depth to the films.  So it is with Beauty in scenes such as her dazzling watz though the town at the openning of the film.Really good films are almost always marked by the quality of the voices of the leading players.  This is the case with the Harry Potter and Ring movies, and is also the case here.  Robbie Benson's digitally altered voice of the Beast is perfect, but then so is Langsbury's Mrs. Potts and even David Ogden Stiers' Cogsworth.  Stiers (Charles Winchester from M.A.S.H) also Narrates the films evidently with some of the same digital enhancements as Benson's voice received.  He does an absolutely masterful bit of work with the small but crucial narrator role.  It is stunningly well crafted job that is further brought to life by the IMAX sound system.Finally - the music is nearly perfect.  People comment on the individual songs, however, what has always most impressed me is that the entire movie plays like a single musical piece.  The music is almost always there to support the drama and emotion from frame to frame, and yet it never remotely takes on the character of filler music.  The transitions are seemless and the music brilliantly supports the drama at every point.  An absolutely incredible job.Truly, this is the greatest animated work ever made, and the best film Disney has ever produced.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A classic in its own right,"As an unabashed fan of the 1991 film, I came to this version ready for a fight -- more than one! Who dares tamper with a classic? But bit by bit, and moment by moment, I was enchanted all over again: the human performances ""fleshed out"" the old animated ones; the coggier Cogsworth and more limited Lumiere charmed me afresh with their differences from memory. The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and I never felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, the sum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a fresh masterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much much more than a ""cover"" -- if Disney can do this as well with its other planned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in.

Magnificent Computer Graphic Imagery and Cinematography,"""Beauty and the Beast"" retells the Disney's version of the French fairy-tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and published in 1740.

However this 2017 version is uneven, with the most boring songs that anyone could imagine and reasonable acting despite the great names in the cast.

Not Quite as Good as the Original,"An adaptation of the fairy tale about a monstrous-looking prince and a young woman who fall in love.If you have one of the all-time greatest cartoons, there are things you can do with it.

Especially if such a version relies on CGI and you have neither the time nor the ability to pull it off.But if you are going to do it anyway, I suppose you could do much worse. Emma Watson was the ideal casting choice and no one else would have worked. No one. Josh Gad is spot on as LeFou. The Beast could be better, perhaps. My biggest casting complaint is Maurice.

"A good, though far from great, adaptation of this tale as old as time.","Adapting Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's original French story about a beauty and her beast is no easy task. In the wrong hands, this romance between a girl and her captor could easily come across as creepy – Stockholm Syndrome parading as a fairy tale. Disney managed to pull it off in 1991: its sublime animated version, with its tender heart and gorgeous music, has rightly become a classic. 25 years later, has the studio managed to capture lightning in a bottle again, this time in live-action format?Well not quite. To be fair, this brand-new incarnation of Beauty And The Beast, directed by Bill Condon, has a great deal going for it. It makes a good case for updating the tale with more modern sensibilities. The film is beautifully performed and designed, and there's plenty of fun (and nostalgia) awaiting fans of its animated predecessor. But it never feels quite as effortless or natural in telling its story. While there is magic here, it's tough to shake the feeling that it's engineered, not organic – that it grazes rather than grabs the heart.The film centres on Belle (Emma Watson), a bookish, resourceful young lady who's never really fit into her little French village. She hankers for adventure – but gets more than she bargained for when her father (Kevin Kline) stumbles into a forgotten castle and becomes a prisoner there. After trading places with her dad, Belle gets to know the inhabitants of the castle: a surly, fearsome Beast (Dan Stevens) and a host of living household appliances and furniture, all of them living in fear that they will never be free of the curse that has robbed them of their humanity.On its own merits, Beauty And The Beast is a decent effort. Condon's film is the Hollywood blockbuster at its most efficient, from its photo-real fantasy castles to splashy musical numbers teeming with life and colour. The screenplay, by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, is a canny adaptation of familiar material, particularly when it comes to adding layers to its characters. Belle has more agency in ways big and small – she's the one in control even when she (voluntarily) becomes the Beast's prisoner and, in a small but important scene, she shares the gift of independent thinking by teaching a village girl how to read.Similarly, the many relationships in the film are given welcome depth. Belle and the Beast find common ground in books and feeling out-of-place, even in the places they call home. We're furnished with hints as to why the household servants – including suave candlestick Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), jittery clock Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and motherly kettle Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) – are more invested in breaking the curse that befell them. LeFou's (Josh Gad) devotion to the pompous Gaston (Luke Evans) goes, quite logically, from subtext to text, though in a way that hardly warrants the firestorm of controversy that has erupted in conservative circles over Disney's 'gay agenda'.That said, other aspects of this remake yield more mixed results. The Beast's very real, very human eyes provide emotional connection and depth in a way that animation can't fully approximate. But burying Stevens beneath layers of CGI and prosthetics also means that the Beast can occasionally come across as a stiff, oversized teddy bear, lacking the fluidity of expression of his animated counterpart. The same goes for the household servants: ironically, efforts to make them more 'realistic' end up bleeding them of life and personality.It's the same story with the film's music. Some of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's iconic original numbers are thoughtfully re- imagined: 'Be Our Guest' is a joyous explosion of camp colour, featuring welcome nods to movies like Cabaret and Singin' In The Rain; and 'Gaston' morphs into a lively bar-storming number that practically demands applause at the end.But the new songs, penned by Menken and Tim Rice, are more nice than necessary. 'How Does A Moment Last Forever' is lovely but lacks impact. 'Evermore' – a new anthem for the Beast – will no doubt become a cabaret standard but is badly served in the context of the film: it feels overwrought and a bit silly, lessening rather than heightening the dramatic tension at that particular moment.Performances across the board are good, as you would expect from a cast of this calibre – though it's hard not to wish for accomplished performers like Thompson, McKellen and Broadway legend Audra McDonald (playing the part of an operatic, narcoleptic wardrobe) to be better served by both script and special effects. Watson, who has proved a better advocate than actor in recent years, is a perfectly credible (though hardly riveting) Belle. Stevens does a decent job with a challenging part, while Evans convincingly conjures up both swagger and menace.It's evident in every frame that everyone involved in Beauty And The Beast worked mightily hard to prove that transforming one of Disney's most iconic movies into a live-action extravaganza is worth the effort. They don't always pull it off: the film gets about as many things wrong as it does right, and it most certainly doesn't surpass the animated classic in quality. But it tells a familiar tale well enough – enough, one suspects, to win over fans old and new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It was OK-Good!,"I am not a fan of musicals but I went to watch this one out of nostalgia. I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn't want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story.

Disheartened,"Hadn't seen Emma Watson in a movie before (not a Harry Potter fan), but for some reason, social media had me with the idea she was a good actress. At least here, she wasn´t. I read here on the Trivia section that while shooting Be Our Guest the crew had to make her smile and all: that's a bad actress right there, it's not like they were working with 6 year olds. (My daughter likes to watch the Cinderella live action almost every day, I highly doubt Lily James was actually witnessing a pumpkin turning into a charriot). She had the same face seeing spoons dancing, someone being shot, and when a handsome prince appeared before her.The whole Belle being an inventor was so irrelevant to the story, and during the dance with the Beast, she was so stiff and it was so badly choreographed, it ruined one of the most beloved Disney scenes.No chemistry between Beauty and Beast at all, the only moment that made me feel something was when the enchanted objects were becoming just objects. Too bad the main character was not great, the movie itself is enjoyable and the special effects are really good, wish horror movies had this kind of CGI.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Underwhelming - some lovely scenes but the CGI face of Beast is a constant distraction,"Up front: I'm probably not the right audience for this film. I only went because I was invited, and I wouldn't have gone to check this one out otherwise.Firstly, some of the production values are really beautiful and reminded me of the animated classic in a good way. Also, the voice cast for the clock and the kitchen devices are great.Secondly, the actors, well... this may sound kind of harsh, but I've never seen Emma Watson act so stiff in a movie. Her performance is wooden, which is pretty bad considering she's supposed to be the heart of the film. Also, she probably won't start a singing career anytime soon.Thirdly (and most importantly), Beast. That's where they really dropped the ball. Giving him a lifeless CGI face was an unforgivable mistake, and it's such a constant distraction that I could never really get into the movie.Overall, I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend this movie, at least not to adults. I'm sure most kids would enjoy it though, and it's not really a bad film: just a very mediocre one. 6 stars out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A remake that was well done,"As much as it pains me to see movies being remade, I find that I am able to give Disney a pass for this. I thoroughly enjoyed Beauty and the Beast .

I think I doubted Disney's decision to cast her as Belle, but after seeing the movie, I feel as if those doubts have been put to rest.I also thought the rest of the casting was well done. Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey fame was great as The Beast (in this version, he even gets to sing a song) and Kevin Kline was great as Maurice, Belle's father. Emma Thompson never fails to impress me. She was one of the people I was extremely glad was cast in this film. She did Angela Lansbury proud. Josh Gad (Lefou) is perhaps most famous for portraying the lovable snowman, Olaf, in Disney's 2013 animated film, ""Frozen"" (although I knew him mainly from the raunchy Broadway show, ""Book of Mormon,"" but that's a story for another time). Luke Evans (Gaston): I am not as familiar with him; the only film of his I've seen is ""Dracula: Untold."" He was pretty good as well. Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor were wonderful as usual. The one I was impressed with the most, was 6-time Tony winner Audra McDonald. I have been a fan of hers since the year 2000 when I first watched Disney's ""Annie"", and she never fails to amaze me with her consistency and overall talent. Her voice was, by far, the best in the movie.The cinematography and special effects were obviously all there. When you get a huge company like Disney behind a product, they naturally have all the money and the resources available to make the best quality motion picture in the technical aspects that they want.Give this movie a try, it was truly beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
My childhood was not ruined!,"I have re-watched this in theaters this weekend, so I come fresh with this movie in mind.Having said that, my perception of this movie has not changed. I will also add that this story was my favorite Disney story growing up. Having watched it twice now, my experience has remained the same. I still got lost in the story, the imagery, the music, and the singing.The plot was almost completely the same as that of the cartoon version, with a few additions. I very much loved these new additions as they added depth to the story and closed some plot holes. It also helped to better establish the relationship between Belle and the Beast.P.S. Loved the gay millisecond! I don't know what all the fuss was about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Quite Average,"When you take on an oscar nominated classic like Beauty and the Beast for a live action movie. You HAVE to make sure that the spirit of the original remains intact even if you can't make it as good. I know that one has to tweak a few little things to make it appropriate for the new generation and a live action movie. You mustn't make it look cheesy or over the top... which quite sadly was the case with this one. It was directed by an Oscar winning director (who also directed a twilight movie). And a studio that has recently produced better than the original adaptation of the jungle book (which I really loved). So one wonders what must have gone wrong. That I think, we will find out later. But for now if I have to say something positive about this movie it would be its visual effects. They were quite gorgeous if not entirely believable. The design of the CGI characters were reminiscence of the original ones. Belle played by Emma Watson though not as great as I wanted her to be, seems to have done her job. And even if the songs didn't flow as greatly with the story, you could still enjoy them. The choreography, set design and the costumes also stole the show. Even the Humour even if cheesy at places worked because of its talented cast. It managed to make me laugh (especially Gaston) hence making it a better movie than it really was... I will give it a 7/10...P. S.- You may enjoy it because of the nostalgia factor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Delight of a beautiful cinematic tale,"A beautiful film crucially inspired with artistic perspective and multifarious virtuosity of solid directorial pulse by Bill Condon in his cinematic canvass, also including sequences of tribute to the great tradition of classic musicals, with the potentiality of establishing the film as a future classic itself. Emma Watson is wonderful, Dan Stevens is superb, Ewan McGregor is amazing, Emma Thompson is excellent, the great gentleman of acting Sir Ian McKellen is euphorically enjoyable as always delivering his touch of gem, while exquisite performances are also offered at any rate by a brilliant cast in every role of actors such as Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Kevin Kline, Audra McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Stanley Tucci, Haydn Gwynne, Hattie Morahan, Ray Fearon, etc. Delight of a fine cinematic tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Live Action Disney Adaptations -  Nostalgia Run Amok?,"The question is exactly what do we expect from these Disney live action remakes of classic animated films? Only you as a viewer or original fan can fully answer that question.I will however at least from my point of view attempt to gain a perspective given that we've been presented with three straight remakes, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and in this instance Beauty and the Beast.With each of these instances there's arguments to be had in relation to whether the original is an absolute classic, whether the film has enough material to flesh out an extended live action feature or even whether just on principal remaking Beauty and the Beast, a film that's universally adored by critics and audiences alike whether this's even a project that should be attempted.Lets focus on a couple of these aspects, I'll admit that I had intermittingly seen parts of the 1991 animated feature and was very familiar with the songs but had never watched the film from beginning to end until literally two weeks before seeing this years live action adaptation so on one hand I don't have the baggage of twenty years or more of preconceptions for what the film should do in its live action guise, however seeing both the film versions within the space of two weeks does come with the advantage (or maybe baggage) of being able to see things in a more mirrored perspective which with this film in particular was a fascinating thing to behold.On the point I've just made I'm going to go down the road of them recreating those scene moments with an accuracy which to many a fan I'm sure was pure delight to simply see an exact mirrored scene only with a live action cast, the opening Belle musical sequence is the quintessential example of this with every aspect pretty much identically replicated to a precision that I've not quite seen on this large scale, yes we saw similar things like it in their Cinderella adaptation a couple years ago but that film was so short with plenty of potential to improve and to mould into something that isn't exactly a clone of it's animated counterpart, however I would say that it didn't completely work for Cinderella and also in respect to The Jungle Book Jon Favreau it would appear did want to go beyond what the Disney animated feature did and made it certainly a more cinematic experience type of film that although yes had nods to said animated film but did have ambitions beyond those Disney constraints.To carry on that point I will simply go onto what I deem to be the films greatest strength and unsurprisingly it is the musical sequences of which the film lives and breaths off of, the question then becomes what exactly are we enjoying about these sequences because haven't we already seen and heard them? Yes and no is my unsurprising conclusion to this question, to focus on two songs in particular 'Gaston' and 'Be Our Guest' these are impeccably entertaining songs in their own right so why did these work even better in this format? I suppose it's down to the physical theatrical performance involved in recreating them, specifically Gaston as so much of the song is for a comedic effect that is only amplified with the performance song and dance piece that it is, in respect to Be Our Guest the visual treat that the animated film created again here is amplified to a splendiferous visual treat that only a creative more physical form can lend to the sequence.What also must be said is that when talking about this more theatrical performance and the positives it brings it's also hugely reliant upon the individual actors involved and with Gaston in particular Josh Gad, Luke Evans and that whole ensemble are what gives that sequence the strength it has, also the vocal performances of the Be Our Guest voice cast is impeccable, equally when we're talking about the opening Belle sequence the same rule is applied, yes the song is adequately performed by Emma Watson, but it's hard when clearly we've heard this song performed by a more than superior singer and given that the opening is most certainly a scene for scene recreation of the animated feature the startling contrast of such qualities are much more keenly and therefore negatively noted by the viewer.I'm clearly going into many specifics that a normal reviewer would not do but I'm trying to find out exactly what it is about these remakes that we clearly flock to see as an audience, as this is part of a more broader film debate given in other areas of the film world we've experienced films like Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, films that overly rely on the audiences nostalgia for the past film products in order to positively survive, yes that's an extremely harsh statement to make but given that Beauty and the Beast regularly just recreates exact scenes from the past film the point I'm trying to explore is exactly at what point does a remake or nostalgia kill or make a film that is in front of you.In respect to this years Beauty and the Beast adaptation, my overall reaction was one of differing feelings, there were the joys of those particular musical moments being recreated, but equally I was unsure what exactly the film generally was bringing to the table as a project, the film does add some scenes to the fray for further context for main characters and there was two extra songs, however I particularly thought that although they did the film no harm I didn't think 'oh isn't it really good they've included that' So overall an inconclusive reaction from me and I'm going to continue to have this debate with myself but I do believe that a more capable group of film reviewers/writers might be able to more articulate an argument.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Uplifting and moving - very well done.,"As a fan of the original cartoon, I also really enjoyed this remake. The songs are as wonderful as ever and the cgi effects really add to the film.

A Cinematic Beauty,"I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who likes classic Disney movies and well-made fantasy movies.The plot flow and musical sequences follows the original animation, but the scenery is gorgeous, the acting is fine and the singing is great.I think that the CGI really enhanced the film. I especially liked the appearance and personification of the Beast.Emma Watson offers a more intellectual and emotionally controlled Belle, which I welcome over the overly optimistic and feminine Belle from the animation.I also highly recommend the 2014 French/German version called ""La belle et la bête"" – the fantasy elements are stronger and more abstract, but it's visually powerful.This film really brings to life the Grimm's brothers tale, which is based on the 17th century French novel.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the Best Remakes,"Amazed!!Probably the best word I can use to describe my feeling upon watching the film in theaters. It truly was an excellent film. It certainly had some originality, even though it was a remake of the 1991 animated classic. The characters were well driven, and came to life, more realized than I could have imagined.I still feel the animated version is far more superior, but this is definitely a close second. The acting wasn't terrible, however, Emma Watson is the most memorable as Belle. She was great. A great step for her, from the days of Hermione in the Harry Potter series. The part of Maurice was better than the animated film, Kevin Kline was nearly unnoticeable, as I didn't recognize him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the beast,"A very good movie. Emma Watson embodied the character of Bell excellently, CGI in the film was good but in the faces it was not good, the servants are still enjoying in the film even though their songs are not as good as the original film, I felt that the film had lost the charm of the original film, they deleted the scene of Belle And The Best in the Snow pissed me off, the new scenes that were put in the film did not need to be prepared in one scene, their focus on the witch was not interesting, the film was too long And bored, I felt that it was a copy of the original movie with extended scenes and some new scenes. If you see beauty and the beast, I advise you to watch the anime version. All the nice things in the movie were in the original version, most of the new things were bad",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A feel good movie,"I arrived at this film in a less than conventional way. I knew the basic fairy story since I was a boy but had at the time of the live action version being released had not seen the animated version. Because I enjoy film music I knew and have enjoyed various Alan Menken works so elected to get the new soundtrack (which has now been on a loop in my car and driving my passengers insane). I enjoyed the music so much that I soon set off to my local cinema and watched the new movie. So that makes Emma Watson my 'first' Belle and I thought she carried the whole film with great charm and style.On reading the various reviews comparing the live action with the animated version I decided to next see the animated version and while enjoyable it, in my humble opinion, does not hold a candle (or should I say Lumierre) to the modern version. I think those saying otherwise are wearing their nostalgia tinted specs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Good-ish.,"After reading so many 1/10, I feel compelled to write a review. It's not the greatest ever film but it's a good one, much better than many of the CGI films out there. This is a fantastic update to a classic. The great actors (Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and Ian McKellen) lend their voices to the inanimate objects and as a result, they are very moving; I teared. Luke Evans is a bad guy who is really good to hate. Even the Belle here has agency and strength to stand up to brutes. She's a good role model to little girls who watch the show.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast Lacks the Beauty,"I just want to say that if people like Emma Waston, that's fine but if you're a huge fan of hers, I suggest you don't read this review.Now I love the original animated Beauty and the Beast so I knew this movie wouldn't live up to the original. With that being said, this new movie does have some merits. The CGI in this movie is rather good and the scenery is beautiful. I also love what they did with the castle. In a way, the castle feels alive too and I thought that was a great twist. The costumes are also really gorgeous.As for acting, everyone delivers a great performance save for one actress who I'll get to in a minute. Luke Evans was stellar as Gaston. You can tell he was enjoying himself and was amazing. Josh Gad of course was funny as always. Ewan McGregor did a rather good job as Lumiere and Ian McKellan was a pretty decent Cogsworth. You also have Stanley Tucci, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Audra McDonald and Emma Thompson also giving it their all. Now as for the Beast, he was decent. I haven't seen Dan Stevens in anything but this and I thought he did an okay job. He could have been better but I thought he was fine.But the worst part of this movie is Emma Watson.Again, if you like Emma that is fine but she was not the right choice of Belle. Not only do they not even try to make her look like Belle but she doesn't feel like Belle. She tries to deliver classic Belle lines but it sounds like she doesn't trust the lines. She feels so awkward and stiff. Every line feels beyond forced and nothing about it feels organic. And the biggest issue is her singing voice. I know Emma isn't a trained singer but even so, that doesn't really change the fact that she cannot hold a tune. She's boring, bland and just all around dull.If you are dying to see this movie, I say go for it but I really think you're better waiting for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Do yourself a favor and just watch the animated version again,"It's incredible how lifeless this live-action adaptation (with real, breathing humans) is compared to the 1991 animated version. The efforts to make the love story more believable were appreciated, but still fell way short and the effort was barely there in terms of writing and acting. The visuals were unimpressive at the least to downright ugly in some. (A simple example would be the rose, just sadly trapped in glass, not even glowing. Lifeless.) The musical pieces were bland, nothing really special, like the commitment was just halfway, just something they had to do. (Be Our Guest was especially disappointing: badly designed, choreographed and directed that really, you would beg to just watch the animated version again instead.) I would've cut some of those additional songs as well. The singing, except for 6-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, was mediocre. Autotune was definitely used for a lot of them, but you can especially tell with lead Emma Watson. The acting was also all over the place. Out of the actors we see on screen, only Luke Evans really commits to his role, his best moments being in the first half of the movie. Dan Stevens' performance is hard to decipher, since his voice was heavily edited for Beast, and his face is completely CGI. Also eye roll-worthy were the fake French accents some voice actors had to use while others retain their own English accents, and Mrs. Potts voiced by Emma Thompson had a cockney accent. Remember that everyone is in France anyway. Either hire French actors or just drop the 'accent' entirely. This movie was nothing but a complete cash grab for Disney, and the box office numbers will unfortunately let them keep making movies this empty.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Redundant, but what the heck.","Upon viewing Jon Favreau's Jungle Book (2015) for the second time, I admired how far a departure it was from its Disney source material. The pillars of familiarity were leaned upon but the films strengths were drawn from some remarkable new ideas and execution. If Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast (2017) can be admired for anything it is giving the people what they want. Aside from a handful of new songs and character tweaks, this new adaptation is almost painstakingly dutiful to the 1991 Disney feature. There will be some, like me, who find it all a little too redundant; but for the bulk of viewers the relentless nostalgia won't disappoint.There is no point in prefacing anything with ""spoiler alerts"", as you have already (ostensibly) seen this movie. Belle is the rural French misfit in her small village. Beautiful, but ""a funny girl"" simply because she thinks for herself. Emma Watson portrays Belle capably, but without much range. Her opening number shows promise, hitting her required pitches without unnecessary flourishes. She floats through the lively town square in ennui. The long takes are well crafted and the music plays like a sing-along, kids who know the words will make the theater pretty adorable. Kevin Klein as Belle's father (Maurice) is a bit of a departure from the original. He is not the buffoonish cartoon, but a more haunted widower. The Gaston role is filled with ease by Luke Evans. He is a powerful singer and has the convincing swagger that comes with the territory. His lacky, LeFou (Josh Gad) couldn't be more at home in the movie if he was actually animated. The issue with the vibrancy of the setting is it does offset Belle's dream of escaping the ""boring village.""Our first glimpse of the castle actually occurs in the prologue. The arrogant and spoiled Prince hosts a glamorous ball that's little more than an embarrassment of decadence. A former plot hole is filled when it's explained that curse affects more than the castle. The local villagers are cleared of any memory of the castle and its dwellers. Years pass and Maurice has the misfortune of taking a fateful wrong turn to the castle. From this point on the CGI absorbed setting just doesn't live up to the first act. Famous names voice the cursed inhabitants, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellan, Stanley Tucci, and Emma Thompson. Once Belle arrives on the scene the ""Be Our Guest"" number can't arrive fast enough. Once it does, I'll confess to being a bit disappointed. As the song played I couldn't help but have the Orbach track playing in unison to McGregor's and it became all too clear I was watching a remake, and only a passable one.I would say that the film is entirely unnecessary, were it not for the amazing title number. I was not sure who had voiced Mrs. Potts through the film. As the vocals began for the ""Beauty and the Beast"" dance, I would have put money on Julie Andrews. I was pleased to find that it was Emma Thompson, every bit the equal of Angela Lansbury.Much has been made about certain political elements in the film, (I.E. Homo-erogeny, diversity.) These are trivial. Had the film developed these elements into more daring areas, it may have provided some very welcome spice to the proceedings. This is a beautiful movie, but comes up short in ways I might be too apathetic to articulate. I craved something that the film may never have intended to provide. If I had to boil this review down to one adjective I'd say ""harmless."" Not a glowing recommendation, but you're likely to get exactly what you want out of it just not an inch more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I loved this film!,"Very much like the cartoon! The singing was really good ... Emma Watson ... what a star! The acting was great.

The thing that let it down a little for me was the make up of The Beast, I thought it was a little too scary for the film and the wolves were quite a bit nastier than the cartoon version. Young children may be scared by these things.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Fine equals disappointing in this case,"1. Belle is basically the Hermione Granger of her time. Like there are so many similarities. 1. They are both empowered females who always have their nose stuck in a book thirsting for more knowledge, #2They both have muggle fatherssee, so many. And Emma Watson convinces you that this character would look past the mundane, and surface level stuff to what is underneath.2. As an aside though, she seems to live in a town where everyone seems to treat reading like it's the devil's water but it has a library anyway, and that's one of the things here which strikes me as more odd now than the last time I saw this. I mean why does no one else like reading, this version of France seems more like U.S. Congress.3. The beast is again a cautionary tale here and that caution is- don't be an ******* or you won't get any poon tang. OK, it's a bit more complicated than that. If you don't know, he begins the film as a prince who's vain and detestable but is turned into a beast by an elderly woman who he turns away one night in the cold. He has until the last petal on a rose falls to learn how to love or he and his household are basically trapped this way. So what we can discern from this is, be kind to your elders, and yeah, basically don't be a dick.4. You can learn a bit more from the courtship here though than from the 1991 film. The movie is trying to prove that there is something beneath all the hair, fangs, and rough exterior and get to the tender soul underneath. So I liked that the two talk and bond over books and she reaches him and vice versa. The lesson is, locking down pretty women is hard work. Yeah, he could have set his sights lower and saved himself much earlier but who wants to be a prince with a desperate chick hanging on your arm.5. It also helps if you can sing, and Dan Stevens can definitely do that. He brings a gruffness to the beast's voice without sounding like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables, so that's a good thing. Most of the songs are in fact from the 1991 version with a few new ones. One called Evermore is actually really good. Emma actually does a nice job here too, sounding a lot like the Belle from the 1991 film. Only musical choice I would have made differently is make Audra McDonald Mrs. Potts cause she belted ""Tale as Old as Time"" a lot better than Emma Thompson.6. So let's move on to the film's villain, and i'm seeing a lot of comments that Gaston is just misunderstood and all he needs is a good woman to turn him from narcissistic, preening jackass into a kindly soul like the beast. It's a little bit like saying if Patrick Bateman settled down he'd be less of an American Psycho. Gaston turns more and more into a sociopath as the film goes on, and like millions of women have shown us twice already, that just isn't sexy unless your name is Christian Grey and you own your own sex room. Luke Evans is perfect in this role by the way.7. It's his little buddy whose been a bit more controversial though as Disney made the announcement that Lefou is gay, which has upset certain parents groups. Well let's make this short and sweet. It's as if no one took a clue from a man singing about the physical attributes, sexiness, and all around perfection of another man in the 1991 film and is now like grandma finally coming to the realization that little Billy and his buddy Henry aren't playing video games all the time in his room. Other than that there is a one second scene at the end of the film, which amounts to just about nothing. This will not cross any kid's radar.8. Looking at Josh Gad's performance as Lefou though, he did what he could. He's a bit annoying when he doesn't have good material and unfortunately for the most part he doesn't here.9. But let's talk about the CGI cause there is some confusion here. As we all know the beast's servants are all turned into what it would look like if Pixar ever decided to make a movie about what happens late at night in Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Candlesticks, teapots, clocks, they all move fairly well here but they're expressions came off a bit hollow to me, which is funny because the beast's came off a bit better at times. Did the old lady actually punish the servants more by giving them the facial movement of an overly-botoxed 60 year old? A question I kept asking myself, especially after The Jungle Book last year, is what happened here? This is where I really missed the animated movie most.10. That hand-held mirror that let's you see everybody all the time that the beast has is actually kinda creepy now when you think about it.11. Lastly, isn't it odd that the film keeps telling us that Belle wants to explore the world and wants so much more out of life but neither movie really says ""Belle went on to feed the hungry and help the homeless"" or ""Belle traveled the world and became the first female French chef"" or something like that. It's just ""She lived happily ever After"". Who the hell lives happily ever after though? And what does that even mean? Maybe she's just hooked on anti-depressants like a Long Island housewife because her husband has stopped trying. Just saying, she wanted to see the world but seems to be settling into a marriage.

Beautiful live action version,"I found this version of Beauty and the Beast to be quite refreshing.

Beauty and the Beast || 2017 (@cmp_moviereviews),"It's been rather difficult to get on board with Disney's current trend of live action remakes. While there have been a few memorable ones, I believe that ""Beauty and the Beast"" will simply be remembered for relying on nostalgia. There is an echo of similarity between the cartoon we all know and love and this adaptation, but there are also moments of elaboration that fill in particular gaps that might have been questioned in the original. Some moments don't chime as well this time around, but overall, this is a remake that is worth seeing due to the filmmakers sensitivity of honoring what has come before. #beautyandthebeast",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beauty and the Beast is garnished with glamour but lacks the inner beauty of the original.,"The original hand drawn animation is one of Disney's classics and has garnered acclaim from both critics and audiences. Disney daringly attempted to adapt the tale as old as time with visual effects and live acting. It's able to capture the magical enchanting allure which made the original all so memorable but pales in comparison. Let's face it we all know the story, a prince is cursed and is transformed into a beast and must acquire true love to break the spell. The overall story remained intact and had minor tampering, although some additional backstory elements were included such as Belle's mother. The musical numbers mostly remained the same, with a few alterations, including some new fresh songs to fill up the extended runtime. All the budget clearly went on producing ""Be Our Guest"" and rightly so! Consistently makes me want to dance and sing along to McGregor's false French accent. The visual effects, particularly the cursed castle items, were top notch as Lumiere and Cogsworth glisten in the warm candle light. The production and costume design were phenomenal and prevented the film from feeling like a musical stage set. Condon was able to produce a cinematic edge to the story that makes it viably enchanting for both younger and older audiences. A few issues that I had were with uninspired lines of dialogue. The script felt too artificial and was unable to inject any sort of natural characterisation. Consequently, this resulted in the actors being portrayed as cosplayers as opposed to real character actors. Watson's singing voice clearly had some modifications *cough* auto tune *cough*, especially during the opening number. I did also find she overacted everything which infuriated me, again it all comes down to this sense of fakery. I will say the supporting cast were excellent and suited their roles. Whilst this is an enjoyable magical romance, it's weighted down by a studio that was fearful of changing anything. Also an openly gay character? Right...",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Plain,"Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney's 1991 Beauty and the Beast was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim Carrey's expressions. The side character animations were poorly executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting, because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is by far the worst remake of an animated classic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Classic never change,"We may be amazed by all the magic Disney created with the classic love story Beauty and the Beast. With all the technology involved the recreation of all the characters were magical. Besides the amazing effects, the lesson remains the same: self-love.Belle is a girl that doesn't fit in, other villagers think she is weird for being interested in books and for not being concerned with how she looks or appearances. In contrast we have Gaston who is the ultimate hunk of the village that comes home from war to seeking wife, everyone in the village wants to marry him, but Belle doesn't. This makes Gaston think she is playing hard-to-get and wants her more. Belle's father is the misunderstood scientist that creates beautiful things to sell in another town.When Belle is captured in the castle, we meet the Beast as a terrible and selfish person who is kept under the spell. The main character may be Belle with all her intelligence and good-sense that shows us that being intellectual help us see the tragic world we are living with a new approach.But the character we can all relate to the most is the Beast, the lack of self-esteem is what we may see at every age. How the Beast develops in the story is the self-realization of who he really is and what matters the most: to love ourselves is more important than what others think of us. The Beast is enchanted for his frivolity and what makes him behave like an animal, but when Belle comes and shows him that outer image of himself is not the most important thing, rather he should show who he really is; that is when the change of his own image comes from within.To know yourself, is to realize that what matters the most to you is what counts, and not what others think matter.

Belle (Emma Watson) is tired of the provincial life and the tiresome pursuing self-obsessed Gaston (Luke Evans). LeFou (Josh Gad) is his adoring man-servant. Belle asks for a rose from her traveling father. He takes a rose from the castle and is imprisoned by the Beast. Belle volunteers to take her father's place as the Beast's prisoner.Emma Watson is a good actress. Her singing is average but that has its charms. Gaston is a great villain. The CGI looks good for the most part but I am uncertain about the Beast. Belle is a modern empowered character which does strike me as a little odd. It would help to have more scenes like the villager berating Belle for teaching the little girl to read. The more backwards the villagers, the better it is for Belle to rebel against. Then there is the basic prisoner love story at the core of this fairy tale. It remains problematic to me. There are ways to ameliorate this but the movie sticks to the story. This is good but the Disney animation remains the better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
What are people talking about?,"people reviewing this film are harsh, this is a great take on the original cartoon, great acting by Emma Watson and Dam Stevens this is such a good film loved the music and the dancing, loved the romance between Belle and the Beast this is such a good film, loved it should win an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Visually stunning, otherwise underwhelming","Although a film's watch-ability may not be directly implied by its Academy Award nods, there is a reason why the 1991 version became the first animated feature film ever to be nominated for the Best Picture category. That version had everything: gorgeous animation, songs of warmth and affection, tremendous voice acting, and a story that was both traditional and far-ahead of its time. We all know how Belle, well-read as she is and dissatisfied with her laid-back village life, longs for adventure. Her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice, is a kind of a bumbling simpleton at first, but is indeed a caring parent and protective of his precocious daughter, whose talents are not lost on him. A village which at once becomes a mob on the mere whim of a deeply narcissistic, insecure person.With such an impression, I was hoping that the live-action version would take the film's already-legendary status even further and make it an all-time classic. Alas, I have to admit I am disappointed. There are several things in this film that were not in the animated version: the lead protagonists' backgrounds are more defined, there is a minor twist in the final act, Le Fou's predicament is more deserving of empathy than the foolish sidekick he was in 1991 are the ones that come to mind.First up, the story. It stays largely faithful to the original (save for the twist I mentioned above). The humor works rather well, but is rather forced at times, leading to some awkward chemistry between the lead pair as well as between Gaston and Le Fou. In terms of progression, here is where I felt let down: Beast offering his gigantic library as a token of affection to Belle was a pivotal moment in the animated version, it made Belle realize that there is a softer side to her ferocious host. The title song also feels a bit flat; when Angela Lansbury sang with her heart, you could feel the quickening of the heartbeats, the racing of the pulses, and the irresistible magic of the moment when Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom. As Belle finally trusts Beast by resting her head on his shoulder and the Beast is totally taken by surprise, his servants encourage him further, enhancing the timelessness of both the film and the song. Sadly, the live action has no such charm. The build-up is rushed, the song ends before you can realize what is happening, and Emma Thompson, as celebrated a thespian she is, tries her best but is unable to match Lansbury's memorable rendition. I was also disappointed to not see ""Being Human"" in this film, it was a song that demonstrated the servants' aspirations and could have served to illustrate how their lives where before the curse took effect. And with just a touch over two hours, the film's pace seems prolonged and ponderous.I am not sure if the lead pair is miscast. On their own, they are pretty efficient: Emma Watson is convincing in her portrayal of a forward-thinking Belle. Dan Stevens is left to bare his soul as a tortured fiend, which he does mostly well. But its when they are together that feels a bit underwhelming. Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson's chemistry in 1991 was terrific and amazing, the former's gentle civility perfectly contrasting the latter's jarring cruelty and eventually transformed elegant nobility. It was refreshing to see Le Fou (played by the excellent Josh Gad) have a human side to him, which made his performance all the more relevant in these times. Luke Evans is equally superb, as the obnoxiously self- centered Gaston who manipulates people to his will. Kevin Kline deserves plaudits for his portrayal as well. However, I don't think Ewan McGregor was that convincing as a French candelabra, to be honest. With an odd French accent, his banter-filled exchanges with Cogsworth lack the rapier wit of Jerry Orbach-David Ogden Stiers' double team. The film does have some positives though: Le Fou's characterization, the lead pair's backstory (both mentioned above), and the stunningly exquisite production design. The detailing was intricate and dazzling, especially in the castle's interiors and Belle's ballroom gown.Overall, this film works, but in hindsight, I should have watched this without much expectation. So that would be recommendation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I enjoyed this movie emensly,"I find extreme fault with anyone who writes a bad revue about this movie. I find for 1. It was a little bit of somewhat typecast to put Emma Watson in the Lead Actress role. Come on people she played the part of a character who was born in Paris France and raise on the French Country side. Ok, for those of you not aware of Emma Watson's background She was born in Paris, France. This is Why I say type casting she speaks French as well as English, as for those of you complaining about her sing voice she would not of gotten the part if she could not sing. So get over your self. I myself am a singer I can tell from her voice she is probably a 2nd alto. The p e son who sang in the animated movie was a 2nd soprano there is a whole octave difference between the two ranges. I myself am a tenor alto I bridge two different ranges. As for the rest unless you can do better you shouldn't judge I for one loved this version so much I purchased the blu Ray version of this movie and placed it beside the blu Ray of the Disney animated beauty and the beast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Moved film,"I was moved by this film very much! I love this film. In this film, there are many songs and these songs express feelings or situation of characters. By this way, I was easy to understand what character is or their situation very much. These songs are fun and attract us. Next, I was moved by Bell. I think that she is pure and an upright woman. I think that she show us importance of honesty. Next, I think that this film expresses the strong of woman because Bell faces adversity with courage. I thought that this point are different from other princesses of Disney film. Because of this, I like this film more than other films of Disney princess. Finally, I think that you should watch this film. Before I watched this film, I thought that a live-action based on anime is difficult. However, this film is great than I thought.

"If not for Emma Watson very bland acting, and bad clothes i would give it 10","The movie was that good, however Emma Watson acting is like subpar and a bit of monotone. Her Belle is kind of different with the sarcastic, cartoon Belle. I missed the belle expressive face when facing Gaston being narccisist he is.For The cgi, the music, i like everything. It still one of the best princess remake of disney tho Belle is not really good. The thing is, this is fairy tale, and the dress doesn't look ethereal or magical enough nor does it looks correct to the history element. It can be a better dress, their first dance was supposed to be perfect, i guess disney need a better dress designer.I hate of why it is Yellow when its supposed to be GOLD and disney can make it with some roses texture since its her signature and there are lots of better dresses in the movie, plus beast clothes are very gorgeous and historically close, while belle one are so 2D, no depth in color and underwhelming. The castle and others were magical but hers are so badly designed. They didn't read the why the old designer design stuff that way, which i think too bad for supposed bookworm like emma.I like the new beast altho i love the old look more because of his underbite which is more beast-ly.But still i really love the new one.*edit i just find out that the dress looks ugly bcs of emma watson bad influence, now i hate her more in this role. She is forever my favorite Hermione but, Belle is my favorite disney princess and she kind of ruined it with her Wokeism.

Miscast of Belle,"Overall the film was decent, a bit boring at times. The acting was OK, but it failed to ever ""sweep you away"" like the animated version did for years.The most frustrating part was Belle, or Emma. I don't dislike her and I could care less about feminism. However, I do think a lead role that includes substantial signing should be able to.......SING!The horrible use of auto-tune was cringe worthy and her English accent was very thick for someone that was born in Paris and grew up in France....I though McGregor was great as Lumiere and hid his English accent well. Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth are supposed to be English, so that worked well.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
What a fantastical and heartwarming tale,"This film tells the story of an arrogant and selfish prince, who is condemned to be a monster by a witch. To break the spell, he has to find true love.I was captivated by the amazing computer graphics of ""Beauty and the Beast"" right from the start. How the teacup, candelabra, wardrobe and other household items come alive is spectacular. Belle looks stunning, and her character is simply beautiful inside out. This is augmented by Emma Watson's clean, intelligent and sophisticated image. The story is full of love, and it makes my heart melt. The first dinner at the castle scene is spectacular, it's very festive and grand. The ending drives me to tears. It's such a fantastical and heartwarming tale.I didn't think i would like this film so much!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A bit dark, yet worthy","Greetings again from the darkness. An entire generation still enjoys their childhood animated movie memories thanks to Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994). We are now a quarter-century later and Disney is looking to re-create the magic (and hopefully cash in) with Live Action versions of all three as it did with Cinderella (2015) and last year's The Jungle Book (sensing a trend?). Up now is director Bill Condon's mixture of live action, CGI and music for Beauty and the Beast.The 18th century story (1740) by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve was re-written and shortened by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont after Barbot's death. Director Jean Cocteau's 1946 French film version looks to have been a key influence for this updated 'Beast', while the 2014 version with Vincent Cassel will probably now be rendered forgotten. Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and Evan Spiliotopoulos (The Huntsman: Winter's War) team with Oscar winner Condon, whose musical movie resume includes Chicago and Dreamgirls, to inject some contemporary aspects to Belle's personality, as well as a bit more backstory for quite a few characters  all while staying true to the 1991 version.Emma Watson proves a nice choice for Belle as she has what it takes to be nice yet tough, while still being an oddball within her own community. Belle is a bookworm who dares to help other girls to read, while also being the brains behind her father's (Kevin Kline) work. She realizes her neighbors view her as a curiosity – and there is even a song to prove it! Ms. Watson brings strength, independence, and courage to the role. These traits and others are on full display even before her first encounter with the beast.Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") is the beneficiary of an extended backstory for the Prince, which includes a large dance and musical production at the castle, leading to his being cursed for having no love in his heart. Most of the scenes with Beast utilize CGI for the face and head. This effect worked for me as I found the look fascinating and able to fulfill the necessary emotions, though the non-beast Prince would be considered the weakest link in this fairy tale chain.Since the comparisons to the 1991 version are inevitable, and certainly a matter of personal opinion, Luke Evans made a wonderfully pompous Gaston, while Josh Gad was quite humorous as LeFou, Gaston's loyal sidekick who is also the center of the misplaced controversy (not worthy of discussion here). The staff – both live versions and special effects – includes Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette. Each bring their own touch to the roles, with Ms. McDonald being a particular standout, and Ms. Thompson having the most thankless job as replacement for Angela Lansbury.While I found this version quite enjoyable and well done, it's a bit confusing why the decision was made to go so dark and foreboding. It's not young kid friendly at all, and seems as if the target audience is millennials who were raised on the 1991 version. This was done at the expense of inviting a new generation to explore the story and characters. Parents should probably avoid taking any kids under age 10 or 11, and the film easily could have received a PG-13 rating. 8-time Oscar winner Alan Menken returns to score the film (he did the 1991 version as well), plus he wrote new songs with Tim Rice and there are some original lyrics by Howard Ashman. With only one viewing, it's doubtful any of the new songs will be instant classics, but ""Be Our Guest"" is a definite crowd-pleaser (again).Of course, it's an impossible task to please everyone when you mess with the classics, but overall, it's a nice twist for fans of the 1991 animated version. Likely a missed opportunity to bring new youngsters into the fantastical BATB world, it does show that the animated to live action transformation can be well done  and that's a relief with The Lion King and The Little Mermaid on the way. Dear Disney – don't mess 'em up!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Absolutely stunning and magical!,"Not sure why some adults with a thorn in their side have given this film a below average score, it was absolutely magnificent! From the moment it began you could feel the immaculate attention to the incredible details visually. Any Downton Abbey fan will revel with joy watching Dan Stevens as Beast. Emma Thompson as Belle was a perfect fit, and yet brought even more depth to the character. I watched with a smile on my face and a singing spirit to the favorite songs we know and love. I can watch this with my three year old niece, my 13 year old daughter, and my friends. In an age of trash TV and films that leave you despondent, Beauty and the Beast 2017 paints you with gold leaf tenderness and an abundance of giggles from Garson and La Foo. Cogsworth and Lumier are brilliant, Ewen McGregor was perfect. The cast was diverse, and open minded. The final scene visually blew my mind, and had my tween daughter jaw dropped. This is a one of a kind, beautiful film that all who made it should feel beyond proud to have created it for many future generations to experience and clap to.

"Happily, gone wrong it has NOT! (Well. . . Kinda')","Imagine if Disney announced a new live action remake of Fantasia and decided to keep Mickey Mouse in it. Try to envision how the photo- realistic CGI might look. Not a hand-drawn Mickey swanning around with a bucket-carrying broomstick, but an actual mouse the size of a person wearing a sorcerer's costume and walking on its hind legs. Also a broomstick that has arms and hands and walks on its, er, hind straw.Would this hybrid human-rodent and its transmogrified cleaning tool look just as magical in live action as they did in the 1940 classic? You wouldn't bet your house on it; the mental image required to picture such a visualisation is weird and preposterous. If Big Mouse executives decided to give the project a go-ahead one question would linger at the core of it: why bother?And so now, you think this film will end up as Disney's revamped and bizarrely note-for-note ""Beauty and the Beast"" just as American filmmaker Gus van Sant treated British Cinema, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and his sacred thriller ""Psycho"" as if it were a blueprint for his much maligned shot-by-shot pathetic 1998 remake.Condon's movie may not have a giant rodent or personified straw broom, but there are comparable alternatives – from the titular bear/boar/buffalo-like creature to a range of magical household things, including singing and dancing furniture. There are times when it will certainly seem not conformable; but not in fact enough to make anybody come out of the cinema with a firm belief that talking teacups belong only in cartoons or acid trips. In fact, those who predicted this wouldn't hold a talking candle to the animated original are in for a bit of a pickle and will be pleasantly surprised. The tale may be as old as time, but it's retold with freshness, charm and flair.Happily, gone wrong it has not. (Well. . . Kinda')There are a few minor fumbles, but you're likely to walk away with a lightened step, a broad smile and at least one song-worm in your ear.The story remains rock solid: essentially a sweet two-hand-er (well, one hand, one paw) in which two bookworms fall in love, helped along by an assortment of sentient household items. Everything hangs upon the casting of those two roles, but Condon has picked his leads well. Dan Stevens appears in human form during a new prologue, in which his vain prince is coped-up, caked in David Bowie eye make-up and surrounded by simpering female admirers, before an enchantress appears and zaps him with a frankly unreasonable curse. From then on, he's in full Beast mode, with a sub-woofer voice and giant horns, resembling the cooler, better-dressed brother of the Faun from Pan's Labyrinth. The CGI used to purify furry Stevens is variable in quality, but as Beast storms around his dank keep's exquisitely designed turrets, the performance is consistently strong. As much as he bellows, the wounded soul beneath the bombast is always clear.As for Beauty, Emma Watson immediately charms in her big opening number, in which the heroine suffers a village-worth's of idiots sharing (what should be) their inner monologues through song. Watson faces one difficult sequence after another — memorable vocalised songs, tussles with talking wardrobes, emotional exchanges with a grouchy Heffalump — but finds just the right combination of innocence and grit. Plus, she doesn't sound like Fran Drescher, which is an immediate advantage.Emma Watson is as wonderful as she is, tough, lionhearted character, rich in self-confidence and sass, with an inspiring disdain for the many injustices of a cruel patriarchal world.Condon's set pieces are old school, picture book, rococo, on-the- studio-lot style edifices, appealing in a very decent and honestly a cartoon lover sort of way. Works for a lot of you, kids!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Better than expected.,"Okay I was not too thrilled over the movie by the time it was coming out. First announced yes. I wasn't so happy to see it anymore because Emma Watson got the role of Belle. I like Emma but prefer unknown women as the classic princesses. Even when I heard Angelina was Maleificent but I LOVED her in the role after all. So with Emma, I didn't love it but she suited the part. Did rather well and I was pleased.After the beast transformed at the end I was smitten with Matthew from Downton Abbey. Lol Oh how I miss thee. The show is no more.Another thing was the other characters. I did not like their new looks. That also wasn't so bad when watching. Although I much prefer Lumiere and his women more like how they were. The bird is weird. Oh and Mrs Potts, I miss the spout being her nose. Well I liked the cartoon ones much more but I wasn't as bothered by these ones as I had thought. Same for the beast. In the posters and ads he looked extra ugly but when watching it he was actually similar to the Disney beast.Lastly I thought this was going to be a whole new telling of the tale but it was actually a retelling of the classic which I actually enjoyed possibly more than a new creative spin. Including the classic songs. That made me happy. Wasn't a fan of the new songs added but oh well.So all in all. I liked it better than I had expected. Now I want to watch the Disney one.

Gorgeous film,"My full review can be read here:www.havekidwillteardrop.comWalking out all I could think was ""WOW!"". This movie is everything the animated version was and so much more!The live action movie follows the animated movie very closely. It has been a little bit since I saw the animated version, but I didn't notice anything missing from the original. The live action version has a few extra scenes than the animated version which adds to the backstory. I really thought these scenes were an excellent addition.I really loved this movie and it surpassed my expectations. I was a little worried about a live action movie after always loving the original - I wasn't sure it would measure up. The music was wonderful and the new songs that have been added compliment the original soundtrack perfectly. The costumes are wonderfully colorful and bright and scenes are beautiful. Cinematography and the CGI effects were also very good and felt seamless.There are so many things that make movies uniquely Disney and those qualities were evident in this movie too. The ""Be Our Guest"" scene had me flashing back to Fantasia for instance, and the overall magic of the film in all of it's beauty could really only be Disney.I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Eh?,"If you saw the animated version, then you have seen this movie. It's the same as the animated movie only live action. There was absolutely no reason for this movie to be made besides as an easy cash cow for Disney cashing in on the nostalgia of fans of the original. This movie brings nothing extra to the table.It took no chances and pandered to feminists and LGBT members when it wasn't necessary. There was no need to make a big deal of the blink and you miss it gay scene. There was also no need to make Gaston's sidekick gay or in love with Gaston. As far as the ballroom scene, it wasn't as mesmerizing as the original. I'm not a fan of Beauty and the Beauty. It's not my favorite Disney movie, but I must admit the ballroom scene was a masterpiece by itself and the best part of the original. I think the movie should have taken a chance and used the concept of the moral of the story and use it in a new twist like the numerous adaptions of the Cinderella movies do from the cheesier ones to the better ones like Ever After or Ella Enchanted.I checked it out. I loved the ending especially the clock's reaction, which caused me to actually laugh. I really wish they did not CGI Dan Stevens' Beast. So it wasn't a bad movie, but you can't mess with perfection.

People are not judging this film on its own merits...just viewing it with their reverence for the original.,"After seeing that this film came out on DVD recently and viewing it on a whim, I decided to go on IMDb to get a sort of consensus on it. And...wow! I didn't think I would be in the extreme minority here, because I loved this film. Loved it. Look, I get all the criticism. I was skeptical at first too; I doubted Disney wanted to accomplish anything more than a mindless popcorn flick with this film, knowing hordes of mindless sheeple would flock to the movie in droves because it's a remake of a classic. Pure capitalism is what drives the film industry now, right? But the longer I watched, the more my breath was taken away. Yes, I'm aware that it is pretty damn similar to the original; but the lush beauty of the film has a sheer opulence to rival Versailles. Complaints on the character designs notwithstanding, the absolute beauty of the village and the castle blew my mind. A lot of people are complaining about the lack of originality in this movie. And to that I say...well, it's a remake. I'm aware that remakes can drastically differ from the original, and I have no problems with filmmakers being inspired by another's work. But still...it's a remake, guys. It wasn't the script from the cartoon repeated verbatim; there were some nice, subtle funny new bits thrown in, and I, on one hand, adored the new songs in the film. However, I will concur that the subplot regarding Belle's mom is historically inaccurate and adds nothing to the plot. But regardless, I think the film did a good job of triggering nostalgia while adding its own little flourishes in. Acting and performance wise, I've heard a lot of people complaining about Emma Watson; yes, you can tell she's not a professional singer, but I think she did a perfectly fine job as Belle. The real standouts here are Gaston and LeFou as portrayed by Luke Evans and Josh Gad. They are absolutely hilarious and breathe new life into these characters, and deserve an accolade of some sort just for making them likable alone. Singing wise, yes, you can tell that most of the actors aren't professional singers; none of them were horrid, though. If that sounds like faint praise for a score of ten, it's because I legitimately don't believe ""Emma Watson has a weak voice"" negates the emotions I felt while watching. If you just let yourself enjoy the renewed vitality of these characters and their story, you'll see how genuine the romance feels, how gingerly the characters develop into something there that wasn't there before. Bottom line: it's a beautiful story, that's why it worked in 1991, and that's why it worked yet again in 2017. If anything, this movie rekindled my admiration of the original, and I plan on viewing it again shortly.Pros: you know what you're getting. Even if you do believe it's a soulless money grab, the elegance of the music and the tenderness of the story cannot be eliminated. Also, the CGI is gorgeous.Cons: Again, it IS a remake, and if that bothers you, stay away. The character designs of Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, etc didn't bother me as much as others but definitely not as iconic as original. And yes, Emma Watson is no Paige O'Hara when it comes to singing. That may be a big deal for some people.In conclusion: Basically, this movie is the film equivalent of someone rewriting your favorite book to be more eloquent, refined, and lavish. Everything is bigger and bolder, but it's still not the original. You'll probably still prefer the original, but you may return to the remake every now and then for a renewed view of the story, that, who knows, may make you appreciate it even more now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An exact copy of the classic original,"Ever since Disney made a live action remake of the jungle book, they have been making remakes of our childhood films,and hope to continue doing that. And then you have this movie. We all know the story, A beautiful girl stumbles across a castle with talking house hold items and a beast, but soon enough they grow to love each other. I really liked all the people in this movie, they did a good job at playing their roles, whether they were a mild mannered tea cup, or a hairy creature. The special effects were good, and most of the musical numbers were great. However all the people and the music does not make up for the same exact story as the animated classic. I enjoyed The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon because all though they had some of the same elements, they boosted enough new elements and a new plot to keep the story going. While this movie doesn't do that at all. I expected some things do be different but it gave me the same characters, same plot, and mostly the same musical numbers. Hell they even had the same dialogue. So in the end, Beauty and the Beast may have some enjoyable moments, but that is not enough to keep us engaged when all it is an exact copy of the classic original. C- or 5/10.

More Aces Than a Stacked Deck,"Once again, I see people getting so personal with a mere film. The animated ""Beauty and the Beast"" is in my top ten Disney movies. It has charm and color and some really great singing. It is a tremendous story, based on an unforgettable fairy tale. So, as is the case with other films, there was a Broadway version made and it has become as successful as just about any other musical. All that said, I'm astonished by all the people giving this film a rating of ""one."" It has incredible special effects, great costuming, glorious sound. Most of the characters seem to work just fine. I would have cast someone besides Emma Watson as Belle, but she holds her own. There are times when the pacing drags a bit, but it stays on serve much of the time. I liked Kevin Kline as Maurice. He is always solid in his roles. I did find the conclusion quite disappointing. It didn't have that cathartic effect it should have. But it's far from a terrible movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A visual masterpiece that you MUST see....,"I have to admit it...I was dead wrong about ""Beauty and the Beast"". I had absolutely zero desire to see it because I really hate remakes. The only reason I did was because my wife insisted we go. And, when the wife insists...we go! I have now to thank my wife and must admit she was right...the film is terrific. The only reason I don't score this one an A+ is simply because so much of it is a regurgitation of the wonderful 1991 cartoon version by Disney.So why am I so positive about this movie? Well, to me it's simply the most visually stunning and artistic film I have ever seen...and I have reviewed thousands and thousands of films. I went to the theater fully expecting to hate the picture...but soon found it took my breath away...not just once but again and again...it's that beautiful. And, what I also really appreciate is that the film is the best looking CGI/live action combination I have ever seen and the 3D effects are much, much better than usual. With most live action films made in 3D, I generally leave with a feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie just as much in 2D as 3. And, all but a few scenes seem as if they were not even shot with 3D in mind. But not Beauty and the Beast. The filmmakers obviously thought out every possible aspect of the movie and each scene used the multidimensionality to its fullest. Because of that, I strongly recommend you not only see the film on the big screen but pay the extra money and see it in 3D. Really, you must see it on the big screen and in 3D. I have no desire to ever see the film on DVD or cable television...it is truly a big and impressive film you must experience in person. You can thank my wife later.By the way, a side note: I know there's been a lot of hubbub about the character Le Fou in this film because he's gay. I think if Disney hadn't said anything about this before the film was released, most folks would not have really cared one way or the other and many simply wouldn't have noticed. It doesn't smash you over the head and I don't see this movie as some 'gay agenda picture'...and I see it much like I see ""Some Like it Hot"". It's a shame, as I am sure a lot of people who were angered by this gay character probably wouldn't be so angry if they just saw the film and let themselves enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Total let down,"The original Beauty and the Beast was a classic but this remake is a rather unnecessary disappointment.

Literal remaking of a classic film,"Beauty and the Beast (2017) is a strange film to review as most of it feels like a frame by frame remake of the Disney classic.It's a good film by the fact that the animated version was great to begin with. Unlike The Jungle Book (2017) which improved on an average Disney film, Beauty and the Beast (2017) doesn't really warrant existing. You could have swapped the film for the original and you would have had the same amount of enjoyment.Any praise is really that the everyone involved did their jobs capably and produced an admirable copy. Let's hope Aladdin, Dumbo and the Lion King can bring something new and not be 'good' by being safe live action/CGI copies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Torturing Disappointment,"The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn't want to change the story much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don't really make sense and don't add up.I don't know whom should be blamed for the 'emotion delivery failure' is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for some certain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. We couldn't differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. In many scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions, soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by reading out loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.Cinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The original cartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copy everything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could have been better.I really don't advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed this time. It happens, though!. Hopefully we'll know what really happened.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very well-done live action remake to one of my favorite Disney animated classics,"Exceptionally well-done live action remake to one of my favorite Disney animated classics. Great casting, well-acted, amazing CGI affects, and memorable musical numbers. The story-line is pretty much similar with the animated version, but with some nice background story additions about Belle's mother and the Beast/Prince's father. Also liked the linking of magical enchantress to the villager ""outcast"" commoner Agathe. The 3 new songs ""Days In The Sun"", ""How Does A Moment Last Forever"", and ""Evermore"" added nice depth and background to this live-action version.The 2 acting performances which stood out were Emma Watson (Belle) and Luke Evans (Gaston). They both brought their animated characters to real-life as well as could be imagined. Emma Watson gave a charming, intelligent, sincere, and radiant performance as Belle. She performed her various singing moments admirably and with good emotion for a 1st time singer in a movie. It would be hard to imagine another actress who could have played this role of Belle as well as Emma Watson. She has made a nice transition from her childhood acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies to Belle in ""Beauty & The Beast"". Luke Evans gave an entertaining, profoundly over-the-top, and eventually villainous performance as Gaston. His singing prowess and theater background came through in his 2 musical numbers. Next to the CGI driven ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Evermore"", Gaston's 2 musical numbers were among the most memorable musical moments.The other supporting cast members, from Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, and Kevin Kline as Maurice fit their roles very well and pitch perfect also.The only reasons I only gave the remake 9 stars out of 10 are the Beast/Prince character and the ending felt a little rushed. As far as the Beast/Prince, his performance felt a bit too understated and smug at first compared to the animated version. His efforts to gain Belle's affection had more of a plan in the animated version than this live action version. The one scene where this difference stands out is when the Beast/Prince introduces Belle to his large library room. It is different and not as planned compared to the animated version. Also, would have preferred that the Beast had more human acting moments after his transformation back to a Prince. Dan Stevens still gave a very good performance as Beast/Prince, but just not up to the level of excellence as the rest of the cast. This brings me to the ending, which felt a little rushed. It would have been nice to extend the ending a little bit longer to get to know the human version of the castle characters after the curse was broken and their transformation back to human form was completed. Minor criticisms, but very few movies can be perfect...lol.Overall, great live-action remake by Disney. Well-cast, beautifully performed, and expertly directed. After ""Beauty & The Beast"" and ""Jungle Book"", looking forward to more Disney live-action remakes. I believe ""The Lion King"" is up next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
OK and the Beast,"A lot of creative set talent was completely wasted on poor casting. Belle was not very Belle. More makeup, crisper costume and better posture would have helped, if they insisted on using Watson. Director lost sight of who the movie was for, not him and his friends. Nothing more needs to be said.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
E Gad... could have been SO much better...,"The movie was great. The score was a wonderful mixture of the original tunes plus 3 new tunes as well, but no ""Only Human"" figure that one out. The cast was brilliantly picked, though Belle came off a bit stiff from time to time. The effects looked great, most of the time. Now my main complaint. Gad. Why. Why do they continue to hire this guy? He wasn't very funny in The Comedians. I couldn't stand his character in Angry Birds. The butt jokes in Frozen, and then we saw his dairy rotund and crack in Pixels with his antics in that movie (which would have been better without that actor...) And then they use him like a bad Kleenex in this film. Can we just stop hiring Josh Gad. He embarrasses the parents that try to take kids to a decent movie... every time. Beauty & the Beast was wonderful, but would have been so much better without Josh Gad. He ruins every movie his mug shows up in. Secret hidden Disney agenda or just continued hiring of a bad/disgusting actor over and over?",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Shot-for-shot an inferior remake of the original,"I like to think I keep myself across reviews of films from all quarters but I genuinely can't remember reading one of Beauty and the Beast that divulged it was simply a shot-for-shot remake of the original. So you can understand my disappointment when I came out of the cinema realising I could have saved my money and watched the 1991 classic at home (for me, one of Disney's greatest achievements).I have enjoyed the recent live-action remakes of Cinderella and (especially) The Jungle Book. Each took the original story and added their own identity with a few nice performances, special effects and surprises thrown in. Beauty and the Beast however stuck firmly to its original, successful model. And after the special effects master- class that was the remake of The Jungle Book, this CGI Beast was horribly fake and stilted in places.All the best songs were taken straight out of the 1991 edition. All the best scenes were taken straight out of the 1991 edition. And despite, on paper, the best cast yet, every single performance (barring perhaps Luke Evans as Gaston) was eclipsed by the 1991 edition.I'm glad I spent good money to see the live-action remakes of Cinderella and The Jungle Book. But with Beauty and Beast I feel I've been conned by sloppy and lazy film-making purely for the purpose of 'cashing in' (which Disney have been highly efficient at again I might add).Not a bad film... just entirely unnecessary. A waste of a great opportunity and a great cast. I'll be sticking to the 1991 original religiously from now on.Oh, and for my money, some of the singing voices (Especially Emma Watson) have been processed to within an inch of their lives.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Boring,"This movie is very overrated and the reason why the film is popular because of its promotion. Emma Watson performance is really boring as hell and her voice is not that good.

It's great.,"This is such a fun movie. Definitely doesn't deserve its low ratings. The songs are catchy, (some aren't great and others are). The casting was perfect, the only thing I could criticize is how ridiculous the talking objects are. Quite hard to take seriously, gets annoying, but that's just how it is. Trying to look past that, it's a very enjoyable movie for all ages and I recommend it. Worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Slightly Nostalgic & Incredibly Flat.,"Firstly, can I suggest that perhaps it would have been better had they strayed away from a classic remake, but instead, had created a comedic prequel featuring Gaston and LeFou since they were the real stars of this movie? It is sort of nostalgic- I'll give it that. And I'm not even too mad at the casting choices for any of the main roles. My main concern is with SUCH a big budget for this and after the success of the live-action Jungle Book-- how could a classic like this be given such bad treatment? The CGI was honestly horrendous. I felt it difficult to call this live-action when everything that surrounded the human characters seemed like a really bad theatre set- they didn't even feel like they're in a small, French town. If you're going to really push the CGI route- go full throttle. Don't use it on places that you need it the least- like the Beast's face for example. I'm familiar with Dan Stevens and I could see some of the facial remarks and quirks were him- but that's it. Otherwise, it could have been anyone. It looked like Belle was speaking to a green screen throughout the entire movie. I also didn't love Lumiere's Liberace-esque redesign. But overall- Lumiere and Cogsworth were enjoyable for the most part and Be Our Guest was BY FAR the saving grace as far as the musical numbers were concerned.If they wanted to do BATB in modern times or re-imagine it- go with it. Go that route. But take it all the way there. I don't think it was a good idea to try and keep the script the same in literally 90% of the movie only to add in a handful of unnecessary extra songs (which weren't actually any good- especially Beast's), the back story of Belle's mom which really did not add anything special to the story and the need to alter the ending by adding in the 'hideous wench' character. What was the point of that? Stick to the original or reinvent it. I didn't mine the slight addition of insinuated gayness of LeFou- I thought it was quite entertaining and very Waylon Smithers/Mr. Burns-esque. I don't understand the uproar, quite frankly. Besides- it's 2017. Can people finally just stop? Being gay isn't a new phenomenon, folks. Just ask Napoleon.The classic songs felt incredibly flat for me- especially Bonjour. I agree with another review that I didn't understand nor particularly like the odd delays in the song- what was the point? And also, she just didn't really seem to sing with much effort. I like Emma as an actress in most scenarios (I try to forget that she did Bling Ring- arg) but it felt very much like Emma playing the role of Belle in a theatre production- I didn't feel as though she really embodied the character in any way. The stand outs- by far- were Luke Evans and Josh Gad. I don't think they could have done better casting for those roles no matter if you enjoyed the characters or not.Another thing that felt incredibly dull to me was the colors. I remember seeing the cartoon version of Belle in her glowing, golden dress that was SO beautiful and well-constructed that it honestly just made Emma Watson seem like she was wrapped up in her grandmother's curtains. Like, who did that? If you're going to do ANYTHING the service that it deserves- you can't lack on Belle's dress and that entire Beauty & the Beast dance sequence. It was flat. Where were the colours and the incredible camera angles? I remember one specific ""camera shot"" that swirled around them in the Disney cartoon version where you could also see the rest of the ballroom- I still feel goosebumps. One of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.And lastly- Mrs. Potts' animation was just plain scary to me.That is all.Twitter: @steacyc",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Reimagining with visual flair,"We all know it's not the artistic vision that makes Disney remaking one of its most timeless classics, but here they do it with at least a breath of freshness. Surely, the retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast"" sticks to the story and dramaturgy of the 1991 animation, but the darker layers and more mature sentiment work well with the plot. Emma Watson does, unsurprisingly, a great take on Belle, and Luke Evans seems to love the to play the below-average IQ hunk Gaston. And thank god the animated furnitures blends in well. Some of the perfected charm might have gone lost since 1991, but this retelling is worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It is what it is,"I have to admit, I'm not really sure where to stand on ""Beauty and the Beast"". The Mouse clearly didn't treat this with kid gloves; the costumes alone are eye-candy enough and there's not one negative to this cast.But when you get right down to it, it's purely a reimagining (for lack of a better word). As if you'd ever watched the original and thought to yourself, ""This is great, but I wonder what it'd be like with Emma Watson as Belle, or Josh Gad as LeFou"". You're getting the same songs, dialogue and set pieces, and the story doesn't stray at all from the animated version. And yet I found myself missing Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion and the cutesy Disney supporting players (the CGI on Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts & Chip just doesn't compare . . . especially on the Beast).It's a well-appointed movie, and somehow disappointing.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

She sings great as do all the cast, with supporting actors of the calibre of Kevin Kline and Emma Thompson, voices of Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci and Ian McKellen, the younger actors of Dan Stevens and Luke Evans are very good as well, as are all the rest (too many to name), not one song is poor, and one is likely to remain in the memory, the last one.For anyone reading these reviews ignore the poor ones they are not accurate, it is a very good film, and this comes from someone who does not like musicals!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Must Walt Disney Studios Redraw Its Future?,"Disney presides over the current film scene in terms of money and art. The company founded by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks benefits from film studios with higher profitability on the market, which are the owner of retributive franchises such as ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"", Pixar Animation Studios' works and the complete universe of Marvel Comics. The money amount it earns periodically with each of its proposals is unheard-of, either original ideas, those that turn to imagination without employing creative precedents, or remakes, audiovisual productions reproduces the narrative thread, the atmosphere in which the story runs, characters, and even pre-existing songs, in this case, from unreproducible animated classics.For a person who loves and understands film substance, it's dishonorable and enervating to see how celluloid world isn't being handled by creative artists, but by financial managers and accountants presiding artificial productions at box-office designs' expense, shelving true meaning of cinema. An archetype of this is the hybrid that I mentioned earlier, etymologically known as live- action. Hollywood executive's greed is derisory, greediness brazenly covers up under the shadow of hypothetical homages or reinventions for the audiences of the 20th century, those who have not had the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the likable unalterable animated characters and stories. However, we cannot declare that live-action feature films presented are strictly a way to make money, this is the hidden purpose, the released guinea pigs have been reasonably great. So this is where the final questioning emerges: must we pass unnoticed Disney's money desires if and only if it remains to offer audiovisual productions entirely well made, even if they continue to nurture the plague producing creative shortcomings nowadays? Judge for yourselves.Imaginative impasse's last prey is ""Beauty and the Beast"", Disney's first movie in being nominated in six different categories at the Academy Awards, of which won two awards with reference to its unforgettable OST.The reinterpretation of the story of a prince transfigured int beast because of his arrogant conceit and his corresponding love affair with a villager who arrives his castle to rescue her father, examining enormous expectation set up months ago, is a modern contraption artistically uneven, it fulfills the objective of evoking the amazing inspiration source, at the same time develops more complex stories and plausible motivations, but using an almost integral copy. Although there's a patent female empowerment message, an unjustified noise for the first homosexual character of the company and places as meticulous as magnificent, it looks as if narrative were in unripe, and I don't mean the tale itself, since we already know it fully, I say this for autonomy lack with the basic story.William ""Bill"" Condon (""Dreamgirls"" & ""Mr. Holmes"") does what he can with the tools on his property. We've had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Condon's aptitudes in sharply human films, the filmmaker exhibited his sensitive eye to portray fables with a dramatic base in these ones. The director will make to resurface briefly the charm of years ago with almost emulated camera shots, only altered by indescribable technological advances, however, the real magic keeps in the adorable animation from the 90s. The dance scene, 'Be Our Guest' musical number and the terminal moment will stimulate the awakening of memories supported by no ideal love and inner beauty, besides the rewarding minor variations to the soundtrack. Such immoderate fidelity allows it to touch both glory and failure at the same time. A recreation with less interest in the most circumstances, perhaps, it would have been better to get away from the original material a little more, just as Christophe Gans' dismal adaptation.In respect of visual part, they had a laborious and delicate job, erect rightly Villeneuve, beast's gloomy palace or the tavern where LeFoe adulates Gaston with a song or make with extreme delicacy characters attire weren't easy. The filmmaking is objectively its specialty, keeping in mind narrative standards raised previously. Although Rococo style, CGI animations and clothing and make-up are fetching, that too dark effect prevailing in the third act is neither pleasant nor required. Fortunately, such chromatic attenuation doesn't discredit Belle's stunning yellow dress, the design of the sets and its animated characters or Emma Watson paying homage to ""Mary Poppins"" with her musical scene. Beautiful pictures.If it had optimal challenges graphically, musically was impossible to get even an infinitesimal improvement, and effectively, impossible is impossible. Despite original composer (Alan Menken) returned to provide his services, none of his new scores are entirely predominant, however, the interpretation of the music classic in the voices of Ariana Grande and John Legend recalls melodic beauty from the original song.The classic movie will remain a classic, but what would be a true modern classic falls short in charm. Exhausting run-time, Watson's overvaluation, the CGI technique in the face of the Beast of doubtful credibility, exaggerated darkness in the third act, and a few new forgettable songs complicate the goals of Disney about its winning streak. I've rated the film with reference to the original movie, since although they didn't want to alter or pass inspiration source, their attempt stays in a lax reinterpretation, as if Condon and his team wanted to draw frame by frame with beautiful elements which don't find who make them shine, and although in matter of adaptations, respectful similarity is what must prevail, it lacks magic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2017) is far from being a bad movie, nevertheless, they knew what and who they faced, and evidently failed to convince so big beasts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Fantastic movie with high popularity,"This 2017 action version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is definitely worth watching base on my experience, because it remains a lot of classic Disney feature, such as its classic music style, plot, foreshadows and happy ending. I personally like its music the most, and I have the entire soundtrack in my phone, even memorized most of the lyrics (No joking). Moreover, there has been a change of attitude for myself to the movie when I was first time watching it. I had a hard time trying to convince myself keep watching it at the beginning, because I watched the trailer and I thought that's what the story about, but later on, there were unexpected changes that brought me back into it, and I actually learned a lot when I connect the story to the real life.After all, I STRONGLY recommend this movie for all ages, despite there are some weird scenes that I'm thinking about that if we should really show it for kids with no doubts, since the kids will possibly mimic them at some point in their life and may be impolite to others.

Disney revisits a tale as old as time,"Tale as old as time, or in the case of 'Beauty and the Beast,' 1991. After 26 years, Disney breathed new life into the animated classic in the form of a live action musical that starred the likes of Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the famed beast.The latest in a string of live action conversions of 2D animated pictures, 'Beauty' is nearly a carbon copy of the fan favorite, from the same songs and dialogue to nearly identical scene selections. While this is kind of eerie in one respect, it's kind of cool and respectable to see Disney pay homage in this way.While Watson does a pretty good job, she does not exactly fit the part as well as a few other actresses probably could have (including Anna Kendrick or even Lily Collins). Still, she does a good job with her vocals and generally acting. Luke Evans is pretty spot-on as the boisterous Gaston, and Josh Gad adds a dose of humor as the dimwitted LeFou. For the rest of the cast, they are pretty much limited to being vocal actors, but still bring to life everyone from Cogsworth the clock (Ian McKellen) to Mrs. Potts (Emma Watson). And then there's Stevens as the prince-turned-beast himself, who fulfills the role quite nicely.In this version of 'Beauty,' we get a little bit more backstory, which is helpful when it comes to character development. And while the film is mostly a vehicle for musical numbers, it doesn't come off exclusively as a musical in the way other recent similar films have. And for a film that is so dependent on CGI, it doesn't come off this way visually. The French countryside and the enchanted castle look and feel authentic, which is not something that can be said about many similar films.Judging by its massive box office return and love among fans, it's fair to say 'Beauty and the Beast' is another example of why Disney will continue to give these stories a second wind. Expect 'Aladdin' and 'The Little Mermaid' to follow in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Top 10 Favorite Movies of ALL Time! Amazing use of 3D!,"I own 463 3D blu-rays and this is easily the best movie in my collection. I was a fan of the original cartoon but this live version is much better in every category. The costumes and sets were beautifully rendered, Emma Watson is adorable as Belle, the music is gorgeously orchestrated and every singer is top notch! The 3D is ""medium-strong"" to ""strong"" and is very consistent. There aren't many ""pop-outs"" but every scene contains multiple layers and plenty of depth and the musical numbers are where the 3D really shined! One particularly memorable scene occurs at the end of the first musical number and it reminded me of The Sound of Music but in stereo-vision! Many scenes inside and outside of the castle also looked amazing in 3D, especially the musical numbers ""Be Our Guest"", which has the one ""pop-out"" I remember, and ""Beauty and the Beast"". The ballroom, with its elaborate chandeliers is particularly stunning, and the 3D rendering makes it and the entire castle seem ENORMOUS! The colours REALLY pop on my 4K OLED and everything has so much detail! This movie adds additional depth to the storyline, which adds to character development and it even adds some new songs which I really enjoyed. I laughed.. I cried...

It all just felt a little meh - It all looked good, but it was dead behind the eyes.I would much rather watch the 1991 animation, but does that mean I'm old and out of touch? Am I falling back onto better times and a sense of nostalgia? You can be your own judge there, try watching both versions and see what you think.

Pointless Remake,"I feel like there is not a lot to say about this film. It was a live action remake of the fantastic 1991 original Beauty and the Beast (emphases on the remake). I felt like this remake did not really bring new life to a story like a remake is supposed to; it just slapped a few new songs in there and called it good. I think that the whole live action Disney thing is a cash grab, but this isn't the time or place to discuss this... To be fair, there were things I did enjoy about this film. I thought the way they did some of the old songs like ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Tale as Old as Time"" were done very well.

A good modern version of a classic,"I was a bit confused with this one. I kind of liked it but then at times found myself thinking, was it worth it. It differs little to the classic Disney movie.

Evans was great as Gaston and the rest of the cast were excellent to. The CGI was fine and the reimagining of some of the scenes was excellent. The only real negatives for me was the running time, which could have been 20-30 mins less and also the murdering of the song Tale As Old As Time. Lansbury and the original were just so much better.

The village looked tiny and cute, the castle astonishing, scary, but beautiful at the same time.Characters: A lot of people even complained about the actor for the prince before. But I thought, he was alright. I really liked his singing voice though. The other cast members were really good. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle and Luke Evans as Gaston was amazing! Even the side characters were well portrait.Music: The music was of course wonderful. But for some people, who don't like singing in a movie...You shouldn't watch this one then. There were a lot of songs and even more than in the animated version. But they were all very well composed and beautifully sung.Conclusion: I really liked the movie in a lot of aspects. What I have to complain about a little bit is the camera work and the cast for the prince. (Sorry...) All in all it's a really great movie which I would like to watch again any time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not beast bad at all.,It's a pretty decent movie.The singing wasn't overdone. I mean the songs were disneyified although toleratable.The quality was superb.Acting and wardrobe was fine.The talking stuff were funCgi is garbage. I hate it.The witch in the beginning is the main evil villain. She should be punished.Now is Belle in love with the castle? Fancy things? The Prince? Beast? Does she have solkholm disease? Or is Belle just being a female?,7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An Absolute Delight!,"I'm rating this so highly (10 stars!) because I feel it is deserving of the highest praise. To see so many reviewers berating this film is quite a shock. I don't see anything controversial about the tale as old as time. In fact, I see lessons that people of all ages can learn from. Not to judge others based on their appearances is one of those lessons of note.I wish to commend the cast and crew at bringing this to screen in such a grand and epic way. The music is beyond wonderful. I love Audra McDonald's singing, and I would love to hear even more. My favorite musical number was ""Be Our Guest!"" That was an absolute spectacle and a dream to behold.Emma was the perfect Belle. If I were in casting, she is the actress that would have been my number 1 pick. She is the main reason why I wanted to see this film. She sings quite nicely, and I wasn't expecting that. In fact, I didn't expect this movie to be so musical. I really do not remember much from the original 1991 animated film. I know I saw it when it came out (I was a young one).I was very surprised to see so many adults, especially baby boomer/retired age in the theater too. There were more adults than children! I wonder what drew them?I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of Disney, of musicals, of the original animated film, or Emma Watson. It was an nice refreshing breath of air and break away from our current political climate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Hermione and the Beast,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is a 2017 musical romance directed by Bill Condon starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. Upon its release, I had mixed feelings about the idea of a live action remake of one of my favourite childhood films. We can all argue what's the point of a remake, but an adaptation that seems to be exactly like the original film? I can not deny that I still consider this one and the other remakes as unnecessary and money driven projects. But since yesterday was a promised movie night with my little sister and I don't have anything suitable for her in my shelf, she chose this one from her own. Honestly, it was not as bad as I expected. The biggest benefit from this movie is the pompous style and colorful costume design. The film crew literally managed to transfer the the magic and splendor of the animated flick on to the big screen. Additionally, every character was casted perfectly and as I expected, each and everyone delivered greatly. Next to this, I was glad that they still included the original songs. It's also notable that they also added a few new details to the tale as old as time, some derived from the original fairy tale, some completly new. Although it may not sound like it, the film also had a few flaws: The design of the beast appeared a bit to harmless to me and most of the most dramatic scenes of the original film (the wolves fighting scene, the showdown on the roof) lacked the emotional depth and dramatic essence they had before. I'm aware that they had to change it, because they targeted a younger audience and it would have been way to brutal to make it so packing, but I still think a little more tension would not have destroyed the concept. The visual effects and performances make it up a bit at least. All in all, this remake still might be unnecessary, but it's highly enjoyable for both, the young and the old generation, and delivers great fun from start to finish. It doesn't want to achieve anything else and was mostly made for a younger audience and as I saw my sister smiling the whole time, I knew that I was right. Watchable, but it definitely doesn't outshine the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the best live action films from Disney.,"Beauty and the Beast is one of my favourite animations of all time. I really loved it and so, when I heard about they are making live action film, I was really looking forward to it. When it's out, I immediately watched it.The film is so great. I think they made the right choice of choosing Emma Watson as Belle. She's so gorgeous. And that yellow dress is so cool. It's prettier on her. So, I'd say the costume designer has done an amazing job.The effects on the Beast is quite good. I thought he'd be uglier. But he wasn't that much than I expected. And the performances are also great. I totally was in the movie and forgot the surrounding.Although it is so perfect, I don't like some of those songs that Belle sung. Maybe I'm not that much into original scores. But I still can accept it.Overall is that Beauty and the Beast Live Action is a great film and not inferior to the animation. It's on equal state. The film is so good, so, I recommend you all to watch it. You won't regret watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"This isn't as good as the animated film, but still entertaining and worth a viewing","Beauty and the Beast (2017) is a movie we saw as a family in the theatres upon its release. The storyline focuses on a beast with an unfortunate past and a damsel who crosses his path after an accident in the woods where the beast comes to her rescue. When the damsel awakes she becomes enchanted by the beast and determines there's more to him than appears. This movie is directed by Bill Condon (Dream Girls) and stars Emma Watson (Harry Potter), Luke Evans (The Alienist), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), Emma Thompson (Cruella) and Ian McKellen (Lord of the Rings). The settings for this are brilliantly displayed. I also loved the animation components and the depiction of the beast was solid too. I enjoyed the dialogue and character interactions; however, there were some components of the main characters relationship with her dad that was under developed and the ending fell a little flat to me, though I enjoyed the transformations. Overall this isn't as good as the animated film, but still entertaining and worth a viewing. I would sore this a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Beauty and the BeastThe upside to marrying a beast is you can forgo getting a family pet.Mind you, the opposite species in this musical may not even make it that far.When the mysterious owner of an abandoned castle imprisons her father (Kevin Kline) for theft, independent adolescent Belle (Emma Watson) embarks on a journey to take his place behind bars.On arrival she discovers her father's captor is an anthropomorphic beast (Dan Stevens) that was cursed by a witch, along with his household items (Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson), which are now sentient.Disney's semi-live-action adaptation of their own animated version of the French fairy tale, this shot-for-shot remake is a visual feast for the eyes and fun for all-ages - even if the beast does look off and Belle's suitors are too mature for her.Unfortunately, the success of this fable could spark bestiality trends among young people.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney does it again.,"""Beauty and the Beast"" was stunning and gorgeous. Beautifully and artfully performed. Dazzlingly colorful and charming. Fresh and lighthearted. Wonderfully and magically enthralling. I laughed, I cried, I floated along with the music, I bawled and bawled as the spellbinding elegance and splendor took me to another place and time. I was 5 years old again enjoying the Wonderful World of Magic that is Disney, as if for the first time. I will gladly spend my money over and over to see that magic unfold. I willingly and happily concede Emma Watson to be Belle, for this generation of children, instead of Hermione.

Disney opens another chapter of family films,"I watched Beauty and the Beast in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen without chopping the picture. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!First of all, trailers are suppose to give you a teaser of the film, not tell you the plot, so don't watch the trailer at all. Next, I will rate this better than Cinderella and well worth seeing in IMAX 3D, considering the 3D is much better than Kong: Skull Island. Emma Watson is perfect as Belle, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying her. I love her acting and singing and could not take my eyes off her. The cinematography is great, often springing right out of the animation and the colors are dazzling. There is a lot to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before.

"A Solid Live Action Adaptation - Good, not great","Let's face it if Disney is going to continue to line their pockets with more cash by releasing live action versions of animations they better be spectacular. This movie is well made and well acted but I wouldn't say spectacular. It's a solid adaptation. I'm not sure about Emma Watson as Belle. She's an attractive woman who's very talented but I don't think of her as beautiful. I get it, box office marquis names aren't always the best casting choices and she didn't detract. One of the best parts was Dan Stevens and the writers who gave depth to the Beast and at least partially satisfied my questions about why Belle would fall in love with him. Kevin Kline was solid as Belle's Dad. Gaston was the right casting choice Josh Gad was very funny as his probably gay sidekick, LeFou. The music was above par and there were a few new songs too. All in all a solid effort although a bit too long.

Despite the Beast's CGI, at least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince compared to Watson. Emma Thompson's rendition of Tale as Old as Time does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by frame copy to the animated film. It's very uninspiring and unnecessary.0/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Not only did the movie blow my mind, the characters were all well cast and the attention of detail really made this movie 100 times better. This movie was so marvelous, I fail to see how any movie could ever compare to this. If you have not seen the original, this movie will far outshine the timeless classic it is made from.

One of the best live action fairy tales ever,"Why did Emma miss the musical romance La La Land for Beauty and the Beast was the worried question thrown at her by her fans. But after watching the live action movie (Beauty and the Beast) the question has become pointless.Beauty and Beast is a near perfect movie in all the aspects. Bill Condon's directorial keeps the audience spell bound at times. The visuals are fresh and colorful. The costumes, the CGI, the castle adds extra color to the already mesmerizing visuals.The background score and the songs compliments the story. Alan Menken's work has traveled along the nerves of the movie and lives in our hearts. Apt song selections and placements are perfect.Experiencing something you have already experienced (At least in animation) might bore, but Bill Condon has mastered the art. His direction never lets down the audience. He has worked hard in each and every detail which is a huge plus for the movie.Cast performance:Emma Watson as Belle would make everyone fall for her. It is the perfect character for her, instead she is the perfect pick for the character. She is charming as ever, the costumes brighten her beauty. Though the little alteration to her character might not impress few, she still emerges our favorite.Dan Stevens as the Beast does his job to perfection. The visual effects might shade his expressions his acting saves for it. A perfect beast and a lover.The voice by Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, and Stanley Tucci for the antiques in the castle were excellent. An adorable addition to the already strong cast.What works:* Visuals and CGI effects * Songs and Music * Bill Condon's direction * Emma's charm * Dan Steven's actingWhat didn't work:* Emma's character alteration (A mild one though) * The first Gay moment in Disney (Might be because of the controversies)On the whole it's a never miss movie. Watch it for Emma, Visuals, special effects, music and Bill Condon's direction.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Mostly deserving of its popularity,"It's weird how this has a high rating yet some of the most popular reviews on this website are of the negative kind. I guess the Walker brothers were on to something. I was quite impressed at how loyal it was to the original Disney movie. I guess it's hard to consider this a live-action version of a cartoon when it's simply a fairy tale that most people are familiar with. If it is one, it's easily one of the best ever made. I was mostly impressed by how beautiful this film looks. The CGI is really good in this. I especially love how they make the objects just come alive.My favorite part in this movie is my favorite part from the original movie. It's where the house objects fight the angry mob. I'm just so impressed at them actually winning. There is one thing that really bothers me. This film was advertised as having the first openly gay Disney character, even though LaFour only dances with a man for a few seconds. This was done better in the last episode of ""Gravity Falls"" much better with the sheriff and deputy. Still, this is a good movie with great atmosphere with really good pacing, not easy for a longer movie.

No time for emotions,"It's very sad to see, that the animated movie from the 90s has had more sense of timing and creating atmosphere. The remake is alright, but it misses the opportunity to create real emotions and strong relationships between the characters. And to be honest, Emma Watson didn't put many emotions or any kind of good acting in this movie. There is a huge party on the table, plates and bowls are dancing and making a fuzz and all she does is stare and smile. I would flip the f*** out if my dinner would dance and sing around me! The animation of the beast is questionable as well and I think Disney could have put much more effort in it. But at the same time Lumiere and all the other furniture were animated really well and if they are in the scene, you'll have a good time! To wrap this up, it's an enjoyable movie but misses the opportunity to create emotions or any kind of atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Still not convinced we need any of these remakes from Disney,"Credit where credit is due, I am glad Disney has chosen to go full on musical (after the confusion that was 'The Jungle Book')if you are going to have 7-8 songs in a film, Do it in a theatrical/ musical style so I am glad they have at decided on that.Gaston and LeFou where hilarious, Gaston is perhaps my favourite Disney character so I was prepared for the worst but I found him to be (almost) the same character and Luke Evans can actually sing! (a rarity in this film but more on that later) Josh Gad was humorous with a nice arc towards the end that I didn't feel was too cheesy.Ewan Mcgregor and Ian Mckellen had a good back and forth too, with Mckellens final line a favourite for me (Turn me back into a clock!!) The CGI (for the most part) is wonderful to look at and the costumes are great as well. I was a huge fan of the animated version so I was always going to like this film to a certain extent, however...EMMA WATSON CANNOT SING!!! Her voice was made up of 99% auto tune, it wasn't even hidden well. Emma Stone doesn't have the best singing voice but with the right songs and background music, it works in La La Land (heck she even won an Oscar) 'Belle' is such a powerful song and I am afraid the film lost me in the first 10 minutes as I simply wasn't convinced, Waston did not even look as though she was singing, her mouth shape was not right for the volume that it was meant to be singing. As she sings in most songs, this was a big complaint.Did anyone else feel the entire film was ticking off plot holes from the animated film? The decadent party showing us the Princes selfishness? The village bewitched explaining the ignorance of the villagers? Gaston behaviour explained by being a war hero? Maybe these are details from the original fable, but to me it felt the director watched 'Everything wrong with...' Youtube video and was correcting everything from the animated version. And what was the deal with Belles mother? that whole section could have been cut and not made one jot of difference to the final story. Another example of filler to flesh out this movie to fulfil a 2 hour running time.My final complaint was the darkness, this was a very very dark looking film, I saw it in 2D and I felt I was wearing shades. I couldn't make out parts of the film when the camera panned.All in all a bloated version of the original with some major nitpicks, certainty not the modern masterpiece everyone is raving about but if Zootopia can make over a billion, this will make 2 bil. Do yourself a favour and watch the 1991 version, or watch this version when the hype has died down so you don't get lynched at work when you agree with me (I am writing this reviewing from a cupboard hiding from a work mob!)",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Beauty and the Beast, A Review","A long time ago in a faraway land, there was a Prince who threw opulent parties. He taxed his kingdom to pay for them and only invited the brightest and most beautiful to attend. During one such party, a poor beggar woman arrived to wait out the storm that raged outside. She offered the Prince a rose in exchange for shelter, but he just laughed in her face. She gave him a second chance, but his heart still wasn't moved. She transformed him into a hideous beast, and the people in the castle who didn't flee in time became trinkets and furniture.It's a Tale as Old As Time.In 1991, Disney brought Beauty and the Beast into the world and a classic was born. When Disney announced they were filming a live- action version with Emma Watson in the title role, I was really apprehensive. I'm not a Watson fan, and I have always adored this story, so what was she going to do with one of my favorite princesses? As the months progressed and the rest of the cast came out, I found myself getting excited. Kevin Kline as Maurice? Ewan MacGregor as Lumiere? Ian MacKellan as Cogsworth? Audra MacDonald as Garderobe (the Wardrobe)? Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza? EMMA THOMPSON AS MRS. POTTS?! This was a cast of epic proportions, and I was positive that no matter what I felt for Emma Watson, this film was going to be as good, if not better, than Cinderella in 2014.And you know what? I was right.They added a bit more backstory to make the Prince less of a spoiled child, and more of a misled young man. It was in the time before the French Revolution, which makes it historically accurate for him to throw these extravagant parties at the expense of his people, whereas in the cartoon, we only knew the story took place in France in a fairy-tale time period. What I love when films do this is that it makes it feel like magic is available in our own world.As a longtime Disnerd and Beauty and the Beast music fan, I was extremely concerned with how they'd handle all of the music. Emma Watson has an okay singing voice, and her songs were fine, but when it came to the other characters songs, they completely blew her out of the water.Ewan MacGregor's take on Be Our Guest was one I waited with bated breath to watch. If you recall in 1991, computer animation was still relatively new, and this was the song they used to create quite the visual treat. Could they do that again in live-action form? They did on Broadway, why not Hollywood? Well, to say they did would be a gross understatement. Plates and food were flying everywhere, there were feather dusters doing synchronized swimming, Belle tried to get a bite of everything they pushed in front of her, and you just got the impression that the showman that was Lumiere had been preparing for this moment his entire life, even before he became a candlestick.I was a bit surprised that they didn't include the songs Human Again or If I Can't Love Her from the Broadway show, but they did give them new songs which added more characterization. The entire cast had the song, Days in the Sun, where they talked about their former lives and how they felt trapped because of the curse, and the Beast had Evermore where he sang about his former life and how he doesn't think he has a future, especially with his newfound feelings for Belle. The chills were there. It was amazing, and Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley from Downton Abbey) has got some pipes on him.I do have to say my favorite transformation throughout the entire film isn't the Beast or any of the staff. It's the unwitting character, LeFou. No, I'm not going to get political. But LeFou is this kid who has admired Gaston and has acted as his best friend for years. He would do anything for Gaston, or so he thinks. We all know Gaston to be a tool of epic proportions, but it's only when his actions become unsavory that LeFou starts to see him for who he truly is. That transition is a beautiful mirror against the transformation of the Beast in the castle. It was my absolute favorite part of the film. It was really, really great.The only real thing I didn't care for was Emma Watson. I'm just not a fan. I think she's a wooden actress and was when she got into her older Hermione days in Harry Potter. I did like everything they did with Belle, though (she's the inventor now, and invented a washing machine so she could read instead of work. Props, girl!), and she also taught a town girl to read, much to the resentment of the town schoolmaster who didn't want ""another one"" to know how to read. Small minds, I tell you.Okay, I didn't care for Ariana Grande's half of the Beauty and the Beast duet, either. She's in her twenties now. She should know what consonants are. Use your teeth to sing. Learn from Audra MacDonald, who didn't have nearly enough singing time, despite being half of the castle's entertainment with Stanley Tucci's Maestro Cadenza.This film is filled with the same amount of fun and warmth and beauty as its predecessor, and then even more. It was well worth it to see it in theaters, and now that it's available on DVD and Blu- Ray, I'll be getting a copy to watch again and again. Please see this movie. Enjoy the magic, and mystery that the cast brought to a timeless tale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Well done,"Emma Watson does better than average work as Belle, and a host of other characters make this classic come to life. If that truly is Watson's voice, she can sing fairly well; although I wouldn't expect her to release a solo album in this lifetime. Could they have done better in casting someone else for Belle? Absolutely. But I guess name recognition had something to do with this. Watson seems rigid at times, and lacks real emotion where it is needed in this film. Still, the amount of CGI, costumes, and other parts of this movie make it well worth watching. I don't get all the controversy over a gay character, because frankly, I didn't see it, and I was looking for it. But I guess some people need to make controversy when there is none. And not that it honestly matters in the grand scheme of things, but they would have been fine with not remaking the theme song that was originally sung by Peabo Bryson and Celine Dion. That's a classic version that is better off left alone. John Legend and Ariana Grande don't come close to pulling that song off the way Celine and Peabo did. But like most musical talent today - they lack their own creativity and talent, compared to what used to be considered star power.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Water and CGI does not an instant classic make,"As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it's their masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages.A film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part believable, unfortunately for this film, it's far from that. It looks like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it's mostly creepy. As the little teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little depth doesn't really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a great comic relief just like the original movie's LeFou. Other than that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!All and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney's first adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work, perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with water and to thin to make a captivating story from. The film is quite frankly not worth your time, you would be better off watching the original one more time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Not perfect, but definitely an improvement over the last one","This movie is in a few ways an improvement over the old film; it has beautiful visuals and set designs, and has also responded to criticism over the old movie by fixing them to an extent. Where Belle seemed somewhat snobbish towards the other villagers in the first movie, here she is shown to be genuinely kind with a desire to help others but also to live her own life. Her fierce and stubborn personality with which she defies both Gaston and the Beast is a stark contrast to her somewhat meek counterpart in the old movie. Also, the movie fixed the plot holes from the old movie concerning the enchantment. However, there are some flaws, such as the blatant autotuning of Emma Watson's voice; and that they tried too hard to make the Beast look human, which instead traps him in uncanny valley limbo and makes him kind of uneasy to look at. Nevertheless, Beauty and the Beast is an enjoyable movie with well-written characters and a feast for the eye.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Don't believe the haters - will go on to become one of the greats,"Whatever you do, under no circumstances, believe the haters. I have read a few reviews so far and most are, sad to say, woefully and shamefully inadequate.As most would know this is a remake of the 1991 Aminated classic. Winner of Academy Awards and loved by generations, the animated musical casts a long shadow. Any movie following in its footsteps has a lot to live up to. Fortunately, the remake does this in spades.Beauty and the Beast (La Belle et la Bête in the original french) was a fairy tale published 1740 for the french court. Fairy tales were popular in the French salons at the time. This version - a political thriller of sorts - was later republished in 1756 by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont for children in the form that is known today. This fairy tale, of the daughter of a merchant who is forced to move to the country after her father loses their fortune, was not the version told in the 1991 animated movie.To be clear, Disney did not re-invent BatB, but the story was streamlined with elements removed and added to make the transition to the silver screen. The inclusion of Gaston, who doesn't appear anywhere in either of the french versions, is an example of this streamlining. Another is the rose, a pivotal part of the fairy tale, was changed into a plot device.The problem with any streamlining is that sometimes elements are left out that turn out to be needed to fill plot holes. A plot hole from 1991 - why was the beast ""spoilt"" and ""cruel"" before the curse? Who knows. Another one - Why are Maurice and Belle so different to the town folk? Don't know. Or try this one - why did the Beast lock Maurice up? Because ..... Yeah. It only took 26 years for a remake to come along, and more importantly, a remake which fills the plot holes. And not only fills them but fills them either with new story or even more importantly with elements from the original fairy tale!Moreover, charges have been levelled against the movie of being a shameless knockoff of the 1991 movie. To this, I have but one word to say - MUSIC. To remake Beauty and the Beast without the songs that earned its place in the hearts of an entire generation would be no less than a crime. The story into which those songs fit, how much can it be changed without the songs becoming irrelevant, or worse yet, out of place? The answer - very little! This charge usually comes with the accusation that certain scenes had been all but duplicated. What those making such a charge fail to realise is that these scenes like the music have become iconographic and inalienable to the Disney story. To lose them would have created a gaping void in the finished product just as changing or removing the songs would have. A symptom of the success of the 1991 movie is that parts must be used in any remake if it is to feel finished to the many, many who have grown up with the original.Other complaints from reviewers who have panned Beaty and the Beast 2017, unfortunately, get worse, more insignificant and more nit- picky, from there. Unfortunately again it is a symptom of the success of the original that there are so many ready to tear apart this remake by sifting through the minutia to find a flaw.The remake of Beauty and the Beast took 26 years to come along and was well worth the wait. It is the must see movie of 2017 and many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A version faithful to the animation of 1990.,"Beauty and the Beast marked history in 1990 when it was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture Oscar, being an animation with good characters and beautiful songs, and in 2014 it won a French live action version which in my opinion is weak , And in 2017 we have a new version Beauty and the Beast, well a problem of the French version is to have taken the musical, and Beauty and the Beast of 2017 hits in full in this question (I do not like musical), the cast was chosen a lot Well, Emma Watson is pretty much like Belle, she's very similar and sings very well, Dan Stevens as Beast, he does well, makeup is competent at talking about it, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thopson and etc, the talking objects are really cool, the truth is that this movie is very faithful to the animation, but it has a lot more problems, there are moments that appear wolves, and you clearly perceive the CGI badly done, the script has problems, has Moments of breaking of rhythms , Some actors were poorly used, the direction of Bill Condon is good, the soundtrack is good too, and the photograph is beautiful, the look of the castle is very good, Beauty and the Beast surprised me, it does not reach the level of Animation of 1990, but it has good performances, good dialogues, good photography and good songs.

"Classics are best, but...","This movie was one of the few that turned out not half-bad with recreation. ""Be Our Guest"" disappointed with its slight lackluster (I'm sure the actors tried their best, and I give kudos of course), yet the addition of more background and specifics in the characters captured my attention. It gave more of a relationship between Belle and the Beast, along with all of the castle servants. Things seemed much less like a case of Stockholm Syndrome turned to budding romance this time around.It keeps most aspects of the original, which is what I most like, and simply builds onto that.

Grace and beauty,"Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a re-telling of the studio's animated classic which refashions the classic characters from the tale for a contemporary audience, staying true to the original music while updating the score with several new songs. There's an emotional authenticity in director Bill Condon's live-action film that helps you rediscover Disney's beloved 1991 animated movie that is also performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast.

Lacking,"Ah, these time-honoured classic stories, such easy money for the studios. Well, maybe not that easy. Although this one has had megadollars thrown at it, it never gets off the ground. Emma Watson in the lead is, I think, attempting feistiness, but although it may be a part of her in spirit, it doesn't communicate itself to an audience from the screen. Nor is Dan Stevens' easy charm up to the demands of the prince-beast, not helped by the bestial side being entirely CGI instead of motion-capture: a strange decision.The extra songs by Alan Mencken and Tim Rice don't add anything much to the score of the 1991 animated film. Emma Thompson's rendition of the title number does, however, match Angela Lansbury's original, both in warmth and sparkle. I'm sad to say that it's pretty much the only example of something in this new version rising to such a comparison.The production design is brilliant and sumptuous but, at the mercy of the choice of 18th century France as the movie's chosen period, sometimes feels crowded in the frame, over-busy, fussy. The costumes somehow rise above this limitation, especially in the finale.Of the other performers, Ewan McGregor and Audra McDonald shine out, but Luke Evans, as vain, villainous Gaston, gives dynamic, high-octane value, wiping the floor with both Ms Watson and Mr Stevens.I've no doubt it'll make its budget back in gazillions, but, unlike the studio's revamped Jungle Book, this is decidedly second-hand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It's an amazing feat that they were able to do that. That's how they make it work so spectacularly.I will say there were some awesome performances by the live action cast members, especially Josh Gad who played LeFou. It was worth the ticket price just to see this dude make you laugh throughout the film. A stellar performance.

Just watch the original,"The original of this film is probably up there in my Top 10 of all time, so I knew this remake would not be as good. All I wanted was for this one to not desecrate my childhood memories of the original. By that measure, this film was a success. It isn't so bad that it ruins the original.All actors play their role reasonably well, and for me the standout being Luke Evans as Gaston and Emma Watson did a decent job as Belle. Disney brought its usual flavour of production and most of the original songs translated adequately to the live-action format. The opening number, 'Belle' worked the best in my opinion. However, some of the songs really paled in comparison to their original counterparts. 'Be Our Guest' I thought was the weakest of the lot. Disney also shoe-horned in a few new songs which for me didn't really add anything. Also, a few plot differences and new script twists seem to have been manufactured just to make the film a little less of a carbon copy of the original.Leaving the cinema though, I could only see this film as a pretty vanilla, paint-by-numbers rerun, which in no way exceeded the original. In that sense, I end up thinking, what was the point of this? Are Disney simply just going to go through their back catalogue re-releasing things as live action? It seems that might be the case.There's certainly nothing new here, and nothing that makes the animation look dated or comparatively weaker. As a stand-alone film, I wish I could think of a better adjective than 'OK', but that is simply how the film makes me feel. It will no doubt make the Disney shareholders happy as it will rake money in, but for us that hold the original in such high regard, this is a second-rate copy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Adequate but unnecessary remake of Disney's '91 Classic.,"Beauty and the Beast is the most recent installment in Disney's ever-growing library of live-action remakes based on the company's famous animated movies of 'yore'. Why is Disney doing this again? To keep its non-Marvel, non-Star Wars, and non-Pixar stuff relevant with the times. For the most part, Beauty works well in updating its classic Best Picture-nominated precursor. But it's mostly pointless and practically shot-by-shot and beat-by-beat remake that introduces just enough material to justify its existence. And the original is STILL a modern film by today's standards.There's some truly pretty moments here and there, but because this film is live-action, you can feel the painfully obvious reality that THIS Beauty and the Beast film lacks the energy and expression of the 1991 original. Despite all the CGI-fueled imagery helping give some extra life to some of the set-pieces, we've seen these pieces before in the original. 'Be Our Guest' is personally the piece I consider to stand out the most in this interpretation. Ewan McGregor does have a unique singing voice: I'll give him that.This growing trend in Disney does seem to be working, I understand why they're pursuing remaking their own movies, but how far can you go once you've run out of animated movies to remake? They can't last and work forever. I'm guessing that there'll be a remake of The Little Mermaid starring Sophie Turner as Ariel or something, and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula; or Henry Cavill as Prince Eric? Michael B. Jordan as Sebastian? *Groan* Disney, please keep focusing on Star Wars for the time being. And don't lose sight of the greatness Pixar affords your company in the field of originality and creativity.Anyway, Beauty and the Beast: the first truly interesting successor to the original 1991 film (the straight to DVD sequel vermin can FINALLY be forgotten: for good)!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

All this musical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the real feeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watson clearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast's daughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for this role.

She completely failed to get into character, that is, of a woman in-love with a beast.

She failed to cry. She failed to convince anyone of being in-love with the beast.

Hermoine and her Beast,"Beauty and the Beast is live action adaptation of the beloved 90's animation of the same name. It follows the nerdy Belle as she leaps off her small provincial town to be trapped in the mysterious world of the Beast. I would not lie, this film really leaves a lot of things to be talked about as it really is quite a mixed bag of positives and negatives.To start off my discussion, the first half of the film is very confusing. It felt like a lot of exposition needed to firmly root the relationships within this updated film were left out. I could not help but be lost at times when some 'different-from-the- original' moments happens every now and then. Also, it negatively affected the setup of some scenes further down the film. In addition, the first half of the film was oddly centered in showcasing the film's special effects and uncomfortably darker than expected.Secondly, a lot of acting in this film left me with very mixed feelings. Emma Watson just did not do it for me as Belle. Though the modern interpretation of Belle is interesting to say the least , Watson does not have enough charisma to carry her character. Also, while I do not see anything bad staying true to the original, I was really bothered by some awful voice acting in this film. If they cannot make a good impression of the original , then maybe change it up. I cannot stop cringing every time I hear awful voice impression every now and then.Lastly, the effects in this film is shockingly wonky. Given that this is a huge production, I am kinda disappointed how the CGI characters is very stilted and hindered some of the framing in this film, especially those scenes including Mrs.Potts. Also, those CGI pan shots are migraine hazards, gosh. Those scenes were the worst.On the positive side, when the Beast and Belle started to appear together and the romance portion of the film starts to pick up, everything just suddenly worked for the better. The mood, the story and the changes are just better than the first half. Also, I kinda find the lightening of the overall mood of the film greatly lift the film from its intensely stiff first half.Acting wise, Luke Evans and Olaf takes this film. They were both stayed true to the original yet their expressed it as their very own. They pretty much stole the show every time they are on the screen. In addition, Ewan Mcgrewor and Ian Mckellen were amazing in their respective voice role as Lumiere, and Cogsworth.Overall, Disney's live-action film update to the much beloved animated film is a mix high highs and low lows but in the end, the film stayed true to what the original intended to be and it kinda worked. I might not say it is better than the original (which, take note, also did not do it for me) but it is an admirable try and surely an enjoyable watch[3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A meandering and dull mess. One of the biggest disappointments in recent years.,"Sure, I'm a huge film snob who (on the surface) only likes artsy-fartsy foreign films from before the 60's, but that hasn't stopped me from loving Disney's Beauty & The Beast; in fact, it's probably my favorite American animated film and is easily Disney's finest work. It's beautiful, it's breathtaking, it's warm, it's hilarious, it's captivating, and, in Disney fashion, it's magical. When I learned that Disney would be remaking their classic films, B&TB was undeniably the best wrapped package. How could they go wrong?Oh man, they went wrong.First thing's first: this film is so flat. The directing was dull and uninteresting throughout the entire film and it honestly felt like one of the Twilight sequels...and then I looked it up and found out that, yes, director Bill Condon was the man behind Breaking Dawn parts 1 & 2. Every shot looks bored and uninterested, which contrasts heavily with the original animated film that was constantly popping with vibrancy. The script too is boring because it's almost a complete remake of the original, though I guess most people won't mind that.Next: the CGI is horrid. Although I didn't care for The Jungle Book from last year, I could at least admit that the CGI was breathtaking. The same cant be said for this film. Characters like Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, and most of the cursed appliances have very strange, lifeless faces that are pretty off putting to be looking at for such a long time. All of the sets too look artificial and fake, especially the town towards the beginning. However, the biggest offender is easily and infuriatingly the character that mattered most: The Beast. The CGI on the Beast's face is so distracting that it completely takes you out of the film. His eyes are completely devoid of soul, and his mouth is a gaping video game black hole of fiction. Klaus Kinski looked much better in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of Beauty & The Beast, and that was a 1984 TV show episode. But do you know why it looked better? Because it was an actual face with actual eyes, not some video game computerized synthetic monstrosity. When will studios learn that practical effects will always top CGI?Finally: wasted casting. Emma Watson is beautiful, but she's no Belle. She is completely devoid of the warmth and humanity that made the animated Belle so beloved. Instead, she is cold and heartless throughout most of the film. Kevin Kline is 100% wasted and does nothing except look old. Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and even Dan Stevens as the Beast are very expendable and could've been played by anyone else. The only good characters are Gaston and LeFou, mostly because they are fun and played by actors who breathe new life into their original shapes. If anything, this film should've been about Gaston and LeFou, but that would never happen because that would mean Disney couldn't cater to blind nostalgic 90's kids.Overall, this film is a complete bore. It could've been better if even the special effects were good, but the CGI in particular is horrendous. I'm all for Disney remaking their nostalgia- catering 90's films, but they need to be interesting. This film, sadly, is not. Even the Christmas sequel is better than this film because it's at least something.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very good,"So beloved was the animated version of 'Beauty and the Beast' back in 1991 that this film was always going to attract perhaps more scrutiny than the other films that Disney have taken from animated to live action form.I thought a lot of this film worked very well. Everyone is well cast and all the classic moments from the animated film are brought to life with a lot of class and attention to detail.Yes, there are deviations from the original, with whole new songs and subplots inserted, which people will either love or hate, but if anything these enhance the experience rather than detract. I don't know what all the fuss was about Josh Gad's character being gay, it's been blown out of proportion.This was an enjoyable new take on a classic film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Attractive new Beauty still pales next to the original classic,"Disney's new and improved ""Beauty and the Beast"" has lots going for it.The beast's voice (as rumbled by Dan Stevens) is perfect, as is Ewan MacGregor's Lumiere and Ian McKellan's Cogsworth. In fact, the whole cast is attractive, engaging and surprisingly musical (who knew Luke Evans could sing?). Speaking of music, the original songs are just as good as you remember. There's even a few additional numbers that, while not spectacular, add color and depth to the story.Speaking of spectacle, the biggest Beauty in this version is the production value. As I watched, every new scene had another gorgeous set piece. The entire Disney stable was obviously working overtime and it shows. Every chandelier is wrought with golden filigree, every turret on the castle is weathered and majestic, every costume gleams with ribbons and needlework. Even the horns of the beast are works of art.I am also pleased to say that the story itself, is, aside from a few minor additions, essentially identical to the original. This really is the 'tale as old as time' and nothing new could improve it. The filmmakers made the right call here.With so many things going right for it, this new Beauty is unfortunately missing one very important thing:Belle.Emma Watson isn't Belle. She just isn't. Even if you haven't seen the original it's obvious that something is missing from our Disney Heroine. On the surface Watson has everything we need. She's beautiful. She's plucky. She can sing, she can dance - heck, she's even comfortable on horseback.With all those boxes checked, you'd think the movie would soar - and there are moments when it lifts off. But multiple times I found myself pulled out of the experience by Watson's disconnection. Unfortunately, she is only partially engaged with the character and so we cannot fall completely in love.Now, to be fair, I've heard critics say Watson is only marginally talented and I would disagree. Her version of Sam was the reason Perks of Being a Wallflower is a millennial classic - and let's be honest, could you imagine anyone else as Hermione? No, I don't think her talent is in question. I'm honestly not exactly sure what happened. It's possible that acting against a digital actor was too difficult. It's also possible that with a giant studio movie like this there were too many cooks in the kitchen. Regardless, Emma Watson's uneven performance is the major weakness of the film.If you loved the original you're obviously going to see this version - and you should. It's beautiful, enjoyable and you'll leave the theatre singing some of the best Disney music of all time. But I'm willing to bet you'll also have a stronger urge to see the cartoon version, and perhaps that was the point of this remake all along. The 1991 Disney film remains one of the best movies ever made.Three stars (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Joy to behold,"While I have deep respect for anyone's honest opinion of movies, I have to say I rarely ""review"" a movie for technical acumen.

This movie was an absolute joy to behold! I've heard talk of distractions etc with the Beast in their effort to keep a touch of humanity to his otherwise inhuman face, but I just didn't care. It was joyous. Ewan McGreggor nearly steals the movie as LeFluer, and Emma Watson is a delight.Probably above all, the nonsense of Lefoo (sp?) is nonsense!

You Are The Beauty To My Beast,"I know cheesy title but I couldn't think of anything else.My review of Beauty and the Beast (2017)Oh my God I LOVED this film. I saw the cartoon version when I was 13 and it was so amazing, the music, the story and the animation and now that theirs a live action version I was in Heaven. I love Harry Potter so Emma Watson who plays Belle who is perfect for the role, they are so alike. They both like to read, charming, well liked, friendly and lovable. The Beast played by Dan Stevens was a jerk at first because he was a Prince who got everything and didn't show any love towards anyone and a witch cursed him to be a Beast until he finds love. I will admit the make up and CG in the film looked pretty rushed and a bit lacking in some of the Disney films you normally see.Luke Evans who plays Gaston is a jerk because he thinks everyone should kiss his butt and love him but Belle doesn't want him because let's be honest he's a butt. And Josh Gad who I can't really stand plays the gay dude LeFou who is clearly in love with Gaston but since it's a Disney film they can't show that. Some will say he's just flamboyant in his mannerism but he clearly in love with Gaston which is fine but it was a bit much.Now onto some of my favorite characters who come to live like the Lumiere who is a candlestick, Cogworth who is a clock and Chip that's a teacup who come to live to help Belle feel more at home in the castle that she's basically trapped in until the Beast who is played Dan Stevens who needs to learn how to love before he can become human. This is no easy task when you've been closed off for years but the Beast will learn throughout the movie to be more caring and understanding towards someone.Now the music in the film I loved the soundtrack I went out and bought it the moment the film was over. My favorite songs which you'll love are Belle (one of my favorite), Be Our Guest, Day In The Sun, and Something There (is so romantic) which are some of the songs that are memorable in the film.Should you watch this film? Hmm it's up to you, if you loved the animation film then yes you'll love this film. If you're not sure then rent it from Redbox, view it and some Redbox will let you purchase the film if you like it. I personality enjoyed it so I hope you give it a chance.Thanks for reading my reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Tales as old as time no so old i think,"First of all the movie was amazing the intro was better than I could expect. I went very considers that this movie could not make my expectation, but I left with much more than that. So many questions were answer and so many things that they were add for the good of the movie. Emma Watson and Dan Steven were great , I have no doubt that other people would thing that they were wrong cast but they make sense for me. The chemistry between those two was great and even one point of the movie I kind of hate Emma Watson for leaving the beast. Also musically speaking I would like to said that most people are expecting beautiful voices in this movie. True , and what I heard was beautiful I don't care what people said about Emma and Dan couldn't sing they sing great and wonderful, they were themselves and that what sale the movie for me the unique and own voice trying to make more real the tales as old as time. Dan song Evermore deserve more than just a price deserve a Oscar and I would be so mad if he doesn't get at least for best song in the track. I think they took this outside the box and that was good for some people other would disagree because they fail in love with the original one but this one was what they want something new that would bring all ages to the cinema to enjoy and remember those years when were growing up an love to watch this movie. For me this movie is great and it would be part of my favorite movies from Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, but lacking of soul","I love the 1991 original, so I was expecting a stunning live-action/CGI reproduction and a magical 3D/IMAX experience. Basically, this film met my expectations. It is beautiful, especially the library scenes and the yellow dress. Lumiere the Candelabra and those CG wolves are also more expressive than their animated version.However, as the core character Belle, Emma Watson really didn't do a good job. Actually, I quite like Hermione Granger in Harry Potter films, but I am very surprised at how awful she acts in Beauty and the beast. Her performance almost had no emotions and made this film lacking of soul. It was far sub-standard for a professional.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A fair fairy-tale with mass appeal,"""Would you love a monster?"", has become an increasingly moot question in our age branded by individualism and non-conformist viewpoint, so the answer would be: you betcha! How cool can be to tame a beast like that? Not to mention, his monstrous front aside, there nestling a genuine prince inside, that's a bonus!This Disney live-action revamp of the classic fairy-tale, directed by the workmanlike Bill Condon (DREAMGIRLS 2006 and TWILIGHT franchise, with occasional curve-ball GODS AND MONSTERS 1998), clings firmly to its 1991 animation in its storyboard and iconic songs, rendered altogether with a grandiose flourish could run rings around Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella (2015).The preamble musters efficiency and glimpses of royal pageantry with a more plausible premise (in the realm of magic, sky is the limit), a selfish prince (Steven) is transformed into a monster (and his servants into a clutter of objects) by an enchantress (Morahan), he must learn to truly love someone and get the reciprocal affection before time is running out, otherwise, him along with his hapless underlings will lose humanity for keeps. Then the narrative introduces our heroine Belle (Watson), a French village girl, who has a yen for reading and is an inventor herself (both are inadvisable hobbyhorses for womenfolk strait-jacketed by macho insularity), she is relentlessly pursued by Gaston (Evans), a bumptious village war-hero who doesn't take no for an answer. When Belle's father Maurice (Kline) is interned in the monster's castle for stealing a rose (a gift under Belle's request), Belle trades herself for her father, and inevitably develops a quasi- Stockholm syndrome to her captor (with the benevolent prodding from those anthropomorphic knick-knacks, among which a motormouth Ewan McGregor revels in sporting a wavering French accent as a candelabra). But when an exasperated Gaston knows about the existence of the monster, he convenes the village mob to assail the castle, there will only be one man standing between him and the monster, Belle is entangled in the scramble, but her feels powerless to stop the inevitable, until, yes, the magic moment after a poignant humanity-dissipating corollary. What a volatile enchantress!The upgraded musical numbers are meat and potatoes to the allure of the film, highlights are BE OUR GUEST (a cynosure garnished with the most deliriously enchanting special effects), GASTON (Evans is so close to snag that Hollywood leading man status for a voluntarily outed gay actor) and Emma Thompson's rendition of the theme song, a balm to one's ears, it is beggar belief that she hasn't been cast in a musical before!Acting wise, the film is a bog-standard family friendly fare demands nothing taxing for its stellar cast, Watson is presentable but far from impressive, Stevens is understandably curbed by his overwhelming costume, even his voice is muffled as if emanated from a mask, only Josh Gad's LeFou adds a nice (but overtly praised) touch of gay inclusivity.Disney's gargantuan ambition of transposing their animation repertoire into live-action by virtue of technique advancement, has been in full swing and proved to be not only viable but also massively lucrative, the only gripe is they could be more gallant in its story-telling (different angles, re- interpretation, reflecting current perspective, et al.), but at the same time, one cannot help but wondering does this trend flag up an overlooking threat to the popularity of animation filmmaking, a food for thought - when CGI anthropomorphism can seamlessly meet the demands, what will audience (in particular, grownups) prefer, a more realistic context or a self-conscious other-worldly dimension?",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Congratulations,"Ever since I remember when I was child I used to watched every single Disney movie. I still reconsider all of them. One classic one was beauty and the beast.

When I saw it the first time I literally I cried though the movie. I felted, I got emotional that good the movie have that spark.

Traditional Hollywood musical with modern techniques,"If you haven't seen this Beauty & The Beast adaption yet, please go and watch this movie without prejudice. Don't expect a 'real life action' version of the Disney animation movie from 1991. Better compare this to a musical movie in the best Hollywood tradition, bedazzled with state of the art computer graphics, it's a treat.The Good: If you like musicals with luxurious sets, vivid colors, you'll love this movie. Also it's a parade of well known actors, and their voices. Some scenes are reminiscent of other musical movies like The Sound of Music (Belle on top of the mountain) or Oliver Twist (Gaston's beer-drinking song) The woods and cloudy skies seem to derive straight from Lord of The Rings. I felt myself getting into this 3 D story book, enjoying every minute of it, although I'm quiet familiar with the fairy tale.The Bad: IMO this Disney production is too much a remake of its own animated movie, using the same colors and styles for the actors' wigs and costumes. Then, naturally, people start complaining about actors who are not 'the real Belle' or 'Gaston' or whomever they play. If the makers would consider this a classic Broadway musical, they would allow their actors to use the stage like in Phantom of the Opera or Moulin Rouge. Now some scenes were copy paged from the nineties version, like the living mops cleaning the castle or the flying dinnerware creating all kind of abstract motions and patterns. They could have known those creations are always better made in animation.Overall, I enjoyed this adaption very much: the story lines were solid like the all star cast, some were better singers than others, with notable roles from Luke Evans, Josh Gad and Kevin Kline. The scenery and music score were perfectly arranged, the emotions right on spot. Highly recommended for musical lovers!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Unimaginative and bland,"Like all Disney fans from the 80's to present, I found myself excited to see this live action adaptation once I saw the teaser poster! I decided to ignore the naysaying that followed with the trailers, and the wave of immoral rhetoric being associated with the sexuality of LeFou. (Rolls eyes)Ignoring all of this I decided to make a judgement call after seeing the movie. I've came to the conclusion that this movie is to Disney movies what the original Blair witch was to the horror genre. This movie apparently cost $160,000,000 which begs to question: Where did they spend all this money? The sets designs and props were hastily put together. The village at the opening looks like the village Dorothy lands in, at the beginning of the wizard of oz. Next is the CGI! The budget and expertise behind Disney should not have been lacking. This movie could've been a cash cow. But the sad fact is, Disney let fine details and lackadaisical work ethic be passed off as a masterpiece.Emma Watson is a tremendous actress, and this is evident in her ability to phone in a wonderful performance to a imaginary beast. Disney please, please... please heed this. When the Gorilla from 'Mighty Joe Young' a movie from 1998 looks more realistic than your beast in 2017 you must realize you've made a mistake. Disney used to be the go to for amazing movies that left you with spirit and wonder. What they've proved with their latest live action movies Is the realization, that they just crank out regurgitated movies with less effort just to cash in on nostalgia. From now on we will be renting Disney movies from redbox instead of seeing them in theaters.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"This beast is a visual beauty, but lacks heart","Before we get down to business it's only right that I admit to never having seen the beloved Beauty and the Beast Disney animation from 1991, a film that clearly holds a special spot in people's hearts, as well as being regarded as one of quintessential telling's of the Beauty and the Beast story.To be even more honest, I've never seen or read an iteration of the Beauty and the Beast story at all, for whatever reason, so my feelings leading up towards the release of this modern day retelling of the famous story were probably quite different to many other's and regardless of how the populace feels about this film as it stands, its already a huge box office smashing hit that will likely see Disney have another film enter into the famed billion dollar club in the coming weeks/months.Now the actual film itself as directed by Dreamgirls helmer Bill Condon is one that will likely appease hard-core fans and newbies alike thanks to its sumptuous production design and often visually captivating settings but for a story that's seemingly remained as popular as ever over a number of years, no doubt through its emotionally charged and magical story, this lavishly produced music filled romantic fantasy is a rather cold experience when it comes down to the nitty gritty of love against the odds story at its core.In the biggest test of her career yet, Hogwarts graduate Emma Watson has the relatively daunting task of bringing screen heroine Belle back to the big time in a performance filled with singing, impressive costume changes and the requirement to act alongside CGI tea-cups and the at the time non-furry beast and she makes a good fist of it without ever really becoming a standout. It shows the still learning actress is capable of carrying a film but it's unlikely her turn will be regarded as a new Disney staple in the female heroine stakes.Arguably with the tougher job, still relatively unknown Dan Stevens does a fine job of becoming the Beast, under the disguise of some noteworthy CGI work (the Beast often looks almost photo real in the right circumstances) he performs well but a major problem Condon's film has is within its chemistry between the two leads and while individually they're fine, as an on screen budding romance there's no real fire, merely a flicker and no amount of visual pizazz was ever going to carry the film past a certain point if this was to be the case.There's able support from co-stars like Luke Evan's as the despicable Gaston and Kevin Kline as Belle's father Maurice while a couple of the A-list voice stars such as Ewan McGregor and Emma Thompson try their best to make the various household objects cursed alongside the Beast work, but at times McGregor in particular seems to be trying a little too hard to be French while Thompson's ""poppet"" filled script work grates after a while.The other somewhat lacking component of this updated Beast is the fact that for a musical, a lot of the big singing set pieces never truly fly. Perhaps spoilt from recent musical masterpiece La La Land the big song and dance numbers within Condon's film are more tolerable than toe-tappingly exciting and bar a nice opening number as Belle sings her way through her local village, the rest of the films well liked and no doubt well known songs do seem to lack that certain magical touch that would've made this well-meaning experience fly rather than simply amble along.This Beauty and the Beast is without doubt a beauty but in the grand scheme of things this box office behemoth is but a pleasant experience without ever threatening to be a great one and while this entertaining popcorn event will be a popular date night pick and a new favourite for little wannabe Disney princesses everywhere, it's unlikely this re-telling of the ever popular source material will ever be regarded as fondly as its hairy forefathers.3 ""papa's"" out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Cinema burst into applause (ignore the salty people),"I have no idea at all what is wrong with all of the salty people writing reviews on this. I went to see it tonight, and I thought it was a wonderful movie, the animated character's had great voice actors. The Beast didn't look terrible like other people on this site are saying. They didn't create a super scary looking Beast that would terrify children. They kept him as close to the original as possible. That might have meant that he didn't look quite as realistic as a horrible beast might look. This isn't a horror movie folks, it's a charming family film. The acting was believable enough to make me tear up at a couple of points, so again, there was nothing wrong with the acting.The packed movie theater burst into applause as soon as the credits started rolling. People were saying ""wasn't it lovely"" as they were leaving.

"Walt would be ""OH"" so very proud of this live version...so where is all this hate coming from?","As any parent should be proud of their children so is father Maurice (Kevin Kline) of his only child, his daughter Belle (Emma Watson) who could never imagine herself swooning over the town's handsome and one-dimensional Ox named Gaston who was played by Luke Evans quite well. Gaston is really in love with himself and he realizes if he wants to have little Gaston's to continue bearing his name then he wants to marry the smartest, prettiest and the only woman in the town who he just cannot convince to marry him, and that young lady happens to be Belle.I am not a big fan of musicals and as an example I was most displeased to have to sit through the 2014 Disney live version of Into the Woods. Once Emma Watson commenced singing her opening song Ms. Shullivan grabbed my arm just a little bit tighter and I just knew this was going to be another Disney classic...and it is!There are so many first class performers in this film such as Ewan McGregor who plays Luminere the candelabra, Ian McKellan who plays Cogsworth the mantle clock, the classy Emma Thompson who is no stranger to appearing in Disney films so she plays Mrs. Potts and by default Belle's conscience while she resides in the Beast's castle. Other great performances were on display by Audra McDonald who plays Madame Garderobe, and I cannot forget Stanley Tucci who plays Maestro Cadenza and of course Gaston's flunky sidekick the gay LeFou played perfectly by Josh Gad.Some countries apparently are uncomfortable with LeFou being a bit more interested in Gaston than he should be but let's face it, this is the year 2017, and so any film should embrace actors/actresses that reflect today's society. In fact if I would have been asked for my opinion by the producers for any suggestions, without hesitation although I truly believe the six (6) foot Luke Evans performance as Gaston was excellent, I would have suggested an alternate name to play Gaston. Or at least give the six (6) foot four (4) inch retired NFL Hall of Fame defensive end, the gap tooth super handsome Michael Strahan to be provided an opportunity to test for the role of Gaston. Strahan would have been great and he would also have allowed a new generation of young children to see that Disney films have evolved to be inclusive when selecting starring roles.Okay so for those naysayers who want to compare this version of Beauty and the Beast to earlier versions, and compare actual Disney characters, or actors/actresses, or the songs style and/or the singers who sing them, I suggest you just close your eyes and please just try to imagine yourself as a very younger version of your own self. If you do this and then fast forward to your adult self you will wake up to see that we are in the year 2017, and that good producers attempt to be more inclusive if the story allows for it and in most cases Disney films such as this great Disney Classic, Beauty and the Beast does. So I loved seeing the diversity in the ballroom scene, I loved Emma Watson and Luke Wilson's gradual affection for each other, I loved Josh Gad's closing scene where he finds his mate, and although I am still not convinced that CGI is an essential part, or for that matter 3-D film versions when I see the younger crowd mesmerized by this film, then I can accept it...and maybe some of you naysayers should be a bit more open minded.I know this live version of Beauty and the Beast will do extremely well at both the box office and when it is eventually released in the retail stores on DVD/Blu Ray format, or streaming one day on NetFlix, or some other new format, such as when humans eventually live on another planet. Walt Disney himself had this kind of endless imagination where others did not and I just know he would have been very proud of all the performances of this cast, the cinematography and of course the musical score.FOOTNOTE: Mrs. Shullivan and I did like the 1991 animated version, but we are in agreement on this next point...we enjoyed this 2017 live version a lot more!!!I rate this Disney Classic a perfect 10 out of 10. It is definitely a keeper.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful but....,"While Beauty and the Beast boasts some fantastic set pieces, wonderful costumes and great performances. The entire film just feels like a retread of the original animated classic, and as a result doesn't feel new (like The Jungle Book) or boring (like Malificent) just uninspired.

Kiss From A Rose...,"Would you please ""Be our guest"" as we revisit Disney's animated classic in the live film adaption? Beauty and the Beast is not my favourite film (gasp in horror here). In fact, at a younger age I would find myself mocking it due to all the mushy (somewhat girly) romance themes. Regardless, I have to admit, Beauty and the Beast is ultimately a Disney classic for many with a solid story and many music numbers that will stick in your head (and heart) forever.In case you've been locked up in a castle... the story is about a young prince, who becomes imprisoned in the form of a Beast due to his selfishness. The Beast can only be freed from the spell by the power true love. An opportunity occurs when the Beast meets a young woman named Belle.This isn't the first time that Disney has turned one of our favourite animations into a live adaption. Previously we have seen live action remakes of the Jungle Book and Cinderella which have all proven to be worthwhile at the box office. I'm pleased to say that once again Disney has succeeded and Beauty and the Beast has been successfully transformed into a live film.Beauty And The Beast's strongest praise are the characters and the solid casting choices. If I'm honest, Belle (played by Emma Watson), is fun and very easy to fall in love with, but it's actually the film's supporting actors that receive my biggest praise. These include Belle's father (Kevin Kline) and of course, the naughty handsome man, Gaston (Luke Evans). When I heard the actor Luke Evans was playing Gaston I was a little concerned as this role is so different for the actor, but credit where credit is due, he absolutely nailed the character and blew the role out of park...Visually, as I expected for a Disney film, Beauty and the Beast is outstandingly colourful and has audio effects that should be highly praised. Beauty and the Beast will have the cinema crowd tapping their feet at the returning classic musical tunes and the 3 new, unexpected musical numbers. Besides, it wouldn't really be Beauty and the Beast without the song ""Be Our Guest"" right?The only one minor flaw for me is the pacing of the film. Many key scenes felt rushed. Certain characters will make an announcement about going somewhere and suddenly they arrive within seconds while other scenes could be classed as a little dragged out. As mentioned, this is a very minor movie issue but I found myself a little surprised at times, as if the film just decided to fast forward for the sake of the film's runtime. But, being a Disney movie, I'm sure this minor issue will not bother movie goers, in particularly the younger generation.Overall, it was exciting to revisit Beauty And The Beast with added fresh direction and an outstanding cast performance. Even if the film does feel very similar, and sometimes is a shot for shot remake of the 1991 animation, it promises to bring back great memories for many or perhaps create new ones for those who have never heard the tale.7.4/10

"The whole package of everything we loved, except 'the love' itself","The opening scenes of Beauty and the Beast are very hard to watch. This film is such an accurate blow by blow mimic of the 1991 Oscar winner that it even nails the timing between lines. Unfortunately this is a live movie with real actors, and actors need timing to give convincing performances. there is no timing here. The movie goes from one beat to another in spectacular fashion, and never catches its breath until halfway through the picture.The highlight is the art direction. Beauty and the beast takes the gilded, spiralling and flowered motifs of Roccoco to the extreme, and the beast's castle looks like a big gold/brass jungle. The negative is that in order to see all this in full glory, director Bill Condon pulls his camera back so far that it becomes pretty obvious that we are in a sound stage.Emma Watson has all the beauty of Belle, but not enough of the charisma. She is small, composed and vulnerable, and strangely unimpressionable. During the Be Our Guest number, she stares at the spectacle as if she on her forty fifth take and in need of a coffee. Her singing voice is fine, but she underplays her numbers.How much credit to give Dan Stevens for his performance of the Beast, I'm not sure. Together with the painters/animators of his face, he does bring some humanity but not a great deal of character. As for the other inhabitants of the castle, The CGI bring Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts to life impeccably, but makes the mistake of minimizing their facial features, thus rendering out their character. What we get are not humans cursed with the form of house ware, we get house ware that talks and moves.The best part of the movie is the middle act; between the second wolves attack and the iconic Beauty and the Beast dance scene. Condon tries to play cupid and get Belle and the Beast to fall in love. The script helps him by giving him some admirable new material to work with, but he cuts his these contemplative scenes too short. As a music number Beauty and the Beast succeeds in summoning a bit of warm and fuzzy nostalgia. This is the only song which comes close to making you feel like you were watching the material for the first time. Whats missing is the chemistry.Condon stages a chaotic rendition of the fight between Gaston's mob and the Beast's army of house furniture, leading to Gaston and Beast coming face to face. Condon falls short here too by not giving them much of a fight. He also rushes the final spectacle of the movie where the beast is turned back into a prince. Belle watches and doesn't even flinch. She takes one looks at him and inherently seems to know what is going on, then they lock lips. The transformation of all the others (back into humans) is done with a bit more flair, not to mention humour.Minus the muscles and singing voice, Luke Evans makes for a realistic Gaston, but it is his side kick 'gay' LeFou who hogs the spotlight. More than any individual, the imagery itself is the real star of the show, and there is too much of it. the scenery is over lit, it goes on forever and the camera never stays still. There is enough spectacle that you become almost numb to it.Beauty and the Beast leaves you feeling depressed for all the people who Disney is cheating out of they're money. the movie itself feels like merchandise in a Disney store. It's a superficially enjoyable carbon copy of something real.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Reproducing scenes frame by frame, Bill Condon does a live action version to please the fans, but it doesn't go beyond this ""service""","There are small changes to the script, and as elements of innovation, the new version of the fairy tale puts the prince and his servants in the spotlight, with a small but important introductory scene about their behavior in the castle before the curse befell them., as well as exploring more the past, both Beauty and the Beast, proposing a solution to what happened to Beauty's mother and showing flashes of the prince's relationship with his parents. On the other hand, there is an addition of musical numbers, which makes the film a bit tiring. We also have some updated references here and there - such as ""Romeo and Juliet"" - but these prove to be very ineffective in refreshing the rehashed story. Even the songs and choreographies are almost completely reused.Revisiting a story, as it was told ""originally"", is not very attractive for those who want creativity. The spectator's need is for a mind that can sustain itself in visualizing, with enchantment, something that has been passed on to him before. The animations, by the way, carry a cinematographic aspect only of them, something that, in live-action, is lost. In an attempt to make everything realistic when, in fact, the work and its characters are crude if imagined outside the animated genre. Differently, but similarly, adopting the thought that if you can create a ""real"" creature like the original in '91 - which it definitely is - the Beast (Dan Stevens) design is one of those things that would look better if not seeking to emulate what the character is in animation, but to do something authorial, creating a palpable creature. While the castle's furniture, former servants of this castle, are extremely believable, magical in the right measure, the creation of the Beast sought to bring a mixture that finds mistakes in not knowing how to model the sad, less threatening side of the character, with its more frightening side, villainous. The second never really appears, while the first is extracted completely, due to the fact that we never experience a more fearful relationship with the monster, just the goofy little smile.The functioning of computer graphics was crucial to an attachment to the character. The scenes of a dramatic nature, without this, fall into an expository melodrama, see the apparent non-commitment of the performance of Dan Stevens, which was too impaired. Belle (Emma Watson), on the other hand, doesn't seem to have a real interest in the monster, although the classic fairy tale is still there, working, for most of us, for another matter: this is a story we know. Perhaps because she acted practically the entire film on a green background and characters created in computer graphics, the actress created a false and uncomfortable look of perplexity that permeates all her screen time. The situation doesn't improve much when she, of course, dubs - poorly - the songs that fit her. The target audience of this film is somewhat familiar with the story of the girl who offers herself as a prisoner of a cursed Beast in place of her father. The dysfunctionalities exist in the dramatic conduction, in the tone, in the rhythm and, mainly, in the acting, hidden under the computer. The same thing cannot be said of the castle servants, who have very well-placed voices. Lumière (Ewan McGregor) and Horloge (Ian McKellen) exude chemistry and are excellent comic reliefs. The curse assigned to them carries even more weight than in the original work, creating scenes of more tragic appeal, as in the case of Madame Samovar (Emma Thompson) and Zip (Nathan Mack). The addition of romantic couples, finally, is another score that works, both as comedic insights and as extra ways to cling to characters, some new ones, like Cadenza (Stanley Tucci).""Beauty and the Beast"" also has considerable narrative additions to the base. The protagonists receive extra doses of background, ensuring, in the case of the Frenchwoman, vigor in her relationship with Maurice (Kevin Kline). Emma Watson shows herself competent, as in the sequel to the song Belle, from her own grace to the mockery of others. The young woman's enchantment with the world of magic presented to her, however, is lacking. While Animation Beauty was fascinated and engaged in the surrealistic presentation of Be Our Guest, this Beauty is almost apathetic. One of the nicest changes, on the other hand, is the introduction of black characters into the plot, which is welcome, even if it's temporally imprecise - but it's a fairy tale, by the way. A conscious decision by director Bill Condon, taking affirmative attitudes in the film, as in the case of ""opening open"" the sexuality of Le Fou (Josh Gad). The director uses the suggestion to provide a wise conclusion, fair to what the character proved to be in the film, far from mere queerbaiting. Gaston (Luke Evans) steals every scene in which he appears. An antagonist who gets the right treatment regarding his maleficent instability, while Le Fou is a rationality relegated to not being heard, as are his feelings.Run by middling Bill Condon of 'The Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn' and 'Dreamgirls', the film fails to deliver emotion. The various musical numbers seem to have come straight from the Broadway stage, being extremely theatrical and uninspired. Instead of helping the plot, the singing ends up boring us and delivering important parts of the plot in an uninteresting way. The director's obsession with filming the action very closely turns the experience of watching his movie into something very similar to torture, after all, you can't understand almost anything that's happening on the screen. The obviousness of his direction is so evident that it is possible to know long before it happens, when, how and where the camera will move.With a script structure that doesn't diverge in any way from the original film, just extends it through more musical scenes, Beauty and the Beast (2017) is, in fact, a film that depends on the feature that it readjusts to the screen. The problem, however, is that it adds little to the plot. With the exception of the ""social"" comments, which very shyly raise a flag with the rainbow in the background (perhaps third), the film does not even manage to strengthen the protagonist beyond what is already presented in the original material, in a time when made it so necessary to put strong women in cinema. Still, the fact that the name of the village is Villeneuve is interesting in that it is a reference to the name of the author of the original 1740 tale, the ""Lady de Villeneuve"". And if we consider that the original tale had envy as its thematic core, it is a shame that the film continues to deal with broad themes about how ""appearances can be deceiving"" and ""love triumphs"", something that works much better in a children's animation.Therefore, it is a pity that the new ""Beauty and The Beast"" manages to stand out in very few features. Speaking objects, for example, are very well adapted to the ""live-action universe"" because of their inventiveness and the performance of great voices (Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen, in particular). But I confess that I felt a great sadness not only in some of the Beast's movements, whose CGI could have been better worked, but especially when Belle enters the castle's library and, instead of a sumptuous look, it is not possible to pay attention to the books, as the camera did not remain quiet for a second, failing to value the wide spaces of the castle and the landscapes, which the film brings in its essence. It's inconceivable that the same Disney, which made history with the Oscars winner digital effects of ""Mogli"", could have produced something as poor and lackluster as what we see here. All digital characters, with the exception of the clock perhaps, are extremely poorly constructed and visually uninteresting. Mainly the Beast, which was apparently created similar to its animation counterpart, and which has disastrously lost all its ferocity. What's the point of creating a character that needs to be great, like a big fluffy teddy bear?!""Beauty and The Beast"" is a film that does not work as an adaptation, much less is sustained as a single work. The lack of courage to explore new nuances and points of view, in contrast to the great ""Maleficent"", or even the lack of visual refinement, unlike ""Mogli"", put the film on a level much closer to another adaptation of the house by Mickey, the bland and forgettable ""Cinderella"" of 2015. Reproducing scenes frame by frame, Condon does a live action version to please the fans, but it doesn't go beyond this ""service"". While benefiting from the skill and charisma of his actors, he is unable to make the film special on his own. This version ends with a ball that epitomizes the entire film: fun, beautiful and charming to the eyes, but nothing memorable and with the feeling that it could be much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I feel he really saved this movie for me, other wise it would have been 3 stars but he is meant to be the baddie! 2)Yes Emma is beautiful and does look like I would imagine Belle, however her signing sounded really strained and unnatural and made me wish it would stop. 3) Mrs. Potts, Chip,Lumiere and Cogsworth - what happened to you!!!

Emma Watson fights against a character who deserves a better script. and, after its end, the question remains - who is the target ? because it has the strange ""virtue"" to not be a film for children. or for adults. but, maybe, a demonstration of posibilities of special effects. the result - sure, nice. but , real, is it enough ?",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
'Beauty and the Beast': Another Pointless Remake,"There's really one key question you have to ask yourself when remaking a classic: how are you making this different than before? how are you contributing to the mythos of this story? At best, it's unwise to create a remake without an original vision; it will surely suffer when compared to the original. Remember Gus Van Sant's misguided shot-for-shot remake of ""Psycho""?2017's ""Beauty and the Beast"" isn't nearly as ill-advised, but it's in the same vain. Disney has been remaking their animated classics into live action films over the past few years, primarily due to the success of 2010's ""Alice in Wonderland"". However, with the exception of Jon Favreau's spectacular ""The Jungle Book"", the whole endeavor has been grossly underwhelming. Sadly, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is not an exception.That's not to say the movie is bad per se. It's well made with some incredibly talented actors in the mix (Kevin Kline, Ewan Mcgregor, Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson, and Ian Mckellan all in supporting roles) solidly mixing drama with gentle goofiness. The animation on Beast is iffy, but in general, the computer effects are well done. The movie is overlong, but the pacing balances out this issue for the most part. Honestly, in a vacuum, this would be a very good movie.However, this movie doesn't exist in the vacuum. The 1991 animated classic is essentially the same movie. Sure, this version includes some more backstory for the supporting cast, but it's nothing that's necessary. Some of the changes are good and some are bad. In the end, the changes are a wash to the movie's overall quality.As for the stuff they didn't change, it's near identical to the original. It's to the point where they almost certainly just cut and pasted pages of 1991's script into this movie. As an example of the changes, there's a key point in this movie where things play out as they did in 1991, however, some details are altered such that the end product doesn't make sense.All the classic songs make a return in decent covers by the new cast. However, they also add new songs. If you've just emerged from a cave after 30 years, there's an easy way to tell which are the classic songs and which are new: the classic songs are the good ones.Fact is, while this is a solid movie on it's own, it's impossible to recommend when in-essence this movie already exists. If you're a huge Beauty and the Beast fan and await with bated-breath any incarnation of this story, then wait no more, you'll probably have fun with this. The rest of us should save our money and rent the 1991 movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Emma Watson Manages to be Luminous in an Already Vibrant Film,"I'm utterly shocked by the negative backlash that this film has been getting from critics and the public because it's truly a joy to watch. Bill Condon has done a wonderful job bringing the beloved animated flick to life with a stellar cast, exceptional musical numbers, and jaw-dropping sets and visuals (the ballroom scene had me in tears). Also, Steven Chbosky and Even Spiliotopolous deserve credit as well as they were able to conceive a screenplay that kept enough familiarity with the original to give the audience some good-old nostalgia while adding enough new details and subtle elements to keep the audience invested in what's going to happen next.The cast really carry the movie as well, with Luke Evans (Gaston), Dan Stevens (the Beast), and Josh Gad (LeFou) entertaining the hell out of me--Stevens is practically playing a completely different character, and his performance creates a new and charming Beast (and damn, can he sing!). Evans is absolutely perfect as Gaston, and although I don't love his singing voice for the character, he nailed every single line he was given. Now, regarding the situation with LeFou; I really don't understand why Bill Condon went ahead and made a big deal about Josh Gad's character being gay because it's barely present in the film. Beauty and the Beast is now not likely to preform as well as it could possibly have with foreign markets in addition to a bunch of local conservatives throwing temper-tantrums (spamming the film with negative ""reviews"") for nothing; you blink and you'll miss that ""exclusively gay moment"". As for Gad himself, his LeFou is charming and hilarious in his own right--he's certainly an extra viewing bonus. Kevin Kline is truly a gift to the film; he does not play a small part and he has one little song that he absolutely nails. The father-daughter bond between him and Belle is truly spectacular. As for the rest cursed objects, I thought they voiced their characters fine enough, but they weren't what was driving the film.Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, this is Emma Watson's movie. And boy, does she crush it as Belle. I can assume it was tough for her to watch Emma Stone take home Best Actress for La La Land, but don't worry, Emma, because you've knocked it out of the park here. Watson's Belle is strong, independent, passionate, vigilant, and every other adjective you could add to describe the perfect modern female heroine in Disney- princess form. She is also adorably awkward at times, something understandable since she's lived as an outcast in her village her whole life. The added backstory and quirks really make this character all the more three- dimensional and they incorporate into the movie beautifully. Emma really sells every one of her scenes, and her Harry Potter days have seemed to have helped her out regarding working with visual effects and acting off of nothing. I doubt the film would be half as good if they had gotten anyone else to play Belle-- just note that about 95% of the people claiming that she was wooden in the film are either biased trolls, or more likely, people who haven't even seen the film yet.As for complaints about the movie, I have very few. Personally, it took me about 10 minutes to truly get into it because it was such a strange sensation to watch my childhood be portrayed by other people, plus all of the songs felt like really weird covers of the original songs until I really warmed to the new atmosphere. Also, they would introduce fascinating details about the Beast that they never really seemed to do anything with. Lastly, the third act is somewhat a competition between the loud and over-the-top music numbers and the climatic state of the plot for your attention. Although both are extremely entertaining, at times the third act felt a little unfocused. However, I can assure you, that the ending scene were Beast transforms is spectacular, both Stevens and Watson do a terrific job expressing the same emotions created 26 years ago.All in all, this is a wonderful movie. All the critics are kind of saying the same thing: ""if the original is so great, why remake it?"" and ""it's just a remake, nothing more"". Why does this film not deserve credit for being a faithful yet fresh retelling of the tale as old as time? In fact, it even improves upon some aspects of the original, such as how Belle and Beast fall in love (just wait a couple weeks and see the film and you'll understand how). I have the answer: people simply don't want to like this movie. The original is so amazing and beloved by practically the entire planet that Disney having the audacity to come and revamp so many people's childhoods for the sake of money is, for many, very offensive--even if the movie's actually really, really good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great movie but the cast could have been better,"This film could have easily been an 8.5 but unfortunately this could not be. Emma Watson was not the best actor for sweet, friendly, enthusiastic Belle. From the beginning of the movie Belle seemed so.... distant, cold, dull, boring. She was nothing like Belle from the animated classic at all. Emma Watson was definitely not for this role and its very disappointing. And oh my goodness--- Emma's singing and the drastic attempt to fix her singing with effects. That was horrible! I noticed that the sound was... off during singing. How easy is it to find a Belle that has an upbeat attitude, is pretty and sings really well? These days they rather cast famous actors for the role, rather than the best actor for the role--- to make more money. The film suffers for this.Other than the Emma Watson disappointment (since shes the main character) the graphics could have been better. The beast looked too fake. I know that they could have made it more believable.Overall, I loved the movie because it reminded me of the good old days.P.S. I think the Prince looked better as the beast. Lol.

"A beautifully traditional fairytale, and a triumphant return to the Disney of old","This is such a nice film. Taking Disney back to their roots of what makes a good fairytale blockbuster, it's a fantastically vibrant, entertaining and traditional movie that'll have you smiling from start to finish. It's very similar to the original film, but as far as remakes go, Disney have done a fantastic job again, making Beauty And The Beast an absolutely wonderful watch.I know that there's so much adoration for the 1991 animation, but I've never been its biggest fan. As nice as it is, it didn't always have that same Disney magic that I really love, so I wasn't going into this with my nostalgia goggles on, nor with any particularly high expectations.That said, I had a great time with this movie. Above all, its traditional feel makes it a properly enchanting watch, bringing back the classic Disney magic of the 1950s and 90s that we haven't really seen anywhere on the big screen since.Unlike 2016's The Jungle Book and 2014's Maleficent, Beauty And The Beast doesn't hold back when mirroring its predecessor, but it doesn't make one bit of difference, simply because it's such a pleasant and magical film.On the one hand, fans of the original will get a wonderful burst of nostalgia with the return of classic characters and musical numbers, but also, the classic vibes of the film will make you remember why you love all those old Disney movies. You may think that the fairytale formula has been beaten into the ground, but watching this film, with its hugely traditional feel, felt very refreshing.There's nothing about this film that tries to be clever and different to what we know can make such an enjoyable watch. With no dark revisionism, no switching of roles, and no hesitation to burst into song whenever it feels like it, Beauty And The Beast feels like the Disney movie of old that's been missing for so many years, and that pleasant, colourful and fun-loving classic vibe is exactly what makes it such a wonderful watch that will easily have you smiling ear to ear by the end.Along with the excellent direction and writing that allow for the film to be such a triumphant return to the classic Disney way, the performances here are excellent, with a delightful turn from Emma Watson as Belle, a whole host of hilarious A-listers as the furniture at the Beast's castle, Josh Gad's funniest role since Frozen as Le Fou, and a fantastically villainous performance from Luke Evans as the dashingly evil Gaston.And on top of those performances are some stunning visuals. Although the CGI of the Beast isn't quite on the level of The Jungle Book, the castle exterior is amazingly created, whilst the real-life production design places you as firmly in a magical version of rural France as the animated film, and the exquisite costume design adds even more to the enchanting feel of it all.I have to say that I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, particularly given how close it is to the original, but that doesn't mean it's completely problem-free. For one, as good as a lot of the musical numbers are, they do occasionally feel a little out of the blue. It's not a huge issue, but the way that the songs are brought into scenes is a little off from time to time, not to mention the fact that the film's second half is a lot more jam- packed with music than the first.Another issue with the music comes in the form of some unfortunate meddling with Emma Watson's voice. She may not be the greatest singer in the world, but what's most disappointing is that her singing sequences are heavily autotuned, and it's very distracting, particularly in comparison to either hiring another singer or just letting her sing naturally.Finally, the Beast is a little bit of a disappointment. For me, the animation managed to capture the character's inner turmoil a lot better, and as such make his transformation through the film even stronger. Whilst it's not bad here, and Dan Stevens' performance is fine, I felt that the CGI Beast wasn't quite the emotional presence that I wanted him to be.Overall, however, I had a wonderful time with Beauty And The Beast. A surprising improvement on the original in my book, but most of all a beautiful return to the classic Disney style, with a pleasant, vibrant, and wonderfully traditional vibe from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Astonishing!,"I don't really write reviews on movies. I like reading them though. And to be fair, I have never even written a review before. But a movie as beautiful as Beauty And The Beast deserves to be noticed. So before you read, go ahead. Tell me I'm exaggerating. Because, honestly I don't really care if you thought the movie was great or just utter rubbish. The movie was indeed great and made me want to watch it again for the FOURTH time.Okay, on to my discussion:First of all, I am just one of those casual moviegoers who like to watch movies that are always popping up in the Internet of how great it is. So one day, I was just surfing the web and I found something rather exciting. Disney was making a live-adaptation of their beloved animated classic, Beauty And The Beast. And I felt like a kid again. Beauty And The Beast was one of my favorite Disney movies of all time and will always have a special place in my heart. After a few months, they had released a trailer that blew up over the Internet. It looked stunning and magical. Everyone was talking about it.Then it started popping up on Google advertisements. Then on television. Even starring on network commercials in my country. And there was a sudden urge to go into the theater and watch it right then and there. And so I did. When I got there, all seats were taken on THREE different theaters. Was it really that hyped? I felt disappointed. So I thought that I'll go ahead and wait for it next week (because it obviously would go for a second week), to empty the space. The next week I go into the theater yet again... And it was still FULL. Whaaaat?! It's already been a week, yet there's still so much moviegoers. Luckily, I remembered to reserve online in case this would happen. ;)I got inside and went through the boring advertisements and got out smiling.Beauty And The Beast is enchanting, entertaining and magical in its own way. And I tell you, DON'T believe the negative reviewers. They just thought that it sucked because it didn't match the original. Maybe it didn't exceed their favor for the original. But from a blind-audience's perspective of both movies, they did a really great job of bringing the movie to life. There wasn't a single set that seemed extraordinary. All were immersing in its set up. In a small provincial town and its townspeople wearing those goofy headdresses that made it look like it was actual real. The musical numbers were great and the choreography was perfect. With my favorite being ""Be Our Guest."" The cast was great and the acting was on point. Not to mention Dan and Emma's roles as quirky but pretty Belle and the horrifying Beast as they find their love for each other despite their differences. I literally was jumping on my seat smiling whenever they both had a scene together. Oh! And the ending made me CRY like a bitch. Which I didn't even feel when I watched the original. I loved Gaston and Le Fou's funny attitude. Le Fou and Lumiere has got to be my favorites!The only problem was the clear auto-tuning which, to be honest, wasn't really much of a bother to me and I wish that the movie could have been a little bit longer just to add in some extra scenes of Belle and the Beast. :3What more is there not to love?!New songs, beautiful sets, stunning costumes, romance, and EMMA WATSON! And what do you get? Well, just might be the best movie ever in 2017 (As of now, that is).Over all 9.5/10. 😀P.S. Not looking forward for The Little Mermaid :P",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney Needs To Return To Pure Entertainment,"Okay, Emma Watson did a great job. Who knew she could sing so well? As did Dan Stevens as the Beast, Kevin Kline as Maurice and Luke Evans as Gaston. Josh Gad as LeFou - this actor has such a charming face, so likable. Why did they have to make him a flaming whatever? For the most part, the cast was wonderful. In so saying, however, frankly I SO love the 1991 animated Beauty and the Beast that there can not possibly be any improvement on it. When I hear 'Mrs Potts' sing, I want to hear Angela Lansbury. When Lumiere sings Be Our Guest, I want to hear Jerry Orbach. Seriously. This is a good version, if a version absolutely had to be made. But did it, beyond having to mix in some liberal views? Here's the thing, Walt Disney must be up there somewhere shaking his head in dismay. Not sure who or what is in charge of the Disney world now, but obviously someone who simply feels compelled to throw in politically correct foolishness to the nth degree – even if it means spoiling the movie for thousands and thousands of previous Disney fans.

MAGICAL. Don't believe otherwise.,"Not to quote a certain overcooked potato, but anyone rating this movie less than 8/10 is fake news.

Exceptional cast, more fleshed-out than the original while still staying true to the story, and even more magical. I couldn't look away the whole time. It really felt like being a kid again and seeing it for the first time with just the right amount of nostalgia, humor, and action. I teared up at least a dozen times and was in full-on tears by the end. It was perfect. I will probably watch it in theaters again, will definitely buy it when it's on bluray. See it in theaters if you can. Immersive and beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Nostalgia factor is key.,"I thought the movie was fine. However, there were so many things that this new adaptation missed.And among the things missed, was the feisty, sassy, charismatic Belle that I'd known and loved. There was a warm girl with a big heart, and she was fully present in the original movie. In this remake, starring Emma Watson, Belle was much colder. Belle didn't capture your heart. There was a detached feeling. Emma Watson is a perfectly good actress, but she wasn't Belle, she was not Belle at all.The CGI on the Beast was horrible, but I learned to grow used to it as the movie progressed. I really didn't become fully immersed into the movie until it was almost over.By far, my favorite actors in the movie would have to be the two playing Gaston and Lefou. They breathed new life into their characters, they made things interesting. I very much enjoyed them whenever they were on screen, but that must have been the only positive contribution made here.What's that saying? ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? The only benefit I found in this was the waves of nostalgia I received from hearing all of the classic musical numbers and seeing the iconic yellow dress as Belle and the Beast waltzed across their ballroom. I still love, love, LOVE, this story. I love Beauty and the Beast and the strange sadness and longing for old Disney films that it inspires within me. I couldn't help comparing the 2017 version to the 1991 version, and feeling slightly disappointed (at times), throughout the movie.This film was just a cash grabber. I'm sure we've got many live action movies coming up in the next couple years. We'll probably be seeing a real-life Mulan, Aladdin, etc., etc., in the next few years. I re-watched the original movie at home, and really felt that there was so much more that could've been done for the remake. The Beast just wasn't as temperamental, or lovable, as the original. Belle wasn't the kindest or most accepting, either. I didn't hate Gaston as much in this adaptation either, when --frankly-- I should have, even if just a little.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Finally a Disney remake that is worthy of Disney,"I must confess that I am a huge Disney fan. I love the movies, well most of them. I love visiting Disneyland regardless of whether its Paris or Florida (Can't comment on the others as I haven't been to them but I imagine that they are magical too). But one thing that I have been critical of with Disney in recent years. Is the lack of imagination.Disney seem insistent on ruining the memories of my childhood by remaking all of their animated classics in to ""real world"" movies. With the exception of Maleficent which gave the tale of Sleeping Beauty a new twist, I have been bitterly disappointed with the remakes. This was topped by the appalling Jungle Book.Yet I was excited about the remake of Beauty and the Beast, while also extremely apprehensive. The original is a classic and all of the hype surrounding this film couldn't make me help but feel 2 things. First that I might be in danger of seeing the film in the trailers that when it gets to the movie that I will have seen it. The second was too many details were being released regarding it, such as it having a gay character and the first interracial kiss. Why should these things make headlines? However I went into the movie still excited about what Disney had done with it.I watched the movie in 3D and there was a few things that came out of the screen but seeing it in 2D wouldn't have changed the viewing pleasure.What Disney have done with this film, is set the bar so high for future remakes, that I don't think they will beat it. They treated the original respect, yet brought this movie up to date. The new songs that were introduced were beautiful and ""Evermore"" brought me to tears in the cinema. The hype surrounding around a gay character wasn't justified it was very subtle and tasteful that unless you was looking out for it I am not sure you would have noticed.The story also had a few little additions but this all added to the film rather then subtracted it. In fact I would go as far as to say that it made the characters and the story more believable. I left the cinema wanting to go back and see it again. This film was that good.The only criticism I would make is the sound mixing could have been better. There was a clear difference int he sound between when the actors were speaking and then the rerecording of their singing. The singing wasn't bad at all but it was slightly distracting. My concern that Ewan McGregors annoying french accent would grate on me for the whole film slowly disappeared as the film progressed. Must confess that I did think Mrs Potts was played by Helana Bonham-Carter but it was in fact played by Emma Thompson.In summary the film was everything I hoped Disney would make and lived up to the magic that I expected. I have no problems recommending this film and giving it 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney did it again!,"I was very apprehensive about a couple of things prior to seeing Beauty & the Beast, the first was Emma Watson playing Belle and the other was Lafou also how the songs would flow but within 1-2 minutes of the film I was at ease and even brought tears to my eyes they captured it almost perfectly. Emma Watson Didn't disappoint me nor did the Lafou character I even enjoyed both. The show stealers though for me were Gaston & The Beast portrayed by Luke Evans & Dan Stevens. I even thought 2hrs 10 minutes ish was a long running time but it flowed along brilliantly and I was amazed at how beautifully the film was filmed from scene to scene. Better than the classic original? no! but almost a like for like remake into a live action animated film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Charming Remake,"I'm no expert on CGI, but I do sing. This was my first 3D movie, which was mostly fun, but a bit overwhelming in the crowd scenes. We were fairly near the front of the theater thanks to having to advance-purchase seats, so that was likely a factor. As soon as I heard Audra McDonald's voice, I was hooked. Emma Watson's voice was fine, while Dan Stevens voice was one of the most pleasant surprises of the film. Kevin Kline added depth to Maurice's gentle spirit, while Emma Thompson's characterization was comforting. Luke Evans' Gaston was less air-headed, and seemed more cruel than either the animated or live musical versions, so having Josh Gad as his side-kick was welcome comic relief. The showcase numbers (Be Our Guest, for example) were well done, and fun to experience. The more violent scenes are really not appropriate for the youngest Belles; however, third-graders (maybe second-grade) and older should be fine.Did it sparkle as much as the animated original? Perhaps not, but the live actors gave it depth and nuance. I enjoyed this version, and would see it again, even in 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Just Fine,"It primarily WANTS to BE the Disney animated film, but it pales in comparison.In terms of vocals, everyone outshines Watson. Her voice sounds as if shes's focused more on hitting the notes correctly, so her acting falls flat when she sings (and her Belle character feels flat already). I stand by the idea that singers should be cast over actors. Musicals depend on strong, trained voices.The scenes that entertained me most happen to be where Watson wasn't present. I like her as an actress, but she wasn't very strong here.I watched the film for a class assignment. It really did feel like homework. Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen were my favorites.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I wish I hadn't seen it...,... so that I could watch it again for the first time.I hadn't seen the story of beauty and the beast since I was a child and I must say no remake has ever made me feel like this movie. The acting is incredible and the songs are just mesmerizing. Thank you disney for this remake I never knew I needed.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
pretty good,"I was bored today and decided to watch this movie on netflix. I went in with very low expectations. At the end of the movie I was surprised. I enjoyed it. Beauty and the beast was never my favorite animated Disney film, but it ran plenty of times in my VHS player. This live action one had all the great songs and some new ones. I wasn't in love with the new ones, but it was a change that set it apart from its animated counterpart. The casting for gaston was pretty good. Wish they found a bigger guy or made him look more rugged. Emma Watson felt a little off kilter in this role. She doesn't have a strong singing voice and that is something i remember strongly from the animated Bell. Her acting wasn't on point. It didn't look right, I wish i could explain it. I really don't want to call her a bad actor, but......this role wasn't too right for her. The beast was not as bad as i was expecting. He had some charm and the CGI wasn't too bad....though it would of been cool if it looked as good as the one from the animated movie. All in all not a bad movie, but something i would only watch once in this lifetime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A beautiful beast of a movie,"This highly anticipated live action recreation of a much loved Disney classic did not disappoint.
The all star cast with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Ian Mckellen and Emma Thompson gave us some of the most comical and memorable moments including some spectacular musical numbers - all of which were sung to perfection.Emma Watson's portrayal of Bell was very well executed and she managed to set the tone of the film to a comfortable understated level which set us up for the comparison of the future magical moments we would see later on.Luke Evans as Gaston was the perfect casting choice. He encapsulated the humerous arrogance and masoginistic nature of the character to a tee and made him as likable as any villain you love to hate. An excellent singing voice worthy of the original classic. His sidekick lefou played by the very talented Josh Gad provided some excellent liners and a great musical performance in the song 'Gaston' with co star Evans.Dan Stevens' beastly voice was also a casting win for me.
His portrayal reminded the audience of the prisoner behind the monster and the innocent remorseful Prince which we grow to route for as his relationship with Bell blossoms.Visually clever effects throughout with colourful sets and scenery kept me firmly engrossed into the magical world of Disney. The story is a timeless masterpiece and one that director Bill Condon did an excellent job of bringing to life.
I have seen this twice now and would happily watch it again.
Another live action triumph for Disney!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It was magical.,"""When we return to the village, you will marry me. And the Beast's head will hang on our wall!""I'm really not ashamed to admit that I'm always looking forward to watch a live-action rendition of a Disney cartoon. We've seen a few of those already passing by. One more successful than the other. Or better, one I liked more than the other. ""Maleficent"", ""The BFG"" and especially ""The Jungle Book"" were, in my view, gorgeous adaptations. I was less enthusiastic about ""Alice in Wonderland"". And when you read which cartoons Disney is going to make a live-action movie of, there's still a lot of fun waiting for us. And when you read which cartoons Disney is going to make a live-action movie off, there's still a lot of fun waiting for us. Brace yourself! These are coming our way : ""The Lion King"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Snow White"", ""Dumbo"" and ""Pinocchio"". My expectations regarding ""Beauty and the Beast"" were high. But they weren't met fully. Despite the many reports about the gross income at the worldwide box office (more than $ 1 billion), I wasn't as enthusiast as with ""The Jungle book"".Let me start again with the best parts. This time it's not the main roles that deserve the most praise. No, the supporting roles do. They were simply beautiful. Humorous, lively and fascinating to watch. First of all, the enchanted household objects from the castle. Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Lumière (Ewan McGregor), Mrs. Pott (Emma Thompson), Chip (Nathan Mack), Madame Wardrobe (Audra McDonald) and Maestro Cadenza (Stanley Tucci) are a grab-bag of props and despite the fact that they are graphic creations, they really look lifelike. Not only the design is fairy-like. The voices of the actors also provide additional magic.And then you have the odd couple Gaston (Luke Evans) and Lefou (Josh Gad) who can easily compete with the legendary duo Laurel and Hardy. Luke Evans was fantastic as the narcissistic Gaston who uses every moment to praise himself and who's always stroking his own ego. An egoist who is not only strong, handsome and feels superior, but also who thinks it's self-evident that everybody dances to his tune. And of course he assumes Belle will marry him blindly. Lefou on the other hand is the clumsy, tractable servant who constantly runs after Gaston and agrees with him all the time (only in the end there's some doubt). Probably the only character people made a lot of fuss about in advance. And all that because of his so-called gayish behavior. Well, there'll always be nitpickers. Terribly exaggerated in my opinion. Not even worth mentioning.In general the story is the same as the one told in the 1991 cartoon. There are a few adjustments and additions. I'm not such an expert when it comes to this fairy tale, but I really can't remember there was an explanation about the death of Belle's mother. And in fact, I wonder if this was a valuable addition anyway. On the other hand, much attention has been paid to the design. The palace of the beast looks phenomenal. A giant building full of stately ornaments and impressive rooms and halls where Rococo is blended with other European styles. The appearance reminded me of my visit to Neuschwanstein Castle when I was young. The styling applied in this contemporary version of a classic Disney looks pretty okay you can say.So, which were the parts I wasn't happy about? The first one has to do with personal preferences and shouldn't really be seen as something negative. I thoroughly hate musicals. Voila, I've outed myself. As soon as the first song has finished (usually quite soon at the beginning of the film), I have trouble concentrating on the actual story itself. I find myself anxiously waiting for the next damn song to begin (And every void, insignificant event is enough to get everybody singing in a musical) . Perhaps the plethora of musicals I've watched in the weekend during my youth, is the cause of this phobia. There wasn't Saturday without a ""Busby Berkeley""-like musical being broadcasted again. Now I have to admit that the song ""Be our guest"" was put together well. A thrilling spectacle. But my hate for musicals will always stay. What disappointed me the most was the graphic design of the beast (Dan Stevens). Especially the famous scene with Belle (Emma Watson) in her impressive, yellow dress dancing through a giant ballroom in the arms of the beast, wasn't so great. Here you could clearly see the beast was a computer generated character.""Beauty and the beast"" is magical, detailed and fascinating. A must see for anyone who's a major fan of Disneyfilms. Even Emma Watson was brilliant in my opinion and the appropriate person to play the lovely, cute Belle. And if she indeed sang all these songs herself (even if sophisticated sound techniques were used to make it sound even better), then she's also a talented singer. Despite some personal remarks, this is also a successful recasting of the classic version. Only the magic of ""The Jungle Book"" overwhelmed me more when I saw it. What the heck, on to the next Disney movie as soon as possible please!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Luke Evans is top notch as Gaston,"It's good. I don't mind remakes, as long as they bring new, positive things into the mix - 'Beauty and the Beast' does that.I don't have any noteworthy issues with it in truth, the casting is excellent while the musical pieces are put together nicely. Luke Evans is top notch as Gaston, he really brings his character to life. Ewan McGregor and Josh Gad also impress.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Ignore the bad ratings/critics, especially the ""gay"" fiasco. Magical experience. However, new additional music was unnecessary and poor.","Emma Watson is undeniably gorgeous, especially in that iconic main ballroom dance yellow dress, and her singing is fantasticThey threw in new additional songs/soundtrack in the movie, but they were all EASILY FORGETTABLE and POOR! It sounds soooo generic and not catchy at all... did not want to listen to those singing parts; the original songs were instantly catchy and what made them all classic, regardless of the the nostalgia factor. Seriously, all the new songs stink, very uninspiring, plain and uncreative.The beast CG is soooo bad. They should have just went with a physical makeup artist. I mean, I'm sure we've advanced in the physical makeup department. It seems like we're stepping backwards in CG quality. The beast also isn't as charming/memorable/likable change as the original.The chemistry between Belle and the Beast just isn't there like the animation.While some of the ""twist""/new elements they changed around with the scenes with Gaston were interesting, the extra backstory they threw in about the mother and Paris is so bad.Gaston doesn't seem that much of a jerk in the beginning. Where's the muscles and him gulping bunch of eggs?!The best scene is the iconic ballroom dance. Emma Watson looks so beautiful there and that iconic Beauty and Beast music just sends you chills. The sets and everything makes this really magical.The ending Ariana Grande/John Legend version isn't that good... the version they used in the trailer is waaayy better and sounds more epic. Also Celine Dion's ""How Does A Moment Last Forever"" isn't that great either.First of all, the whole ""gay scene"" controversy is totally overblown and ridiculous; did I miss something? It's honestly not there. There's more direct blatant sex on TV and ads daily all the time, yet there's actually people complaining or spreading this silly false propaganda of a ""gay scene""?And another thing, what the hell are people complaining about Emma Watson's singing? So hard to please people. Yet another ridiculous controversy rumor floating around about ""auto-tune"" is another overblown false accusation. Haters are just always haters. Emma is an amazing singer and has a wonderful voice... Jealous, crazy people out there.The first scene when Belle talks to her father, she bends over way too many times... that seemed almost too deliberate and calculated.Josh Gad as Gaston's side kick is spot on. It's very risky and hard to top a classic legendary film, you can't expect this to surpass the original - I mean, nothing is going to take away the original anyway. Obviously it's not perfect, but it's still a nice addition. I enjoyed the set, hearing the classic songs again, totally didn't care for the new songs/new backstory - but it was still a magical experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not too bad. But I personally felt that the 1991 version is still the best,"I think the problem with Disney live-action remakes, is that there's such awkwardness in the layout, I personally felt that in the case of Beauty and the Beast, the live-action version can't ""perform"" the story very well, it appears to me that they are trying to tell the story with a fusion that combines animation, movie and musical, a bit of everything in everywhere, however I don't really enjoy this experience. The actors and actresses were fine considering the demands and preference of the audiences (consumers), some of them did very well, Like Gaston and LeFou. I think that Emma Watson looks very pretty on screen as Belle, and her singing is okay, but I personally felt that her acting is very stiff, her singing skills is very much not enough for a musical. She is a very successful and smart celebrity, I think she is a very good fashion and makeup model too, but her performances (including Harry Potter, etc) on screen I've seen so far, haven't appear to me as a professional/convincing actress at all, I never seen her looking like she is doing (performing, acting) something she believes. As Belle Emma Watson sometimes looks miserable, like she is forcing her face to hold on expression(disgusted, love, sad, etc.) that she was told to. I felt that my money spent on the movie ticket was burned watching her performance, and this isn't the first time at all when it comes to movies that has her in the cast, I remember feeling really angry last time when I saw her performance in Harry Potter- The Goblet of Fire, because I can't believe I spent money to get to watch such unprofessional performance of a pretty ""actress"" like her on a mainstream movie, and now in B&TB she hasn't improve at all.Overall I think everything on the screen appears to be pretty but also boring (awkward). I personally much prefer the 1991 version, for me it is one of the best from Disney. I kind of wish they didn't do the remake.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Above average movie, leads/songs are great, just doesn't feel as ""magical"" as the 1991 classic","***WARNING: This review may contain spoilers***The movie is nice but doesn't feel magical. Don't get me wrong. I like the movie. Here's what I think worked and didn't.WHAT DID WORK: 1) I like the additions of backstory to the Beast's and Belle's mother stories. 2) The new songs were good. Belle's solo, the Beast's solo (showing him as a kid looking at his mother), and when the Beast was up on the tower after he released Belle to go back to her father 3) The more life-like movements of the candelabra and the clock 4) The Beast being Belle's ""book"" equal instead of being uneducated in the 1991 film 5) Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, and Luke Evans are good leads 6) The part where all the servants in their ""cursed state"" (dresser, candelabra, Mrs. Potts, Chip, the piano, and especially the leg rest / dog become immobilized (and practically dead) was truly emotional and done very well. 7) I actually liked the end credits (no surprise scene at end) 8) Nice to hear Celine Dion sing during the end credits (but I'm partial to her voice)WHAT DIDN'T WORK: 1) They did a Brandy Cinderella-type version with town folk being white and black and multi-cultured...which made it look like a modern movie set instead of a fairy tale 2) Bad CGI for the wolves and the Beast's face 3) The Village people reuniting with the ""new"" reformed castle at the end and realizing there are some relationships that were crisscrossed with each other 4)Emma Watson's songs were partially auto-tuned 5)Biggest disappointment for me was the ""Beauty and the Beast""-song and the dance. That was the scene that ""made"" the 1991 movie, but the way the whole scene was filmed did not make it seem magical. I was waiting for the scene where Beast escorts Belle into the dance floor (which was imitated in the movie ""Enchanted""--but nothing like that here. Unfortunately, it was regrettable and more people are talking about Emma Watson's yellow dress than this scene.There are more things that worked and more things that didn't work, but these are some to give you an idea.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
3 Times Is the Charm,"This review is by someone who was introduced to the Disney tale of Beauty and the Beast through the live-action version. That being said, having now seen the animated version as well, the animated version is clearly better as it actually manages to make me cry at the end (darn you Disney!) But don't let that dissuade you from seeing this delightful revision of the classic tale. The live-action Beauty and the Beast is truly dazzling.Emma Watson is a fantastic actress and clearly one of my favorite actresses because of her work as Hermione Granger but, to be honest, I don't feel she's pretty enough to be Belle. But...she just manages to pull it off.However, Luke Evans is the PERFECT Gaston. He's devilshly handsome and yet so conceited and awful at the same time. I can't imagine anyone else playing him.All in all, I've seen this film three times now so yeah, I like it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pretty but lifeless retelling,"There is a trend going on right now with Disney films, that they are redoing their animated classics in live-action – Alice In Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and now the latest in this trend Beauty And The Beast. This one was going to be difficult for me because the 1991 Disney film Beauty And The Beast is one of my favourite films of all time.So how do I feel this film? Honestly I spent the first half being pretty annoyed as it was just carbon copy with minor changes, but I just accepted it by the time I got to the second half and just pretended I was watching a play of the movie instead. But then I have to admit there was one really great scene that got me emotional towards the end. Not enough to make me love the film, in a way it highlights my biggest problem with the film, I'll get to it later and don't worry I won't spoil it.The majority of it is pretty much a copy of the 1991 film, they might as well have used the same storyboards. The problem though is not so much that it redoes the same scenes, it's that they get lost in translation, not enough effort is put in to create the same feelings. I lost count over how many cut-to-blacks this film has.Visually this film is really nice to look at. Many of the sets are well designed, the castle especially with all the little details. However the environments of the locations aren't well explored that you notice at times that it's shot on a sound stage. The CGI effects for the Beast is not that great, I don't understand why they couldn't use prosthetics, you could've saved legendary make-up artist Rick Baker from his early retirement. The best CGI goes to the animate objects, sure the designs were pretty creepy this time but I did buy them as genuine moving objects – the mechanics on the clocks look realistic and the teapot and cup look like real china. Be Our Guest was a visually stunning moment.The acting all-round was more or less on the same level, they are great actors but the issue I have is that I'm always aware that they are playing the parts. I don't see Belle in this film, I just see Emma Watson playing Belle in this film and it's like that for everyone. It seems like all these big named actors were putting on performances for theatre instead of an actual film. It's kind of bad that I think the characters in an animated film feel more like real people than the ones played by real people. I don't care how much they expand on their backstories or how many additional character-building moments they are given; if they don't act natural I'm not going to be invested in them. They're never boring however, you can tell everyone had a lot of fun making this, so at times they share that enjoyment with you. The strongest performances are from Kevin Kline as Maurice and Josh Gad as Le Fou, I guess that helps that their characters are the most different from their animated counterparts, they're less goofy and are a little more realistic. The singing is not the greatest either, not Russell Crowe or Peirce Brosnan levels of bad, but not good compared to the singing in the original. The best singing comes from Audra McDonald, whom is a soprano but she's not given enough to sing.In terms of what this added (again not to spoil the film), there are about four new songs added which were good I will admit, I could see these fitting into theatre productions quite well. There are some really good additional scenes like when Maurice and Belle work on a music box together and they mention her mother and a pretty unpleasant scene with Gaston and Maurice. There's a scene that could've taken this film in a unique direction, unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere and adds nothing except to try and expand on Belle's past which kind of ruins the subtle moment she had with her father at the beginning. Then there is the big scene towards the end that made me tear up, it was a real heart-breaking scene. It was built up quite well and when it happens it lets it play out. Very clever and by far the best scene they did in this film. So why is the best scene it's biggest problem? Because it's a moment that does not involve Belle or the Beast and it made me realise I how much didn't really care about them here. I love Belle and the Beast, they are awesome characters because in the original they are allowed to be characters. They have genuine emotions that you feel in all of their scenes and you feel their chemistry even in scenes without dialogue. Here despite being 'more developed' they feel still feel shallow, again it's because they don't feel like real people and their chemistry is non-existent.I apologise that I keep making so many comparisons to the original but it's very difficult not to. This film keeps reminding me of the original, it keeps redoing it but not as well with minor changes and additions that aren't strong enough to let this film stand on it's own merits. Honestly, this film only works for me as like seeing a stage theatre version of a film you like. In fact if you watch this film without seeing the original, you'd probably think you are watching a stylised film adaptation of a musical play like 2004's Phantom Of The Opera. If you bare that in mind you'll enjoy this just fine, it's not bad by any means but it won't stand the test of time. The 1991 movie however is a timeless classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beautiful! BUT...Consistently Tries to Validate Itself...Ultimately an Unnecessary Remake,"Prepare yourself for ""a tale as old as time"" that is ultimately better told through its animated counterpart. Director Bill Condon's live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the first animated film nominated for Best Picture at the (1992) Academy Awards, is an extravagant display of visual effects and digital imagery necessary to animate a live-action motion picture. Essentially, he took an animated movie, made it live-action, just to make it animated again. Sure, this new version of the ""song as old as rhyme"" can certainly stand on its own and is demonstrably well-directed, but 2017's Beauty and the Beast largely comes across as unnecessary. In terms of the storytelling (or diegesis), the film's effort to nearly shot-for-shot translate the most memorable parts of the film from animation to live-action pays off nicely! It's when the film tries to be different that it falls short in its delivery. You may find yourself exhausted and over-stimulated by the constant waves of computer-animated figures in a live-action world. Oh yeah, you'll likely miss hearing the legendary Angela Lansbury as the iconic Mrs. Potts.Can this film stand on its own? Sure. There is no question in that. Moreover, is it enjoyable and magical? That, it is. But when most of the campaign, leading up to the highly anticipated release, was primarily built upon how similar the live-action film would be to its animated counterpart, therein a problem arises. Because most people going into the movie will have seen the animated version, Broadway show, or even the show at Disney's Hollywood Studios (which, in full disclosure, is a show that I worked when I was a Cast Member at Walt Disney World), you are predisposed to looking for and eagerly awaiting the nostalgic references and memories. And there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I was looking forward to reliving the experience of when I first saw the animated movie. For the most part, if you are like me, then you will be pleased with the live-action translation–truly. However, it's when the live-action version departs from or adds in material not found or referenced in the animated classic that you may be disappointed or simply ask ""why?"" You may find yourself wondering why was a live-action remake even necessary?One of the most memorable elements of Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991) is the music! Still to this day, millions of people love hearing the classic music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Both the Beauty and the Beast and Be Our Guest can be heard as part of other shows at Walt Disney World and of course are included in the stage show at Hollywood Studios. Fortunately, the most iconic songs from the animated version are largely untouched; however, with a couple of the songs, there are breaks for diegetic dancing, fighting, or other material that essentially interrupts the organic flow of the music from the buildup to the climax and denouement. Furthermore, here's something quite interesting and odd: the song ""Human Again"" was written for but deleted when it originally hit theatres in 1991. It was, however, added back in for the Broadway show and in the 2010 (and Diamond Edition) re-release of the movie. Although it was seen as important enough to include in the Broadway show and add back into the animated version, it is conspicuously missing from the live-action remake.Okay, now for the white elephant in the room: Josh Gad's Lefou. Unless you have been completely disconnected from social media and the news, you've undoubtedly heard or read about the first ever Disney ""gay moment"" in this film. Suffice it to say, the whole thing has been blown way out of proportion. In fact, more attention is likely being paid to Lefou now than had the story never grown to the size of Gaston's ego. For the most part, the subtext and subtitles of Lefou's are largely just that–subtle–unless you are looking for them. But, in doing that, you may miss some of the more important and impressive parts of the movie. Moreover, there is nothing in Lefou's actions that come across as offensive or obnoxious. Before audiences begin accusing Disney of pushing their ideals on those eager to attend this film, it is likely that the entertainment and media giant is simply delivering what audiences already expect or want. As a film and media professor, I can tell you that by in large, media simply delivers what audiences and investors are telling them to produce–not the other way around. Looking back at the animated film, it is pretty obvious that Lefou has a thing for Gaston anyway. Although most of the hints at his sexual orientation are more-or-less winks or nods at the audience (winks or nods that you have to be looking for), there is a moment that is a trifle more obvious at the end of the film. Diegetically, there is nothing bizarre about Lefou's behavior and it suits his character well.Prepare to be whisked away to an enchanted castle in a remote part of France. So remote is this province in France, that most everyone speaks with a British accent. Bill Condon's film will take you back to when you first saw this magical tale of falling in love with someone based upon what's on the inside and not allowing a beastly outward appearance to detract from the gentle soul. Relive the music that you may still listen to in the car or eagerly look forward to when visiting the Disney Parks and Resorts. Ultimately, this film may not capture the magic of the original for you, but there is a lot to enjoy! Looking for a great date movie this weekend, then this is definitely it! Hopefully a side effect of this film may remind producers and audiences that some stories are better suited for an animated motion picture.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Missed Opportunites,"Disney's latest live action remake is a wonderful trip down memory lane, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It follows the animated feature line for line, but with extra scenes and songs to try and deepen the story a little. Those added details don't really go anywhere though, which is an unfortunate missed opportunity when you have such fascinating source material to work with. Getting to see these timeless characters reenacted with today's talent was also a lot of fun, and though they do look the part, their singing voices were tainted with heavy doses of autotuning, and some just lacked energy all together. It felt as if the filmmakers were holding themselves back from making a more fleshed out version of the animated feature, but it was still highly entertaining.

I just left the cinema, and remembered exactly why I used to love Disney so much as a kid, and why I still love them! Everything about this movie is so MAGICAL. I loved how they created the beast, sang the songs, acting, Emma Watson is truly a natural beauty and perfect for the role! 10 out 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Rekindling Magic is Harder Than it Looks,"One could argue Beauty and the Beast is Disney's most beloved property of all-time. The 1991 animated classic is legendary, with its iconic score and captivating story becoming a staple in pop culture. It's a risky move to slap a remake onto such a profound piece of movie history, but, outside of a few hard bumps in the road, the risk of Beauty and the Beast (B&B) seems to be worth the reward.Right out of the gate, most remakes are going to be scrutinized for its ability to walk the thin line of honoring the original story, while incorporating new, fresh narrative details. It's no easy task to accomplish. We hear constantly how remakes will honor the original while bringing new ideas to the table, and quite often, it doesn't pan out. Beauty and the Beast is not so much an exception to that history, more than it's acceptable. The age-old tale of B&B is still undoubtedly the main story focus in the modern take, but sprinkles of new plot structure weave through the film, for better or for worse. The 129 min run time topples over the original's 84 min, adding extra scenes, mainly in the first act, to try and liven the character development of some of the film's lesser known characters outside of Belle and the Beast. This is where I felt the film was at its weakest, however. Sure we need introduction to the main story, setting and characters, but it's not until Belle is actually in the Beast's castle that the movie starts to become more interesting. Once we're in the castle, focusing on Belle, the Beast and the objects occupying it, the movie picks up, becomes more intriguing and more endearing. The overall pacing can be described as OK. B&B struggles to tell a rock solid three-act story like it's 1991 counterpart, but if you can get past the added run time, the classic Beauty and the Beast tale is still oh-so-charming.The '91 original was a pioneer in animation, boasting one of the more recognizable camera shots in all of animated film history during the ballroom scene. 2017 brings an entire new world of animation and CGI, and whether you like it or not, B&B utilizes it to the extreme. The budget was a clear green light for massive CG visuals, most notably the Beast himself whose design, while at first a little unappealing, eventually grows on you. But the heavy dose of CGI littered throughout the film is tough to accept, even though it is a remake of a fully animated film. I have no problem with how the SFX looked, the movie was visually wonderful, but the sheer amount of it is hard to ignore throughout the entirety of the film.On the audible side, the iconic B&B score was on full display here. I'll get into more detail about that shortly, so for now, I'll say that the excitement and charm of the score is present, but not always quite as enthralling as the original. The mixing is often unbalanced during the musical numbers boasting numerous people, and it's undeniably hard to recapture the pure wonder of Angela Lansbury's original performance of ""Tale as Old as Time"", but B&B does the song enough justice with Emma Thompson's performance. The big budget brings assumptions to how well the film will look and sound, and it honestly looks and sounds just great. But there are inconsistencies that hold B&B back from getting to the level of the original.There's been mixed feelings towards the casting choices for the film, namely mega-star Emma Watson in the lead role as Belle. The bulk of the negativity towards Watson seemed to be in her inability to sing at the professional level you'd expect from a movie such as B&B. While I'll admit it's true that the vocal performances from Watson, along with several other actors, are weak for the standard Disney set in 1991, the overall performance given by the main cast was good enough to warrant the stamp of approval. Watson is solid in the lead role, while Dan Stevens does his best with the screen time he was given as Beast. My stand outs, however, have to go to Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor as Cogsworth and Lumiere respectively. While their time on screen is also too limited, their chemistry was spot on, providing the perfect comedic relief and giving great performances during the famous number, ""Be Our Guest"". I also enjoyed Luke Evans as the main antagonist, Gaston, but not so much his more-focused-on partner, LeFou, played by the over-hyped Josh Gad. The change in LeFou's character was welcome in the film, but it was the forced screen time and dialogue for the character that just took too much away from what was important to the film's story.Disney captured lightning in a bottle in 1991 with the original, now legendary Beauty and the Beast. It's not fair, or maybe not possible, to bash it's remake, seeing how the films are similar on many grounds. I had many moments enjoying B&B and would happily watch it again. The story was close enough to the original to pass as enjoyable. The acting, while hurting in the vocal department, was splendid and the chemistry between certain characters was delightful. What B&B lacks is the simplicity of its predecessor. The added story elements, which created the longer run time, and CG- heavy atmosphere leave a dent in the crafting of the film's 'soul', if you will. The musical score just couldn't hold up to the original, and that is such an enormous part of what makes B&B so special. Beauty and the Beast tries hard, maybe too hard, to stand out from the original film, creating a respectable, often enjoyable remake of a iconic film, but even so, comes nowhere near the level of what was seen in 1991.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Visually astonishing for all ages,"I do struggle to understand the reason behind so much hatred towards this movie. Because I went to watch it in the theater and I can't point out anything that is actually wrong with it. The performances were good. Much of the original material was there. So why are people complaining so much? Truth is, I kind of understand both perspectives. People was expecting perhaps a faithful copy of the original only with the live- action change. Disney is bringing back the classics but they don't want to simply redo their old successes. They want a refreshment too. And all the cast and the crew contributed to it in their own ways. Disney always made a point of making movies with a message. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was no different. Now in 2017, they made a great update in my humble opinion including more background from the characters and more themes that were quite pertinent. If you ask me "" Would you take small children to watch it?"" I would immediately reply ""Not before they have watched the first one."" Why? Because this one has way more layers than the first. Small children can't really grasp all of it and that would be a bit of a shame. I've found so many layers and dimension to it, so much is implied between the lines. But you have to go with an open mind. Just thinking back at the other version that French studios did a couple of years ago, I kept thinking these past years that Disney would have to go deeper to run against that. And they did. I couldn't be happier with this new version. It's different, yes it is. But not necessarily in a bad way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Is this one version too many?,"This is the 7th film version of Beauty and The Beast and I really wonder why they made another, especially seeing it's part human and part animation but it works . It's neither a film version of the Broadway stage hit or a Human version of the great fully animated Disney feature film. It does have all the magic and effects that Disney dollars can throw at a film and a few new songs and plot twists.The cast is very capable especially Emma Watson, who sings well and looks suitably enchanting as a true Disney Princess should . It's was fun to see some favourites of mine like Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobes and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts . The new songs by Alan Menken don't really add anything to his original score in fact I think they made a mistake by not including Human Again in this film it's a great production number and I missed it, perhaps it's on the DVD extras cost certainly couldn't have been a factor in dropping it with Disney dollars behind it.In conclusion it's a good film with reservations I prefer the 1946 Jean Cocteau version, watched it recently with new Phillip Glass opera soundtrack or The fully human live Broadway musical production, but yes it's lovely and pays little tributes to The Sound of Music opening scene Maria twirling while ""The Hills are Alive ""and little references to the Original Cocteau version but please no more Beauty and The Beasts , that's enough!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Beauty of a Film,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is a wondrous film that can never be touched...well...unless Disney is the one doing the refurbishments. This classic ""tale as old as time"" was brilliantly reimagined with all of the same pomp and circumstance as the original. The production design and costuming perfectly captured the dark ominous moods while simultaneously highlighting the sheer elegance of the picture. A piece of this elegance was brought about by the film's effervescent and at times, gripping score provided by the composer of the original film's score, Alan Menken. The familiarity of the film in its score and story was astonishing and probably the only thing I could see anybody having a grievance about. However, the picture did provide some much needed backstory that was glossed over in the 1991 version of the film. With that, Disney did a commendable job at adapting several aspects of the story while still maintaining the nostalgia for the film we all know and love. Finally, I must mention that the casting for this film was phenomenal. With Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor as Cogsworth and Lumière, Dan Stevens as Beast, and Emma Watson as Belle, the talent was truly immeasurable. I know that some fans of the beloved animated film were a bit skeptical of Emma Watson in the role of Belle as she had no musical theatre experience prior to playing this cherished Disney Princess. Nevertheless, I can assure those fans that she did an outstanding job as Belle. While Watson's vocals did seem a bit fine-tuned, she still managed to bring a higher level of emotion and meaning to Belle's voice. She boldly characterized the true meaning of feminism all while subtly hinting at Belle's down-to-earth nature. With that, I must say that this film was, without a doubt, transcendent of our modern era. The picture gave life to a new generation of family entertainment, yet it still managed to charm us with its nostalgic vibes. For me, this film lived up to the glory of its predecessor and may have even surpassed it. From now on, when I think of the story of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I will think of this enchanting masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Watered down version of the original classic,"Aside from this, I have seen Cinderella out of the new live-action Disney adaptations. And they do share certain similarities, but also certain key differences.We all know the story of Beauty and the Beast. Cursed prince, a smart woman feeling trapped in a small provincial village, castle in the middle of nowhere, tale as old as time, and so on. The problem, at least when compared to Cinderella, is that they changed absolutely nothing. It's the exact same story, the exact same songs, the exact same characters. Almost scene by scene the same movie. There are a couple of added scenes that aim to deepen the character of the two main leads, but they seem exactly what they are: tagged on additions to pad out the runtime. Whereas Cinderella, while still sticking to the basic premise, significantly deepened the relationship between the main couple, changed the order of events and felt as a whole like a fresh movie while still paying an homage to the original.On the other hand, the actors are better in this film. Emma Watson has her haters, but I've always liked her and she gives a credible performance here as Belle. Perhaps it's a bit distracting that the character is so similar to Hermione Granger, but that's what you get. Luke Evans makes for an incredible Gaston, probably the best character in the film, and Dan Stevens makes for a credible Beast. Although I do hope that they had made him at least partially with practical effects because now the CGI just isn't quite there with this budget.That being said, the film looks fine overall. I'm not a huge fan of all-CGI effects like in this film, because it just doesn't look real unless done phenomenally well and perhaps not even then, but I can live with it. It helps that the designs and textures are thought out well.As a whole this movie doesn't have much reason for existing. The original Beauty and the Beast looks, sounds and acts better as a story and as a film. These live-action remakes only make sense if you bring something new to the story. Still, as a standalone film, without the context, it's an okay piece of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Amazing!,"I thought the movie was very well done. I agree, Gaston was my favorite. He did a great job. As for the gay under tone.....whatever! Most movies have it. It was so subtle you really had to look for it. Similar to but less than Sweet Home Alabama. Think about this...if Olaf wasn't a snowman in Frozen it would have been the same here. No big deal! Emma Watson was a fantastic choice for Belle. I thought it impossible to break the Hermione character and she impressed me!! The perfect Belle!! The only bad I can say....Beasts solo??? There was a point but eh???? I didn't care for it. Some graphics in later scenes looked fake and that is the only bad I can say!!

8/10,"Belle (Emma Watson) is a...yeah probably no need for a plot synopsis since this is the tale as old as time and it would just bore the hell out of any reader. So lets just get to it. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the live action Disney remake that comes twenty six years after the gorgeous animated feature.I am more not only fine, but encourage the retelling of classical tales in any kind of medium. It has been done since the dawn of humanity and I see no problem in doing so as long as there is always something new to add to these stories and some fresh silver lining to find in our characters. Going into this I must admit that I was very frighted to be treated to a shot for shot remake that I would have enjoyed only because of charm and would have felt embarrassed about it.Whilst there is treading of familiar grounds, I was so pleasantly surprised to see what a great, touching and progressive modern take Disney was able to stamp on it. I am a big fan of the animated feature, the story is really universal and whilst this entry does not touch the emotional heights and the charm of the original, it offers a reminder of what a flawless piece of storytelling this is and it graces us with a good enough touch that managed to take me genuinely to enjoy and live this story one more time in a different way.Whilst the songs might be the same they are always so fantastically entertaining on their own, Bill Condon builds on that and assembles a series of flashy musical numbers that all live beautifully on screen. There is no fast cutting, the editing decisions in these pieces are always warranted and the filmmakers manage to strike a perfect balance of seeing everything unfold on screen and using the editing to enhance the music. There are also a couple on updated or new musical numbers and it was a great sign that they flowed with the picture fluently, they felt genuine and didn't play as a forced new addition.Of course the real spearhead of this production is its incredible cast and what can one say that the list of names here cannot already do on its own. It is just pure glee, there isn't one half of a bad casting decision, everybody not only fits their role, but does the perfect amount of updating and nuance to make you buy into them as soon as they appear on screen. Luke Evans was definitely the highlight for me, he brought Gaston to the screen in all of his ridiculousness and irony, it was a pleasure to see and was the high point of comedy of an already strongly funny film.Another magical strength of the film is its CGI. There are a couple of green screens that got under my skin because of their blatant notability, especially considering how excellent the rest of the VFX were. This was really state of the art work. I literally could not tell all of the animated characters were apart from the live action ones, it was completely seamless in a way that I think we've never seen done this good before. The question never came up, there was not a single false beat, they were absolutely perfect.However, what might be the very best part of this update is just how modern it is. No, not only because of a gay character, which still is such a brilliant addition because of how brilliantly they manage to weave it into the story and adapt it into a fairy tale character. There's much more here, many genre conventions are broken, many male/female stereotypes are purposefully bent and turned on their heads, there is diversity and it so beautiful to see such an iconic story get an adaptation that is a better representation of the human race.Yes, there is no denying some of the ground treaded is very familiar and I am the first to say that there still is some space for change in this story, there still are a couple of plot point that can be updated and because of how modern the take overall is I felt like some events and minor character dynamics could have had a little polishing. Technically too the film has some moments of disjointed editing and it could have done with a little more cutting. Don't mistake me, the two hours never drag, but they do feel kind of unnecessary by the end, a five to ten minute tightening could have done the job.I was initially a little cold on this film, but after realizing just how much I enjoyed it, how it actually got to me on an emotional level by the end and how charmed I was by the characters and their new iterations. I have to admit that I would be happily up to rewatching the film which was something I was doubting going in. I bumped up the score a little because of this, I hope that a further viewing confirms my feelings on this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The Trade-off that's not worth it,"When i was a kid Beauty and the Beast (1991) is one of my most favorite animated films of all time (followed by Mulan and Toy Story 2) so there's no denying that this review is going to be a little bias.Why is that ? you might asked, it's because this Beauty and the Beast basically try to do exactly what the animated version do like literally almost copy and pasted frame by frame and this became the most negative things about this Live Action version even though it adds a few backstory here and there (which i appreciated) the part where it's exactly the same lacks the emotion or authenticity like 1991 version did.A lot of iconic scene came out kind a bland because it can't go crazy like the animated film did instead it just move there in a frame called 'Beauty and the Beast 1991 version' in a way that there's so few room left to actually breathe (or dare i say they too scared to actually do something new?), sure production design is so beautiful sometimes even more than the original but when the emotion is not there at all it's pointless.one thing that i really need to gave credit to is Luke Evans like wow he's really really great as Gaston, honestly he's one of the best thing about this version.If we judge Beauty and the Beast ( 2017 ) by it's own without comparing it to the original movie it's a pretty good movie but still i think that's impossible because in the end it's a remake, and few of new backstory is not worth to trade with emotion and authenticity than the original has.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Disney can still work the magic even out of the animation studio, and 26 years later after a treasured classic.","Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, The Fifth Estate, and Mr Holmes) re-invents the wonderfully powerful fantasy tale of Beauty and the Beast, continuing Disney's mission to make live action versions of their classic films. Re-introducing the lovely story of love and beauty that we all treasure, Disney have created a fine piece of work that reminds us of our passion for the story.As we all know Belle (Emma Watson) is a intelligent girl a head of her time, who is snatched from her ordinary life, into the mysterious world of the Beast (Dan Stevens), when her farther is taken kidnapped by him and she takes his place. But as she discovers the secrets of the Beast's castle and furniture she and the Beast find something that wasn't there before. See what I did? In a visually magnificent presence, the story we love is moved pleasantly onto the live action screen in a colourful and enjoyable experience. Of course not replacing the original masterpiece, the film has its own merits as its own re-telling. These new live action films are not here to replace our memories but show them in the real world instead of animation. I hold that the same magic is equally qualified but with the advancements of technology in filmmaking, the magic that animation could only portray can be seen in real life form.Emma Watson is the perfect Belle, with no other actor coming to mind to replace her, with her lovely appearance and character fuelling and taking lead of her performance, Watson is an absolute pleasure. Dan Stevens apparently taking the role of the Beast but is too layered in CGI and voice adaptors to tell its him, but somehow making perfect sense when his flesh self is seen. Not forgetting the jewel of the story but the living furniture of Lumière (Ewan McGregor) Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Mrs Potts (Emma Thompson), all shinning still amazingly all the household appliances that we'd love to own.Luke Evans steals the show as Gaston , really showing off his self centred, boasting character combined with the humorous match of Josh Glad as LeFou, who's secret is clear but barley as shocking as claimed.What can be said about Beauty and the Beast (2017) is that a it is a very justified and fine reminder of why we love Beauty and the Beast (1991). Not to say that its not good on its own, on the contrary it is a very enjoyable delight with its majestic music sequences that captures the magic perfectly. But its just not the Disney classic.The film has added its own additions and side bits, which unfortunately bring very little to the film and could be removed with no difference but are still perfectly fine anyway. At times I couldn't help but look at the film and think that's it was very set piece-y and not as real as it would like to be. Personally I thought I was watching a theatre play at moments.The Beauty and the Beast song remains as indestructible as ever, but is challenged by Emma Thompson's slightly over sold accent, but does not stir away from the magic. By the end of the film you re-discover the power and love of the story.At the end of the day, Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience that I'm sure will be enjoyed, but just won't match the power of the original, and sometimes too loud in its scenery but none the less an absolute delight. 7.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

This is in fact a once handsome prince (Dan Stevens), transformed into a monster by an enchantress as a punishment for his selfishness, while all his simpering courtiers were turned into household appliances such as candles and clocks. Belle offers to be his prisoner in her father's place. Gradually the grumpy, soppy old Beast falls in love with her and she with him.Plus Points:1)Emma Watson: I can spend almost an entire day watching Emma Watson in that gorgeous yellow gown in the ball dance scene.Aaahh!!! How Lovely She Is! It is her charm which not only help the breakage of curse of the castle but also our busy work minded minds.Emma Watson is a demure, doll-like Belle, almost a figure who has stepped off the top of a music box; she never gives in to extravagant emotion, or retreats into depression, but maintains a kind of even-tempered dignified romantic solitude. .Her charming presence and her lovely voice is enchanting.No other actress would suite Belle like Emma Watson.From today.Emma Watson is not only the clever witch Hermione but also our enchanting Belle.One of her career best roles.....Love you Emma Watson2)VFX: Beauty and the Beast has amazing VFX.I got a great nostalgic feel watching the Great Castle and especially our entertaining talking clock Cogsworth ,candelabra Lumiere,kettle Mrs.Potts and her son Chip,everything is sol lively and lovely.And last but not least our terrifying Beast.He is so charming despite of his beastly look.3)Music: It's the music that makes it particularly special, and appreciating that is entirely the point of the live-action remake. It's hard to imagine a case for this film's existence without the songs – without, say, that five-note ""Tale as Old as Time"" motif,foot tapping Gaston,visual wonder "" Be our Guest"" and many more..Even though they used all the tracks from the original,they still felt lovely.4)Direction: Bill Condon did a marvelous job by bringing the best live screen adaptation of the classic.Bill Condon's direction and Tobias Schliessler's cinematography must be applauded, especially for making this fairy tale enjoyable for people of all ages.5)Art and Costumes: Definitely deserves a nomination for Oscars..Such a lovely settings and costumes..Emma looked gorgeous in the yellow gown in the ballroom scene.6)3D: This has one of the best 3D for a Disney film.It has brilliant pop out effects when the Beast throws a snowball at Belle,Sorry! at audience and when the Chip throws the saucers at the intruders,Sorry! again right at the audience and there are lot of such moments..But disappointed a bit regarding the in screen depth.So,Beauty and the Beast is the perfect live action adaptation of classic with Emma Watson's flawless portrayal of Belle,splendid VFX ,foot tapping music and charming screenplay..A Must watch for allMy rating 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Exquisite Adaptation,"Disney really got one right in this case. The artistry is beautiful, the acting and casting is impeccable, and Disney was able to hit the important social lessons with just the right balance without being heavy-handed. It does the original animated film justice while adding more dimension to the story and further fleshing out the characters, ultimately without changing important details of the original. The music was also handled perfectly, adding new songs with the same flavor as the original while not remixing the original songs into awful parodies of themselves. This is the only film I have ever attended that got two rounds of applause after it ended. It is worth seeing on its own merit, and is also a fun nostalgic walk down memory lane for those of us who were young when the original came out (and the movie knows it, and gives more than a couple subtle nods to this).",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Love is slowly blossoming between Belle and the Beast, but will it be enough to break the curse?All the characters in the story have blended nicely with an amazing cast.

Still, pretty sure Disney doesn't care they got two tickets out of us, but if you read this it is nothing new or different and the inclusion of a so-called gay character is so irrelevant to the story and so ungay that it makes no difference. If you have seen the multiple other Beauty And The Beasts out there (animated or not) you have seen this. Disney must be really hard up for cash.

I Think I'm Obsessed With This Movie...,"To start off, I absolutely loved the original 1991 film and admired Belle as a character ever since I was a young child. But the original did have multiple plot holes such as the age of Prince Adam when the enchantress put the curse on him and his servants. But in this remake this plot hole is fixed by showing the Prince as an adult when the enchantress showed up at his palace and by changing the lyrics in ""Be our guest"" from ""ten years we've been rusting"" to ""to long we've been rusting."" Not to mention the fact that the last rose petal was set to fall on the prince's 21st birthday in the 1991 film. This was changed by simply not giving the final rose petal a known due date.I also believe that Emma Watson made a good Belle because she is the closest thing to a human Belle. She did the role well and didn't seem out of character at any time. Even though she didn't really sound all that close to the animated Belle in her singing parts it's not necessarily a big deal. The rest of the casting in this movie was great as well and the props and sets in the film were grand and magical as well. My favorite performance in this movie was probably Josh Gad as Lefou, he truly brought his character to life and the Gaston song in the bar was just so amazing to watch! It was definitely a magical film for me.So in conclusion, I honestly can't wait till this movie gets on DVD and blu-ray because I will continue to watch it over and over and over again. I highly recommend it to Disney fans, non Disney fans and people who just want to watch a charming movie.Thank you for reading my review!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Through astounding make-up and CGI effects, Steven's Beast is the towering horned majestic lion. His Beast embodies both joy and suffering in his gentle blue eyes. Stevens accomplishes the nearly impossible. He is a handsome man, and his Beast becomes beautiful as he allows us to see his soul and forsaken dreams. Watson is natural beauty with freckles on her nose. Her Belle's innocence discovers the truth in others, be it the Beast or the ghastly Gaston. Watson and Stevens are beautifully sublime.With the largely familiar story-line and great songs by Alan Menken and Hal Ashman of the original 1991 animated movie, Director Bill Condon's recreation is about loss, destiny, and falling in love. His spectacular vision creates the haunting images of the wintry forest and the Beast's austere castle. This is a musical, and Condon wonderfully orchestrates the song and dance. He does homage to ""The Sound of Music"" with Belle singing on the hills of her village.Watson and Stevens make us believe in Belle and Beast's love story. There may be one too many dance numbers or introspective character musical solos. Fortunately, they are not too distracting. Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos invent the poignant back stories of Belle's and the Beast's deceased Mothers humanizing this fairy tale. This is timeless tale of true love and forgiveness.The story opens as the narcissist Prince, played by believable Stevens, callously dismisses the gifted rose from an old woman visiting his castle. This was his test. The old woman reveals herself as the Enchantress, played by stunning Hattie Morahan. She casts a spell upon the Prince transforming him into the Beast and his servants into living furniture. He shall remain the Beast until he can fall in love with someone, who loves him back. The Prince must do so before all the petals on the rose fall; otherwise, the curse is forever.Belle's opening song expresses her uniqueness. She is the independent spirit, who loves books, and has great dreams. They do not include braggart Gaston played by talented Luke Evans, who wants to marry Belle. She tells him, ""I will never marry you."" Belle cares for her watchmaker Father Maurice played by kind Kevin Kline. Belle's Mother died years ago and she was Maurice's love story. He tells Belle of her Mom, ""Your Mother was fearless."" Belle is like her.One night Maurice becomes lost and trespasses the Beast's castle. Beast imprisons him until Belle bravely takes her Father's place. Beast's servants wonder if Belle is the one, who will break the wicked spell?As enemies Belle and the Beast aren't so different. They both love Shakespeare. The Beast reads ""Guinevere and Lancelot"", which Belle labels, ""Still a romance."" He too, is a dreamer who loves books. He shares his vast library with Belle.Belle discovers the servants' loyalty to the Beast. The young prince was very much like his loving Mother. After she died, his Father's cruelty hardened his extraordinary spirit. Belle begins to see his noble wounded heart. The Beast doubts she will end his curse, telling his servants, ""Look at me!"" I know that resolve. He too is falling in love with Belle.Condon's ballroom dance with the Beast and Belle in golden gown is nostalgic, new, and touching. Emma Thompson as the teapot Mrs. Potts beautifully sings the theme, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Beast frees Belle when tragedy arises. She promises to come back. Candelabra Lumiere, voiced by Ewan McGregor, asks Beast about the spell and Belle. He says, ""I let her go."" Mr. Potts says, ""Because he loves her.""The miscalculation of the movie is villain Gaston. He is the arrogant stupid narcissist without nuance. We cheer for Belle and Beast against Gaston, often because nothing redeems him. Belle and Beast emerge as heroes in this conflict. Hearing Beast say to Belle ""You came back.""— is so touching.""Beauty and the Beast"" has a wonderful human quality and spirit. It reminds of the old and recreates as new. Emma Watson is amazing in this ""tale as old as time"". Take a chance on ""Beauty and the Beast"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The real risk was visual,"The Disney's bet about creating the remake of such an epic story was visionary and as it comes, risky. Its just predicable the huge amount of critics from the classic fans. In my opinion the real goal of the production is in visual terms, in fact, the visual effects sometimes are just good enough, the real problem is that good enough isn't enough for the magnitude of this film. Specially in the village, for me its such evident the chrome used that it seems intentional from the director, make it look like a tale, three point over a simple animation. The castle and the unreal characters works, it force you to forget about picky unbelievable details of the village and push you in the whole fantastic and magic story, where we can't resists when we are in front of such a splendorous tale. The perform of Emma Watson its not far from the action range we all already know of her, but lets be clear, what is the big difference between Bella and Hermione, they both are perfect, pretty, intelligent, weirdo girls, the perfect essence for Emma interpretation. Beast its a good Beast, I rescue the visual effects and his look, it is just as good as it must have to be. In other terms, the art, music and story development its satisfactory, I enjoy this film, having clear from it begging the purpose of Disney and that its not a master piece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Watched without preconceived notions,"My daughter's high school just did this musical, and that was the first time I ever saw the story of Beauty & The Beast, in any format. I knew the basic story line, of course, but had never seen any of the movies. From the comments in the other reviews, this version failed to provide the same level of enjoyment of the animated movie. Having only seen a high school production of the story, I actually found this movie very enjoyable, with most of the songs & dialogue the same, and more content that fleshed out the story. I guess if you saw & loved the animated movie, this one may well seem disappointing, but without the preconceived notions, I would think it would be a pleasure to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Hairy Pouter and the Reluctantly Redundant Remake,"Watching Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast as an adult is like running into your best friend from grade school at a bar. They're hammered, decked out in a circa 2001 Avril Lavigne Sk8ter Boi outfit and faux-hawk, but surprise: they work as an insurance claims adjuster, and make awkward, drunken conversation about linoleum. Yep. Hear me out. Heady nostalgia, amusement (both uncomfortable and sincere), but all tampered by a vaguely alienating sense of antiquated tackiness and boredom. This is your old friend, and you'll always love them in spite of... them. But did you really need to run into them again like... this? This is the battle of Beauty and the Beast 2.0: not as beastly as your worst fears would have it, but a far cry from the beauty that once was.'Tale as old as time' doesn't work as well when it's a tale barely older than the average viewer, begetting the invariable 'Too Soon!' griping. Sadly, in this case, the peanut gallery may be justified. It's rare to see a film tiptoeing around its fan following so fearfully, every frame oozing desperation to validate its own existence. From the first notes of the soundtrack, there's an uneasy balance between near shot-for-shot slavishness and defiant new beats. But, for every closed plot hole (so THAT'S why no one in the village noticed the gigantic, deserted castle!), there's awkward, superfluous character exposition (did Belle really need to be saddled with a 'disappeared parent' subplot, a-la Amazing Spider-Man?). The original songs are, naturally, too darn good not to make hearts soar, but they're staged with varying degrees of imagination and vibrancy. New tunes range from cutely forgettable to downright cringe-worthy (let's just say the Beast's solo romantic ballad plays better on Broadway...), while inexcusably lame tweaks to Gaston's legendarily raucous tavern ditty will have you pulling out every last inch of you covered in hair. And so on. More than almost any adaptation, Condon courts an invariable game of constant compare/contrast that he's fated to lose (would you want to go toe-to-toe with the first animated Best Picture nominee?), conjuring an audience commentary of ""Meh, that was better in the original"" to ""Did we really need that?"" Throw in some lurching pacing - how can a film 40 minutes longer than its predecessor feel so much more rushed? - and staid, wooden sensibilities, with only glimmers of the original's whimsy or the playfulness of 2016's Jungle Book, and you've got one squirmy audience.It's a shame, because Condon's fairy tale unearths plenty of magic when it's allowed to breathe. If there's one strain that feels fully fleshed out in live action, it's the poor provincial town's bullying of Belle, seeing her unmarried, innovative intellect as beyond 'odd,' but as a downright ideological threat verging on witchcraft. It's this focal point that lends surprising sincerity and sweetness to her budding romance with her ferocious captor - she connects with him as a fellow outsider, passionate, but fearfully clueless about how to societally integrate. Condon also finds surprising poignancy in the Beast's household workers resigned to living as animated objects as penance for taking no accountability in preventing his warped, cruelly spoiled upbringing. A subtle nature/nurture conversation of a social environment's power to corrupt through passive-aggressive teasing or shameful inactivity? Now that feels like classic Disney!If the prospect of 2017 special effects bringing the magic to life were a selling point, it's still a mixed bag. It's ironic that the film's prologue cautions against gaudy, superficial excess, as Condon's film is almost exhaustingly lavish, but too loud and busy to settle into the painstaking elegance of its predecessor. The surreal twisty, Jean Cocteau decor is pleasingly intricate, but almost perennially muted by murky, grey lighting, while the vaguely creepy anthropomorphic household utensils take considerable acclimatizing to. Even the 'Be Our Guest' showstopper manages the paradox of looking ferociously expensive but oddly unspectacular. Still - Condon does nail The Dance, and it alone is transcendently lovely enough to keep the film afloat, and then some. No, you're twirling around humming the theme. Hmmpff.You want to love Emma Watson's Belle. You really do. But, Hermione hangover aside, she feels distressingly miscast - as sullen and sunken as her wincingly autotuned singing voice, she's too caustic to capture more than dribbles of Belle's warmth, spunkiness, and bubbly braininess. Trading Harry for Hairy, Dan Stevens makes a superb Beast, dubious CGI aside. His Beast is a grumbling hipster, his former effete condescension bleeding into his brooding making his character arc all the more charmingly self-aware. Though far from the size of a barge (no ""biceps to spare"" here, amusingly), Luke Evans swings solidly at Gaston's seismic chauvinism. But, although he hits the musical notes, he's too tentative a scene-chewer, and lacks the thunderous charisma to properly sell the narrative's masterful deconstruction of toxic masculinity (it's no wonder LeFou has to bribe these townspeople to - literally - sing his praises). Speaking of: 10 points to Josh Gad, singlehandedly stealing the show with a pitch-perfect deluge of adorably fawning silliness. While Kevin Kline's softly quirky Maurice is pleasantly winning, his additional screen time adds little to the film. Indeed, most of the comedic and emotional lifting is left to the charming voice cast, and Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, and others all brim with the mountainous charm and silliness you'd hope for.There is beauty within Condon's film, but it's largely enshrouded by oodles of overstuffed visual dazzle and fumbling mimesis that fail to disguise the the film's heart isn't quite there. It's an amiable diversion, but a worthwhile remake? Let's just say time won't be kind to this tale. But let's be honest: it's Beauty and the Beast. Reviews or not, you're probably going to obstinately check it out anyway, muttering ""surely it can't be as bad as all that."" And you know what? Be my guest.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Expensive but not expansive...everything money can buy or manufacture except charm and spirit,"Disney trying to top themselves. This live-action rendering of the studio's 1991 animated version of the oft-told fairy tale is Disney's way of giving family-friendly audiences a 'treat' while raking in big money the easy way: by delivery a presold product, one with name and song value--and built-in approval ratings. At a debutante ball in 18th century France, an old hag casts a spell on the partygoers after she is rebuffed (seems she's an enchantress in disguise, though we have no idea why); the selfish prince of the manor is then turned into a beastly creature, while his attendants are turned into (talking) objects. Her spell will be broken once the prince learns about true love, though this must happen before the last pedal on the enchantress's rose falls... Ideally, this material is timeless and should entertain those who do not know the story and approach it with a fresh perspective. However, while Disney's previous version broke new ground for animated musicals, this dark, lead-footed endeavor never lifts off, remaining flatly earthbound despite the familiar songs and characters. When trying for a little humor, scenarists Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos cannot come up with anything other than dry sarcasm, which doesn't wear well on their princess Belle, played by a miscast Emma Watson. Whether feigning indignation or attempting to register awe, Watson approaches her part with a firm jaw and a righteous tone, as if this were a feminist mock-up; when she asks the Beast if he's joking when he offers his castle to her, she sounds like the captain of a cheerleading squad. The art direction and design of this preconceived blockbuster is fussy and forgettable--no one will come out of this movie saying that it transported them to another time and place--while the unobtrusive supporting cast plays it safe, perhaps so as not to be in competition with their animated counterparts. Somewhere, French filmmaker Jean Cocteau (who helmed the 1946 version, ""La Belle et la Bête"") is smiling, for trendy blockbusters come and go but art remains truly timeless. *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Inferior To The Original In Every Way Or Shape Or Form,"Though there is no denying that the live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animation classic of the same name is gorgeous to look at, thanks to its extravagant production design, radiant camerawork & exquisite costumes, the film still fails to emulate the dazzling quality & magical flair of the original, and is also unable to transport us to its enchanting world.Directed by Bill Condon, this latest adaptation follows the original faithfully yet never for once manages to capture the beauty & simplicity of its story. Bloated, overlong & ruined by superficiality in nearly every aspect, this visually arresting yet narratively hollow remake brings nothing new to the table. And apart from the nostalgic connection, it's got nothing going for it.The musical numbers don't have the same effect in the live-action scenario, the extra minutes add nothing to the experience, its eye-candy moments of spectacle are missing the charm required to deliver the desired result, and the supporting characters are poorly sketched. Emma Watson is surprisingly amongst the few positives about this film and her chemistry with Dan Stevens has a certain warmth to it as well.On an overall scale, Beauty and the Beast is inferior to the 1991 musical romance fantasy in every way or shape or form but Condon's reiteration has an authentic touch & sweet vibe to it that prevents it from being a total disaster. However, the film still fails to offer a valid reason for its existence, just like every other Disney's live-action remake of their beloved classics. It might appease the newcomers but won't garner a similar reception from most die-hard fans of the original masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"An eloquent, classic romance renewed","26 years after the classic Disney film was released, Bill Condon directs Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.This film was absolutely stunning. I sat and watched my childhood on screen with real people for the first time in my life, and I am not ashamed to admit I shed a tear once or twice. I grew up watching Emma Watson as Hermoine, so seeing her on screen as my all time favourite Disney Princess was highly emotional.The cinematography in this took my breath away. Every frame of this film was stunning. The cinematography was beautifully done. The costume designs were so expertly done, they all looked like they were direct from the animated film. The casting was done so stupendously it was like the original animations had just stepped out of the film and began waltzing across the screen.The only two qualms I had wereIt seemed to take Emma Watson a while to warm up to singing. It was very rough in the first song of the film, and then she seemed to get better as it went along.The pacing of the film seemed quite rushed. I understand they were pretty much copying the original animation, but I feel like it could have been paced out just that little bit better. I felt a little out of breath watching it, whizzing from one point to another.Those qualms aside, this still took my breath away. It definitely deserves the hype it got. This was a wonderful retelling of such a classic tale. I hope that this generation of children may enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the original growing up. They deserve a movie like this, full of love, hope and romance. And of course, the age old moral, don't judge a book by it's cover.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Pure Magic- wonderful movie,"This movie is pure magic. Cast, production designs, direction, acting and cinematography is on point.This live action makes you believe that fairy tales can be real. It stays true to original and builds on it. It is much more layered and sophisticated. However,i have to agree some things feel extra in this version. New songs are really good but are not better than original ones.Emma Watson proves herself to be a live action Disney princess.The transformation is complete.She is a wonderful heroine and role model for everyone.She gives this role everything she has. I have never seen her doing this great before.Her performance is absolutely perfect. This should be a career defining role for her. Her singing was good and much less auto-tuned. Acting wise, she was a solid choice. Overall, the CGI on objects was great. All voice actors have done wonderful job. Kevin Kline is such a gift to this film. He has a tiny little song which i think he nails. THE bond between belle and her father is just loving and charming. The only drawback is that the beast looks unfinished and fake at times but Dan Stevens has done a wonderful job. His song 'Evermore'' is great and very emotional. The ballroom scene is spectacular. The transformation scene is well handled . As for LeFou, it was mistake for Disney to make a big deal about him being their first ever gay character because it is barely acknowledged in the film. There are two gay moments in the movie which are barely noticeable and are just for laughs, neither one involves Gaston. This movie just acknowledges that LGBT people exist and leFou happens to be one of them. Nothing more than this. Luke Evans as Gaston has done an incredible job and he is a lot more evil in this version. Beauty and the beast is a perfect movie and maintains the charm of original animated movie. It is really sad that some people are trying to assassinate this wonderful movie. Everybody should go and see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it",This is the Bill Condon adaptation of the Disney animated classic from 1991. Let me repeat that this is a live action adaption OF A CLASSIC! I have read many reviews complaining about its lack of originality but im here to say that why would we want to change a story that is so dear to many a heart. This movie is a fantastic viewing for children and adult alike. though i recognize that it is not perfect.The acting roles were also done masterfully but with some questions in my humble opinion. i thought everyone except emma watson as belle fit perfectly. ESPECIALLY GASTON! Luke evans stole the show for me. a big surprise was josh gad as lefou because it was brilliant. josh gad did a great job. all voice acting was superb and made it grand to be a guest for their show.this movie holds dear to the story while also adding depth to pretty much all the characters and even surprisingly giving depth to LeFou. Some songs have been added which definitely did add to the story beautifully. This movie feels very much like a musical due to the increase of songs within the movie so it does feel like they sing way more then in the animated.This movie was a very satisfying cinematic experience with breath taking visuals from the beast to the castle and everything in between. sets were absolutely gorgeous and every shot of this movie is a beautiful master piece. and equally as beautiful is the heart that is added through background stories mainly of beast and learning more about belles mother which we learn very little about in the animated.overall this movie was an awesome viewing for me being a whole life fan of the animated classic and i feel this only made it even better by adding more to love that fits so perfectly. it is a beautiful viewing so go see it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Go if you want to relive your childhood,"I finally had to change to go back to my childhood with this one.Many complain the CGI doesn't look realistic. Well how much more realistic do you want a teacup to look?I avoided spoilers these last weeks, besides Evans and Watson I did not know who else was playing and what a surprise I got. Recently went to see T2 Trainspotting where McGregor was amazing. So seeing him in this one weee hoo. McGregor with a French accent does not disappoint one bit.Still don't get why it was banned in some parts of the world because of the gay moments. Gad stole the show on so many occasions and made the character so likable.I for one loved the movie. I felt an emotional connection with the story. It may have been because of it being my first animated movie when I was a kid, it may have been the great acting or the 3D experience.The thing is, I enjoyed it and I definitely recommend it to all those that want to relive a little bit their childhood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Nicely done!,"There are differences in this version from the cartoon, however, I thought the movie was nicely done! Singing was great - left me with chills (in a good way).

Perfect through and through,"I absolutely loved it! Starting from the perfect casting to the songs (old and new).Emma Watson was perfect for the part of Belle, I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the part justice. She brought a grace to Belle's movements and character that reminded me of old Hollywood (Julie Andrews, Audrey Hepburn). Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou were pure perfection as well. I also found that Dan Stevens brought a lot of humanity and humor to the Beast and by the end of the movie I could see why she fell in love with him. I always found the cartoon was a bit rushed in this respect. It felt like they met and the next day they confessed their love and The End. The movie fixed this as well as several other plot holes that the original cartoon had in my opinion. The movie, probably benefiting from being longer than the cartoon, had a much better pace and thus could flesh out the characters more fully.During ""Be our guest"" I realized that I was smiling from ear to ear and I did not find it overstuffed at all. Others mentioned that the new songs were not catchy like the old ones. I actually left the cinema humming Days in the sun and Evermore. I got the soundtrack and the second I got home and these two songs are practically on a loop since then.The only thing I did not like was one of the 3D effects. I saw the movie twice in IMAX 3D and the time they pan up to ceiling of Belle's bedroom with all the gold leaves, that scene was completely blurry and I was forced to look away. Other than that the 3D effects were better than expected. It was probably the first time during a 3D movie where I flinched when seeing something coming towards me. Marvel movies never managed to get me :)I also loved the changes they made to Belle's costumes. The small touches they added here and there were very notable and just perfect.All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone and I would even pay to watch it for a 3rd, 4th, 5th time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Compared to the original it's awful but it's entertaining nonetheless; Would Recommend,"Directed by Bill CondonStarring Emma Watson, Dan Stevens and Luke EvansPlot Overview: ​After her father is kidnapped and held hostage in a mysterious castle, Belle(Emma Watson) takes his place but soon begins falling for her captor... a beast(Dan Stevens)!I get the hate for this movie. Nothing exceeds the original and the original will be marked as an all time classic. If you compare both these movies side by side, this movie will suck, I promise you that. Despite that, this movie is still entertaining. Flawed? Yes. Outright awful? No. It has its flaws, nearly every movie does, but that doesn't take away from some of the good in this movie. If you haven't seen the original(I recommend you do) I imagine you'll enjoy this movie for the most part. If you have seen the original and are going to constantly compare this movie to that, then you won't enjoy this movie. Overall, I will say this movie is worth watching, and I imagine most audiences(especially children) will really enjoy this movie. Also, if you prevent your child/refuse to see this movie because of the alleged Le Foue gay controversy then you have nothing to worry about. They gloss over it is seconds and it won't bother you at all.The story is a 'tale as old as time' but that doesn't make it any less magical, exciting and enjoyable. It's pretty much the story of the original with a few tweaks here and there so if you've seen the original, you'll know the story and won't be surprised(much) but if you haven't then you'll get to experience a wonderful story for the first time in live action. Either way, it's a good story.I will say that most of the casting in this movie is absolutely flawless. Emma Watson was fine as Belle but she isn't the best singer and when she is, it's clearly been heavily edited. They explore Belle's character more in this version which I will say was pretty nice and a welcome inclusion. Dan Stevens was great as the Beast but I do feel like he could have put more care into some of his scenes and not rushed things. There were many scenes that should have had greater meaning and effect but didn't, and that was down partly to Steven's portrayal but mostly down to Condon's direction. I also didn't like the arc of the Beast and though it was primarily just a straight line with no curves or edges. Luke Evans was just fantastic as Gaston and plays the part to perfection. He made the role his own and was easily one of the best parts of this movie. Gaston is also just a really great villain. He's awesome. You can't mention Gaston without his buddy Le Foue(played wonderfully by Josh Gad) who has had some tweaks to his character and arc(some of which stupidly garnered controversy) all of which I like and am happy Disney went with. Both Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen were great as Lumiere and Cogsworth respectively and both their characters stood out for me. Kevin Kline was also really good as Maurice and the relationship between him and Belle was explored more and was another welcome improvement.On a technical standpoint, this movie is absolutely gorgeous and looks amazing. The visual effects were all awesome, even if I would have done the Beast a tad differently. Both the costume and set design were all really good and looked nice with the time period. The cinematography was also amazing.While this movie made some minor changes, it didn't add/remove/alter enough for me to say a sequel was needed or warranted. It was reasonably funny but some of the jokes were clearly aimed at the lowest possible denominator. It did need to reintroduce this classic tale to children of this age but some of the kids in my audience were crying and even I was pretty shocked by how graphic some scenes were(as far as making the audience scared goes) and scare factor of some scenes. The action was amazing though and it didn't even need to be that great.They do carry over much of the music from the original(while adding new songs) but none of them are done as well as in the original and none of them were performed to a spectacular degree.In conclusion, if you can ignore the existence of the original you will most likely enjoy this movie. The acting is great, the story is great, the visuals are gorgeous but it does lack some of the charm and sense of wonder that the original did posses. Despite this, I can say I recommend this movie as long as you can forget the existence of the 1991 Classic.7/10Would Recommend",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A very pleasant experience,"If you loved the original animated film or if you love the Broadway production, then I think you'll end up enjoying this production as well. One thing I really liked is that this film provided some more backstory on the curse and filled in some spots the original never made clear. The cast is also very good and they fit their roles well. The singing is also good. Emma's voice isn't as strong as the others but it was nice anyway. And of course the costumes were beautiful (although not as outstanding as Cinderella was). But the production design was gorgeous and would be a shame if it didn't get an academy award nomination next year.With a couple of minor changes, it does pretty much follow the route as the animated movie practically beat for beat. Although one change I thought was kind of unnecessary/silly was making the Belle the inventor. Its not like it added anything to the story or having Maurice be an artist add anything different but they also barely even focused on it. They show her make one thing and its never referenced again. Not even in Beast's castle is she seen working on something. At least in the animated movie, it served a purpose by making the townspeople already think of Maurice as kind of kooky (and therefore unbelievable when he comes back to tell them of the beast). Plus, one of his inventions actually helps Belle escape from the basement. Here, it literally doesn't add anything.I saw it in a theater with a bunch of kids present and I heard giggles of delight from them, so I think it will be a hit with them. Overall, I enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A definite score of 10, 3D is a must!","I found many of the top reviews too cruel on their critics when the film was just released on its first day. Having read them before seeing the film with my own eyes, I was truly nervous and worried that it will be a disappointment, yet despite all that I still went and it turned out to be most fulfilling and satisfying. Now I am back from the cinema giving it a 10, well it is not perfect, but it deserve a little compliment and you can not deny some of the beautiful replicate on the old scenes which clearly shows the efforts that the team has put in, and I am not very picky when it comes to actors, I found them singing quite well too considering they are not professionals.

I could not help but held a big smile on my face for over half of the time, it is like a dream come true, with all the most lovely songs and scenes and childhood memories. I was less than 10 years old when I first saw the cartoon version and now at age of 30, I could be in the cinema with my husband, holding his hand and watch it together, it was such a wonderful moment, I want to give a big THANKS to Disney for making all these happen, thank you for all your stories and songs that makes the world with more love and brightness.

It actually impressed me,"I'll start by saying this. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of my favorite Disney movies ever. Probably only second to Mulan. Of course, I always enjoy the singing, but what I enjoyed most were the characters, especially Cogsworth, Lumiere, and Mrs. Potts. I loved the dynamic between them and the Beast. And concerning the Beast, I was always impressed with Robbie Benson's ability to go from gruff and feral to sweet and gentle.When I went to see this movie, I was cautiously optimistic; I didn't want one of my favorite childhood movies to be ruined. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be. It will never be the 1991 movie, but I still managed to get a lot out of the film.My biggest qualm with this movie was Emma Watson. I love her to death, but I can't say that I enjoyed her singing too much. I was perfectly happy with the acting, but I think it would've been better to dub the singing parts with an actual singer or to have just cast a better singer. The quality of her singing versus that of others was starkly apparent. Other than that, I loved seeing her again.The movie's also missing that back-and-forth banter between Lumiere and Cogsworth. There's some of it in there, but it's not nearly as funny as it was in the animated movie.Now for the good stuff. I'm so glad that they brought Alan Menken back because he did it again! Even 20 years later, he manages to make such terrific songs. It's amazing! I'm pretty fond of the old songs, but the new ones are simply to good to ignore.A lot of the stuff from the 1991 movie is in this one. There are also some new scenes that sort of give you a little more insight into certain characters. Lefou is certainly more respectable here than he is in the animated movie and seems much less deserving of his name.I thought the CGI was pretty good with maybe the possible exception of the Beast. He didn't look horrible, but I wish he'd looked different. Certain features of his looked odd at times. Like his legs. They looked a little too big to me. But the CGI in ""Be Our Guest""? That was amazing! A very entertaining show!I'm glad that I saw this. I was having doubts, even while sitting in the movie theater, but I was very happy with what I'd seen when I left.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It was good for the audience this  movie is meant to be...,"Beauty and the Beast is, was and always will be my favorite off all Disney movies (concidering the princess theme). This movie was good, not perfect but good. I read many posts about how bad this movie was but lets not forget that a movie is not only its actors but all in union. Acting 7.5 ,Music 9.5 ,Singing 7, Directing 7, Costumes 10+, Sets 10+ My final verdict is 7.I liked it but yet just in moments I felt that I was going to be thrilled like the original one I did not, but this movie was not the original one. It was a remake,a remake to dazzle the new generations not us, it was created to have as a main audience children not 25+ people and it was good enough to do that.Also do not forget that in this one Disney decided to give a proper representation of the time line that these event happened and to say the truth that was not one of the most beautiful eras considering clothing,hair etc. also the put information about to many questions had been left unanswered all these years(something new of the mostof us and unfamiliar). Emma's singing and the era that the story took place were the thinks that thought me off. In general the movie is perfect remake of the original considering the story and the musical essence of the music.It was good movie better than any other I have seen the last hole year.I would like to see this over and over again than seeing Batman Vs Superman or Suicide Squade again.....

Incredible!,"Bill Condon's adaptation of Beauty and the Beast is nothing short of amazing. Being a fan of the original Beauty and The Beast I was a little nervous going in to the cinema. I really wanted them to get the film right, and they did! The score is genius, the costume design is superb, the production design is great, the direction is amazing. This film was so visually stunning and I couldn't of hoped for better!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Satisfying Remake,"Disney's highly anticipated remake of the 'tale as old as time' has arrived, and while not perfect, it certainly packs in cutting-edge special effects and extravagance that can please audiences of all ages. The film's plot is very similar to that of the original version. However, the CGI effects are often very realistic. There are, however, some exceptions, as the character designs of the Beast and some of the 'object' characters (such as Cogsworth and Lumiere) could have been done better. That said, from its lavish set pieces to realistic-looking CGI wolves, the film overall is visually enthralling.The music in the film is excellent, and the scenes where such music can be found are choreographed perfectly. ""Be Our Guest"" and the climatic action scene where Gaston's mob storms the castle are easily the two best scenes in the movie. The performances are slightly hit-or-miss, however. The acting could have been slightly improved, as Emma Watson gives a solid but unspectacular performance as Belle. Still, however, Disney does a very good job overall of adapting this story for modern audiences using live action and delivers an entertaining end result. Recommended. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Boring...,"I've seen the original more times than I can count so I was very excited when I heard about a live action version that sticks to the original movie. While they did stick to the original for a good portion, they changed many of the most iconic scenes and not in a good way. For example, they cut out the scene where Belle's father first encounters the beast by the fireplace, which is my son's favorite, and replaced it with something far less interesting. They also managed, and I don't know how, to ruin the music. All of the songs are slowed down so much that it's hard to care about them and they're lacking the booming vocals that made the originals so good. They also added a lot of unnecessary dialogue which makes for a much slower pace. Overall all this movie just lacks the character of the original. We were so bored that we actually left about half way through.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney simply cannot resist mucking about,"The first thing you need to understand is that, according to some scholars, every story is at its essence a love story. Even, for example, some the male-oriented actioners can be perceived as a tale where the hero is in love ... with himself.Second, the original Belle Et La Bete is an 18th century French tale with antecedents, they say, in older literature going back 4000 years. (Wikipedia) Since it is a French tale, it is only fitting that the French were the first to film it, in the 1940s, with Cocteau at the helm. One of my all time favorite films.Now to the Disney machine. Disney has done this story before. Disney, being Disney, simply cannot resist the temptation to set the story to music. Seriously. If there is a third world war, and 100 years from now, Disney does a film about that, it will no doubt be a musical too.The story was changed significantly. Add the musical interludes and you are really dealing with a variant or ""fork"" of the tale but not the real one. It is significant that even the critics who love the film cannot help but notice that chunks of it are ""awkward."" Watson is a delight. Can never tire of seeing her light up the screen. The movie however is deeply flawed, and odd.See the French original. Or see the Kristin Kruek TV knockoff. Both are, overall, better and more focused productions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It's not New York Metropolitan Opera vocal quality.  AND I DON'T CARE!,"DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Emma Watson. I am predisposed to love anything she does because she does it.DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Alan Menken. If he writes the music, I'm there.DISCLAIMER: I love loving things. I hate hating things. It makes no sense to me to equate intelligence with the ability to find fault. Sometimes I see what they were going for and applaud the effort. Sometimes I see what they were going for and weep at how badly they missed it.That being said, I LOVED the new ""Beauty and the Beast"". I was wiping tears from the corners of my eyes frequently for sheer beauty.The original cartoon I loved. Even though there were holes in the plot you could drive a battleship through. They fixed all the plot holes! Go see it, if only for that!Okay, okay, Emma Watson isn't a classically-trained coloratura soprano. She's no Paige O'Hara vocally. For that matter, I missed Jerry Orbach when Ewen MacGregor was singing ""Be Our Guest"" and I missed Angela Lansbury in Emma Thompson's ""Beauty and the Beast"". I understand Orbach is no longer available and the supernatural Ms. Lansbury, in her 90's, probably couldn't do the song the justice she did a quarter of a century ago. Guess what. I DON'T CARE! They did justice to the songs. They didn't do brilliance with the songs. I don't care.Emma has a divinely expressive face that carries her emotions perfectly for the big screen. Her Belle was glorious.Is it possible to miscast Kevin Kline? He is brilliant. And his Maurice is delicious. His singing, still not New York Metropolitan Opera quality, carries the song.Luke Evans does just the lightest touch of camp in playing Gaston. I reveled in it! Once again, not the vocal quality of Richard White, and I did miss that amazing bass. But the baritone/tenor carried it off.Now, let's get to Josh Gad.Bill Condon did the lightest hat tip to the Gender Community with Josh Gad's Lefou. If you blink, you might miss it. If you're terrified your little ones might get gay cooties on them and grow up ""perverts"", by all means skip this show. But you'd probably better not let them watch any television, listen to any music, or attend any movies, because the portrayals there are not teensy hat-tips. They are full-body bows and curtsies.Now for the real star of the show: The music.Alan Menken is a living miracle. He does things with a musical score and songs that blow me through the wall! All the new songs are brilliant! Beast's song of pain over Belle is stunning. THOSE vocals are magnificent! I've always loved the opening number of ""Beauty and the Beast"". It is full-blown grand opera, and makes me wish Alan Menken would write a sure-enough opera.This movie dazzled me visually, musically, and emotionally.

"Good overall, but something seems a bit off","As far as Disney's live action remakes go, I'd honestly have to say that this is my favourite one so far. I went into the cinema with pretty low expectations - I remembered how the 2015 remake of Cinderella had played out: it was an okay film, but it was just okay, and it didn't really do the original animated film much justice. That was what I was expecting with Beauty and the Beast.It turned out a lot better than I thought it would. I really like how the Beast's character has been built up more in this version - they actually gave him a backstory, which was something that I had always felt was lacking in the original animated film. And a few plot holes from the original story are filled (i.e. how come nobody knows that there's a huge castle in the forest next to the village, why does nobody remember the prince, etc.). And the idea that the servants in the castle could have had family in the village was something that honestly never even occurred to me whilst watching the animated film. In the original movie, the Beast's castle just seems so displaced from the rest of the village, it is honestly very difficult to remember that it isn't that far away from Belle's hometown. That definitely is not the case in the remake.However, something just seemed very... off. And when I got halfway through the movie, I realized what it was. I didn't feel like I was watching Emma Watson playing Belle. I felt like I was watching Emma Watson playing Emma Watson.Perhaps it is just because I am so used to seeing her in roles similar to Hermione in Harry Potter, but even her performance in Noah reminded me of her portrayal of Belle here...I would still recommend seeing this if you are a fan of the animated movie, or even if you're just a fan of the fairy-tale (or just fairy-tales in general). It is a very visually beautiful movie. But if you're expecting something that is completely true to the original film, you may leave disappointed. A few things have been added in - the basic plot stays the same, but it is not a perfect copy of the animated movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not one to look back,"Well I absolutely loved this movie. Couldn't give a care that an animated 1991 version was much better!? Animated - not my thing - and truly why would you even make a comparison between a cartoon and a CGI, human acted movie, nonsensical to me. I am far from a Disney fan as all the singing generally drives me crazy but in this case I just sat back and enjoyed it all. I took my 8 year old who enjoyed it immensely. She found the Beast scary, hid her face a few times from the action and swooned over the love story. So in frankness I'm unsure what all the negativity from the adults is all about - oh wait... Yep it's a movie for kids. All very simple, very pure and true to form but shockingly without the animation. I think you could see that was the case from the previews and the posters and the casting. But well, it appears people went hoping Disney would re-write an animated movie and recreate the whole premise to just appease grownups. Had they done that of course - the reviews would be even worse I can guarantee it. If you loved the original story and enjoyed the characters and found the love story and the message of being bigger and better at being a human being .. then you'll love this movie too. It's very beautiful, Emma was fine, Dan was fine ... every one was fine and it was 2 hours of pure entertainment. All I hope for in a movie. I think Disney out did themselves and I HIGHLY recommend it as a modern day reprisal of a much loved animated film without trying to recreate perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Not a beauty nor a beast, but presentable Disney offering","OK why make another Beauty & The Beast?I thought the older cartoon was pretty good and there are other film versions. The reason for this remake of course, is to make more money from a sure bet.With real actors, I thought maybe, it could have been made more appealing to adults.It does play safe to the beloved fairytale and to politically correct doctrine, include everybody, offend nobody.There is nothing bad about this film as such. They certainly did not botch their version of a classic story.Minor criticisms (I am just knitpicking here)Emma Watson was unremarkable as Belle.I found the bursting into song every 5 minutes a little wearisome, and I know this is heresy, but a little more popular music.Maurice (Belles father) was sliding off a snowy rocky outcrop about to be eaten by wolves then suddenly he's on his horse galloping away.All in all, it is, what it says on the tin.""Beauty & The Beast By Disney""I doubt it will be a 'classic' I had a nagging feeling it just 'missed the boat' for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Missed Opportunity,"Come on Disney: what were you thinking?! You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).Now the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&Ms.Emma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face (""now act SURPRISED"" - ""now show us a sense of WONDER"" - ""now look SAD""). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.But all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI ""beast"" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?I'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

How did they NOT make this the best film ever?,"Loved the animated version; in fact, would be in my top 25. Loved the stage version.But then this live-action film happened. Disappointing. Cloogy. Forced emotion in parts. I'm supposed to accept the love blossoming between these two... and I did in the animated version; couldn't in this one... but to be honest, it choked me up anyway (though the tears started even prior to the moments, so I'm thinking I was working from the remembered story.)But perhaps the most damaging... besides the forced plot points and emotion, was the horrific computer graphics on the Beast. With all the great graphics in other films, why did they settle for this?Agree with others, should have been another director, perhaps other screenwriters (or just lift the animated version verbatim). It's not a waste of time... so I give it a 7. But watch the animated version if you have a choice. I'll need to do just that to get back my fondness for the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Of course, I have to check out the newcomer edition, and it did not disappoint me. Many of these movies are afraid of destroying the original, but this one is really good. The prince has become a monster without love because of some things, but in fact he has love in his heart, but just needs someone to warm him.

Enjoyable but not worth memorable,"This movie struggles to stand out. The tale of Beauty and the Beast is a timeless classic, with the original animated film being a must-watch that captures hearts effortlessly. In this live-action adaptation, a few new songs and real-life actors are added, but it doesn't offer anything groundbreaking. However, it remains an enjoyable and charming experience, with good music.While the film is entertaining, it doesn't leave a lasting impression and is likely to be forgotten. The animated version will always be the preferred choice, but if you're looking for something fresh and delightful, this movie is worth a rental. Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle is somewhat lackluster, coming off as more aloof than endearing. Despite this, most characters look fantastic, and the overall design of the film is beautiful.

Dan Stevens was a bit of a weird cast for the Beast but actually managed fine. Emma Watson did a great job as Belle and the voice actors too.

An Honest Review,"If it were in a theater rather than a cinema, it would have been great.But the fact is we saw this before when it was called Beauty & the Beast.The songs we all heard before. Rather than an animated background you have a computer animated background but we have still seen it before.We sit down and pay to watch a movie we already saw turn live action and follow the same plot, the same game, as the movie we fell in love with oh so many years ago.We are living in an era for that, but we still want it to change at least a little.Like all remakes it is dull and boring and utterly mindless. Like all remakes it makes changes that are unnecessary and irritating and in some cases, fairly insulting to the fans of the original: Belle, not her father, is the eccentric town inventor and that would, maybe, work if he wasn't supposed get locked up for being, well, the eccentric town inventor with a story about a Beast.Take away the establishment of one character that is sort of necessary to the plot and give it to another where it is less important to advance the story and do it only because, well, it's a remake, you have to find at least one way to really insult the fans...And changes like this are the only way to do it because, otherwise, you have the EXACT same movie you saw before with little changes made to really just drag the monotony out as much as you can.I hate remakes, but the fact that it IS THE SAME MOVIE just makes it so much more monotonous to watch than your average remake.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Believe it or not, they improved upon the Oscar winning Score (but you have to watch through the credits!)","I'm not really sure why Disney is remaking all their animation classics in live action form but ... well actually, it's pretty obvious. And Beauty and the Beast (2017) has performed so well at the box office that I'm sure the studio isn't about to put a stop to the money train.What's nice is the fact that they're adding some new scenes, more detail of characters' backgrounds and motivations, or even altering their stories slightly. While these changes don't necessarily improve on the originals, at least they give moviegoers something besides a rehash that might bore (adults in particular). Yes, some of these alterations are predictable, and even unfortunate, given the politically correct nature of our society, but others are welcome, especially those that extend the story - this one runs 45 minutes longer than the 1991 Academy Award Best Picture nominee - in ways that entertain old and new audiences alike.Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens (heavily costumed and partially CGI-animated) play the titled leads, while Luke Evans plays the boorish Gaston, Josh Gad his sidekick LeFou, and Kevin Kline is Belle's eccentric father Maurice. Ewan McGregor plays Lumiere, Ian McKellen Cogsworth and Emma Thompson is Mrs. Potts; Stanley Tucci also plays a role ... and all are marvelous. It would be nearly impossible to top the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence from the animated original, but the filmmakers certainly did try.No need for me to retell one of the most cinematically realized classic stories of all time (perhaps only Cinderella exceeds it?), but I feel it's important to note that the Soundtrack is excellent and PLEASE DON'T leave or turn it off too soon as two of its best songs are featured while the special closing credits roll - one by Celine Dion and the other by Josh Groban.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It grew on me :) A lot better than I expected,The first time I watched it I was pretty bored but then the next day I had the urge to watch it again and I liked it way more the second time.I've really liked Emma Watson ever since the Harry Potter movies and in this movie she wasn't just beautiful but she actually added depth to the character of Belle. The CGI for the beast usually looked really good but at times it looked very average. The relationship between Belle and The Beast was a lot more believable than the original animated movie.

To sum up, I kind of liked it as a movie on its own, but I didn't like it as a remake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Shameless money grab that is sub-par at best,"Let me preface by saying that while the '91 cartoon is my favorite movie of all time, I am not a strict cartoon purist, as the Broadway musical of BATB is also one of my favorites and there are other takes on the fairy tale that I really enjoy as well. But, when you are doing the songs from the cartoon and even replicate some scenes shot-for-shot, I expect that the characters should feel familiar and the quality of the production should live up to its predecessor. Unfortunately, this 2017 version falls dreadfully short.CASTING - The biggest blunder is Emma Watson in the lead role. This is not to disparage her as an actress in general, but she is not right for this. Her Belle lacks grace, enthusiasm, warmth and sincerity. She seems bored, and while it sounds like she could have quite a sweet voice with further training, it is evident she does not have that skill set yet. In the other title role, Dan Stevens' Beast is all CGI and you never forget it. They've also edited his voice to make him sound more ""beastly"", which makes his solo awkward to listen to. One has to wonder why they didn't just cast someone with a deeper voice then? The character also seems a more like a grumpy old man than a tortured soul in a beastly body. Why did Disney cast ""Hollywood names"" instead of people who were best for the role? It's not like there was ever a doubt this would be a box office smash anyway given the beloved source material. I also never believed for a moment the relationship between any of the characters with the exception of the playful rivalry/camaraderie between Cogsworth & Lumiere.CGI AND MUSIC - For a ""live action"" version, it certainly feels more stilted and unreal. The CGI in general looks fake, and the enchanted objects are creepy. There are new songs but they are mostly dull. Now, I think Alan Menken is a musical genius, so perhaps it had something to do with having to write songs for non- singers. The Beast's new song is the best of the bunch, but the emotion doesn't seem appropriate for the scene. The reused songs have new arrangements & new lyrics, but with the exception of The Mob Song, the changes are distracting and feel oddly paced.STORYLINE - In truth, the whole movie is oddly paced. Things are dragged out that don't need to be, and other things zoom by that should have been fleshed out. They give backstories, but odd ones at odd times in odd ways. Minor spoilers: For example, Gaston is a soldier who saved the village and that's why everyone loves him. He likes Belle for her looks but also her dignity.By giving the villagers a very good reason to like him, he is no longer a foil for the Beast. Gaston is supposed to be handsome, strong and charismatic and people equate that with being good. The Beast is ugly so they automatically think he's bad. Is not the moral that it's actually what's on the inside that counts? It seems they have forgotten the point. Even Belle makes a joke in poor taste at the end which undermines the message. Furthermore, significant details are altered which result in the Beast not changing & the leads basically falling in love by accident, and (SPOILER) the enchanted rose has no real significance in the end (END SPOILER)I could say more, but I think you get the picture.

It disturbed me to the point where I felt like making an account and writing my own review, in hopes that perhaps people won't turn away from this great movie after reading all these hate-filled essays.To start, I do want to point out that I agree with the criticism in one aspect: Emma Watson. She's certainly not Belle, or a good actress overall for that matter. This is coming from someone who's obsessed with the Harry Potter movies, and even then I couldn't tolerate her. She's the same character in all her movies, and that is Emma Watson. I saw someone comparing her to Kristen Stewart in terms of bland acting and just being bland in general, and I second that.That being said, she didn't ""ruin"" the movie. In fact, I saw past all of that because there were many other things to focus on and enjoy. Beautiful scenes and decoration, great acting (Josh Gad, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline), the enchanted objects are much funnier and more appealing than the original movie's, there's chemistry between the actors, good directing, and most importantly: I love the added songs and character insights. We get to know more about the characters and many questions that were left unanswered in the original are answered in this one.I wasn't even a big fan of the original and I only went to see it because I love Disney, and I was in for a delightful surprise.The CGI isn't on the Jungle Book level per se, but it's not bad. The only thing that might tick you is the beast's face animation but not to the point of NOT getting over it as the movie goes.Most importantly: this is still a children's movie. You can't critique it as if you went in there expecting the depth of the Godfather. From what I can tell, it served its target audience more than fine.""This is a copy of the original movie!"" If it wasn't, there would be criticism over it NOT sticking to the original story. ""The story is about a wealthy beast who only gets love because he's wealthy!"" OK, why weren't these complaints present in the original movie? Not to mention that this is a *fairy tale*. ""Too much singing!"" There are movies where there are barely any spoken words (ie Les Miserables, Evita) but this isn't one of them, it has a reasonable amount of songs for a musical. ""The original didn't even need a remake!"" And that's your opinion, but a lot of people do want live-action remakes, hence why they're made. A remake can never do any harm to the original movie, in fact if a remake is bad it will only make you like the original movie even better.I gave this movie 10 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hell, I can't wait for more live- action remakes!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Could've Been Done Better,"Compared to The Lion King remaster, this was a masterpiece. However, the CGI and Acting were mediocre.

Decide for yourself,"I can't help but wonder if there are ulterior motives behind some of the negative reviews here.

Luke Evans was particularly excellent as Gaston. The sets, the costumes, the music....it all fit perfectly.We didn't go to this movie expecting deep character development, intense dialogue and/or state of the art CGI effects.

"Takes your right back to your childhood, but...","This movie was absolutely beautiful made! The songs and the costumes were stunning and sent you right back to your childhood. In all honestly, the only thing there drew the movie back was the casting of the prince. When he transformed into a human again the whole theater burst out laughing including the person I came with. Because well you expect a handsome kind faced prince, but that was left with an empty feeling of ""eh?"". Not that the actor was extremely ugly, but he had a very normal appearance, that he was a random guy from the grocery store, just the everyday guy. Which isn't bad ofc, just very unexpected. I loved how Disney incorporated homosexual aspects in this movie with LeFou and another male. Kudos to Disney for doing that, it was very enjoyable also the fact that there are equal whites and blacks in the movie, was great to see and couldn't help smiling when I saw it :)But definitely go see it anyways, just be prepared that you won't be wowed by the prince, apart from that this movie takes you right back to your childhood and is worth going seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The candle and the clock look awfully hyper realistic.This movie was a copy and paste, except with irritatingly bad cgi. The design of the beast isn't even accurate whatsoever. The furniture and objects in the movie have no character and look so dull with no personality.It all just feels so mechanical. Disney has completely butchered the classics at this point.

Tips the scales in both the right and the wrong,"To be honest, I never found the animated movie as spellbinding as everyone else. I never owned the VHS as a child. I really liked it and there were a lot of great things about it, but I preferred other films.This live action version manages to correct a few mistakes, but also leave out some things and add new ones that weren't necessary.The set is beautiful, and the song and dance routines are very energetic. The characters are rendered more realistic and three dimensional with extra back stories.What I thought was the best change was the character of LeFou. He is not really a villain in this film, more like a very sweet guy who happens to worship and be in love with a very bad man (Gaston).The same could not be said of the Beast. I kind of prefer it in the animated version. There were things left out and things added that were both good and bad, but ultimately didn't leave much of an impact as I thought.Another thing I thought was missing was the hilarious banter between Lumière and Cogsworth (""En Garde you overgrown pocket watch!"").Overall, it's a sweet and beautiful tribute and expansion to the cartoon version, but probably not enough to make it stand out on its own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A charming new take on a beloved classic.,"Well, most of the user reviews that I've seen on here for this film are mixed-to-negative so I decided to give it a positive review for a change of pace.Let me be clear; this isn't going to replace the original film. The original 'Beauty and the Beast' is still very much the masterpiece that made it the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. Clearly, there were a lot of expectations towards this new film because of that prestigious pedigree. And, clearly, it was one of the riskiest ventures of Disney's recent run of live-action remakes. And because this film is probably the closest to its original out of all the Disney remakes so far, the term 'unnecessary' is being thrown around a lot. Maybe it is, but that doesn't really bother me in the slightest.Yes, this film has almost the exact same plot as its predecessor, but at the same time, there are some minor touches here and there that at least help it to differentiate itself from the original. At the very least, it's not a 100% carbon copy of what we saw before. Plus, the film is undeniably well-made with gorgeous visuals and an equally gorgeous production design. The classic songs are handled excellently in live-action, the new songs are great additions, and the film's impressively stacked ensemble cast is fantastic.In short, I know that there are people out there who aren't too big on the remakes. That's fine; no one's forcing you to watch them. But, at the same time, these new films are not negatively impacting their original sources to the high levels that those who oppose them claim they are. At worst, they'd just end up being a mediocre remake that just makes their original counterpart even better by comparison. And yet, that hasn't been the case with most of the recent Disney remakes. They don't replace their original sources; they just serve as a nice little complement to them. This new take on 'Beauty and the Beast' is no exception. So, with that in mind, ignore all the negativity surrounding this film (particularly the completely overblown backlash towards a new aspect of the film that is so subtle, you probably wouldn't have noticed it if everyone hadn't made such a big deal about it) and just enjoy a heartwarming new take on one of Disney's most beloved stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

No comparison to the original,"Emma Watson should not have been cast as Belle, first of all she is far from being a beauty she is average looking not to mention she has no singing experience. Emmy Rossum who is both a beauty and a fantastic singer should have been cast as Belle, she actually looks like her. The casting is ridiculous, her voice is sub par and does no credit to the original movie, im going to pretend this remake doesn't exist, the casting of Gaston was also absurd....not to mention the adding of strange dialogue that is not even in the original movie, the whole casting was ridiculous but Emma Watson does no credit to Belle and is one of the biggest casting mistakes ever made! my favourite fairy tale but not movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Try look them up in IMDb Most of them are somehow based at this fairy tale, which is very niceHowever make the fairy tale into a movie, it is just bad form Some fairy tales are just too (badwords) to be ""translated"" into motion picture.

A step up from previous Disney's animation adaptation movies,"Went to the theater to watch this movie three times and I have zero regrets. The movie meets my expectation and certainly worth the wait. I love everything about this movie; the casting, almost seamless CGI effect, the brand new songs, and the plot which kind of completing the plot holes in the original one.It is a dream come true to watch Emma Watson plays Belle. Emma is breathtakingly beautiful in it and the movie really exploit her singing (quite good for beginner), acting and dancing skills. I couldn't be more happier that they cast Emma as Belle. Both Emma and Belle are truly a good role model for young girls. Needless to say Belle is my all time favorite Disney princess so I'm probably heavily bias.And to The Beast of it all, Dan plays Adam so fiercely. He shares about how complicated it was for him to transform into The Beast and I'm seriously amazed how this handsome and charming guy could transform into a monster. Hats off special effect team!Josh as Lefou and Luke as Gaston are perfect for their respective roles. I can't imagine another actors playing their role other than them. Also I like this version of Lefou because he's less stupid and not a blind follower of Gaston (like in the animated version) which is pretty good.If you love the original, love fairy tales, love musical or just love the actors, I'm damn sure you would enjoy the movie. See, I wouldn't dedicate one post for it if it is not that good.. So, seriously, this is the best animation adaptation movie by far. Go watch it ❤",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A great movie after a long time,"I was a child when Disney 1st released the same movie as a cartoon and delighted by watching this with romance, humor and some emotional scenes with excellent music. This changed from the original a bit though didn't harm the story what we knew. An excellent effort from Disney again and hope they will thrill us producing more. I've read some critics from some people above and saw some negative comments. But trust me this is a movie you could watch with your children and there you have to imagine like a child. This is surely a movie worth watching. I have to straightly mentioned this. I've little frustrated by seeing some horrible reviews from some people here.

Probably the best live-action Disney adaptation,"Probably the best live-action Disney adaptation, even though that isn't difficult to achieve, Beauty and The Beast (2017) excellently transports the audience into the magical world of the Beast's magical and cursed castle. The scale of the tiny claustrophobic village contrasted with the grandiose halls of the enchanted clearly presents the different worlds of the main characters despite grappling with the same loneliness. The cast has two major standouts in Luke Evans' Gaston and Ewan McGregor's Lumière.

Skip this movie. You won't miss anything,"Skip this movie. You won't miss anything. Except perhaps the good performance by Luke Evans as Gaston. But still, the bad aspects of this film just overrides any good ones.There were too many distractions in the film that it does not evolve into a movie experience. There are lots of propaganda in this film. If you would like to put racial minority actors, you don't pick 18th century France as your setting. I am a racial minority so I can say this. They also depict that gays as mostly men in drag, weak and the so called gay scenes are not empowering at all but rather tacky. I am gay, so I have a right to say this.The worst distraction and aspect of this film is Emma Watson. She doesn't give justice to the role of Belle. You can see it in her eyes. This actress grew up with everything, having played Hermione. Belle is a sweet, innocent provincial lass. Every time I look at Emma Watson, it seems like I am waiting for her to roll her eyeballs or take out a cellphone and tweet.Dan Stevens looked effeminate and his beast form should have been a bird and not a mammal. Josh Gad looked mechanical, uninspired and unconvincing as gay LeFou.I watched this film because I was afraid I would miss out on something historic or a good film sequence. But sadly there was none.

cool,"I will give my opinion on the movie ""The beauty and the Beast"" (2017).

Disney's got it's magic back,"I do understand the other critics, especially the 'bad' CGI comments, but I wanted to provide another perspective on this for you.Cultural context: Yes, this movie requires you to see the original - but if you are open to a new approach and a deeper story, you might never wanna go back to the original again after you've seen this movie.The story is enhanced in almost every aspect: Plot holes have been closed, motivations and a lot of background are added for all relevant characters. The casting is superb in every detail, the acting is emotive. The direction takes a lot more time to explore feelings than the original did.Among the deeper story elements - without giving anything away - is an enhanced role for the enchantress. By not knowing how much she is involved, events seem less coincidental and more - well, enchanted. It adds the kind of literal magic the original movie lacked. Just an example: Does the tree really fall by accident or is there something else involved?Here is also where the CGI adds in. Yes, there are some problems with it: Sometimes you can tell that Emma Watson had no one to play to on set, sometimes the backgrounds look not well keyed out. And the beast as well as the wolves, is close to the uncanny valley. BUT I think this is one of the movies strong suits: You can never really focus on the beast, never really grasp it - just like it should be if you are involved in the story. If it would have been rendered more plastic, it could have looked flat and so real you loose empathy. With the wolves I almost felt they would be transformed humans as well.So in my opinion, the CGI just adds to illustrate the story.The new songs by Alan Menken are amazing, the auto-tune and editing on the singing is hidden well (except for the beginning) and the orchestration is much more subtle and dynamic than the original. Going back for Menken and Rice to work on this for the third time in their lives has payed off.I'd advise you to - if you are going to see the movie for yourself - keep an open mind and remember the sense of wonder you could feel as a child. Because if you let this happen, you will be enchanted as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Good but predictable,"When I heard that Disney was going through its animated film library and was doing Beauty and the Beast, it had me curious. I wondered what a live Beauty and the Beast would be like, since there are so many different versions of the same story. But if I had to pick a favorite of all those, it'd be the original animated Disney movie. And this comes in second. This is one of my favorite post-Harry Potter Emma Watson moments and while it kept me interested, it felt a little predictable. There were some parts that weren't predictable, but I'll leave that up to you to see. There's also Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen with Luke Evans (of The Hobbit films) which made this a pretty entertaining film. Still, it doesn't hurt to watch it once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Visuals Are a Beauty, The Charm Is A Bit More Beast","It's finally here, the live action telling of a beloved story that Disney made memorable years ago. Yes, I'm talking about Beauty and The Beast my friends, and tonight I'm here to share my thoughts. Now let's get this laid down now, I'm going to look at it as its own movie and do my best to minimize the masterpiece. So please don't cast aside the review if I tread on any ground. With that said, let's get started to see if the modern retelling has what it takes to stand out in the world.Summary: You may hear others say the movie is spot on with the 1991 telling. Not entirely true, but this rendition keeps about 80% of the Tale as Old as Time to please the classic fans, while adding some tangents to give it a twist. To quote a friend, ""the new spins are built around the fans from the 90s generation to entertain"". It works for the most part, adding depth to the characters and giving the emotional kick older audience members will appreciate. And while sticking to the story is good start, the next magical step is how well they brought it to life in the visuals. Beauty and The Beasts charming country side and castles, are brought out in spectacular detail via breathtaking scenery shots and detail oriented settings that are worthy of recognition. Next dress our characters in wonderful costumes fitting of the landscape, with special emphasis on the traditional Belle Dress and Beast coat that remains timeless, and you again get more magic. Finally add in the animation, realistic, fluid, and somewhat mirroring the classic style most fell in love with, and you have a great combination. Of note, there are times when things get trippy, or not done quite as well, but overall solid around. All in all, Disney's abilities to blend these elements together are impressive, and this reviewer gives them their well-deserved props.In terms of casting, there is a mixed response to the cast assembled. Again, they are not the originals (which I did miss), but that doesn't mean they aren't bad just the same. Emma Watson is charming, smart, and courageous (all elements we have seen just without the wand), which works for the protagonist. Dan Stevens I guess does well for the few scenes he isn't covered in CGI fir, but in his monstrous form delivers his lines with surprising depth. But it is Lumiere and Cogsworth who stole the show for me. I worried, I'd be robbed of their relationship, but that wasn't the case. Ewen McGreggor and Ian McKellan stepped up the role, delivering their well- written lines that had me laughing in delight. The rest did well, but I need to move on, so let's just say for the most part, this movie's casting was well-done.Summary: The music, a staple of Beauty and The Beast that is almost as timeless as the story. This rendition has put their own spin on it, while trying to keep the backbone of the original. Most numbers work, albeit obviously auto-tuned, with their own whim, but the song Gaston was a number I did not enjoy for everything it lacked. Ironically the original tunes I found to be better composed, packed with emotion and not seeming a diluted version, but its weakness came in how they seemed randomly thrown in (yes in an effort to add more emotional develop to the cast). Overall the changes aren't terrible, they just didn't have the same bite as the classics did, unless you count shock factor from either some cheesiness/trippiness).Other changes that I didn't quite like were Le Fou's changes. Le Fou is supposed to be his name sake, the fool who is comedic relief as the joke, before getting his just desserts. Josh Gadd's rendition wasn't so much a fool, as a smart alec, clingy, admirer who made slick comments and kept his idol at bay. Again, the deeper development is appreciated, but this drastic change kind of meant his name should have been changed as well, perhaps to Petit Malin? Changes aside, the acting is capable of bringing the characters to life, but there are moments where things are a little forced. Some of the Beasts Temper tantrums, a few of Belle's stoic speeches, and Gaston's attempts to be devious, all of these hit their overacted moments at times. And while this made me laugh, there were a few conventional moments that were a bit cheesy (as stated by some in the movie). Most of these coincidental moments are ignorable, but one scene in particular was an anticlimactic finish at the end where something just happened to break at the right time.All of these moments alone aren't too bad, but many of the changes brought into this film brought it more into the adult/realistic and took away from the fun, whimsical nature of the movie. The design of the characters, the emotional subplots, even the music were lacking that element of childlike fun that made the movie so memorable for me. Doesn't mean it isn't still entertaining, I just really missed that element.The VERDICT:With the big shoes the original left, this telling did a decent job appealing to many. It is a well- developed remake of the story, with a wonderful cast and setting to bring it to life and capture your heart. While the music didn't quite reach the same heights, and some changes took away the energy, this film certainly has much of the magic that rose promised years ago. Go in there with a clear mind and try not to compare, and you'll be fine. I recommend this for a theater visit (as if I could stop you) and hope you enjoy.My scores are: Family/Fantasy/Musical: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Spoiler free review of Beauty and the Beast. A beautiful film with incredible acting and mesmerizing visuals.,"Beauty and the Beast was an amazing movie. It was a great remake of the original animated version with extra added parts that only improved the story.I have to admit, I did not have the highest hopes for this movie. I found the trailers looked alright, and decided to go see it after a few of my friends told me how good it was. I was stunned at how good it was.I'll start with the visuals. The visuals were stunning. It was such a beautiful movie to watch, from the animation to shots of the castle, forest, and village. The costume design was spot on, as well as hair and makeup.Next, the acting. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle. She was a strong female lead, smart, brave, and caring. She did such a good job of acting that I could only see her as Belle while I was watching the movie, despite having known her as Hermione for so long. Gaston was also spot on. He was the same arrogant character as we all remember. I thought that the Beast could have been a bit better at the start, but he improved throughout the film. I thought the other characters, such as LeFou and Maurice were very well done.Now, the story. This movie follows the original story, while adding some more in to make it a deeper, better story in my opinion. We are given some backstory on the Beast and Belle. I find the way the plot unfolds is more believable than in the original. The relationship between Belle and the Beast seems a lot more genuine.Finally, the music. I had my doubts about Emma Watson's singing capabilities, but I was blown away with how beautiful her voice sounded. The dance numbers are fun, with great choreography. Be Our Guest has some of the most beautiful animation.

Beauty and the Beast,"A little like ""Into the Woods"" (2014) this is a technically ambitious attempt to reconcile animation and live action with an excellent cast. Again, it works spectacularly as a piece of cinematic innovation - but has no spirit. We know the story: a vain Prince is cursed by a sorceress to remain shut up, hideously disfigured, in his castle until the spell is broken by true love's tear. ""Belle"" (Emma Watson) does well to keep this almost Ziegfeld-esque extravaganza on track. She manages to avoid the amorous intentions of Luke Evans as ""Gaston"" before ending up doing the prisoner swap for her father in the castle of the Prince - an extremely well made up Dan Stevens. The additional voice cast line up is great - Kevin Kline, Sir Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci. The songs are reprised from the 1991 version of the story but without the charm and mischief of their original iterations; they are just too precise and dare I say ""professional"". The technology has now super-subsumed every element of the process to the point that it is almost clinically delivered. The characters and story are still great, but please, Disney, leave something a little rough around the edges for us....",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful,"This was beautiful, breathtaking! The soundtrack was amazing and the graphics were astounding. I don't rate very high so 7 is already pretty good if you ask me. My only complaints were how unnatural the lip syncing looked at some points, an example would be when Belle's singing. But that's honestly just me nitpicking. If I were not myself today I would've probably given it a higher rating out of sentimentality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Enjoyable,"First thing to say, the movie is a feast for the eyes. I am talking about the colors, film sets and costumes. The CGI are also great. The beast is well-designed and the living objects look photorealistic.
The story remains quite simple and manichean (but what do you expect from a fairy tale ?). More or less, it's about the battle of knowledge against ignorance and open-mindedness against discrimination.
Emma Watson is ok. Apart from the beast, the other characters are quite caricatured therefore not very appealing.

Incredible!  Better than the original.,"2017's live action remake of Disney's beauty and the beast is by far better than the original 1991 film. First off, the visual effects and designs are absolutely breathtaking! The set designs are so eloquent and beautiful. Then the costumes, the period costumes are very true to the original and accurate. And the casting is one hundred percent perfect. Emma Watson is a great Belle, she looks a lot like her, speaks a lot like her, and represents the starring character very well. Dan Stevens is good beast, even though you don't get to see him in human form till the very end. And throughout the rest of the film the CGI is so well done and the Beast looks great, doesn't look fake at all. I enjoyed Kevin Kline as belles father very much, he just looks like the character when you first see him and when he talks you just know that was a perfect casting decision. I adored Emma Thompson as Miss Potts, her beautiful singing voice gave me chills, she lit up the screen. There could not have been a better casting choice for LaFou other than Josh Gadd, and if anyone was surprised by his character being gay then I seriously wonder if you have ever seen original film, I applaud Disney for promoting diversity and even giving his character a love interest at the end. Luke Evans as Gaston could not have been better! The writing is very similar to the original animation and it works very well. The musical numbers will blow you away and fill you with awe and wonder. Be my guest is absolutely wonderful. I honestly can't say anything bad about this wonderful film. Take someone to BE YOUR GUEST and go see this! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beutuful,"Beauty and the Beast It tells the classic story of Disney, in which a Bella (Emma Watson) after its father (Kevin Kline) was imprisoned by the Beast (Dan Stevens). After exchanging roles with her father, Bella, is imprisoned by the Evil Beast?Let's start with the actors. Emma Watson as Bella is a Disney hacienda, unfortunately I went to see her in Spanish. For me the English seat is the best there is. Dan Stevens as the Beast can not be said any more. Because most of the work was done by the effects. But the character I liked the most was Le Fou, interjected by Gosh Gad, after realizing that he is on the bad side change sides, for a few moments. Ian Mackellen and Ewwan McGregor (Cogsworth and Lumière respectively) seemed very good, a very important impulse to the film.The music is very well used, I would put one point less than La La Land. It should also be said that La La Land and La Bella y la Bestia have different styles of music. This very well used music in this movie, it would not seem strange that I had an Oscar nomination for best song or best soundtrack.Beautiful 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very disappointing,"First I want to say that I have been waiting for too many years hoping that Disney will make my favorite Cartoons in real movies; but when I went to the movies and I saw beauty and the beast I was very disappointed.I expected to see something beautiful, like the work they did with Cinderella. Why they didn't chose the same director. This movie would have been huge!. I was sad. My little daughter was scared of the beast. She is 7 years old and kept crying. This is supposed to be a family movie. This movie didn't meet my expectations at all. Actors didn't show emotion while acting. It looks fake. I'm sorry; but it was disappointing.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful to look at BUT...,"This film was sumptuously beautiful to look at but the whole way through it I couldn't help thinking how film makers today are cheating with CGI. I firmly believe that part of the magic of cinema is knowing that what is on screen once existed to some degree in reality. Admiring the work of a talented model maker, make-up artist or costume designer is, at least for me, part of wonder. I can see a lot of advantages of computers in cinema but I am really tired of watching films that imitate the magic of talented human beings using silicon chips. Compare the images in this with say Ridley Scott''s Legend (1980). Knowing many ARTISTS were employed to construct the sets, make-up & costumes, etc made for a jaw-droppingly beautiful movie.
The movie going experience is not simply watching a moving photograph. It is also an impression of what someone has made &/or done with their own hands & talent. Enough with the CGI please. While I thought this was a very entertaining film, it could have been wonderful (in the true sense of the word) if the makers had not used so much, or any, computer graphics.
P.S. I am not a luddite. I simply think cinema is about more than making pretty pictures in a computer. So there!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Could Emma Watson be more beautiful???  <3,"I am a guy and admit I only saw this movie because I think Emma Watson is the cutest and most beautiful thing and she looked more beautiful in this movie than any movie I have seen her to date or ever-after all her name is Belle-meaning beautiful in French-and I would have been disappointed if any actress played Belle other than Emma; therefore, Emma playing Belle seemed felicitous. I could be wrong, but I think this is her first movie she has been in where she is really considered the main character.I am not going to give anything away since I really cannot. I vaguely remember the original 1991 movie that I saw decades ago; but from what I do, the movie does a pretty good job of emulating the original 1991 animated version, while adding its own flair.A few people I have seen on TV this morning criticized Emma Watson's singing in the movie, but I thought she sounded perfect-then again, maybe I am biased because I have adored her since the Harry Potter Films and have seen all her other movies since.I thought all of the parts were played perfectly and the film was an overall joy to watch, and didn't feel silly watching this on opening day as a grown man surrounded by mostly very little kids with their parents. I think most of the parents who brought their children probably wanted to see it more than their children.If any event, I think this movie will go down in history, despite the critics and look forward to getting this on DVD when it comes out. I was a little confused about the part where they flashback about Belle's mother and Belle as a baby and what really happened. Perhaps, it was because I was startled by Emma's beauty. I also did not understand the magical powers of the woman who released Belle's father, as that is never clearly explained and maybe wasn't supposed to be.The film was great. Emma was beautiful as Belle. Perfect adaptation. Emma was beautiful, especially in those dresses. The film was the perfect length. Emma was even stunning in the very beginning before she wore those dresses in the village-maybe even more beautiful than in the dresses, as she has the most beautiful face. This is a great movie for the whole family, especially if you have kids and gives off a warm feeling and nostalgic feeling of when you saw the original as a kid or adult.By the way did I happen to mention how unbelievably beautiful and cute Emma Watson was in the movie? 10/10. Three thumbs way up!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A visual treat once it gets started,"The film starts slow and uninspiring but after not too long we finally reach the Beast in the Castle and the film gets started. The story is almost identical to Disney's original animated film, so it's best to think of it as the same film turned into live action rather than its own thing, but it's a good adaptation. The performances are mostly great, particularly Ewan McGregor as Lumiere stands out. Gaston lacks the fun and charisma of his animated counterpart, and his sidekick doesn't really get much of a chance to be amusing, but apart from that all the performances are strong. It's nice to see Emma Watson and the others but what really sells the film is the impressive and stylistic visual look to the film - quite simply, it looks really good. It's not something I think I'll revisit, but it was an enjoyable film and I will remember it. If you're a fan of the Beauty and the Beast story then you'll enjoy seeing it realised so capably.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Tail as old as Kline.,"If you are lucky enough to have children you will know that each child tends to have ""their"" Disney feature: for my second daughter (then 4) that film would be ""Beauty and the Beast"". With a VHS video tape worn down to the substrate, this is a film I know every line of dialogue to (""I'm especially good at expectorating""). So seeing this movie was always going to be a wander down Nostalgia Avenue and a left turn into Emotion Crescent, regardless of how good a film it was. And so it proved.Taking no chances with a beloved formula, most of the film is an almost exact frame-for-frame recreation of the original, with the odd diversion which, in the main, is to slot in new songs by original composer Alan Menken with Tim Rice lyrics. For, unlike ""La La Land"" this is a proper musical lover's musical with songs dropping in regularly throughout the running time.Which brings us to Emma Watson's Belle. I've seen review comments that she 'dials it in' with a humourless and soulless portrayal of the iconic bookworm. I can't fathom what film those people were watching! I found Watson to be utterly mesmerising, confident and delightful with a fine (though possibly auto-tuned) singing voice. Her 'Sound of Music' moment (you'll know the one) brought tears to my eyes. There are moments when her acting is highly reminiscent of Hermione Grainger, but this is about as crass a criticism as saying that Harrison Ford has done his ""Knock it Off"" snarl again.I even felt that the somewhat dodgy bestiality/Stockholm-syndrome thing, inherent in the plot, was deftly handled by her. Curiously (and I feel guilty for even thinking this) the only part I felt slightly icky about was the age difference evident in the final kiss between Watson (now 27) and the transformed beast played by Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") only 8 years her senior. I think the problem here is that it is still difficult for me to decouple the modern feminist woman that is Watson from the picture of the young Hogwarts schoolgirl. (I know this is terrible typecasting, and definitely my bad, but that's the way it is).Stevens himself is fine as the cursed prince, albeit that most of his scenes are behind the CGI-created wet-rug that is the beast. Similarly, most of the supporting stars (Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts and an almost unrecognisable Stanley Tucci as the maestro Cadenza) are similarly confined to voice parts for the majority of the film. Kevin Kline is great as the supremely huggable Maurice. But the performances that really shine though are those of Luke Evans (""The Girl on the Train"") as the odiously boorish Gaston and Josh Gad (Olaf in ""Frozen"") as his hilariously adoring sidekick LeFou. Much has been made of the gay Disney angle to this element of the story, most of which is arrant homophobic nonsense since the scenes are pretty innocuous. In fact the most adventurous 'non-heterosexual' aspect of the film, and a scene that raises by far the biggest laugh, relates to a completely different character.Most of the songs delivered in the film are OK without surpassing the versions in the original. Only Dan Steven's dramatic new song ""Evermore""- as one of the few really new 'full-length' songs in the film – has 'Oscar nomination' written all over it. However, the film eschews the 'live-filming' approach to song production featured in recent musicals like ""La La Land"" and ""Les Miserables"", with some degree of lip-sync evident. Whilst I understand that 'imperfection' is not a ""Disney thing"", I found that lack of risk- taking a bit of a disappointment.In terms of the special effects, by today's ""Jungle Book"" standards, they are mediocre at best. I wondered at first if some of the dodgy green-screen work was delivered that way to make it seem more ""cartoony"", but I doubt that – – why bother? More irritatingly, the animated chattels in the castle, especially the candlestick Lumière, are seriously unconvincing. Mrs Potts, the teapot, and her son Chip, the cup, are rendered as flat and two-dimensional. There should have been no shortage of money to thrown at the effects with a reported budget of $160 million. Where has the Disney magic gone?The film also seems to be rendered primarily for a 3D showing (I saw it in 2D). I say this because some of the panning shots (notably one around the library) to me just ended up as an unimpressive blur of mediocrity. Most odd.The director is Bill Condon responsible for the modestly well- respected but low-key ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Mr Holmes"" but also the much derided ""Breaking Dawn"" end to the ""Twilight"" series. As such this seems to have been quite a risk that Disney took with such a high profile property, and I would have been intrigued to see what a more innovative director like Chazelle or Iñárritu would have done with it.However, despite my reservations it is bound to be a MONSTER hit in every sense of the word, and kids aged 5 to 10 will, I predict, absolutely adore it (be warned that kids under 5 may be seriously scared by some of the darker scenes, especially the two wolf- attacks). For a younger age group, I would rate it as an easy 10*. As an adult viewer, given that I have viewed it through the rosy tint of my nostalgia-glasses (unfortunately you cannot hire these at the cinema if you haven't brought your own!), this was an enjoyable watch. Despite my (more than expected!) slew of criticisms above my rating is still a generous 8.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Faithful to Animated Version -- is it too faithful?? (Audio),"Our podcast review features a discussion between Hollywood hosts Ann Elder & Les Roberts. Here's a summary of what they said:This movie should have been an out of park home run. With a director like Bill Condon who executed a brilliant musical in ""Dream Girls,"" an all-star cast, and a first-rate score, this movie had set great expectations. While it wasn't terrible, it should have been exceptional.Ann says that ""the worst thing about this movie is that it's faithful to the animated version; the best thing about this movie is that it's faithful to the animated version."" It's nice that this version keeps the old score and adds a few new tracks, but the story didn't seem to develop at all.The portrayal of Gaston and LeFou as stereotypical jock with an adoring buddy is okay when they're cartoons, but they come across as one cliché after another when they are real people. They seem like caricatures in this version.One scene Ann & Les both loved, however, was the ballroom dance. They thought it was the director's nod to classic musicals such as ""The King & I,"" when the King of Siam dances with Anna.All in all they appreciated the efforts of the director and cast, but they had hoped for a little better. It's still a good movie the whole family can enjoy.Check out Ann & Les' full audio review: https://soundcloud.com/greenlightreviews/beauty-and-the-beast",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I wanted to like the live action version,"I really wanted to like the live action version of Beauty and the Beast. I was obsessed with the animated version growing up as a kid. I went to see it in theaters on New Year's 1991. My main complaint is that I believe Belle was miscast. I like Emma Watson, but I think the character of Belle would have been portrayed better by someone who is less known, or who is not mostly known from playing one character.Another thing I didn't like is that the film is supposed to be live action but everything about the film is so over produced that nothing seems real.The parts that were added or changed that moved away from the original were boring and didn't convey the spirit that the original had.It's hard to make some aspects of the film live action (Chip, Mrs. Potts, etc.) however Lumiere and Cogsworth were downright creepy.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I'm missing good results on make-up.,"The classic Disney movie's real action version has stunning colorful sets and a pretty perfect cast. Watching Kevin Kline and Emma Watson do a wonderful job as Belle is especially nice. The songs are a bit hit and miss (not counting the amazing title one) but the biggest problem with the film is the computer animated Beast. During his solo song, the creature sometimes feels sterile and fake, that becomes apparent. Wonders would have fitted with a fantastic mask and make-up.

That Was Magical,"Out of all the Disney live action remakes in the works, perhaps none more sacred to film fans than Beauty and the Beast. Dissecting and critiquing every set photo, clip, and trailer to pieces, there was a ton of pressure on Bill Condon's remake. With that said, it's hard to imagine a more fitting re-imagining of the classic tale than the one we were given.Let's talk about this cast. This may be the most perfectly cast film I've seen in quite some time. Starting with Emma Watson as the beloved princess, Belle. Lily James certainly had some pressure taking on Cinderella, but to today's audience, Belle is the more popular character. Watson wasn't going to please everyone, but she captures Belle's wonder, intelligence, curiosity, passion, and of course, beauty. Pair her with a great performance by Dan Stevens as the co-lead, and you have your classic romance.Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, and Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts? Come on now, casting that impeccably just isn't normal. They don't just look like their animated counterparts from the 1991 version, they completely embody every aspect of what made us love them in the first place. McGregor and McKellan have a hilarious back and forth, as do Gad and Evans, and Kline & Thompson will break your heart as respected parents.As for the music, which probably provided the most hesitation from avid fans. Would they change things too much? Too little? Would the new songs actually add anything of value? I wasn't bothered by any of the new music, but none of them particularly stood out either. But they nailed all of the new renditions of the classic Alan Menken hits. I don't know that anyone can top Angela Lansbury's Beauty and the Beast/Tale as Old as Time, but Emma Thompson gives it her best effort. The ""Be Our Guest"" scene? Yep, it's just as ridiculously fun as the original.The additional time spent fleshing out the Beast and Belle's individual backstories felt necessary and not excessive. Really, the only thing that needed working on in this movie was Beast's CGI. There were moments of really noticeable effects work, especially in the ballroom dance sequence. Unfortunately, that's one of the most important scenes in the film, you'd think that would be something they spent a little more time on. In the same vein, not all of the green screen was polished either. I love how colorful and wondrous the production design and sets are, but that can only do so much. But if the CGI is all I'm complaining about, then I think the filmmakers did alright.I watched the 1991 version a lot as a kid, so this was a remake that was near and dear to my heart and pretty much my entire generation. With the exception of a few CGI filled scenes, I think this ranks up there with the best of Disney Live Action remakes. It's not often I get swept up with emotion at the climax of a kids movie, but I just couldn't help myself with this one. The cinematography, the performances, and that legendary music all came together at the end.

The animated moments are top notch while the characters play their role very well but I cannot escape the feeling that it misses something. It is mostly the same as the animation masterpiece that inspired it, but somehow doesn't manage to stay on par with it, or to create and inspire that feeling that no other movie can.It is a very well executed film, but it somehow does not have a soul, fact which alters the overall sensation.

In Search of the Real Beauty,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A second-hand knock-off that rarely touches the original's beauty but still entertains.JIM'S REVIEW: The Hollywood Remake. A strange breed of movie it is. It is not a sequel adding more to an already told tale. It's more like a parasite leeching onto someone else's ideas and crediting themselves with all of the glory. Those who loved the original will look upon this new attempt with disdain, those who disliked the predecessor will question the filmmaker's motives. Is it pure folly or a creative need to improve upon the mistakes of others? Most recent remakes seem to be financial quests for more $$$, cashing in on the known product and its glowing reputation. Whatever the reason, all are hoping the film will be rediscovered by a new audience and make a profitable return.Which brings us to the latest entry, Disney's Beauty and the Beast (2017). Now the studio has pulled from its vaults one of the most honored movies of all times, a near-perfect masterwork and the only animated film ever to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. (Perhaps we should drop to our knees and give thanks that they do not own the rights to Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, Some Like It Hot, or many other film classics.)Beauty and the Beast (1991) has such a high pedigree and creates a daunting challenge to covert into a live action remake, even with all of the CGI state-of-the-art technology and artisans on board for this project.Which leaves us to wonder: Can one ever perfect the already perfect...Is there room for improvement upon such a skillful work of art? Director Bill Condon was at the helm of this project and the answer to his end result is decidedly a mixed blessing.Let me begin by saying that is much to admire in this re-imagining. Yet for every step forward, the film awkwardly takes two steps back: the nice mix of live action and CGI is more than serviceable yet hardly magical, the ensemble is well cast with some notable exceptions, production values are generally strong although proportions of the re-animated animated objects are inconsistent and vary in size from one scene to the next, and the glorious score by the talented team of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman remains relatively intact, with some additional new tunes added which do little to impress. (Except for one standard Broadway 11 o'clock number, Evermore, the additional tunes with lyrics by Tim Rice, are lackluster.)Also, on the minus side: Backstories have been written for some of the characters, but they serve more as filler and do little to advance the plot. The screenplay by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spilotopoulos has the basic plot handled successfully, but too many sub-plots muck up the works. The dialog has an overabundance of anachronisms than become almost as jarring in their dated pop culture references as Josh Gad's odd interpretation in the role of a minor sidekick character, La Fou, which becomes a major misstep in such a sweet story. The actor chooses to perpetuate the gay effeminate stereotype in his overt ""nance"" mannerisms that is humorless and borderline offensive. He almost ruins the film as he takes this fairy tale far too literally and figuratively, as does Bill Condon's direction.His direction seems haphazard and in need of restraint. Mr. Condon often goes for the obvious slapstick and crass moments rather than enhancing the subtle charm and class of this classic love story. No more is this apparent than in his treatment of the film's big production number, Be Our Guest. (In the original animated version, the film is aglow with vibrant colors and stunning hand-drawn details that make for a delightful movie-going experience. Here, the moment is excessive, becoming a dizzying whirl of garish shapes and hyper-active movement that blurs the details of its imagery. Other musical sequences lack proper staging with scenes that overwhelm the proceedings. However, Mr. Condon does get the essential title number right in both setting a romantic mood and filling the screen with sumptuous detailing.Some of the actors are spot-on, while other are just spotty. Emma Watson as Belle, is fine in her acting, but her singing is wispy and thin. (Paging Marni Nixon!) Ms. Watson does share a lovely chemistry with Dan Steven's Beast and the actor is very convincing in his angst under layers of make-up and special effects. Kevin Kline as Belle's father is a treat as is Luke Evans, playing a leaner and meaner Gaston. He captures the menace and vanity of this perfect foil. More voice-overs than real supporting turns are provided by Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McKellen, while Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Stanley Lucci, and Audra McDonald try to bring some degree of interest into their fussy characterizations. And let's not even discuss the mincing of the aforementioned Mr. Gads any further...awful.That said, Beauty and the Beast (2017) still entertains and is a lovely diversion in its tale of unconditional love. The celebrated music score is a lovely homage to the Broadway musicals of yore and its romantic story still enchants. I suppose, if one has never seen the superior 1991 film, I'm sure that what is on screen is all the more captivating.Russia said, ""Nyet"" to this remake due to censorship issues with homophobia. I said, ""Meh"" to this remake due to purely aesthetic reasons. This film, while no beast, is certainly no beauty either.

Not only has Disney recently made excellent live-action versions of their animated masterpieces (Jungle Book, Cinderella), but the cast alone (Emma Watson, Ian McKellen, Kevin Kline) already seemed to make this one a sure hit. Well, not so much as it turns out.Some of the animation is fantastic, but because characters like Cogsworth (the clock), Lumière (the candelabra) and Chip (the little tea cup) now look ""realistic"", they lose a lot of their animated predecessors' charm and actually even look kind of creepy at times. And ironically - unlike in the animated original - in this new realistic version they only have very limited facial expressions (which is a creative decision I can't for the life of me understand).Even when it works: there can be too much of a good thing. The film is overstuffed with lush production design and cgi (which is often weirdly artificial looking though) but sadly lacking in charm and genuine emotion. If this were a music album, I'd say it is ""over-produced"" and in need of more soul and swing. The great voice talent in some cases actually seems wasted, because it drowns in a sea of visual effects that numbs all senses. The most crucial thing that didn't work for me, though, is the Beast. He just never looks convincing. The eyes somehow don't look like real eyes and they're always slightly off.On the positive side, I really liked Gaston, and the actor who played him, Luke Evans, actually gave the perhaps most energized performance of all. Kevin Kline as Belle's father has little to do but to look fatherly and old, but he makes the most of his part. Speaking of Belle, now that I've seen the film, I think her role was miscast. I think someone like Rachel McAdams would actually have been a more natural, lively and perhaps a bit more feisty Belle than Emma Watson.If you love the original, you might want to give this one a pass, it's really not that good (although at least the songs were OK). Also, I'd think twice before bringing small children; without cute animated faces, all those ""realistic"" looking creatures and devices can be rather frightening for a child.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Artificial Art,"Missing magic, for the entire film you're waiting for a grande finale trick that will make up for it all. Sadly the climax is fast tracked and dull to say the least.

Lovely one,"Beauty and the Beast (2017), a spellbinding journey that breathes new life into a beloved tale as old as time. Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle is enchanting, bringing intelligence and warmth to the iconic character. The film editing dances gracefully through the enchanting sequences, seamlessly transitioning between the whimsy of the castle and the quaint charm of the village. The film's strength lies in its vibrant and nostalgic homage to the animated classic, with a cast that brings depth to the beloved characters. While the music tugs at the heartstrings, there are moments where the pacing feels a touch too swift, racing to keep up with the magic. Cinematography bathes the audience in a visually stunning world, from the grandeur of the Beast's castle to the lively spectacle of ""Be Our Guest."" At 7/10, Beauty and the Beast is a magical retelling that captures the spirit of the original while adding a touch of modern enchantment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Wonderful Adapted Movie,"Overall.. I was Thrilled by this movie. I cried when I was watching this movie, Especially in the end. I recommend this movie for All people, Especially for those who love Literature.. The designs and the effects of this movie were awesome.. I love the town's design, every thing seems so quaint and real. This movie magically makes the objects seems alive ( The candle, The clock, The wardrobe,etc) .However, this film has the bad side as well. For me, the weakness of this movie were the uncertain and ambiguous fate of some characters in it. I wonder who and how's the fate of the enchantress and Gaston. In other words, there were lack of descriptions for a few characters.

Pretty Tough to Assign a Grade,"Let's stipulate to the fact that the animated version of Beauty and the Beast (and subsequent live musical productions)are absolute masterpieces. Beauty and the Beast may just be the greatest musical of all time.So, let's also stipulate to the fact that the 2017 movie production is also pretty good. You can't take an established masterpiece, apply a Disney-sized budget and an all-star cast, and come out with a bad movie. The question is, did they come away with a great movie? Mmm...not really.Is there anything about this extravagant production that improved upon the animated version? Well, there's new songs that are...um...pretty weak. There's the new version of LeFou, and he's umm...umm...there's the reimagined Maurice who is terribly miscast, drab, and lifeless. There's the new, not-especially-appealing, time-travel Paris schtick. And umm...did we mention LeFou loves Gaston? Amazing, huh?So there you have it.

Very good,"The film tells the story of Bela (Emma Watson), a resident of a small French village whose father is captured by the Beast (Dan Stevens) and decides to give her life to the strange being in exchange for his freedom. At the castle, she meets magical objects and discovers that the Beast is, in fact, a prince who needs love to return to human form. The film was directed by Bill Condon, he directed the musical scenes in an impeccable way, all the camera movements were very precise, since the editing of the film is a little flawed, there are serious problems of continuity, especially in non-musical scenes. The script of the film is very good, it is very cool to see the story that we already know in a version with actors, and of all the live-action adapted, this is the most similar to the original. The new songs are excellent, even though some do not have the same weight as the original film, they are beautiful and pleasant songs. Emma Watson does a good job playing Bella, even in some scenes she seems expressionless, she does well. Dan Stevens is also great as the Beast, being very expressive, even with the use of CGI. Luke Evans gives the best interpretation of the film as Gastão and Josh Gad is also great as LeFou. The voice work for dubbing the secondary characters in CGI is perfect and there are several famous actors voicing. The cinematography of the film is very good, there are some dark moments but nothing that gets you out of the film. The soundtrack is impeccable, and as I said, the new songs are extraordinary. Beauty and the Beast (2017) is an excellent film, which proves that not all remakes are bad, well directed, well written and with great performances. I recommend!Film reviewed on January 6, 2021.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Casting not right,"When an actor is cast in a role, it shouldn't be because she is famous, has a pretty face and represents another million dollar franchise.
An actor, essentially, should be good at ACTING. I don't have anything against Emma Watson, she seems to stand up for the right things (feminism). But in all honesty, I don't think acting is one of her gifts. Her performance in beauty and the Beast was cringe worthy.
Also, the SONGS! (I'm not even going get started on those)

Beauty and the Box Office Beast,"Beauty and the Beast has gone through a lot of movie and TV variations over the years and luckily I have only seen a few. I watched the black and white 1946 French ""La Belle et la Bete"" last year, and I have seen the cartoon countless times but have never watched any of the TV iterations or other movies and I am glad for this otherwise I would say this is movie overload.Beauty and the Beast is a bright eyed loving remake of the cartoon from the choreography down to the songs and even the script. In many respects that is what makes it fun to watch. As many of you know, I have a very complicated relationship with Hollywood and their remakes and reboots because I hate most of them but when it comes to Disney they have been making some really great live action remakes of their beloved cartoons and this one is no exception.The casting was spot on, and Emma Watson is a perfect fit for Belle. All of the other characters also shine but I particularly enjoyed Gaston and LeFou as a pair. Luke Evans and Josh Gad, respectively, worked so well off of each other and added some fun comedy to the mix. Most of their interactions were a little over the top but I was able to channel that frustration towards the children behind me kicking my seats.There were also some really noisy people next to me who kept laughing and shouting and one phone went off as well. It was at this point that I really appreciated the plight of the Beast in the film. I really wanted to attack many people around me and tell them to get out of my castle and as each rose petal fell in the film, so did the rose petals holding my patience together. I think it is very important to note that when you are going to see a movie you should make sure that not only is your phone off but that your crying child is fully out of the theater and not just around the corner so you can still watch the movie. I know it is frustrating that you have a child but also really want to go see this movie from your childhood but a good parent can wait for this movie to come to Netflix instead of forcing a packed theater hear your child scream as the wonderful musical numbers come across the screen.Overall, this is a great date movie. It is also perfect for those of us who loved the cartoon growing up and don't yet have a young child that doesn't like loud noises. I think while some parts of the movie were over the top, nothing really took away from the movie besides all of the children who took one thousand years to open their bags of candy and as the crunchy sounds of the packaging pushed me over the edge, the soundtrack and score saved me from jumping.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Main characters just too creepy,"As a huge fan of the original Disney animated pic, there were several issues I had with this live action remake. Namely, the Beast and Lumiere. The Beast's horns made him look like the devil, as well as nothing like the original Beast in the animated movie. Why change that? It gave me the creeps. Also, making him two-legged only, instead of sometimes four-legged like in the original movie was distracting. As for Lumiere, there was nothing charming about his face at all. That too was creepy, the kind of thing that scares you in your dreams.Thirdly, where was the delightful song, ""Only Human Again,"" by the original team of Ashman and Mencken, that made it to the stage production? That would have been much better than the forgettable tunes by Mencken and Rice.And lastly, why mess with Beauty's original gorgeous yellow dress? The one Emma Watson wore was nice; it just wasn't Beauty's.So, I would not take little children to this movie. Let them enjoy the original animated feature or the stage production. No bad dreams there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Fair remake,"The live action remake of beauty and the beast brings stunning visuals and Disney magic. Most of the characters are well cast and well acted and the singing is pleasant.

A Beast of Manufactured Nostalgia,"Disney continues its unprecedented line of rebooted, re-imagined, and refurbished live-action remakes with the new fangled Beauty and the Beast. And much like last year's Jungle Book (2015) and Pete's Dragon (2015) this one injects just as much chemical perfection into its innards as a robot arm would bestow a Twinkie. It's not a necessary movie per se. But its unabashed zeal and fidelity to the source material (the Disney-fied 1991 film not the Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont tome) has a certain giddiness to it; a certain manufactured innocence.I'm sure we're all well versed by now on the self-described ""Tale as Old as Time."" A precocious Belle (Watson) falls in love with a surly Beast (Stevens) whose secret heart of gold is hidden underneath layers of loneliness, sadness and fur. There's an enchanted castle, a witch's curse, singing silverware, inexplicable walks through wintry forests without a coat - its basic fairy tale stuff really. Difference this time is Disney has carefully and lovingly set its story on its perch like butterfly taxidermy in frame. Most everything you remember from Beauty and the Beast (1991) is in this film, and everything you don't remember is just a tiny bit better.What parts you may ask? Well arguably the best thing about Beauty and the Beast is the way it quietly updates the gender politics of the material and does so without feeling pushy or preachy. Much ado was made of the ultimately benign gay character that nearly everyone failed to notice the first (and second) bi-racial kiss in a Disney film. As for Belle, Paige O'Hara certainly had her moment as the progressive page-turning princess but Emma Watson's take on the character comes with a dream of traveling to the great white somewhere and (sort of) accomplishes it. Speaking of which, Watson positively runs away with this role; dawning natural sincerity while belting out gorgeous melodies like she's not even trying.Do you remember Gaston? In the animated version, the vain hunter-in-chief of Belle's little town had all the charm of a nefarious, dark-haired Johnny Bravo. Here however Luke Evans's meat-headed take on the popular villain pops with campy fun. His interactions with LeFou (Gad), up to and including the song ""Gaston,"" are easily the best parts of the movie.Yet while these minor improvements are sure to win over the nostalgic, the case against Beauty and the Beast proves much more interesting, at least from a filmic perspective. First let's start with the added songs provided by B&B originator Alan Menken and replacement lyricist Tim Rice. While the songs do their best to slink underneath the film's major melodies, their lack of Howard Ashman's lyrical wordplay and effortless charm clash like burlap underneath layers of purple satin.Additionally Bill Condon's persnickety attention to detail works for the mechanics of the film to the detriment of the narrative. Every cut, every structural progression, feels stiflingly familiar, and can't help but make everything look paler when compared to the original. Considering the way the film was shot and cut, the middling filler looks presentable while the big scenes all seem overwhelmed by clutter. This is most evident in ""Be Our Guest,"" when Lumiere (McGregor) our photo-realistic French candelabra fills the screen with gauche CGI chaos. It is at that moment I realized; the best part of the 1991 version is the worst part about this one.Yet despite, its various faults, I can't help but admire this posh little remake. It's a begrudging admiration, like the kind of ambivalence I increasingly feel towards Marvel movies. Only unlike Marvel, which tricks you into thinking you haven't seen all this before, Disney live-action remakes all but announce you've seen this all before, only you shouldn't care. It looks like we'll have to wait a little bit longer before killing this beast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not a Fan,"Years ago I saw a coming attraction for the ""Disney Cartoon"" of ""Beauty and the Beast"". I was floored. The song was ""Belle"". It was catchy. I couldn't wait to see this film. I took my niece and nephew. After I watched it I couldn't wait to see it again. I loved the film. I wasn't the only person who loved the film. The 1991 feature was the first Animated Film to ever be Nominated for Best Picture. It was the first to Animated Film gross over $100,000,000 at the domestic Box Office.About 3 years Disney had a Broadway adaption. I thought it was terrible. Nothing original about it. All they seem to so was transfer the film to stage without much imagination. Now in 2017 we get the live action musical ""Beauty and the Beast"". Yes it was a huge box office success but doesn't mean its a good film. Far from it.The story here is almost the same. The new songs stick out. They are just as bad as the changes George Lucas made in his ""Star Wars"" film.The casting in this film is okay but Emma Watson is obviously auto- tuned. Her voice is very average. That is too bad. The producers should have cast Ann Hathaway or Emmy Rossum. Both have much stronger voices.As for this film adaption?

Magical,"Went to see this movie last night and dragged my husband along for company as all my movie 'buddies' had already been to see it. I fully expected him to be nodding off early into the film, but to my surprise he actually enjoyed it. As for me - I loved it. It has been a long time since I've been to see a good musical (La La Land doesn't fall into this category for me...dismal film); however, for 2+ hours I was able to completely lose myself in this movie and wasn't bored for one minute. The one thing I can't understand is the criticism that Emma Watson has been receiving from lots of reviewers as I thought she was the perfect Belle. Some people even referred to her as being 'unemotional' and too 'cold'. For me; however, Emma captured Belle exquisitely, with just the right mix of angst, vulnerability, strength, longing - and in the end, love. She is a natural beauty without the typical Hollywood glamour - a refreshing change if you ask me. As for Luke Evans - he most definitely nailed it as Gaston!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Wonderful World of Music and Love,"When Disney first announced their slew of live-action remakes after the financial success that was Maleficent, I had great doubts about them. Maleficent was, to a point, fun, but the amount of films they planned to make in such a short time sounded like they were not going to do the originals justice. I found myself proved wrong with Cinderella. Alice in the Looking Glass was a lost cause. (Pete's Dragon, while not a remake of an animated classic, was utterly beautiful). The Jungle Book was nice, but highly overrated in my opinion.Then there was this. This ... THIS ... is true Disney at its finest. A classical romantic musical adventure extravaganza filled to the brim with a strong story, upraising laughter, marvellous tension and pulled-straight-from-your-heart tears of both sadness and joy. Bill Condon's direction is a complete triumph and, if I may, the best thing he's ever made thus far. Alan Menken's return as composer is spectacular, restoring lyrics that were deleted from the original film and adding in three new and very moving song numbers (Evermore, the Beast's solo, is a personal favourite). Every cast member was masterfully chosen for their roles in both professions of acting and singing; Emma Watson defies all expectations, Dan Stevens puts on a magnificent and awesome Beast, Luke Evans perfectly conveys the villain's immoral tendencies in the form of a realistic psychopath, Kevin Kline and Ian McKellen are as funny as ever, and Ewan McGregor and Emma Thompson pull of their respective roles (and singing) of Lumiere and Mrs. Potts with performances that would make Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury proud.And the music... oh, the music. All the well-remembered and beloved songs of the 1991 animated masterpiece are back, fully realised in all of their resplendent glory and never losing any of their charm.If it's classic Disney you love, then this is your film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A beautiful song and dance movie,"It is said that Belle accepted the ugly beast and filled his empty heart with love; in fact, the beast did not appreciate and sincerely accept Belle, who was ahead of their time and ostracized by the short-sighted villagers.

How Disappointing,"""Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.""I'm sure this won't be the last time I say this, but it needs to be said: Stop making movie musicals with people who can't sing. If they can't sing, drop the Autotunes and dub them. We have the technology; it's virtually painless. Non-singing actors have ruined 3 of my favorite musicals: Beauty & the Beast, Sweeney Todd, and Phantom of the Opera. In a musical, music is a character, and hearing Josh Groban sing ""Evermore"" over the end credits merely proved what was missing.The overuse of CGI in films is creating a nightmare of quick cut, in your face visuals that are detracting from the overall story and quite frankly, giving me a headache. Again, CGI should enhance, not overtake your scenes and wrestle them and your actors into the ground. The same CGI that made ""Be Our Guest"" a thing of beauty in the 1991 version creates an on-screen, muddled mess here. In fact, the CGI detracted rather than enhanced this entire production. The cartoon characters showed more emotion than the flat, emotionless, and rather frightening faces here.I'd rather not comment on the acting because it's hard to do that and not hurt people's feelings, and at the end of the day, actors are people, too. I will say that there is a reason Disney is now seriously recognizing and marketing their Villains. THEY ROCK.

It's serviceable.,"I'm not a huge fan or musicals to be honest, but every now and then I find myself to be entertained by some of them.That being said when I was a child I enjoyed a few Disney animation classics and Beauty & the Beast is definitely one of them. During the hype train I found myself anticipating the film the more I heard about it. Emma Watson's casting as Belle definitely brought my attention to the film. As did the casting Ewan McGergor, Sir Ian McKellen, Stanley Tucci, and Emma Thompson. The set photos and promotional images also grabbed my attention too.I'm happy to report that it's a serviceable adaptation of the animated movie. Most of the cast delivers with the exception of Luke Evans. He definitely looks like he's having fun in the role as Gaston, but he is so cartoonishly two-dimensional and so over the top. I just could not take him seriously every time he showed up on screen. Aside from him everyone does a great job. Emma Watson brings it, and her singing isn't too bad either. Stand out for me was Ewan McGergor as Lumiere. He brought a lot of swagger and personality to the role. His banter and exchange with Ian McKellen's Cogsworth brings a lot of humor in their relationship. I also really enjoyed Dan Steven's performance as the Beast.Singing in the beginning of the film is a little bit of a turn-off. Not because the actors couldn't sing, but it's one number after another, and some of the verses were kind of pointless as well. But once the plot gets going it becomes more tolerable. In the middle near to the end, the film know when to pick it's moments to showcase a number. Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but the annoyance is only temporary. Some of the actors are kinda there without much to do, despite some amusing moments, like Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, Audra McDonald, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.The romance is solid. It never felt too over the top, and the chemistry for the most part was there. I believe making people laugh and showcasing romance is something hard to convey for any movie. Beauty & the Beast does a commendable job at it, however while I never felt like Belle and Beast's relationship felt force, I wish that a little more was given to them. The film does showcase their bonding, but most of it are montages. Everything set up for their romance was just almost, almost executed with perfection. I also wish I got to see more out of Dan Steven's Beast as well. The film hits in high gears once the film introduces him.Special effects and production design are first rate. Yes there are moments where you can tell it's CGI, but it's not that noticeable that it's going to distract you. Costumes are fabulous too look at and the actors are well lit. Director Bill Condon does an excellent job showcasing the fantasy land, it's visually pleasing and enriching. The ball-room dance sequence with Beast and Belle is done with justice too.At times Beauty & the Beast can feel cluttered and overproduced eye-candy, but the film is a very faithful adaptation of the animated film. Aside from a little backstory from Belle and the gay character LeFou played by Josh Gad(which is handled well to be honest), it really doesn't bring a lot new to the table. Which is fine for some, cause why fix what isn't broken, but that works for and against the film.Among other live adaptations, I'd rank this below or evenly with Cinderella, but definitely much more entertaining than Maleficent or the Alice in Wonderland films. Odd that both Cinderella and Beauty & the Beast are basic retellings that work for the most part, but Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland try to be new re-imaginings that just crumble. Perhaps Little Mermaid or Mulan might find the striking balance of both.6.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Awesome remake with Disney magic and spellbinding visuals. Don't believe the bad reviews.,"Disney's live-action remake of the much loved classic animated film Beauty and the Beast lives up to the hype, and is just as good as, or possibly even better than the animated version. The story is the same, with enough new things in it to add something fresh. Most of the songs from the animated version are in the film, and sound quite similar to those in the animated version. All this makes viewers nostalgic for the old film. The acting is what one would expect from such a huge cast. Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou are especially spectacular, as they add humor to their already well developed characters. As I already mentioned, the songs and the music are great, and live up to Disney standards. The cinematography is also great, with long sweeping shots during the musical sequences. The shots of the setting and of the castle are also amazing. What really impressed me about this movie though is the costumes, the sets, the castle, and the general look of the film. Wow wow wow applause clap clap clap!!! No description of mine can do justice to the amazing design and the spectacular use of CGI. I was worried about what the beast and the objects in the castle might look like in a live-action movie, but Disney did a very good job of not just making it work, but making it amazing. Another thing about this version of Beauty and the Beast that I loved was that there's a homosexual character! In a Disney princess movie with a lot of clichés in it, it's awesome to see some diversity.Disney's remake of Beauty and the Beast will make fans of the animated classic nostalgic. It will delight a new generation of children. I wouldn't recommend bringing really young children to see it though, as there is some violence and things that may spoil your child's innocence. The movie is very enjoyable for teens and adults as well. However, if you don't like the animated classic, you will not enjoy this movie. If you don't like classic fairy tales featuring princes and castles, don't see this movie. If you hate musicals, don't see this movie. See this movie for the Disney charm, the nostalgia for the animated version, the music, and the amazing visuals. I would highly recommend seeing Beauty and the Beast in the cinema, possibly in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
2017's Beauty and the Beast,"2017's Beauty and the Beast is the live action remake of the 1994 film of the same name. There's plenty of music throughout. It does encapsulate the old story that's as old as time about true love. It goes to show that love isn't just skin deep, literally. It's best if it's not just about looks but the actual qualities of their character.This is the currently the last live action remake I have watched (haven't watched the live action Little Mermaid yet). My favorite Disney live action remake is still Aladdin. I prefer its music and story to the other remakes.I haven't watched the original Beauty and the Beast yet, so I can't say which one I prefer.I find it did a good job at showing the characters who are inanimate objects that are brought to life. I feel like they could be like the lions in the Lion King. They're better in animation and in live action, they seem to not be as expressive. These animate inanimate objects seem way more expressive in live action than lions would ever be.Overall, I find this to be an alright film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Ruined by the female lead,"This had all the hallmarks of a great live action fantasy epic. Brilliant visuals and great effects, a half decent story with some interesting characters, and of course, it's Disney. What could possibly go wrong?2 words, Emma Watson.I know Ms Watson has legions of fans who'll watch anything she is in just because of her Harry Potter connections but almost everything I see her in, she ruins. She has the acting range of a wooden block, her delivery is so stilted here, that it completely takes you out of the film and her facial expressions never seem to change. Seriously, she could have been wearing a mask in this and you wouldn't have been able to tell any difference, she just stares blankly and looks disinterested for the whole film. She's awful as Belle and her dialogue delivery is cringe inducing. I lost count of the amount of times I rolled my eyes when she tried to convey any emotion, it was embarrassing.Now, I'm not trying to simply beat up Emma Watson because I dislike her, it isn't that at all, but when someone in a film is so bad they make the film almost impossible to enjoy, it really needs to be pointed out.This could have been a great fantasy epic but I myself couldn't wait for it to end. Shame really, had they have cast an actress with a morsal of talent or acting skill, this could have been really good.Stick to the original animated film, it's far better.No doubt it will still make tons of cash though.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

My only concern was the gay references, I don't think there was any added value other than shock, and I don't like shock in my Disney movies. Moving forward, the story was easy to follow and it followed the typical Disney Princess theme perfectly. The singing was delightful and the cast did a great job making the moment real.

A Slightly Askewed Live Action Version,"26 March 2017. Adapting the animated classical musical into a live action musical brought forth some memorable emotional moments but at the same time lost the fun exaggerated, lightness captured in the cartoonish display of several of the characters. The most prominent problem with the updated live action movie is the casting of the real human character Gaston whose physical presence just doesn't capture the animated comical snootiness of the anti-hero. The animated version had charm whereas the live action version had to make due with a pseudo-Broadway stage musical production and in some ways didn't capture the dazzling set designs along with the musical renditions found in such productions as Sound of Music or even Mary Poppins or My Fair Lady.The live action was most wonderful when it came to the humanity of human suffering and pain but as the same time became too edgy in its raw, violent scenes. Oddly enough Kevin Kline while perfectly cast as the father, wasn't Kevin Kline enough to capture the softer and lightly comical animated version. As for the use of song as live actions and the voice over, which is almost second nature in animated movies, since Les Miserable (2012) use of live singing on set, this live action musical seemed less authentic and more acted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An Outstanding Piece of Work!,"Beauty & the Beast stands, in my opinion, as one of Disney great triumphs. Further, Emma Watson is purely magnificent and steals the show! Gaston also adds wonder and wit. Most of the main characters act splendidly, making the movie a joy to view. This movie pulls you in and makes you a part of it!Overall, I give this movie a nine. A ten is not deserved for some slightly odd CGI regarding the Beast. Other than that, the movie enchants me, and I will see again and again.As for the critics that complain about the ""gay"" scenes. Bah! There's hardly a thing there. You might not even notice if you weren't looking. Kids certainly won't know to what the very subtle innuendos tangentially point.

fan's dream come true,"Ever since i saw the first teaser,i was dying to see this childhood favourite animation movie come alive as a liveaction Hollywood adaptation.As any other DisneyFairytale fan,my expectations were way too high with this one.Although i was not very pleased with their casting (EmmaWatson and Luke evans specially),i had no shortage of desperation to finally witness the epic eternal love story produced in today's advanced filmmaking facilities. And i am happy to say that i didn't get disappointed this time.This movie has met all my expectations and exceeded in some aspects.3D effects are extremely aesthetic and quiet a feast to eyes.the CG work of particles,fur,cloth etc is of sheer brilliance (as i would expect with Disney,it was perfectly balanced and neither photorealistic nor cartoonish..) There is nothing to say about the story etc as we all know it since our childhoods.Disney didn't waste runtime on establishing the plot and only focused on its grand ""portrayal"".Which is a good thing (And exactly where Junglebook,Snowwhite n maleficient failed) There is this ""Be our guest"" sequence which is breathtaking beautiful. It just mesmerises for few seconds. Belle is dressed in a magical yellow gown and beast comes up so elegantly there. Cogsworth,lumiere and chip (living objects of the palace) are animated very cutely.I'd not compare their expressions with the 1991 2D masterpiece though,inner child in me loved them all! 3D effects and complimenting cinematography makes you go awestruck quiet regularly till the end. The only thing which could have been wayy better is the ""music"". It wasn't something unpleasant ,but this being a ""musical"",needed freshness and not too stretched singing solos and repetitive same old ensemble BGM we have heard countless times elsewhere. All in all,i am very happy with this movie and i can say that it will stay in my collection for years! This isn't the first time when Disney did a classic remake,this is indeed the first time when Disney made me fall in love again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An adaptation almost at the Disney level,"""The beautiful and the beast"" is a good musical, a great adaptation, with many hits, but also with some mistakes. With a script coming from the animation of 91, we have some changes for the worse, like trying to create a suspense over the beautiful mother, and solve this mystery in a scene that completely escapes the rhythm of the movie, such a mystery would not have to exist or could be solved In 2 min, because such a plot is created for the development of the father's character, but really, it does not work, other small changes were the king's employees become more and more inanimate and the castle collapses more as the pellets fall, that change was Great, more, the script follows the pattern, with scenes equal to the animation - which is not bad - and a great development of the village in relation to the beautiful and the passion point between beautiful and the beast. The film talks about how the quest for knowledge was something seen with strangeness, and the film is completely full of diversity, I am against putting gay actors, whites, blacks, women ... just to meet quota, ""the beautiful and the beast ""Changes the character in an extremely natural way, and the change gets even better. We have a photograph that mixes the white of the village with the gray of the castle, we also have a great mix and sound editing, a completely confused assembly, and we have a makeup and a costume simply spectacular (a sure indication to Oscar in the costumes). Emma watson is not a painter in terms of acting, but fulfills her role as beautiful, and at times even charms, Josh Gad is great, and incredible as it may seem, has an incredible chemistry with the character of Luke Evans, at last , We have problems in the script, and problems of continuity, but the film pleases, and much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Perfect! Wonderful film!,"This film was spot on. Practically perfect in every way. I loved it entirely. The casting is spot on. I don't think anyone did a bad Job.Emma Watson was spot on. Her singing is perfect and no, it is NOT auto-tuned. She said so herself. She said many people were betting her singing was auto-tuned, well, it wasn't. It was all her. People need to leave her performance alone. She was perfect in every way. Nothing wrong with her. She's actually my favorite Belle having seen on screen. More so than Paige O'Hara.I only had three very minor problems.#1: I missed the Broadway songs. I feel they should have included them into the film. Especially Human Again and If I Can't Love Her.#2: I hated they changed the Feather Duster and Wardrobe's names. I prefer the names Babette and Madame De La Grande Bouche.#3: I feel they rushed the story a bit. It was pretty speedy.But other than that, it's beautiful. I loved what they did with Lefou. Lumiere was my favorite of the males (No wonder as he is my dream role for the musical and has always been my favorite character). Belle was my favorite of the female.If people love the classic film, they will love this one. Maaaaaybe not more, and maaaaaaybe not as much.

Tale as old as Time...,"You can have many opinions about movie remakes. It is true, that many times remakes are stupid and vain and many times they flop simply because of their contradiction in terms. So is Beauty and the Beast remake legitimate? Absolutely yes. Movie is a thoroughbred true musical and many musicals are very populated in theaters all around the word and people travel to see them in many theater cities around the world. There is no reason why we can't enjoy the new version of Beauty and the Beast. With the new technology movie has brought back so beautifully. It's legendary themes sounds so lovely and familiar, that even new generation can enjoy it's magic and luxury. Also the movie characters are now more profound and therefore more interesting even for more adult audience. Beauty and the Beast takes it's audience from very beginning to it's magical world and entertains it's whole audience. Movie follows almost exactly the original movie concept. Most of the time it works, but not all the time. Especially at the middle of the movie ""Be my Guest"" song is little too blurry and childish and could be replaced with better scene. That doesn't bother too much and movie maintains it's magic.Emma Watson as Belle manages her role very well and surprises with her talent to sing. Dan Stevens has make-up almost unrecognizable, but digitally created monsters face and eyes are brought to screen so lively and humanly as possible. Strong story, great characters and Alan Menken's score is so beautiful watch and hear, that it sensitize even strongest viewer.

Something...Not There,"(Spoilers ahead, possibly)As much as I love Disney, shame on them for insisting on modernizing classic animated movies by making live-action remakes. From the moment I heard of this movie being in production, a part of me knew that it would never measure up to the beloved 1991 film, yet try to compensate for this fact with some *grand* musical numbers and better developed elements of the story and characters...This movie, in my opinion, is just okay, and I would not mind never watching it after that first viewing (save for a few scenes toward the end). In my opinion, B&tB tries a bit too hard to impress viewers of a new generation (predictable), and the use of auto-tune on the female lead was annoying and unnecessary (none of that that rubbish, or cast an actress who can actually sing well!) The new songs enhance the story but are altogether unmemorable. The live-action versions of Mrs. Potts and the rest of the enchanted objects looked so dainty and realistic, it was creepy and ""unmagical"" to me. As for the main characters, the writers did not even seem to give Gaston a chance. He was deeply unlikable from the beginning, so his characterization was not very well-rounded in this version (villains deserve even a bit of love/empathy).There are enough remakes/reboots being made nowadays, and I find it upsetting that Disney ended up tampering with one of its classics. This movie is a bit of a disappointment. Listen to the other reviewers stating you would be better off re-watching the original.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Uneven yet not bad movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.I really did enjoy the first ~45 min. or so of ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2017).

Set design, costumes, even some acting were great. The story here well known, and it doesn't provide anything new or original - you know what your are getting into.

I understand Disney intent and praise them for it, but an African-American priest is just so historically inaccurate that I could never really get into the story and forget I was watching a movie from outside. For someone a little familiar with European history, this characterization was forced, artificial, excessive, totally unnecessary for the plot, and overall a constant reminder of how terrible this movie was.A piece of advice: better watching the animated masterpiece of 1991 (again) than losing your time with this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pure escapism,"20 March 2017 Film of choice at the Plaza Dorchester tonight - Beauty and the Beast. If I was only allowed to use one word to describe this film I guess it would be spectacular, but I'm glad there are more words available as I want to use a lot of them. This film was sumptuous, extravagant, romantic, dark, joyful, and spectacular. Emma Watson was the perfect casting for Belle as she radiated naivety, beauty and the compassion we come to expect of this character. Dan Stevens played the beast and brought a tenderness to the part. Luke Evans shone as Gaston oozing stupidity, boorishness and an evil sly malevolence when he didn't get his own way. This live action version of the Disney animation excelled in what it does best, bringing the stories of our imagination alive on the screen. There were moments of joy, moments of sorrow, moments that made us laugh and that made us cry, and although we all know the story, I find myself still willing the good guys to win as the film comes to its glorious conclusion. Although I knew who most of the cast were, it was still a wonderful moment when the true characters of the household objects were revealed. I must applaud the costume department and the people in charge of the set, I feel I could watch this film every week for year and look behind the characters to see something new every time.

"Wonderful Movie, But It Does Remind Me...","I love this live-action adaptation of the 1991 Disney animated classic.

Ms. Watson is a lovely person-- who can not sing.Back in the day, Hollywood producers for a big budget musical most likely would have insisted that Marnie Nixon and other professional singers overdub the singing parts for tone-deaf actors. Now producers seem to insist that tone-deaf actors attempt their own singing--for authenticity, I guess.I really, really adore this movie.
