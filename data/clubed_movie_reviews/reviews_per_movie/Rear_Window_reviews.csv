First-rate thriller,"Having watched it for the second time recently, I was struck by how razor-sharp the film's script actually was. Sure, it didn't have a big Agatha Christie-type mystery reveal; but the banter and repartee between the main characters was just so well-written. Of course, the film's framing and camerawork is legendary (for good reason) and Grace Kelly has a luminous screen presence. Suspenseful, intriguing, and a film that shows off a master at the peak of his craft.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Master In Control,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience's thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn't trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before. There's less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it's romantic about couples and cynical about people. There's a little bit of everything in it,--it's a work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rear Window is 64,"I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Our Obsession with Voyeurism,"After viewing 'Rear Window' again, I've come to realize that Alfred Hitchcock was not only a great moviemaker but also a great moviewatcher. In the making of 'Rear Window,' he knew exactly what it is about movies that makes them so captivating. It is the illusion of voyeurism that holds our attention just as it held Hitchcock's. The ability to see without being seen has a spellbinding effect. Why else is it so uncommon to have characters in movies look directly into the camera? It just isn't as fun to watch someone when they know you're there. When we watch movies, we are participating in looking into another world and seeing the images of which we have no right to see and listening to the conversations that we should not hear. 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom' are some of the best movies that aren't afraid to admit this human trait. We are all voyeurs.When watching 'Rear Window,' it is better to imagine Alfred Hitchcock sitting in that wheelchair rather than Jimmy Stewart. When the camera is using longshots to watch the neighborhood, it is really Hitchcock watching, not Stewart. Hitchcock's love of voyeurism is at the center of this movie, along with his fascination with crime and his adoration of the Madonna ideal.In many of Hitchcock's movies, 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' 'Psycho,' 'The Birds,' etc, the blonde actresses are objects. Notice how rarely they get close with the male leads. In 'Vertigo,' Stewart's character falls in love with the image of Madeleine; in 'Psycho,' we see the voyeur in Hitchcock peeking out of Norman Bates at Marion; and in 'Rear Window,' Jeff would rather stare out of his window than to hold the beautiful Lisa by his side. For Hitchcock, these women are ideals that should be admired rather than touched.However, the story of 'Rear Window' isn't about the image of women, as it is in 'Vertigo.' 'Rear Window' focuses more on seduction of crime, not in committing it but in the act of discovering it. At one point in the story, Jeff's friend convinces him that there was no murder, and Jeff is disappointed, not because someone wasn't dead but because he could no longer indulge into his fantasy that someone was. Think how popular crime shows are on television, and noir films at the movies. People do not want to commit crimes; they want to see other people commit them.'Rear Window' is one of the most retrospective movies I've ever seen. In a span of two hours, it examines some of the most recurrent themes in film. When we watch 'Rear Window,' it is really us watching someone watch someone else. And all the while, Hitchcock is sitting on the balcony and seeing our reaction. It is an act of voyeurism layered on top of itself, and it allows us to examine our own behavior as we are spellbound in Hitchcock's world. The only thing that I feel is missing in the movie is a scene of Jeff using his binoculars and seeing himself in a mirror. Why did Hitchcock leave it out? Maybe because it would have been too obvious what he was doing. Or maybe he was afraid that the audience would see themselves in the reflection of the lens.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Deep & Entertaining Classic,"One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, ""Rear Window"" is a deep and entertaining classic with many strengths, and a little bit of everything.  A fine suspense story is combined with romantic tension in the main plot, and there are numerous sub-plots, some humorous and some moving, all with many psychological overtones.  The main characters are wonderfully portrayed and full of life.  The apparently simple setting in an apartment complex is developed into a world filled with intriguing and sometimes unsettling possibilities, and this apparently average neighborhood comes to life with a wealth of lavish visual detail and interesting minor characters.  It is the kind of film-making that (like many of Hitchcock's greatest movies) is very flattering to the viewer.  The director assumes that his audience will pay close enough attention to appreciate the many subtleties with which he has filled the movie.  It rewards both careful attention and repeated viewings, since there is much more here than merely a suspense plot, as good as that story is in itself.For the first 30 minutes or so, we simply get to know the characters.  Jimmy Stewart gives one of his best performances as a photographer recuperating from an injury, forced to spend several weeks staring out his apartment window at the minor dramas in the lives of his neighbors.  Grace Kelly is ideal in the role of his perfect girlfriend, who can never find a way to break down Stewart's reserve.  The study of their relationship would have made a good movie by itself.  Almost every action and every word between them is filled with meaning, and what they see in the lives of others is an interesting reflection of the tensions and possibilities in their own present and future.  Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a colorful, no-nonsense nurse who constantly sheds some light - sometimes unwanted - on what is happening between them.  The action and suspense that occur later serves in large part as a catalyst that resolves some of the important issues between the two.After we get to know the characters and their world, things start to happen, as Stewart becomes engrossed in some of the things he has seen.  The ethical and moral concerns of meddling in others' affairs become intertwined with more urgent questions about what may have happened in those other apartments, and from then on the tension builds steadily.  It leads up to a riveting climactic sequence filled with suspense, and made even more meaningful by our awareness of its deeper significance to the main characters.There is much more that could be said, but you should see this for yourself. It is a classic that will be enjoyed not only by thriller fans, but by anyone who appreciates carefully crafted movies with a lot of depth.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Hitchcock masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window' as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo' (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom'.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho' (#18) and `Vertigo' (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10. `Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well of course when you've got nothing better to do with a broken leg you will accuse your neighbor of murder!,"Finally, I watched ""Rear Window"" by famous Alfred Hitchcock. First off, I saw this movie on the top 250, and it's #14 on top of that! I mean, it's gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I'm a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie ""Rear Window"", I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it's a good reference if it's from The Simpsons.""Rear Window"" is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years, this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart, he's just so great as L.B., I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn't even try, but you can't help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn't have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he's a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza, she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility, and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.'s heart.I loved the ending, to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza. I won't tell, you'll just have to trust me, it was a brilliant way to breath and smile again after all the suspense and drama. ""Rear Window"" is a true classic and I'm extremely grateful to the reviewers of IMDb who saw this movie and gave it great reviews, and the writers of The Simpsons! If it were not for you guys, I nor other members of my generation would probably not view it! Let's keep this classic alive!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sophisticated Hitchcock, with a wonderful performance from James Stewart!","Rear Window is a one of the more sophisticated Hitchcock films, and I will always consider it a masterpiece. It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as ""the villain of the piece,"" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Reading from Top to Bottom...Hitchcock's Sophisticated Masterpiece,"Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated...?,"The more I watch Hitchcock and the more I compare my impressions with the reviews of other people, the more I start to think that maybe I do not like his style. I love the genre he works with and I appreciate him very much, but either the most reviewers are following the hype and rating his movie too high because that's expected from ""true cinephiles"" or I simply don't get him the way most people do. I saw 16 of his movies so far and my average rating is 6,9 which places him slightly above average. ""Rear Window"" is a perfect example. It is considered to be one of the best films of all time, but to me, it's nothing special. I have no objections to it thou, but I do not see what's there to praise so much. Good movie, but not the great one and definitely overrated.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Hitchcock masterpiece.,"Photographer L. B. Jefferies is temporarily wheelchair bound, and spends his days staring out of his apartment window into the courtyard, observing everyone's activities. He becomes convinced that a murder has occured.Alfred Hitchcock is regarded by many as the master of suspense, and I don't think there's a better example of a suspense thriller than Rear Window.Hitchcock created several masterpieces, Rear Window is one of them, it's a fascinating study of human nature, the natural curiosity and fascination to observe people.Jefferies has a natural curiosity, but his circumstances heighten that curiosity, with nothing else to do, he watches everything, absorbing every single detail. He's essentially looking at a goldfish bowl, his world becomes that courtyard, he sees everything.Every single character is fascinating, the dancer, the woman drinking alone, and or course the man who's wife vanishes.James Stewart is excellent as Jefferies, he is superb in the role, Grace Kelly is terrific also, the epitome of glamour and elegance.Doesn't anyone close their curtains, or pull the blinds, thank goodness they don't.One of my top ten films of all time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Form over content,"Rear Window is particularly interesting for two things. The first, is the excellent direction and staging, Hitchcock's trademark. The second is the innovative concept of the confined, voyeuristic story.Because let's face it, the script didn't match the expectation. The plot is a lot too predictable from start to finish. One tries to establish theories, collect hypothetical clues, when ultimately there is no surprise at all because everything that Jefferies imagines turns out to be the exact truth. Where are the misleads for examples, one of the basic thriller elements ? In these conditions, the outcome is a real deception because of its predictability.Add the fact that there are overlong passages such as some voyeuristic scenes or well written yet pointless dialogues, and you get a pseudo thriller, little dynamic, with no suspense or tension, that stands out more because of its form that its content.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Excellent. Sharp, clever, funny, inventive, with great values all round.","Ah it's a movie that's in IMDB's Top 20, and it has good reason to be. For starter's let's look at the simple premise - James Stewart is L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is currently recovering from an injury on assignment. With his broken leg he's stuck in his apartment, with nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours and be visited by his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly), his officer friend Wendell, and his nurse, Stella. Jeffries observes the coming and goings of the various apartments he can observe (from his rear apartment window) and it is one of these - a Raymond Burr - who draws his attention because. could it be that the man has committed some heinous crime? Let's find out.One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment. This would seem claustrophobic but Hitchcock never inhibits us like this - he lets us escape through Jeffries binoculars and camera lenses, and his roving camera swoops down to let us see what the characters see (but never, thankfully, anything more than that - this is how you do suspense!). The set design is wonderful - the apartment is just the right size and is nicely laid out. However the real praise is for all the other apartments visible to Jeffries - an actual habitable set with multiple stories where characters can be observed only as they pass by their own windows (yeah, they don't care much for curtains). There's a sense of individuality gone in to each home, despite the fact we can only see barely elements of each. This is helped by a nice, differing range of characters inhabiting each and going about their daily lives - there's a mini soap-opera contained in the movie, all observed at a distance. Excellent stuff.Acting? It's great here. There's some nice depth to the characters here, with them feeling like actual real people rather than slick one-dimensional tags. Stewart is very proficient in this type of role - he was born to it - and Kelly proves she is more than just a pretty face, managing to effuse her character with both grace (*groan*) and steel. Even supporting characters like Stella are good (she has a wickedly black sense of thinking that's hilarious). What's so incredible is that the characters we observe from a distance in the other apartments (and with whom we never actually interact with) have as much depth as most main characters in movies nowadays. Excellent script and acting in this movie.I've already praised Hitchcock's set location and camera work, so I won't prattle on about him much more. He does a stellar job here and, in my opinion, this is the best piece of work he's done (that I've seen). It's virtually flawless and you're never let down (or bored). Well done. It's a shame he lost out on an Oscar (although he did have tough competition that year with `On the Waterfront').`Rear Window' is a great example of how you can successfully have sharp acting, script, and directing and not feel the need for a slew of swear words and gratuitous violence. Regarded as a classic, and deservedly so. 9.1/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
"In the mid-fifties, Hitchcock brought remarkable suspense by reverting to the logic of a silent film (with an observer behind the lens as the hero)","Many reviewers and critics have commented on Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the voyeur in Rear Window (the mere thought of a voyeur in a suspense film conjures up images from other classic Hitchcock films), and I felt that voyeuristic bug as well.  But I realized something that I hadn't thought of as I watched it for the first time- this is a return for Hitchcock to his skills as a master of silent-film chills.  As L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart in one of his most infamous performances) is in his wheelchair viewing out one perspective to other inhabitants in the apartment, the audience views right along-side him.  So, for more or less 50 percent of the film, the only sounds we hear are the sounds of mere realism, as Hitch's camera keeps a close eye on things.As the thrills build in the second hour of the film there is considerably more dialog than the first hour.  This could, and occasionally does, present a challenge for the audience member that could either be accepted & payed off or resented- can one sit back and just watch things unfold as in a film from the 20's?  Personally, the experience of seeing these events unfold and increase was near electrifying.  Along with Stewart's performance, which ranges from amusing to terrified, compelling to frightened (i.e. Hitch's 'everyday man'), there's Grace Kelly as Lisa, who carries her own beauty & inner conflicts, and Raymond Burr as Thorvold, who could have things going a little better with his wife.If we empathize with Jeff, it's because we become as much apart of his mind-set/POV as he already is, and that's the ticket to the film's true success.  Not only is there a magnetic kind of skill to which Hitchcock (and cinematographer Robert Burks) presents us with the apartments' supporting and minor characters and how their fates are played out against the enclosed backdrop, but the psychology of Jeff becomes parallel, or against, to the audience's.  This is the story of one man's temptation and compulsion to be involved with those he can see (much like movie-goers have with any given film), and how perception of the realities around him become ours.  Rear Window may have become dated for some movie-goers, particularly since the theme has been played on by other movies and TV shows (like The Simpsons for example).  Yet there is a certain effectiveness to it all, even in the earlier scenes, that holds an edge over imitators.  A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tremendous thriller. Classic Hitchcock.,"In '54, I was seven years old and this is one of the first 'grown up' movies I remember seeing.

He thinks that he witnessed a murder and has trouble convincing his girlfriend, Grace Kelly, to help prove a crime was committed.Three scenes that always stuck with me:(1) Stewart fighting off his attacker with flashbulbs (2) the smoldering kiss (3) the glowing cigarette in the dark apartment.Every bit a classic.

Hitchcock and voyeurism,"Rear Window is a film that's been talked about for decades and having finally watched it, I can see why.Rear Window follows L. B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photographer who spies on his neighbours from his window and becomes convinced one of them has committed a murder.There's so much Rear Window does extremely well but what I really love is its commentary on voyeurism and how Alfred Hitchcock manipulates the audience. The stofy is very interesting and Hitchcock makes sure we see it through our protagonist, L. B. Jefferies. Having him be wheelchair-bound connects the audience with him further as we're also in the same position. Hitchcock also restricts the camera within his apartment without letting us explore inside the neighbours' worlds. We only see what Jefferies sees and based on that we form our own opinions on his neighbours just like him. This sparks the debate on voyeurism and the morality of it. Should we really be peering into other people's lives? It's a trait we have and it's what we do when we watch films or TV shows. We're taken into a new world with characters we're unfamiliar with and we form our assumptions based off what is shown on screen. Hitchcock uses this to his advantage to toy with our thoughts and question what we're viewing. He never shows us what's fully going on in these people's lives which helps us doubt our protagonist and adds to the mystery of what's really happening.Hitchcock builds the tension so well by constantly making us go back and forth on what we think is going on, leading to one of the most suspenseful climaxes I've seen in a film. The dark cinematography accompanied by the absence of the score makes up for a truly thrilling yet entertaining finish. No wonder he's regarded as ""The Master of Suspense"". Having James Stewart play the lead was a great choice considering his much loved persona during the time. He's likeable in the role and plays the character really well. Grace Kelly is elegant all the way through. I love the development of the relationship between her and Stewart and she adds a real charm to the film. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey were also great in their roles. Despite having very few lines, Raymond Burr was excellent as the mysterious Mr. Thorwald.This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best works. With beautiful filmmaking, intriguing social commentary and fantastic acting, Rear Window is a classic that people should see immediately.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Rear Window, Forward Cinema","Why on earth a man, heterosexual and still relatively young, would spend his time looking out of his window when in his rooms there is a woman like Grace Kelly could be the real mystery left after watching Rear Window, the 1954 masterpiece directed by Alfred Hitchcock.Besides this cheeky and impudent question, this is really a masterpiece, one of the films most loved by his director and one of his more sophisticated, both narratively as well as cinematographically. Loosely based on a relatively unknown 1942 short story written by Cornell Woolrich, It Had to Be Murder, Rear Window sees L.B. Jefferies, a successful photo reporter played with enough confidence and progressive involvement by James Stewart, confined in his New York small apartment with a broken and plastered leg. In the sweltering summer heat, he turns and focuses his attention and lenses to the neighbouring apartments facing his condo's backyard, observing them with a fast growing interest that rapidly becomes excited voyeurism when he starts suspecting that a uxoricide took place in an opposite flat. Albeit reluctantly, also his beautiful fiancée Lisa, a Grace Kelly whose first appearance in the film is one of the most esthetically captivating close ups in movies history and fully justifies the hot ice nickname given to her allegedly by Alfred Hitchcock, as well as both the solid, down to earth nurse Stella, caustically played by a vitriolic Thelma Ritter, and the reluctant detective Tom Doyle, a fairly stolid Wendell Corey full of banal common sense, are drawn into his obsession with what neighbour Lars Thorwald, an imposing Raymond Burr, might or might not have done to his nagging wife.The opening credits reveal straight away one of the movie's multiple codes, when the curtains of James raise to reveal the fixed scene of the coming attraction, the very same back yard where all flats look into. From then on, a static journey begins that reverses many established principles of the 50s filmmaking: the main character does not move, all the other, secondary casts actually play in front of him. The viewer, barring a short yet important moment when James Stewart falls asleep, has the same point of view of the protagonist, sees and interprets the story through the eyes and expressions of him. The soundtrack comes from within the movie, mostly heard from one of the apartments where a musician is living.All these filmic and narrative details, together with the crafted and perfect jigsaw of which each apartment and neighbours' live is a piece, are added to the self-conscious study of voyeurism and the essential role of cinema to make an essential film, where no shot, no dialogue is redundant, and an evergreen masterpiece, at the same time celebrating and subverting the Hollywood's codes.
This is not the only Hitchcock's movie constructed in a theatrical form, but in no other the British master was able to extremize with such genius and depth of analysis the intertwined relationships between the eye and the mind, mixing like an esoteric alchemist obsessions and humor, suspense and sexuality, flashing light and silent darkness, individuality and collectivity, reality and perceptions.

What's the big deal?,"I love Hitchcocks' movies--he was undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of our time--but what's the big deal about this movie.  It's well-directed (obviously) and the acting is good, but the story is predictable, the dialogue dull (except for a few of Thelma Ritter's wisecracks) and it's just plain boring!  Also I can't seriously accept the fact that someone as beautiful and classy as Grace Kelly would fall in love with Stewart.  He's old enough to be her father!  So, I don't see why everybody loves this film, and I consider it one of Hitchcocks' lesser works.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' Still Stands as a Masterful Example of Visual Storytelling and Suspense,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is a masterful suspense film that has stood the test of time. Released in 1954, the movie still holds up as a classic example of the power of visual storytelling. The film stars James Stewart as L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is confined to his apartment with a broken leg. Bored and restless, Jeffries spends his days watching his neighbors through his rear window. But when he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors has committed murder, Jeffries finds himself in the middle of a dangerous investigation.The film's strength lies in its simplicity. Hitchcock keeps the action confined to Jeffries' apartment and the surrounding courtyard, which creates a sense of claustrophobia and intensifies the tension. The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the suspense to build slowly until the final, thrilling climax.Stewart delivers a standout performance as Jeffries, perfectly capturing his character's frustration and growing sense of dread. The supporting cast, which includes Grace Kelly as Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa and Thelma Ritter as his nurse Stella, is equally strong.But what really makes ""Rear Window"" stand out is Hitchcock's skill as a visual storyteller. The film is filled with carefully crafted shots that reveal just enough information to keep the audience engaged and guessing. Hitchcock uses light and shadow to great effect, creating a moody atmosphere that perfectly complements the film's suspenseful tone.Overall, ""Rear Window"" is a classic of the suspense genre and a must-see for fans of Hitchcock and cinema in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is a Hitchcock gem that is a must see,"Rear Window (1954) is currently available on Prime and tells the tale of a photographer who is stuck home after an accident leaves him injured. He becomes obsessed with watching his neighbors out of his windows and avoiding marriage with a perfect girlfriend. When he suspects his neighbor of cheating and about to leave his wife he notices he starts acting funny. Then one day something horrible seems to have happened and the neighbors wife seems missing. Could he have killed her and plans to escape or is it just the photographers imagination? This movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and stars James Stewart (Vertigo), Princess of Monaco 🇲🇨 Grace Kelly (To Catch A Thief) and Thelma Ritter (All About Eve). The acting in this is out of this world as James Stewart and Kelly play off eachother well and portray the evolution of their characters throughout the film perfectly. The script is excellent as you'd expect from Hitchcock and the intensity of the events - both across the street and within the relationship are well depicted. Grace Kelly continues the list of blond bombshells Hitchcock targeted as actresses that were both gorgeous and over the top talented. This entire movie is essentially on one set and is still so good. The scenarios that unfold during the peeping Tom moments are fun and the ending is intense and well executed. This is a Hitchcock gem that is a must see and a solid 9-9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ode to Hitchcock, part six","Have you ever gotten the feeling like you're being watched when you're standing on the balcony or doing some housework at your apartment? There are a lot of peeping Toms out there who watch other people; I'm sure we've all caught ourselves peeping out the window once in a while to see what our neighbors are doing, and for what? Is our life too unexciting? Do we have nothing better to do? I guess it's just in the human nature to be interested in somebody else's business especially when our imagination can allow us to make up an exciting story behind ordinary lives of others.""Rear window"" tells a story of a photographer who has to stay at home because of a broken leg and because he got used to excitement he seeks it in the lives of his neighbors; and you know what they say - if you're looking for adventures you will surely find some.There's something fishy going on in everyone's lives if you're just looking from outside. ""Rear window"" proves its name by telling us that not all we see and interpret reflects the reality but sometimes it does. James Stewart's character knows what he wants - a life full of fun, solving mysteries, getting impressions, doing what he does best; Grace's character also knows what she wants and that's to be with the person she loves no matter what inconveniences might come her way. She wants to find the bridge that could connect her to her loved one on the other side even if it lies through somebody else's abyss.""Rear window"" is a perfect example of a thriller: a presumably light-hearted mood at the beginning, a little drama and something to think about, a mystery, its slowly growing suspense with a cherry of paranoia and doubts on top, the pinnacle and the final resolution. Almost complete absence of musical score makes you sit nervously glued to your chair along with the main protagonist and watch this wonderful picture until the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Before setting out on the journey, if you are given a synopsis, it's difficult to imagine how the slight story can hold one's attention for nearly two hours. There are in effect multiple plots extending beyond the suspected murder. Each apartment holding it's own narrative and inviting the viewer into the private lives of the block. We care about all the characters in these sub plots, holding both humour and tragedy in their confined spaces. The developing relationship between the two excellent leads is the icing on the cake. Grace Kelly is stunning, and did James Stewart ever make a bad film? Hitchcock in his prime.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enforced Idleness,"Alfred Hitchcock's second film with James Stewart is the story of Stewart's enforced idleness due to a broken leg. He's an active man, a news photographer, who constantly pushes himself into dangerous situations to get a picture and got a broken leg incidentally. Idleness for him is sure torture.Fortunately or unfortunately as things turn out he has a Greenwich Village apartment with a Rear Window that allows him to look on the neighbors across the courtyard. It's like watching about 15 different soap operas at once. And with his photographic equipment including a zoom telephoto lens, Stewart gets himself involved with the various soap opera plots.Stewart also has a girl friend in Grace Kelly who is playing a part that is really no stretch for her, a Park Avenue chic and rich woman who's really had quite a life of comfort. Stewart doesn't think she's ready for his kind of life and they have a running quarrel.That is until Stewart puts some conclusions together from observing one of the apartments and he thinks that salesman Raymond Burr has killed his wife. Although he can't convince his detective friend Wendell Corey, he does slowly convince Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter his nurse of the validity of his conclusions.Everyone here does a creditable job, but I think the best performance comes from Raymond Burr. Burr, who played a lot of villains on the screen, usually plays them tough and mean. Hitchcock did a superb job in getting a performance of a really frightened man. Seeing the story of Burr and his wife through Stewart's eyes, it's the story of two very ordinary people apparently mismatched. Up until the last 15 minutes of Rear Window, we see Burr at a distance like the rest of Stewart's soap operas. When we do see him up close we find a very ordinary, but frightened man. It's his very ordinariness that makes Burr so frightening. The audience sees themselves in him, could we commit murder if sufficiently pushed hard enough?I suppose if James Stewart had a broken leg in 2005 and was laid up that way, he'd be busy on his personal computer and wouldn't have time to be looking across the courtyard. Televisions were still a luxury item in 2005. My grandparents still didn't have one at that date. Today Stewart could get all the afternoon soap opera action he wanted.A remake of Rear Window was done in 1998 with Christopher Reeve. Of course the difference is that Reeve was a paraplegic and dealing with a real and permanent situation on film and in his life. It was a whole new kind of Rear Window.Rear Window has all the elements one expects from Hitchcock, thrilling plot, witty and sophisticated dialog and a wry conclusion to it all.

"Raymond Burr was born on May 21st, 1917","Voyeurism, the stimulation of the libido and a slick murder mystery are the key instruments used by Hitchcock in Rear Window (1954). However, the most important aspect of this film, that must garner attention, is the incredible sense of timing, in all aspects of this film. Just like the magic he was able to tap into, six years earlier, with Rope (1948), the timing in this film is perfect also. I guarantee something like this could not be duplicated today the way it was then. Today's filmmakers would wind up using computers, CGI effects and every other technological trick available in the 21st century, but all Hitchcock had was a stopwatch. The fact that Hitchcock was able to orchestrate all of this is incredible. Each window is its own movie or play, that has to start and end on time, so the camera can move onto the next window. Each actor had to be ready to say their line, pick up a newspaper or play a song on the piano in the allotted amount of time needed.Another incredible aspect, that clearly represented Hitchcock's greatness, was his ability to exhume emotions from his actors with minimal use of energy. Of course, the actors had a little hand in this themselves. Grace Kelly, with plenty of clothes on, saying appropriate lady-like things, was able to show a sexiness, that is on par with, in today's terms, with Jessica Alba in a bikini. Please don't tell me, that you are not on the edge of your seat, watching Raymond Burr do whatever the heck he is doing throughout the film. You do not want to close your eyes out of fear of what might come next. The stimulation of the libido, seeing the woman as the stronger character, watching people in a voyeuristic way, would not have worked as well as it does, if this wasn't a Hitchcock film. This is why, for my money, Rear Window (1954), is the greatest movie ever made. Oh! Did I mention that Jimmy Stewart was in it? As always, he is awesome.9.9 (A+ MyGrade) = 10 IMDB.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sorry But I fail To See Why It's So Regarded,"I was really looking forward to seeing to seeing Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW because of the massive acclaim it's had from film critics , and when I say "" film critics "" I mean everyone from the professional journalists who have their own columns in broadsheets to people with real jobs who contribute their own amateur - But by no means amateurish - comments on this website . In fact much my desire to see this movie was down to the it being listed at number 14 on the IMDb top 250 movies list , so I stayed up late last week to watch it on television where it was broadcast at the ungodly hour of 2am and I'm afraid I was bitterly disappointedMaybe it was the fact that it was well past my bedtime that I could hardly keep my eyes open but it could have been down to the fact that this is one slow moving thriller and the more I think about it the more I start to think that the screenplay was originally written for radio ! The action is very static with Jeff Jeffries lying in bed recovering from an accident looking into a courtyard that is obviously a pastel coloured studio stage . I wasn't expecting explosions and car chases but I was expecting exciting plot twists not a film where the hero spends all day in bedIs Jeff really a hero anyway ? How would you react to someone who likes to watch pretty young girls sunbathing all day ? And instead of the always likable James Stewart playing the role how would you react if the part had gone to a lecherous bald middle aged man with glasses ? That's right you'd react like one of the villagers from a FRANKENSTIEN movie and lead a torch carrying mob to burn down Jeff's apartmentI won't go into the plot but I will warn anyone who hasn't seen it not to expect very much .

"I spy, with my little eye, the most overrated Alfred Hitchcock thriller.","This is likely to go down as the least popular user-comment in history, but then so be it. I believe in honesty and freedom of speech. Although universally considered as one of the top three (or maybe top five) best thrillers that Alfred Hitchcock made in his lengthy and undeniably brilliant career, I personally feel that ""Rear Window"" is the most overrated movie of all times and I sincerely can't fathom why it's such a cinematic landmark. I reckon that the basic plot idea is utmost intriguing and that it's rather inventive how the cameras film literally everything from within the same secluded living room location, but that about sums up all the film's strengths. The narcistic photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) sits immobilized in his apartment, bound to both a wheelchair and a humongous plaster cast around his leg ever since he took too much risk during a photo shoot on a racetrack. Purely out of boredom, he begins to watch all his neighbors across the little cement garden. The watching quickly turns into observing with binoculars and then into spying with his most professional & strongest photo lenses. He then thinks he witnesses a middle-aged man murdering his wife in cold blood, but a befriended police inspector, his lovely girlfriend and even his nosy housekeeper have trouble believing him. I was particularly annoyed by the behavior and ignorance of the protagonist. Jeff is supposed to be an intelligent person, so he must understand or at least respect that the police can't just go invading someone's private property and interrogate them about a possibly felony for which there isn't any evidence. The entire film evidently revolves on L.B. Jefferies' arrogant persona, and of course it doesn't help that I never really liked the actor James Stewart. I can appreciate him when his characters aren't omnipresent, like in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" for example, but here he was rapidly getting on my nerves. The other characters, including Grace Kelly who never looked prettier, are downgraded to mere extras. I am also aware that practically every review praises that the powerful impact of ""Rear Window"" lies in the fact that it's a statement on the human towards voyeurism and blah blah, but to me a film has to be entertaining and plausible first and foremost.""Read Window"" along with ""Vertigo"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" made me realize that can't get into Hitch's espionage or 'wrong-man-condemned' thrillers, and that I find his more polished thrillers extremely boring, unrealistic and overrated.

Nosy neighbour.,"'Rear Window (1954)' is one of the greatest films of all time, a thriller that does more with its single location than most movies do with their entire world.

Hitchock Classic,"Rear Window is considered one of Hitchcock's classics, and is probably Jimmy Stewart's most famous Hitchcock Role.  Stewart plays an adventure-seeking photographer who is laid up for seven weeks in his apartment with a broken leg.  During this time, he has become vicariously involved with his neighbors; looking out his rear windows and following their lives.  As the final week of his incapacity begins, he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors has killed his wife, and pretty soon his girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and nurse (Thelma Ritter) realize that he may be right.I seem to get more out of Rear Window the older I get  there are subtleties to the relationship, and to the lives of the other apartment dwellers that I catch as an adult, and didn't when I was younger.  One thing that has remained a constant however is the methodical pacing and the slow tension that builds up to outright terror.  I get just as tense and nervous during the last ten minutes of the film as a 30 year old as I did when I first saw the film at age 10.  It is only as I got older that I realized the helplessness of Stewart's character, and how important that element was to the plot along with its contribution to the uneasiness of the film.I've heard more than once that people have been bored during this film  of course, that is an opinion and cannot be judged, but I find it hard to relate to that, as I believe that even without the elements of suspense, Rear Window still makes a great story and film:  Which is just one of the many reasons it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films to this day.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The right thriller at the right time,"The opening shot Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork Rear Window is a chilling one; one that shows off the film's bold colors, common setting, and artistic voyeurism. It simply shows the small courtyard outside that can be viewed through the rear windows of the Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan, specifically James Stewart's character's, as the bright red blinds roll up, revealing each individual section of the window. Playing in the background is a peaceful score and after about one minute and forty seconds of credits and a static camera, Hitchcock moves us outside that window, showing us the sights of the village's backyard. From flower beds, to cats lounging around, to a dog being transported from the top balcony to the ground below, etc, the sight is familiar and commonplace to this specific setting. After a few minutes of a relaxing and almost romantic stroll through the wonders of Greenwich's backyard we meet out main character.His name is L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart), a professional photographed now confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. He remains in his apartment during a brutal heatwave, where he and his neighbors keep their windows open all day and night. Jeff passes the time by watching his neighbors go about their daily routines; one of which is a young, attractive dancer he cleverly names ""Miss Torso"", a woman who often sits all by her lonesome, a pianist, a sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a wife confined to her bedroom because of an illness.Jeff frequently gets visits from his wealthy and gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), but while the two have notable chemistry and know how to take care of each other well, Jeff simply views her as too perfect. He confesses this to Stella (Thelma Ritter), the sassy, home-care nurse he has been assigned to and states how he would much rather have a woman with more visible flaws than one who seems to ooze perfection and gorgeousness with every step she makes.One night, however, this thought becomes nothing but a faint memory when Jeff awakes to the sound of a woman screaming and glass breaking. The noise comes from Thorwald's apartment, the apartment directly across from Jeff's rear window. Jeff then sees Thorwald leaving his home and is troubled by the sudden disappearance of Thorwald's wife over the next few days. Frequent spying and self-contemplation (along with bouncing the ideas off of the heads of Lisa and Stella) leads Jeff to arrive at the conclusion that Thorwald murdered his wife for reasons unknown to him. He then spends long hours watching Thorwald's every move, trying to arrive at a sensible conclusion for an action that is unjustifiable.Hitchcock achieves the power and impact necessary for a film like this thanks to his act of making the audience a voyeur in their own right. We can judge Jeff about snooping and eavesdropping on his neighbors all we want, but are we looking away during the film? Are we the ones covering our eyes when Jeff pulls out binoculars to see across the courtyard? If not, and we're criticizing him for his actions, we are not only hypocrites but we are condemning ourselves and our own actions. We are disagreeing with our own practices and not even recognizing them.Hitchcock leaves us with this uncomfortable feeling of seeing something we're really not supposed to or overhearing things that weren't intended for our ears. This kind of filmmaking is wonderful, especially for the time when audiences were most often used to being in a place of comfort. Films of the fifties, like Singin' in the Rain, offered a happier escape and put us in a place of joyful exuberance. Hitchcock dared to make us feel uncomfortable and make us feel unsettled at all times. He utilized lengthy shots, establishing a mood by showing off all the simple, day-to-day occurrences in a typical courtyard in America. These lengthy shots are key to the film's success. The only thing better than Jeff and Lisa conversing about everyday life or their relationship is when the scenes do the talking for us and that's key to Rear Window's success. It keeps a simple story relatively basic but also dares to let us experience the environment without the burden of chatter.Every Hitchcock film has, what he has dubbed, a ""MacGuffin,"" or something tangible (or intangible) that the characters in the film are searching for that we, the audience, may or may not care about. The MacGuffin here is simply proof, proof in favor of Jeff's case. With this MacGuffin, the audience is put in an odd place. We want Jeff to achieve the satisfaction of him being able to prove his case and not be made a fool of, but we also want this all to be a misunderstanding and find that Thorwald's wife isn't really dead. The way Hitchcock goes about trying to give us a two-faced MacGuffin is enticing entertainment.Rear Window is invigorating with tremendous features that make thrillers interesting. From lengthy shots, to great performances, to an interesting premise, and the idea of repercussions arising from unintentional actions. My knowledge and resume for Hitchcock films is depressingly low for a cinephile, and seeing Rear Window was a ""right place at the right time"" event considering my relatively low faith in modern thrillers and crime capers.Starring: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr.

Rear window movie review,"Rear window is such a unique and interesting movie. It is one that almost stands alone in its plot and camera angles and things of that sort. During the first twenty to thirty minutes of this movie it was almost extremely boring and I kept constantly asking myself the same question over and over again, which is ""are they really going to keep the camera in this one room for the whole movie?"" I kept on telling myself that the camera would probably move sometime soon and they would change scenery sometime soon, but that time just never came. Throughout the film it took sometime for me to actually accept the new movie style that Hitchcock portrays in this film. 
 During this film I went through almost 3 different stages of interest. The first stage consisted mostly of confusion and trying to figure out what was going on as they were introducing the different characters and scenarios. It was a very new movie feel for me so it took time to get used to. The second phase for me was unfortunately boredom, as I couldn't really engage into what was being played out in the different apartments. It wasn't until the end of the movie, about the time when the dog is found dead with its neck snapped that I really started to enjoy and became engaged in the film. The ending was very engaging and was extremely well done. It created an excellent sense of tension and suspense that I think engages every single viewer. During the whole process of watching the movie I can't really say I enjoyed it at all but once I looked back on it and realized the different cinematic elements and styles I came to appreciate it and understand it more.
 I definitely have a strong bias here because I was born into a generation of such great quality cameras and such good editing and animation. For this reason it can be really hard for me to engage in older movies of this style. Nonetheless this movie was very interesting to look back on and see how Hitchcock portrayed the characters in such an interesting way. It was so different and cool to basically see people as non-actors but just as every day people. You really get a sense of this when the movie is portraying someone in their everyday life without them supposedly knowing that they are being watched. You see the pureness of every shot. This film really enacts a different feeling in the viewer, as it is something were really not used to seeing.
 Overall I cant really say that I enjoyed this movie to much as I found it slightly boring and un-engaging. There are many great cinematic elements that make it very different and interesting. The whole stationary camera sense was just two different for me and I was able to really appreciate and enjoy the movie very much.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A colorful, friendly story...about a murder","Exceptionally likable movie about a desperate killer and his secret murder, yet also one about the bond of friendships and the camaraderie which arises in the face of exciting danger. Photographer James Stewart, laid up with a broken leg, gets to know the neighbors in his housing complex--by watching them all day out his back window (it's a sticky hot summer and everyone has their lashes up). This Alfred Hitchcock thriller gets off on the wrong foot by introducing Stewart's love-interest, Grace Kelly, rather clumsily. Kelly is supposed to look out of place in Stewart's rumpled apartment, with her designer dresses and Park Ave. manner, and we're meant to see that they are possibly an inappropriate match; however, Kelly's character wounds too easily, and the argument that ensues between she and Stewart isn't convincing. Luckily, she's allowed to warm up soon after, and she's wonderful when teamed with Thelma Ritter as Stewart's sharp little nursemaid. Ritter, in one of her best roles, keeps score on all that's going on and soon all three are involved in some mysterious doings happening across the courtyard. Dandy yarn has one of the most satisfying wrap-ups for a Hitchcock picture, and three fine actors who really get into these roles.

"Voyeurism, Murder, Stewart and Kelly Make for a Hitch High","It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's ""Rear Window"" is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like ""Miss Torso"" and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"". But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script. Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in ""Vertigo"" but still likable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character. Robert Burks' probing camera-work makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark film-making style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes. One of Hitchcock's best in an impressive canon of work.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"One of the greatest Hitchcock films, but not his best","While Psycho is still my favorite Hitchcock film, this comes very, very close to that. Having only seen the made-for-TV remake starring Christopher Reeves, I was quite excited to see this, as it's referred to by many as one of the(if not the) greatest Hitchcock thriller. Now, while I still prefer Psycho over this, I must say that it's a very well-done and effective mystery-thriller, and most of the second half had me almost biting my nails from suspense. The plot is very good, and its theme appeals to some of the most base instincts, including the tiny little voyeur that we all have. The pace is great, I was never bored during any point of the movie. The acting is great, Stewart and Kelly give excellent performances. The characters are all well-written, credible, and, as they almost always are under Hitchcock's direction; very human. The cinematography is excellent; most of the camera angles are from inside the main character's apartment, which creates a very effective and scary feeling of claustrophobia and adds to the suspense. The mystery keeps you guessing throughout the movie, but the ending seemed a little like a letdown... there's no definite answer to the mystery. Then again, maybe that was Hitchcock's intention... to any true mystery, there is no real answer. And Hitchcock probably wanted to have each viewer make up an answer for him- or herself. The film has some great suspense, and a few of the scenes will have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The ending was very close to being anticlimactic, but it managed to make up for it by having one of the most thrilling and nail-biting endings in a Hitchcock film ever. The main reason I rate Psycho higher than this on a personal scale is that the theme works better there... the killer is more easily understandable, while here he's just... well, sloppy and arrogant, half of the time. That was my one complaint while watching the movie, and it won't bring down my rating, not even a notch, because I'm positive it was the way Hitchcock intended it to be. His characters are always human, and what is more human than failing? I recommend this film to any fan of thriller, mystery and/or Hitchcock. You won't be disappointed. Great film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The most Hitchcockian of all Hitchcock movies.,"There is something about Rear Window which for me is the pinnacle of the Hitchcockian energy of suspense and intrigue. The whole film feels like you are sharing in the voyeurism and the mystery and suspense of what is happening.

"70 years later, still a great thriller.","I knew it was a classic and that Hitchcock is a master of his art but I did not expect to be so thoroughly engaged and entertained by this movie. While it's undeniable that everything about it makes it a product of the 50s, it's also eerie how much of it feels like it could easily be a contemporary movie with just small changes. Or in other words, from the story to the pacing to the characters lives and motives, it is not aging badly at all. But I have to confess that even though I am 70 years too late, I just fell in love hard with Grace Kelly... I swooned every time she was on screen! Just another reason to highly recommend this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Classy, gentle excitement with nice subtexts within the enjoyably tense main story","Jeff Jeffries is an adventure photographer for a major newspaper who, thanks to an attempt to get an action shot during a motor race, has found himself in a plaster cast spending his days and nights in a wheelchair. His only visitors are his carer Stella and his beautiful, but pressurising girlfriend Lisa and the majority of his time is spend staring out the window into the courtyard area of his apartment complex. It is during one typically hot night that he spots something funny going on inside one of the apartments opposite his  the woman of the house seems to be gone and the man is acting suspiciously; from the confines of his chair, Jeff keeps watch, with the case becoming increasingly clear to him and his friends.Despite having themes in common with many Hitchcock films, this stands out as being one of a couple of his movies that are accessible and entertaining to a wider audience. Using voyeurism as its central theme, the film takes us into a fairly straightforward mystery that is well told but also laced with subtexts and other windows to stare through. To me this makes it a better film because there is much that intrigued me about the characters and the neighbourhood while also providing me with an engaging mystery. Modern audiences who have seen this film copied and referenced countless times will doubtless struggle to see what the fuss is about and perhaps they are right as the story doesn't have the twists and turns that are considered the norm now in a lot of thrillers; but it is still strong enough to keep the interest. The voyeuristic nature of the characters is interesting  with them changing throughout the film; meanwhile the many lives on display in the other flats provide other things to be interested in as well.Of course a massive part of it working is the cast. Stewart plays his usual ""aw-shucks"" personae to good effect but crosses it with a certain lack of ethnics and a less than wholesome character who spends his nights with a young girl who he doesn't want to commit to and an unhealthy habit of staring at his neighbours. Kelly is sexually innocent and seductive with it  unlike Hitchcock I tend to find blonde princesses all a bit dull and obvious but she worked here. Stealing most of her scenes is sterling support from Thelma Ritter, not that different a performance from some of her others but still very well timed and blessed with some really great lines. Burr is rather stiff but at a distance it doesn't really matter and he does well enough. The various other neighbours each works well with their mini-stories that barely exist within the film but do add to the layered effect of the film.Overall the film is classy and the rich colours and ordinary setting are nicely in contrast with the action of all the main characters. The mystery is well delivered and engages in a gently dramatic fashion while the starry cast are impressive and interesting throughout. For my money not as pound-for-pound entertaining as North by Northwest but still one of Hitchcock's more widely accessible films if not quite one of his best.",,Anonymous,Mystery
I am repeating this review!,"Tremendous thriller. Classic Hitchcock.In '54, I was seven years old and this is one of the first 'grown up' movies I remember seeing. I have seen it at least ten times since and realize seeing something different each time.James Stewart is a photographer in a wheelchair recovering from an accident. He passes the time by watching his neighbors out his apartment window. He thinks that he witnessed a murder and has trouble convincing his girlfriend, Grace Kelly, to help prove a crime was committed.Three scenes that always stuck with me:(1) Stewart fighting off his attacker with flashbulbs (2) the smoldering kiss (3) the glowing cigarette in the dark apartment.Every bit a classic. I think this is THE BEST Hitchcock movie. No offense intended toward PSYCHO, but this movie has the more human aspects of fear and terror. This super cast includes Raymond Burr, Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey.Actually I wanted to everything where or she already told !",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A manipulative and provocative thriller that uses the effects of loneliness to bring to life a story surrounded by mysteries and doubts,"Hitchcock transforms what could have been a simple police investigation into a more complex operation, which holds the viewer's attention until the end of the film, wanting to know what the end of the plot will be. This is, above any story that can be explored during its narrative, a declaration of love for cinema and a tribute to the spectator. Just as Jeff inserted himself into the lives of strangers, trying to decipher their secrets, dramas and complexities, the movie viewer puts himself in the same role; the role of observer. When we watch a movie, we are in precisely the same position. We see, we accept, we create scenarios and we try to decipher the mysteries, even without ever being fully involved in the story.In fact, we never got to know Jeff's neighborhood, we just saw it with our eyes. We look for features and draw maps that can lead us to doom, but in fact, the whole denouement is built through a distant look; a gaze that does not insert itself into the presence of the characters and, when it does, risks danger (I'm talking about a scene in which Lisa tries to discover one of the great secrets of the plot). Generally, in Hollywood, it's the protagonists who move the action. That make the pieces of the puzzle slowly fall into place as the film progresses. But in Rear Window, that doesn't happen. It is under Jeff's watchful eye that the whole world built there by Hitchcock develops, and the main character never goes beyond such a secondary plan that the neighborhood itself could lead the film.Jeff's window overlooks a set of interior courtyards surrounded by other buildings and this is an absolute highlight of the set design work. Shot entirely in a studio at Paramount, Rear Window relies on this carefully constructed set, which represents a microcosm of society. And, together and in this context, this magnificent setting is a living character in the narrative, entirely built in just one month on the studio's soundstage 18, after an intense study of how it should be.Of course, everything is dependent on the point of view of the narrative, that is, from where Jeff sees his limited world, as all the action takes place inside his apartment or is seen from his apartment. Also, as he is obliged to always remain seated, we see the camera at half height and therefore all the action - and the scenery - has to be seen from this exact angle. Jeff's world is connected to that of his neighbors, but separated by an invisible barrier of seeming individuality that is slowly demolished by Hitchcock's indiscreet camera representing the photographer's own camera and, ultimately, our will and curiosity to know what happens. In the lives of others. Every detail of the set is created thinking about this prison imposed on the protagonist.From the beginning, it is easy to see the director's skill in working with images as the main source of narrative construction. It is a sequence in which we are introduced to the neighborhood where the entire plot takes place, and then to the protagonist. The cast on his leg with the inscription ""Here lie the broken bones of L. B. Jefferies"" already makes it clear who he is and what state he is in. Soon after, a broken camera and photos from an accident reveal what he does and what happened to him. This contributes greatly to the pacing of the film, since the first act resolves such explanatory questions in the first sequence, providing time to develop the character from the moment his actions directly affect the course of the story.The pattern of camera movement from this first sequence is repeated several times throughout the film: a pan showing the neighboring apartments, then a pullback showing Jeff and revealing where this view is coming from. The option for this constant is perhaps one of the greatest merits of Hitchcock's direction in the work because at the same time it establishes a narrative cohesion, serving as a support point for the entire plot, it refers to the meaning of the protagonist's own practice of observation/espionage. . This is pointed out in one of the scenes where Jeff talks to his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), as they both look out the window at their neighbors. It's as if each resident is a projection of some internal conflict in Jeff's: the pianist who lives alone represents the kind of life he craves, with freedom and detachment; the newlywed couple harkens back to their constant discussion with Lisa on this topic; to ""Mr. Lonely Heart"" represents his fear of being alone and unhappy for the rest of his life if he doesn't marry Lisa; and the ballerina, a beautiful young woman who lives surrounded by men, is how Jeff imagines his girlfriend's life to be. Thus, it is not for nothing that the camera always retreats into the protagonist's apartment after a walk through each of the other people's windows, as if they were internalized.Never leaving the setting of Jeff's apartment to tell about the disappearance of Mrs. Thorwald, Hitchcock - who makes one of his usual flashpoints here too - rarely takes the risk of framing the neighborhood from angles that suggest a departure from the main scenario, which it is, after all, his captive's armchair, and as such must not be left until the riddle is solved. This one, contagious, much more because of the interest we have in seeing our ""detective"" discover the truth than for the truth itself of what is happening in the window of the Thorwald couple. Between one peek and another, Rear Window presents us with mesmerizing dialogues about the ethics of being able to see other people's lives and search their secrets through their windows, openings that provide only broken images of the truth on that side. Which, in a deeper study, could open up a complex debate about how the way we see an image can change our perspective on its content, which would inevitably lead to a discussion about the information industry, biased journalism, etc. Just one more proof that well-made cinema remains current and relevant, even sixty years after it was made.Rear Window has a great script very well written and well tied together that uses the effects of loneliness and anxiety in a person's life to masterfully create an atmosphere of suspense, doubt and paranoia in the midst of a very simple premise story, where throughout the narrative we find ourselves constantly wondering if everything is real or just imagination. Along with the protagonist, we are invited to observe everything that happens in this neighborhood with its characters of different characteristics and with their certain routines. It's amazing how a script where its narrative develops in a single environment can be so rich in details and manage to attract the audience's attention, with new layers being inserted into the scene all the time. The level of immersion is absurd and very well done, giving us the feeling of being another character within the story who also observes everything and everyone. There are several moments in which the audience smiles, is surprised and apprehensive along with the protagonist and those around him, since everything happens through his point of view. Hitchcock, with his genius and ability to tell a good story and create a good atmosphere, manages to engage the audience with naturalness and simplicity to a degree that few can.As the film progresses, along with the protagonist's need to prove his convictions, we find ourselves tied to a dialogue between him and Lisa, where she points out how much they were so concerned with proving they were right and not even worried about it. The life of the alleged murdered victim.However, it is at the climax that Hitchcock shows his true mark. The tension built is based on the traditional development of two simultaneous and interconnected events, much worked by D. W. Griffth in the beginnings of the seventh art: something bad is about to happen while salvation rushes to prevent it. However, in Griffith, this tension is constructed by revealing both events through parallel montage; Hitchcock, on the other hand, chose to focus attention only on the tragic event that is about to happen - also to keep the entire film in the same environment, the neighborhood -, but without failing to provide the viewer with information that people are on their way to this situation to prevent it. . This makes the event even more tense, as we don't know how close or far these people are.Still in this sense, the only moment other than the climax in which the point of view leaves the apartment in some shots is in the scene of the dog's death. Afterwards, the owner of the animal accuses the neighbors of having killed him and talks about how they should like each other instead of committing such acts. The camera is not oblivious to the character's drama, daring to compose more closed shots that show the faces of some of the supporting actors, previously seen only in open shots. Perhaps this is the most important scene in the film, as in addition to serving as a turning point for the plot, it dialogues with the spectator himself through criticism of a society that evolves in an increasingly individualistic way. This is evident at the end of this sequence, when everyone who has gone out to the balcony of their apartment and listened in surprise to the dog owner's monologue simply returns to their tasks as if nothing had happened.This is a manipulative and provocative thriller that uses the effects of loneliness to bring to life a story surrounded by mysteries and doubts. With an excellent script, good performances and a quality production, the film is the result of yet another brilliant work by Alfred Hitchcock's direction, which shows why he is considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers that cinema has ever seen. A work that deserves to be seen even if only once by any self-respecting movie lover. Full of twists, suspense and drama, Rear Window is one of those films you never forget!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""A Gripping Tale of Observation and Suspense""","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" released in 1954, is a riveting exploration of voyeurism, human curiosity, and the fine line between observation and invasion. Set against the backdrop of a sweltering New York City summer, the film invites viewers into the confined world of L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, portrayed by the charismatic James Stewart, who finds himself immobilized in his apartment due to a broken leg.As Jeff recuperates, he becomes increasingly fascinated with his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. This seemingly innocent pastime soon spirals into a suspenseful investigation as he begins to suspect one of his neighbors, played by the enigmatic Raymond Burr, of committing a crime. The film deftly captures the isolation of city life while simultaneously revealing the depths of human curiosity and the darker impulses that can accompany it.Hitchcock's masterful direction creates an atmosphere charged with tension, using the confined setting to heighten the conflict and suspense. The film takes place almost entirely within Jeff's apartment, yet it never feels limited. Each window tells a story, depicting a tapestry of diverse characters that, together, illuminate the intricacies of everyday life while building an underlying sense of menace.The cinematography, helmed by director of photography Robert Burks, uses clever framing and perspective shifts to engage the audience, mirroring Jeff's own observations. As the narrative unfolds, viewers are drawn deeper into the mystery, caught between the thrill of seeing and the ethical dilemmas of spying on others.James Stewart delivers a compelling performance as Jeff, embodying the character's charm, frustration, and sense of moral ambiguity. Grace Kelly, as his girlfriend Lisa Fremont, is equally captivating, providing a counterpoint to Jeff's cautious antics with her own adventurous spirit. The chemistry between the two adds a delightful layer to the film, blending romance with suspense as they navigate the tension between action and inaction.""Rear Window"" is not just a suspenseful mystery; it also serves as a commentary on the nature of observation and the complexities of human relationships. It poses questions about watching others and the motivations behind our curiosity, challenging viewers to consider the ethical implications of such actions.Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is a masterpiece of suspense that expertly combines tension, character study, and ethical reflection. The film's exploration of voyeurism and its implications resonates powerfully, making it a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences.

Perfect film,"Rear Window is a perfect film. I wrote my thesis on it at university and I've watched it probably more than any other film. It's absolutely stunning and shocking how much it achieves without an actual film soundtrack or musical score.All the sounds you hear come in from the open window. It it a lesson in editing and pacing. A masterclass in how to build suspense without relying on music. This is far and away, in my opinion, Hitchcock's best work. His masterstroke. Though other movies in his catalogue get more attention, this one should be required viewing for every young horror filmmaker. Even though it lands far less in horror and more in maybe a crime thriller genre, a young filmmaker can learn so much about how to build suspense and pace a scene in all genres.10/10.

Thematic Relevance Make This An Evergreen Hitchcock Classic,"Psycho or Vertigo might be the most identifiable Alfred Hitchcock films. North by Northwest his most visually stunning. Shadow of a Doubt was the Master's personal favorite. Rear Window perhaps doesn't eclipse any one area of those classics--but its tremendous cinematography and thematic relevance keeps it fresh some 70 years after it debuted at the cinema.For a very basic overview, Rear Window sees photographer L. B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg--nothing to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city-dwelling neighbors. One such individual (Raymond Burr) in particular arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife. At first, things seem relatively harmless and one isn't sure if Jeffries isn't perhaps taking suspicions a bit too far. But when Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, the drama is ratcheted up another level.First and foremost, Rear Window shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of that time. In a 1950s Hollywood prone to B-pictures or variety show-style ""something for the whole family"" flicks that did little more than draw maximum crowds, Hitch proved with Rear Window that a true thematic and character masterpiece could be produced for the big screen.It doesn't hurt that the acting here is phenomenal, with Stewart and Kelly having a chemistry perhaps unmatched in the rest of the Hitchcock canon. Cary Grant's Hitchcock offerings may have been glitzier, but Stewart's everyman acting chops allow for more performance depth. Even Burr's antagonist--despite almost no dialogue--is memorable.In terms of cinematography, I'll call Rear Window Hitch's outright best worked. Paired with frequent DP Robert Burks, the duo produce a film cut that is a sight to behold on the big screen. Every scene is filled with interesting movement or visuals and not an ounce of any frame is wasted. Again, mind-boggling to think this was created in 1954.About the only criticism I have of this film--dropping it from 10 stars to 9 --is that it might be 15-20 minutes too long. The build-up is superb and the climax is thrilling, but there is a period in the middle where both the character development and plot motion sag a bit. In a film otherwise so expertly constructed, this ""sitting in neutral"" is apparent.But for the most part, that is mitigated by the relevance of the film's overall themes. Though originally constructed as commentary on tenement housing situations and their cramped quarters allowing for voyeurism, Jeffries' peering into other lives while neglecting his own is just as relevant in, say, the social media era. When Thelma Ritter says ""we've become a race of peeping Toms--what people ought to do is get
outside their own house and look in for a change"", it is a true punch to the gut. That, to me, is the reason why Rear Window can still play in theaters nearly three quarters of a century after its premiere.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A MUST!,"Rear Window is a classic that still holds up today.While some may find the pacing slow by modern standards, it's the tension and suspense that make this film timeless.James Stewart delivers a great performance as the confined photographer, and Grace Kelly shines with her elegance and charm.The way Hitchcock builds the story, using only what's visible from the apartment window, is genius. The suspense builds slowly but steadily, keeping you hooked!I am a huge fan of this director, but this film, OMG this film never feels old or outdated. It's a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted, timeless thriller.",,Anonymous,Mystery
I didn't like it,"First of all, the whole movie being around one room in an apartment can be really hard to focus and even enjoy the film. Are the audience expected to sit for an hour looking from the window on neighbors and traking the murderer? Can't the characters go outside off the apartment and go to other locations? (I mean more film locations). If this whole movie reminded me of how Hitchcock ""blocks a scene"", this was even worse cause there is nothing much to see or expect when the characters are ""trapped"" in a four room wall for an hour of a movie. The acting was decent and there isn't much about the characters for the audience to be attached to them. The only good thing in this movie was probably the opening sequence and the introduction to James Stuart's character.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Probably the best thing Alfred Hitchcock ever did...,"... and if you ever want to introduce somebody to Hitchcock start here. Highly regarded and often spoofed, Hitchcock's ultimate ""cabin-fever"" thriller still knocks down imitators almost 70 years after its release.James Stewart is a photojournalist injured in the line of duty and holed-up in his studio apartment with a crippling leg break. Wheelchair-bound and longing to return to his previous adventure life, he spends his days and (hot summer nights) spying on the occupants of the apartments in his New York City alley courtyard, and manages to eye (via telephoto lens) mysterious neighbor Raymond Burr possibly committing (and cleaning-up after) the murder of his invalid wife. Stewart's haunting convictions about what he believes he saw, clash with the romantic agenda of long-suffering glamorous girlfriend Grace Kelly, who wants nothing more than to lure Stewart into a boring life in polite society, forcing him to give up his dangerous and inquisitive nature to settle down and start a family. A film full of suspense, sexy innuendo, a fabulous Franz Waxman score (be it partially recycled from some of his older films), and enough haute-couture Kelly threads to keep the pages of a vintage Vogue fully-dressed, this is essential viewing due to its timeless statement about voyeurism and suspicion - that what you think you know about your neighbors may or may not be stranger than what is actually going on behind closed doors.Of course the most unbelievable thing in the entire plot to a modern viewer is an insurance company nurse who makes house calls, does massages, and cooks breakfast in the person of wise cracking Thelma Ritter, but I digress.

Voyerism 1on1,"No pun intended of course. The movie itself sets up the stage (again with a likely pun) and where we're going to spend most of our time. We are as confined as the main character here. We see what he sees and we may react similar as he is. Adding visitors and strange neighbors, who all have something going on ... it makes you wonder what is going on next door? And that is one of the things Hitchcock displays here.There are many stabs (at marriage, human nature, sanity etc) and it is even more relevant to some I reckon during a lockdown/pandemic. Not entirely claustrophobic, but also quite contained in the world it is showing us. Men can be mad and certain circumstances will bring the worst out in them. The movie depicts so many ticks and character traits you could easily write novels about it. As it is, you can also just enjoy it as the thriller that it is",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In fact , at the time the set was the largest indoor set built at Paramount Studios . The entire picture was shot on one set, which required months of planning and construction . The film was shot quickly on the heels of Dial M for murder (1954), November 27 1953-February 26 1954 .

The first part of this production is slow and artificial ; however , the rest of this suspense picture takes off at high speed .

Screenwriter John Michael Hayes based Lisa on his own wife, who'd been a professional fashion model when they married . The original story by Cornell Woolrich had no love story and no additional neighbors for L.B. Jeffries to spy on, and those elements were created by Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks and he also was known for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an engaging as well as fun script .

And of course , Hitch cameo , about a half hour into the film, winding the clock in the songwriter's apartment. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Vistavision by Robert Burks , Alfred's ordinary cameraman , showing nice images from studio . The film negative was considerably damaged as a result of color dye fading as early as the 1960s , nearly all of the yellow image dyes had faded out. Despite fears that the film had been irrevocably damaged, preservation experts were able to restore the film nearly to its original coloration . Rousing as well as atmospheric score by the classic composer Franz Waxman .The motion picture was stunningly directed by maestro of thriller Alfred Hitchcock . The film was unavailable for decades because its rights were bought back by Alfred Hitchcock and left as part of his legacy to his daughter. They've been known for long as the infamous ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"" among film buffs, and were re-released in theatres around 1984 after a 30-year absence. The others are The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), The rope (1948), trouble with Harry (1955), and Vértigo (1958). This essential and fundamental Hitchcock will keep fascinated and thrilling right up until the edge-of-your-seat climax .

An Open And Trusting World?,"As far as I know, this is a huge favorite with older folks. Kids of today would be bored to death with this famous Alfred Hitchcock film.I went on a bit of a roller-coaster ride myself regarding how I viewed this movie. When I first saw it on the big screen as a kid, I was fascinated and almost terrified at the end. Years later, watching it twice within five years on VHS, I found it boring with Grace Kelly's dialog annoyingly corny and dated. Recently I viewed it again - a fourth try - and absolutely loved it. Next to Psycho, it's now my favorite Hitchcock film.Yeah, it's still dated quite a bit, and, in future viewings, I might fast-forward through a couple of talky parts with Kelly or Thelma Ritter. I would prefer to stick with the focus of the story, namely Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment. That storyline is entertaining and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart is usually fun to listen to, anyway. Kelly is there for looks.Speaking of dated, can you imagine all the people in the apartments keeping their blinds open all the time, and Stewart keeping his door unlocked all the time as well, and people entering without bothering to knock first? True, it was more trusting and safer world back then, but it couldn't have been THAT transparent and trusting. Give me a break!Yet, credibility aside, it's so involving and fun to watch that who cares if doesn't make a lot of sense?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There are so many things going on in this movie, but most reviewers have touched on all of these so I won't add to them. But the plot is so superb in its layers of conflict, and studies in personalities of Stewart, Kelly, and all the neighbors. It is probably the best film for observing human nature at its many forms.I never realized how massive the set was until I dug a little further. They actually constructed the massive building in one sound stage. All the apartments in Burr's building had running water and electricity and could actually be lived in. Talk about realism and going the extra mile - but Hitchcock was all about that. All along I had assumed they had pieced the different scenes together to look like one building. At the time, it was the largest indoor set ever built by Paramount. While some may find the action a little slow as everything is filmed from the viewpoint of Stewart's apartment window, I find it amazing that the movie still creates such tension and suspense in spite of this.I think it is interesting that Spielberg is facing a lawsuit for his movie Disturbia which claims that it is basically a re-working of Rear Window. Why would anyone even attempt another telling of Hitchcock's perfectly done masterpiece, and especially without permission (even if your last name IS Spielberg)?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An original, intruiging work... brilliantly cinematic","Yes, Rear Window is probably the film that has finally made me accept Hitchcock's genius. I loved ""Vertigo"", appreciated ""Psycho"", was irritated by ""Spellbound"", was partial to ""Strangers on a Train"", was intruiged by ""The Wrong Man"" and fairly enjoyed ""North By Northwest""... ""Rear Window"" is probably his finest work that I have yet seen... open, as it is, to many, varied interpretations.While ""Vertigo"" had a more domineering score, photography and general artifice, ""Rear Window"" has a greater impact for me. While ""Vertigo"" was gripping, this one was positively electrifying in that department. The fact that Hitchcock managed such a multi-faceted, intruiging effort with the original conceit he adopted - to make a film from one set, and one single vantage-point - is astounding. I've not heard of the novel it was based on, but this is one hell of a script. All of the characters, and that's partially including the ones viewed by Stewart's L.B. Jeffries, are fully fleshed out and flawed. I found Thelma Ritter's performance amusing, and believable, providing the Bel Geddes (in ""Vertigo"")-type role early on, and then developing interestingly. Grace Kelly's Lisa is a fascinating character, more than you'd initially suspect. Undeniably beautiful, but also frustrated, passionate, devious and desperate in equal part. While Jeffries, or perhaps his accident (a typically important little detail that Hitchcock uses brilliantly, like Stewart's vertigo in ""Vertigo""), starts the whole voyeuristic business, Ritter and to an interesting extent, Kelly collaborate with his fancies. Stewart's role is a great one, that of a deeply flawed, and disturbingly obsessed voyeur. It is sure that, at least with the films he made for Hitchcock, Stewart fulfilled all of his promise as an actor. From the wonderfully casual early scenes, to his gradual obsession with a particular house, his acting is brilliant in conveying the character's less-than-positive traits. It seems absurd at first that he be resistive at all to Kelly, but gradually their relationship is made complex, with perhaps Kelly's motivations in the film's later stages intruiging to consider, if she is or not as ""perfect"" as Stewart earlier claims. There is twist after twist in characterisation, theme and plot, with the final 15 minutes particularly striking in this regard. The conclusion is brilliantly ironic. Audience expectation and sympathies are toyed with exceptionally by Hitchcock at every turn. The themes are manifold, with voyeurism the guiding one. Themes are linked with character, and are effectively tackled; Wendell Corey's character pretty much emphasising the voyeuristic theme with a pertinent quote that I can't exactly recall.The direction is superb, as you would expect from Hitchcock (its his fascinating, complex use of narrative, character and theme that eleveates this work above so many of his other films), engendering many different moods, but none untainted by corruption in some way. The photography is impressive, giving the restricting settings a pungeancy. Hitchcock and his photographers always tending, at least with ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"", to capture colour in a more vivid, expressive and importantly, atmospheric light than most in the history of colour film. Perhaps pivotal in my view is the brilliant use of music, distant, from the houses Stewart spies on, especially the haunting piano tunes (referred to yearningly by Kelly's character) from one home. This adds contrast and depth to many scenes, both within and without of Stewart's flat.It seems a waste that there are so few films that try, and succeed, in capturing this film's mood and devices. In many ways, I felt David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" to capture some of its suspenseful brilliance. Terence Young's 1967 film, ""Wait Until Dark"" was very nearly as tense and exciting, and also well worth checking out if you love ""Rear Window"". No doubts are there, that ""Rear Window"" is one of the ""classics"" more than deserving of its status. Rating:- *****/*****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Peeping Tom Movie,"When the issue is a fifty year old ""classic"" that others rave over, the easiest thing in the world is to go along with the crowd, and proclaim the film a ""masterpiece"". You've got lots of protective cover.But I, for one, do not like this film, and I don't mind saying so. First, the film's theme is unethical. Many people equate Jefferies' voyeurism to an audience watching a movie. Such a comparison ostensibly makes the voyeuristic theme harmless. But filmmakers make movies specifically to be watched. By contrast, most people at home value their privacy, and would not like some neighbor from across the street spying on them through binoculars. In this film, Hitchcock gets away with it because the guy doing the spying is played by a famous, and beloved, actor named James Stewart.The second problem is the film's contrived plot. The timing of Thorwald's activities with Jefferies' spying is way too coincidental, for my taste. And without Thorwald's activities, you don't have a story. Further, Thorwald conveniently leaves his windows open to view, behavior that is not believable. For that matter, how believable is it that any of those neighbors would leave their windows open to view, in such a tight, claustrophobic setting? And without those open windows, you don't have a story.My third objection is the film's lack of suspense and lack of plot twists. I do not consider this film to be a thriller at all. It's more of a social commentary on nosy neighbors.Most viewers would pounce on a film whose theme is unethical, or would jump all over a film that has obvious contrivances, or lacks suspense or plot twists. In the case of ""Rear Window"", however, viewers ignore the film's flaws, because the film has Hitchcock's name attached to it. And so, we have a double standard. The standards are fairly low for films directed by Hitchcock. A much tougher set of standards apply to films made by other directors.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A wheelchair man spies his neighbors,"This is another good thriller of Hitchcock. James Stewart, as usual, was the selection as a leading actor together with the then nice Grace Kelly, always efficient supporting actress Thelma Ritter, a solid acting of Wendell Corey, and the villain Raymond Burr, who later in his career became the famous actor of the detective Perry Mason. The best is that the thriller does not show any particular violent scenes until its end when the wheelchair journalist (Stewart) was caught in his activities by the guilty man (Burr). Notwithstanding with this, the film keeps you always awaiting for a final discovery of the supposed killer. So watching the film you have entertainment, you may see the people's life of 50s, and you enjoy with the plot of the thriller. Film-makers should see how Hitchcock did to delight everyone with a really simple plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock at his visual best,"Movies like Rear Window perfectly show that you don't need a ton of expository dialogue to tell a good story. You can simply let the setting, camerawork, and actions of the characters tell you all you need to know. The film does an exceptional job of showing the development of the various residents of the apartment building the whole movie takes place in by simply showing their day to day lives and how they change/stay the same throughout. All this is done with very little dialogue, other than occasional commentary from Jimmy Stewart meant to give us an outsider's perspective. Helping this is the fact that, with the exception of a couple of scenes, all of the apartments are shot from outside and afar, as if from within Stewart's apartment, which is the only one we are ever in. Not only does this give us a ton of great shots, not only does it really help put us in his POV, but it helps make the mystery at the center all the more interesting and intense, an intensity that only increases in the final act, leading to a pulse pounding climax.Despite how iffy it is for Stewart to play a romance with a woman half his age, he and Grace Kelly (who actually seemed to make a career out of love stories alongside men old enough to be her dad) have incredible chemistry, helped by their extraordinary performances. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey are great as the two friends of Stewart helping with the investigation. And the neighbors, despite, of because of the lack of dialogue, all do great jobs too, especially Raymond Burr as the suspected villain.Overall, while I haven't seen every Alfred Hitchcock movie, Rear Window may very well be my favorite of the ones I have seen; either this or Psycho. It's certainly one of his best jobs as a director and a storyteller, and it definitely earned him the title of master of suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""North by Northwest""","While ""North by Northwest"" is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film, his 1954 classic ""Rear Window"" is a very close second as it's a masterclass in audience manipulation. Based on a short story titled ""It Had to be Murder"" written by Cornell Woolrich aka William Irish, it tells the story of a news photographer named L. B. Jeffries who finds himself confined to his apartment for six weeks after an accident leaves him with a cast on his foot and in a wheelchair. With nothing else to do besides becoming voyeuristic towards his neighbors, he begins to watch the various people in his complex when a neighbor begins acting highly suspicious. This leads Jeffries to believe that the man has killed his wife, as her sudden disappearance and the man's odd behavior is caught through the binoculars and telephoto lens that our protagonist owns and this makes for a gripping mystery thriller and one of the best ever made.The genius of this film is how Hitchcock crafts the character of Jeffries, as the story is told from his point of view which turns us into voyeurs and has us believing what we see. However, a seed of doubt is created in our minds as Jeffries is presented as both a deeply concerned neighbor but also a nosy one whose boredom has led him to make crazy claims with no tangible proof. The camera work and editing here is spectacular, as we get various shots of people in their apartment living their lives and cut to James Stewart to get his reaction to it all and he tells us a lot just with facial expressions alone. We're never taken away from his perspective because it would otherwise take away from the magic of the film, as through his eyes we become just as curious as Jeffries while also believing that he's completely out of his jurisdiction.Stewart is great as our main character, as so much work is done for him before we get into the meat of the story that makes him a very compelling protagonist. He is a man who finds himself in a relationship with a woman named Lisa played by the extremely gorgeous Grace Kelly, but he looks to end it with her due to his own insecurities regarding their compatibility of lifestyles. Kelly is both stunning and classy as Lisa, someone who simply wants to love Jeffries for who he is but finds it difficult because of his stubborn nature and it makes for great comedic moments. Thelma Ritter as Stella is Jeffries's masseuse who talks sense into him regarding his current physical condition, as she feels he should relax and not get caught up in spying on his neighbors while Wendell Corey as Lt. Doyle acts as the one Jeffries consistently bothers about his neighbor's suspicious activity.The art direction from Hal Pereira and Joe McMillan Johnson is perfect for this story, with each apartment fusing within the same courtyard and each neighbor having their window open yet never paying attention to their surroundings. The cinematography from Robert Burks is beautiful, as the use of shadows creates a noir tone as this mystery develops throughout the film. What I truly love is how, similar to that of ""M,"" this film highlights the dangers of not knowing your neighbors and never taking interest in what's going on around you as a scene involving a dog really gets this message across clearly. We all fear not knowing if the person next door to us is hiding sinister secrets, yet we don't want to be bothered with it on our own until it's too late and this character is willing to put his own safety on the line to expose a murderer within the complex. This is one of Hitchcock's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent Cinematography,"Throughout the film, the director gives excellent shots to portray the characters emotions through visual means rather than speaking it aloud. As well as this you get a glimpse into several people whose homes are arranged behind his. Actor James Stewart gives a compelling performance as well. Showing both emotion and feeling through his being stuck in a cast and missing out on his normal adventurous lifestyle.While some scenes lack in interest and absurdly long focus on the dancer whose main character choice is bending over, this does show how his inability to live how he enjoys puts him in a state of boredom and often lust for the outdoors, and of course companionship.That paired with a script that is fit perfectly to the theme I'd say this film is worth the watch for any movie lover. I give Rear Window a nine out of ten rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Note, death, humor, suspense and genius.","""Rear Window"" might is not the best film of Alfred Hitchcock, but it's my favorite and I think impeccable, starting with the script that develops several different characters just showing a few minutes via a window, and the script shows the daydreams LB Jeffries, who is with a broken leg and kill the boredom observes its neighbors to notice a strange behavior ... no need to even say that the suspense in the film is even more amazing in the final 30 minutes, you can not even blink, and the best is that Alfred still put shades of humor in the film that fall very well. The picture is beautiful, without words, that vision for the buildings and their indiscreet windows has its own life, or look like a movie, it seems that Alfred Hitchcock filmed a building any in an American suburb, the soundtrack although not very participant in the film, she is accurate, the main plot the film will count through small steps the stories of several families, all very fast and complete, you feel the LB Jeffries himself, the performances are very good, although redundancy praise actors like James Stewart and Grace Kelly, the movie is great, mixing humor, romance, drama and suspense in a very effective way, I recommend any movie Alfred Hitchcock, but this, I place a starlet.Sorry my English translator google.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's Classy Voyeurism Thriller...,"One of the joys of Alfred Hitchcock films is his ability to take social taboos, present them in an enticing context, throw in major stars we know and respect to perform them, and thus make abhorrent behavior seem attractive! 'Vertigo' is the best-known example of this Hitchcock trait ('Psycho' also comes to mind), but 'Rear Window' is arguably the most fun to watch, because of the appealing combination of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.Stewart is a photographer, laid-up while recuperating from an accident (cleverly shown through photographs in his studio), who, out of boredom, begins spying on his neighbors through binoculars. Virtuous Jimmy Stewart a 'Peeping Tom'? Only Hitchcock could get away with this!Of course, Kelly, as his high fashion model girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter (who is fabulous as his nurse), are appalled by Stewart's behavior, but are drawn into voyeurism by Stewart's devotion to it, particularly after he witnesses an apparent murder (committed by Raymond Burr, in one of the most wonderfully EVIL roles of his career).The film takes on a cat-and-mouse intensity, as Stewart attempts to prove Burr's guilt to his skeptical policeman buddy (nicely played by Wendell Corey). To add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart (""Previews of Coming Attractions"", she purrs). All this leads up to a fabulous, claustrophobic finale, with camera flashes, and a twist ending that is pure Hitchcock magic.If you haven't seen 'Rear Window', run, do not walk to your video store, and rent it! You'll quickly discover why it is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular films!",,Anonymous,Mystery

Rear Window starts slow but is rewarding in the end.,"Rear WindowPicture this: You're all alone in your apartment, dancing in your underwear when you suddenly stop cold.  The little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, and you get the feeling that someone is watching you dance the night away through your window.  Well, before you call the cops and tell them you have a peeping tom, why don't you wave at them because your peeping tom just might be...Jimmy Stewart.Yes, Jimmy Stewart likes to look through peoples windows when they're in their underwear in the movie `Rear Window'.  And to tell you the truth, he does a pretty good job of it too.  Jimmy played a character named Jeff who was confined to a wheelchair in his apartment as a result of a broken leg. He was perfectly cynical, and his idleness, and curiosity of other people's private world was his downfall.  Jeff was like a stereotypical house wife who gets caught up in their `stories', or soap operas.  Jeff was becoming more and more absorbed in the private worlds outside of his rear window until he was finally sucked into that world in the shocking conclusion. Jimmy Stewart played this character with strength and established Jeff's cynicism, stubbornness and his meddlesome tendencies.But the viewer wasn't always paying attention to Jimmy and his paranoia, because there was often times something a little easier on the eyes on the screen.  The beautiful Grace Kelly played opposite of Jimmy Stewart.  Even though her beauty was undeniable, she was more hypnotic than anything else. It was in the way she delivered her lines with such, dare I say, grace.  Her parents weren't kidding when they named her after beauty.Hitchcock used his resources to create beauty in every frame that appealed to all five senses and most emotions also.  And even more amazing is how he filmed the whole movie out of the little apartment, and made it both an interesting story which built to a fantastic crescendo, but his cinematic genius was also stimulating to the mind.  Hitchcock created visual metaphors of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs and of basic, raw humanity.  He accomplished this with his set that had a apartment building that symbolized the human state, with the rock bottom sad people in the lower apartments and the happy people in the top floor apartments.Hitchcock's film `Rear Window' had many levels much like his metaphorical apartment building.  And from every angle there was something to appreciate in this movie.  It captured beauty, it captured humanity, it reflected raw and polished life.  `Rear Window' is in every sense of the word `art'.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Rear Window,"My years-long quest to see everything Alfred Hitchcock has ever made finally lead me, albeit far too late, to Rear Window. Hitchcock's 1954 feature starring Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly has been revered and countlessly referenced in the 62 years since its release. The film in which a wheelchair bound photographer with nothing better to do than look out the window of his New York apartment at his various neighbors becomes convinced that one of them has committed a murder. Bringing together a brilliant display of the various lives that make up a neighborhood and how each human effects the other, Rear Window was a long overdue treat.After injuring himself on a photo shoot, L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is wheelchair-bound with a broken leg. Since Jeff is single, for the most part abhorring the idea of marriage, the only interaction he enjoys throughout his long days are the visits of his caretaker, an occasional guest, and his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly). In order to help the time pass as he recovers, Jeff has taken a liking to watching his neighbors from his large apartment window. Living varied lives, each with their own schedules and idiosyncrasies, Jeff becomes entranced learning more about their lives behind his binoculars. Among his watching, Jeff notices a traveling salesman with a bed-ridden wife at home. He watches him take care of his wife and begins to learn his schedule. One day, Jeff notices that salesman's wife has disappeared and his schedule has drastically changed. The collection of oddities has Jeff convinced that his neighbor has killed his wife. Jeff is so convinced that he shares this belief with his girlfriend and caretaker, who initially dismiss him, then go on to help him. With no proof, the threesome hatches a plan to implicate the neighbor with murder by entering his apartment, even if it costs them their lives.Now I understand why I like the film Disturbia so much. I saw the 2007 version of Rear Window first, and was stunned that I liked it so much, being as I am no fan of Shia LaBeouf's; after seeing Rear Window, however, I can appreciate my liking of Disturbia more as it is basically a remake of the Hitchcock classic. I was initially disappointed to see that Rear Window was a color film, for some reason I thought I remembered that it was in black and white, but I got over it quickly when I first saw Jimmy Stewart; really, is he in anything that's not completely splendid? I really enjoy watching films by British directors, as I love the emphasis on dialogue within the films. Rear Window, had a wonderful emphasis on dialogue and the three principles delivered the lines quite well. There was a great deal of fun effects throughout this film, including the fun way Hitch filmed through the lenses of Jeff's camera and binoculars. Rear Window is a fantastic example of a distinction Hitch himself was sure to make; he made suspense pictures, not mysteries. It really doesn't matter to the film whether or not the man actually killed his wife, what is paramount, however, is the quest endured by the actors to find out whether or not Jeff's neighbor is a murderer. Another gripping suspense from the ultimate master in the genre, it is easy to see why Rear Window is the classic it has become.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film as a kind of voyeurism,"Jeff (James Stewart), the lead character of ""Rear window"", is immobile because of a broken legg. During this period he starts spying on his neighbours in the appartment building opposite of his house.There is little doubt that Alfred Hitchcock wanted to make it very clear to the moviegoer that there is a strong resemblence between him/her and the voyeurism of Jeff. Just like Jeff has a big choice of appartments to spy on, the moviegoer can choose from a broad supply of movies. Just like Jeff can't intervene in the lives he is spying on (because he is immobile), the moviegoer is also incapable of changing the end of the film he is watching. The overall point is that while watching a movie you are looking at the lives of others, who can't look back. Viewed this way, watching a movie is a special kind of voyeurism.I already mentioned that Jeff can (and does) spy on a lot of apartments. Because each apartment has its own story ""Rear window"" takes on the character of an ensemble film. This is easily overlooked because one story (the murder mystery) is very dominant.Nevertheless the character of ensemble movie is important. Very often ensemble movies do have some element connecting the different stories. In ""Rear window"" this connecting element is the relationship between Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly). Lisa is pushing for a more serious relationship. Few men would hesitate when Grace Kelly would be pushing them, but Jeff has fear for commitment. In the different stories different aspects of a married life (positive and negative) are illustrated.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the Most Thrilling Films Hitchcock Ever Directed,"I saw this last night on AMC and was blown away by the plot, the characterization, the setting, and of course, the suspense. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, some of my favorites being ""North by Northwest,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Lifeboat,"" and now this.L.B. Jefferies, known as Jeff by his friends, is wheelchair-bound in his Manhattan apartment, dealing with a broken leg. With nothing else to do but look out the window, he takes to watching the lives of his neighbors around the center courtyard: the struggling musician, Miss Torso, the dancer, the eccentric couple with the curious dog, the newlyweds, Miss Lonelyheart, and of course, the Thorwalds, right across the way. Lars Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife become Jeff's focal characters to observe...until Mrs. Thorwald disappears, and Lars becomes progressively suspicious. He quickly involves his uptown girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly) who opts to do some investigation, and then involves his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Helpless in his apartment, he works through them and the moderate help from his friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), a detective. Questions continue to arise, and Jeff, Lisa, Stella, and Doyle seem to be coming to a conclusion. Yet, this is Hitchcock, and our team of protagonists aren't close to just solving the case and moving on. Oh no, the last twenty minutes or so prove to unbearably suspenseful as Lisa investigates the Thornwald's apartment while it's unoccupied, and Jeff and Stella watch helplessly as Lars comes home....This truly is an amazing film. James Stewart and Grace Kelly give amazing performances, and Thelma Ritter is wonderful as the witty nurse. The vignettes on the lives of each of Jeff's neighbors are all quite interesting, and I found Miss Lonelyheart's story in particular to be absolutely wonderful. I also loved how Jeff was helpless, while the two women were off doing what one would think to be the man's role in the movie. Lisa, particular, is quite an innovative character. First of all, she's very funny. I love when Jeff is telling her the rough aspects of a traveling photographers life, and how when he asks her something in the way if she had ever been 5000 feet up, struggling to stay warm in twenty below zero weather, and she replies, ""Well, when I get a few minutes after lunch...."" She also takes that role of the elegant uptown girl and admits her sophistication and perfection, like when Jeff comments on how she never wears the same dress twice, and Lisa notes light-heartedly, ""Only because it's expected of her [me]."" And then, when she takes all those risks to uncover the truth in the end. Not only could I not sit still, I was so scared (which is rare for me with most horror movies) but I was amazed at how she proved that she wasn't afraid to risk anything. Now, that's one hell of a heroine, and perhaps the greatest Hitchcock woman ever.I also loved Stella. She had some of the greatest lines in the movie, and I love when she's commenting to Lisa and Jeff on the probable gory details of Lars's act. She was definitely memorable with all her witty lines, and had me laughing many times.And of course, James Stewart gave a great performance, conveying that feeling of helplessness, and near claustrophobia being in that apartment, unable to do anything, and just as he's safe in his apartment watching everyone, he goes through hell trying to figure out what to do when Lars comes home while Lisa is still at his apartment.The movie is enthralling from the amazing opening to the wonderful epilogue, and the title music totally sets the scene for some fun. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is an amazing film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly captivating,"`Rear Window' is an incredible mix of things; mystery, life lessons as lived within the perimeters of various stages of life, and romance. James Stewart portrays Jeff, an ambitious photographer who is temporarily on a wheelchair due to a work related accident. He believes to have witnessed a crime as he watched his neighbors' lives through the rear window of his apartment. The cinematography of Hitchcock's film is deserving of recognition, because it was the largest inside set of the time. The film's setting is inside Jeff's apartment throughout the duration of it, with one exception. Yet every single apartment watched through the apartment's window is so incredibly detailed and thanks to the filming allows the audience to capture all that goes on inside the far off windows. Hitchcock does an amazing job at carefully choosing the stages of life in which every one of Jeff's neighbors is going through. One woman is your typical lone heart; he gives us an aspiring musician, a ballerina, a newlywed couple, as well as a look inside a troubled marriage's apartment. These don't just stand for their clearly stated definitions, but also in a certain way reflect what Jeff's life is like. As he gives marriage a serious thought. Grace Kelly is portraying Lisa Carol Fremont, the woman Jeff is seeing and who represents an opposite of Jeff's character. She is rich and holds a high social status, and also deeply desires a commitment to Jeff. The chemistry created between Lisa and Jeff is reflected very well by the actors. Jeff is almost blinded to see the perfect woman throwing herself at him. The pace Rear Window starts off with is steady, yet seems to drag at about the middle of the film, making it hard for the audience to follow, again towards the end its faster pace is picked up again. This is recovered by the choice of inspirational and dynamic music continually played in the background of the film.

Lars is a salesman, and Emma appears to be a chronically-ill housewife. Emma suddenly disappears, and with the help of binoculars and his camera's telephoto lens, Jeff begins to make conclusions about what happened to Emma. We learn the truth at the film's climax.""Rear Window"" is probably my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film. I enjoy photography, which helps me to identify with Jeff. The storyline is straightforward, and the twists and turns all make sense. Some of Lisa Fremont's actions seem out of character for her personality, but she has totally bought into Jeff's theories. Thelma Ritter helps provide a little comic relief. ""Rear Window is a well-executed film based on a solid story.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining and thrilling from beginning to end,"Beautiful film, where do I even begin. The story has you on your toes the whole time, the cinematography is brilliant, the performances are fantastic, and everything about it is just enthralling. The fact that this whole film is basically shot from one location is an accomplishing feat on its own, the fact that you can make an almost 2 hour movie while staying in the same cramped apartment is beyond impressive. The camerawork is something to marvel, the frame within a frame shots are visual storytelling at its best letting the viewer experience these people's lives from the same perspective as our lead.

Brilliant,"Rear Window (1954)**** (out of 4)Alfred Hitchcock's smart and sexy thriller remains one of the greatest of the genre. James Stewart plays a man confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg who spends all day and night spying on his neighbors. The biggest thing going in his life is his nervousness of his relationship with a rich woman (Grace Kelly) but that's about to change when he thinks one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr) has killed his wife. Here's another film that probably would have been a disaster had anyone else in the world directed but Hitchcock brings his normal brilliance to the film making it one of the greatest ever made. This film has countless layers so it's impossible to catch everything on one viewing, which is why I think the film gets even better with each new viewing. The way Hitchcock has Stewart spy on all the neighbors is something brilliant and we get to know and care for each of them, which pays off greatly towards the end of the film when we're worried about the ""lonely lady"" while forgetting to watch Kelly who has snuck into the neighbors home. I've read several reviews that says the film moves too slowly and perhaps this is true but on repeat viewings it's clear that Hitchcock is just setting a trap for the viewer, which leads to a really suspenseful ending. There's no question Stewart is a brilliant actor and while I haven't seen all of his film I might put this at the best performance of his career. Sure, he was brilliant in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life and various others but he has to do all his acting here in a wheelchair so his facial expressions, voice tones and other small items have to be used throughout the film. How deep of a character he's able to deliver is something not too many actors could do. Grace Kelly is great as well as is Thelma Ritter adds great comic support. Raymond Burr never gets mentioned but he's terrific in the film as well.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"James is very good, Grace not so much","""Rear Window"" is a masterclass in suspense, offering a captivating and voyeuristic exploration of human curiosity and paranoia. Set almost entirely within the confines of a Greenwich Village apartment, Hitchcock's direction turns the protagonist's limited perspective into an immersive experience for the audience.James Stewart delivers a stellar performance as L. B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, a wheelchair-bound photographer who becomes obsessed with watching his neighbors, suspecting one of murder. Grace Kelly's portrayal of Lisa Fremont is both elegant and spirited, albeit a bit flat. But she is providing a perfect counterbalance to Stewart's intense curiosity.The film's innovative use of space and sound, coupled with a meticulously crafted narrative, keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. ""Rear Window"" is a timeless piece that showcases Hitchcock's unparalleled ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, making it a must-watch for any cinema enthusiast.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nosey neighbour meets moral obligation to report a serious crime,1954 Alfred Hitchcock directed mystery thriller. Have you ever been annoyed at nosey neighbours? I have.

The Cinematic Masterpiece of Voyeurism,"I just got done watching Rear Window (1954), arguably one of if not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie, for the first time ever and I safely say that this movie is indeed one of Hitchcock's best as well as one of the greatest movies ever made.Positives for Rear Window (1954):
Now on its surface, this movie is a simple story that has been done many times after this movie's release and the only other movie I've seen to tackle voyeurism was The Voyeurs (2021), the Amazon Prime Original Movie starring Sydney Sweeney. However, the main thing that separates this movie from those others is of course the masterful direction and execution by Alfred Hitchcock. The atmosphere in this movie is by far the most intense and thrilling in any Alfred Hitchcock movie. I also really really enjoyed the movie's setting of the apartment in the Chelsea-Greenwich Village region of Manhattan and this might the best simple settings in any movie ever made. Throughout the runtime, you are sitting there wondering if our main character is either crazy or if he is telling the truth about one of his neighbors committing murder and the movie has your attention throughout the runtime. Of course, it goes without saying that the cast in this movie give phenomenal performances with James Stewart as L. B. Jefferies, Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Wendell Corey as Thomas J. Doyle, Thelma Ritter as Stella and Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald just to name a few. The dialogue and banter in this movie is by some of the best I've ever heard in any movie. The movie also does a fantastic job at throwing twists and turns at the right moments and it raises the stakes and tense for the rest of the runtime. And finally, the climax of this movie is one of the most intense and thrilling finales I've seen in any movie ever made.Overall, Rear Window (1954) is a cinematic masterpiece for the ages, it is my second favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie and it is one of my favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Grace kelly's performance is also not inferior to her beauty. Considering how this was shot from one room the cinematography is amazing, they're all varied so it never got boring to see. One other thing that keeps this movie alive is the dialogue, it's like every character is trying to outwit each other when they talk and it was really fun to watch. The story itself is simple yet Hitchcock was able to snuck in some suspense in it. The kind of suspense where it gave you satisfaction when the movie ends.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'll be watching you,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window follows Jimmy Stewart as a Photographer. Who after an accident confined him to his Apartment. When he's not being wed by his Nurse and visited by his Girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly). He spends his time spying on his neighbors to pass the time. He soon suspects one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr) just might have killed his wife and tries to prove it. Rear Window is an interesting film especially for its time a very self-contained movie it does a great job of adding suspense and mystery while also adding a dark sense of charm and humor. As well as a sense of self-doubt. Giving this is a setting that's very limiting pretty much puts us in the perspective of Jimmy how do you make this rear window received work for a whole movie? It does that by making a colorful cast of its leads and the side characters. You spend a good chunk of the film getting to know these characters the relationship between Lisa and Jeff a cynical relationship at first, to say the least Jeff is kind of a jerk but doesn't feel like he deserves or warrants a girl like Lisa who is very charming and life to her. Feels there's this disconnect between marriage and a fling. And kind of starts to reflect on himself as he watches his neighbors who themselves are almost in their sort of prison. You see this similarity between the songwriter trying to complete his song or Ms. Lonesome who a very sad and the newlyweds. Even though none of these characters interact with each other or the leads you get enough of what their about. And of course, having Raymond Burr Perry Mason himself was nothing short of genius to add to this mystery and charm when cutting between the killer and the neighbors.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Master at his best.,"Brilliant. Legendary. Perfect. There are not enough adjectives to describe properly ""Rear Window"". Along with ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" this is probably one of his best 3 movies.After his period in Warner Bros., where he directed masterpieces like ""Strangers on a Train"" or ""Dial M For Murder"", it seemed as if the master could not top what he had previously achieved. But he did. In fact, when Hitchcock directed ""Rear Window"", his first movie at Paramount, he was beginning with the right foot what would become his most brilliant period.The well-known plot stars Hitchcock's favorite Jimmy Stewart as photographer L. B. Jeffries, who is almost caged in his apartment during his recovery from an accident he had while working. To kill the time, he becomes obsessed with what happens to his neighbors outside, to the point that he is convinced that one of them committed a murder. Grace Kelly plays his beautiful girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter plays his nurse.Hitchcock makes us parters in crime during Jeffreis voyeuristic adventures, as we are silent witness of the misfortunes of the neighborhood. Lisa, his girlfriend, has a difficult relationship with Jeffreis, there is definitely love there, but he is reluctant to include her in his life because he considers her ""too perfect"". Jeffreis voyeurism is probably, his escape to his problems as he prefers to watch the others.Technically the movie is brilliant. The camera is our eyes and it flows smoothly; and even when the movie takes place almost entirely in Jeffreis apartment, it never becomes tiresome or boring. This is also possible to the ingenious script and the brilliant performance of the three lead characters.Beautiful Grace Kelly is outstanding as the lovely girlfriend who turns into an adventurous spy as she gets interested in his boyfriend's new hobby. Jimmy Stewart gives once again his classic performance of the ""regular guy"" that Hitchcock enjoyed so much; although in my opinion, is Thelma Ritter who gives the movie that charming quality, as her witty comments are delivered with that dark humor that Hitchcock loved so much.""Rear Window"" is without any doubt, a perfect movie. Hitchcock has walked a long way, but all his previous work was practice when compared to the movies to come; his work would reach it's peak in the famous three: ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Psycho"". At this time, he is already considered a master.10/10. Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A very inferior Hitchcock film,"When this film was released, it was a big hit, but much of the reason for that was that Grace Kelly was in it, and she was the darling then. Also, people had not yet grown tired of James Stewart. But the film itself is contrived, artificial, tedious, unconvincing, and silly. Looking back now at the ethereal beauty of Grace Kelly, her perfect face, her perfect dainty profile, her perfect lips as she kisses, and her highly cultivated dreamy look which is meant to convince us that she is in love, it is a bit like remembering that one tried to eat the lace-like sugar ornament on the first wedding cake one encountered as a child: far too sweet, indeed sickly. The outrageous designer dresses and suits worn by Kelly in this film, including a ludicrously flouncy skirt, can perhaps be excused by the period, combined with a director indulging his well-known fantasies. But let's consider the film itself and what is wrong with it. For one thing, it is one of those films set in a single room which directors vainly imagine they can make compelling for the entire length of a film, but so rarely do. Alfred Hitchcock was notorious for preferring always to shoot in controlled studio conditions whenever he could, and would build whole exteriors inside a studio rather than step outside to the real thing where – what was it? – he was afraid of catching cold? No, it was insecurity and the need for control, especially control over those beautiful blonde victim actresses whom he wished to dominate either directly or through story lines. He could not kiss them himself, but he could have other people kiss them and film it. He could also punish them, or even murder them on screen. In this film, Grace Kelly is not killed, though she does have a serious scare. The story is about a press photographer who has broken his leg and is stranded in his small Manhattan apartment with his entire leg in plaster, sitting in a wheelchair by his large rear window. From there, he can spy on his neighbours, at first through binoculars, but later through a telephoto lens attached to his camera. It is summer in Manhattan, apparently August, when everyone in the 1950s was sweating and suffering from the heat, and air conditioners were not yet widespread. All the windows are open, one couple are sleeping at night on a mattress on an outside balcony, and everyone is on view, and one can hear everything and see everything. The photographer is played by James Stewart. He turns into a compulsive Peeping Tom because he is bored and, after all, he is a photographer who is always looking for things anyway. Stewart plays the role in his usual default manner, that of the droll and drawling good fellow. (His acting range was never broadband. He could always be counted on to be the same.) Grace Kelly flies in every evening in some fantasy gown or other to look after him. She professes that she adores him, loves him overwhelmingly, and why cannot they marry. He grumbles and complains both to her and his masseuse Thelma Ritter that Kelly isn't really what he is looking for. Pull the other unbroken leg! Grace Kelly not good enough for him? Try telling that to the public. The whole world was lusting after Grace Kelly at that moment, and tedious, drawling James Stewart wants to find someone better? How can she put up with him is the better question. And yet, this is what Hitchcock would have us believe. But she is having none of it, and will not be disposed of by her boring choice of husband-to-be. Being as well endowed with money as she is with good looks, she goes off to The 21 Club and orders a takeaway dinner for two. It arrives, carried by a man in a red bellhop uniform, and consists of a bottle of chilled Puligny Montrachet (of unimaginable expense in America then, and indeed now) and lobster thermidor. And thus her courtship of her reluctant photographer is carried out. She brings a small overnight bag because she is going to stay with him one night, and from it she pulls something long and silky. Shortly afterwards she emerges from the bedroom dressed in the most outrageous Hollywood floating negligee and strikes a pose in front of Stewart, asking him how he likes it (i.e., how he likes her). He remains indifferent. Surely erotic fantasy is here butting its head against a brick wall. Stewart remains more interested in spying on the neighbours. (Is he gay? What is his problem?) He rolls his jaw around and does a bit of drawling with it from time to time. Are there really no other takers on Kelly's Park Avenue? Must she really keep coming slumming in Lower Manhattan where her adored James Stewart overlooks a motley back yard with different small apartments inhabited by oddballs? (There is the usual irritating bad soprano practising her scales, an all too realistic touch, though we never see her.) Several of the oddballs are overdone, to say the least. The dancing girl in shorts is perhaps the most ridiculous. The story concerns Stewart believing that he may have witnessed the aftermath of a man murdering his invalid wife, cutting her body up and taking it away in stages in a metal suitcase. Everyone ridicules him for imagining this, but Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter end up believing him and try to collect additional evidence. This lengthy and languid attempt to keep us watching this dreary story is a complete waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Lots to see, even on a third viewing","Made around the same time that televisions started to become an essential part of the home, 'Rear Window' paints an interesting time capsule of a society devoid of television, where the only entertainment if stuck at home all day is watching the neighbours' activities. In fact, 'Rear Window' could even be seen as a film about television, with Jeffries, the protagonist, switching views of other apartments just like a man constantly changing channels on his television set. As Thelma Ritter's character Stella says, ""We have become a race of peeping toms"", relating to a key issue of the film: the voyeuristic tendencies of society.Although it would not be made for another twelve years, the film bears a strong resemblance to 'Blowup', with Jeffries stating that ""right now, I'd welcome trouble"", an indication that his mind is overactive, searching for something interesting to follow. And with his detective friend, a character representing the devil's advocate, we are constantly hanging on the edge, weighing up the evidence for ourselves. We are also able to do more investigating than what the characters themselves conduct. In different windows, different events occur, some of which the protagonists note, and others of which we ourselves observe only.The cinematography helps a lot in serving this cause. There are at least a couple of shots that scan the courtyard and then go back into Jeffries' apartment. These shots at first appear to be taken from the perspective of the characters, but since they do not end on the characters looking out the window, Hitchcock establishes a separation between us and the characters. We are learning more about what is happening outside when they are distracted. The way we are introduced to Jeffries also probes us to investigate: first we see his leg, then photos of accidents, and only later do we realise that the photographs are of potential accidents, rather than photos of his accident.The opening shots of the film are amazing. Three blinds are slowly opened in the background as the main credits roll, just like how we are slowly opening our eyes as the film begins. Then the camera goes through the window, explores the courtyard, and finally ends up inside Jeffries' apartment, and on a perfectly focused shot of Jeffries. Another great shot is Lisa's first scene, where she kisses Jeffries in slow motion, almost as if it is a dream. The film is full of great shots and excellent camera-work, and to think - Hitchcock probably had to call most of those shots from the distance! It's a very fine directorial achievement.Speaking of Hitchcock, his cameo here serves more purpose than in any other film of his. Before Thorwald notices that he is being watched, Hitch is the only character to actually look back at Jeffries. And aside from that, it's quite interesting with the whole relationship that is then established between director, actor, film, audience: the whole chain that is controlling what we are seeing. If nothing else, Hitch's cameo reminds us that even though we see more than what the characters are see, we only ever see ourselves what he allows us to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Had To Be Murder.,"L.B. Jefferies is a wheelchair bound photographer who by way of relieving his boredom, starts observing the lives of all his neighbours from his apartment window. As he gets deeper into the lives of all around him, he becomes convinced that one of hem has committed the act of murder, thus putting himself and those close to him in mortal danger.Much like most of Alfred Hitchcock's other lauded pictures, Rear Window has been dissected, examined, appraised and written about by far more versed people than myself, a mere film fanatic. So how do I even start to write a review of a film that I view as one of Hitchcock's best? Well maybe I should just write what I like about it without delving into psycho babble and a deconstruction of the human psyche and all its little offshoots! So I will!.Rear Window is adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and his writer John Michael Hayes, from the Cornell Woolrich story called It Had To Be Murder/Murder From A Fixed Viewpoint. The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth.Working from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved. What is often forgot by those more concerned with the psychological aspects of Rear Window is the blatant irony of L.B. Jefferies situation, his obsession with the neighbours is not confined to a probable case of murder, his interest first and foremost is with the love lives of those he observes, thus forcing (excusing) him to acknowledge the love from the woman who so wants to be in his life!It's also important to note the merits of each character of the piece, those that visit Jefferies and the conversations that take place, even the suspected murderer has a bemused interest pouring from his very frame. Rarely has a film been produced that has every single character having a critical element to the story. Then there is the ending where Hitchcock and his team weave all strands together to leave us wryly smiling away whilst simultaneously feeling that we have been had by the big director, and be under no illusions here, we have been at the mercy of a genius and party to a film of unquestionable quality. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great thriller,"Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt the king of suspense. I have been a fan of his for many years, so I knew I had to see this movie. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.POSSIBLE SPOILERS ********Jimmy Stewart is great as LB Jefferies, the cranky photographer who's wheelchair bound in his apartment with a broken leg. To pass the time, he begins playing Peeping Tom on his neighbors. Good thing there are some interesting characters around. There's the gorgeous ballerina, who loves prancing around in her undergarments, the party hardy pianist, the couple that sleeps on their fire escape (I love when it rains on them) and the volatile salesman with a bed stricken wife. Things get even more interesting when Jefferies starts to think the salesman has murdered his wife. He's going in and out of his place on a cold, rainy night, and the wife is no longer in bed, where did she go?Jefferies asks for the assistance of friend and former Air Force buddy Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey), who unfortunately, thinks he's crazy. Not to worry. Even though he won't fully commit to her, Jefferies is able to enlist his beautiful, sociable, and all around perfect girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) to do his dirty work. Being the fearless type, she's willing to take more risks than Jefferies imagines, a move that almost gets her killed and lands her in jail. Of course, Jefferies soon puts his own life at risk, which leads to the one action sequence in the movie (which is kind of cheesy and dated).One thing that was unique about Rear Window is that the whole film was shot in the same location, from Stewart's apartment. Hitchcock, not only good with suspense, is also able to do some fascinating camera work. Those shots of Stewart holding his camera are innovative and show how talented he was. I have to say, I don't think movies like this could be made anymore, for it isn't action packed. The mood slowly builds up until you have the final confrontation. No high speed chases, explosions, anything of that nature, just old fashioned suspense. The acting by Stewart and Kelly is wonderful and they had a great on screen relationship, even if Stewart's character is oblivious to the idea of love (how could you be if you had a woman like Grace Kelly)?If you're a person that loves blood and guts, plot twists, fast paced action, then do not see this movie. Many from Generation X and Y (which I am a part of) would be bored by this flick, but if you appreciate good film making and suspense, go see it, and you'll understand why Hitchcock gets so many accolades to this very day.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Classic!!!,"Rarely does a motion picture come along that is so genuinely intense that it sends cold chills down one's spine. This was a knack that late director Alfred Hitchcock immersed his films in-particularly, `Rear Window.' Starring the late, great Jimmy Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly, `Rear Window' is a spine tingling film that leaves the audience guessing and one the edge of their seat. 	L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (Steward) sits in his apartment, stuck in a wheel chair with a broken leg after photographing a car accident. He's been there for nearly seven weeks and all he does is watch out his apartment's back window at the other tenants in their apartments across his backyard. All seems normal until one night he hears a scream and notices that in one apartment, a woman who was sick in bed is no longer there. And her husband, a salesman, has been leaving the house late at night. Jeff suspects the man has killed his wife, but can't prove it. Jeff's story seems contrived and silly to his nurse, a close friend, and his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly). But clues soon turn up that will leave these characters forever changed.Hitchcock masterfully directs this classic from 1954. The one astounding aspect of `Rear Window' is that it all takes place inside Jeff's apartment. The camera never leaves the room, except to occasionally pan around the exterior of the backyard. Also, Hitchcock sets up interesting characters in each of the apartments. There are the newlyweds, a woman who is an artist, a woman who is a dancer, a man struggling with writing music that will sell, and another woman who is so distraught from lonliness that Jeff refers to her as Miss Lonely Heart.' 	The performances of `Rear Window' are some of best ever captured on celluloid. Naturally, Stewart can't touch a film without turning it to gold with his down-to-earth appeal. Kelly lights up the screen with her beauty and intriguing nature. Thelma Ritter is witty and engaging as Jeff's nurse, Stella, who provides her own insight into the relationship of Jeff and Lisa, but also into the possible murder. Wendell Corey plays Thomas Doyle, Jeff's friend who is an investigator. He gives his own explanation for the disappearance of the man's wife-she could have gone to visit family, or left him. And lastly, Raymond Burr plays Lars Thorwald, the man whose wife goes missing. Burr is terrifying in his portrayal as the strange salesman.All in all, `Rear Window' proudly takes its place among the top 100 movies of all time from the American Film Institute (AFI). It's certainly one of the best movies ever made not so much because it has the ability to terrify its audience, but because of the brilliance in the filmmaking by arguably the greatest director of all time, Hitchcock. `Rear Window' is available for rental at local video stores. ****",,Anonymous,Mystery

Rear Window: A True Classic,"I always loved Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", so when i found out we would be watching ""Rear Window"" in my college film class i was excited. Surprisingly i didn't know much about the film, and had never seen it before. It is so much fun to watch a classic for the first time. The movie is so full of suspense it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.When ""Jeff"" (James Stewart) continually spies on his neighbor believing him to be a murderer, the plot thickens. I love mysteries, and i wasn't sure throughout the movie if i also believed there had been a murder, or if i thought maybe ""Jeff"" was just paranoid. Hitchcock uses great elements to build the suspense, such as POV (Point of View) shots that really make you feel for the protagonist. He is seemingly helpless stuck in that wheelchair of his. I also loved how Hitchcock not only included the story of the upstairs neighbor, but also of many other neighbors surrounding the courtyard. Downstairs, Miss Lonely Hearts was also an object of ""Jeff""s voyeurism.This film was interesting for 1954, an era when peeping tom's were not accepted, much less as the ""hero."" It broke down barriers by showing women ""spending the night"", and dancing around in their underthings. This film has definitely become a new favorite of mine, and i would recommend it to any movie-buff's out there that haven't yet seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An acquired taste,"I didn't really know much about this movie until the 90's and never made it all the way through until the last few years. Now it's a high-priority selection. Action photographer Stewart is injured and confined to the rear porch of his modest Manhattan apartment, which overlooks a courtyard and many other units. He thinks he sees a murder, or is his under-stimulated mind just imagining things? It's so good you don't even realize that the camera is (just like Jimmy) grounded on Stewart's back porch. Kelly is great as the dedicated love interest and Ritter equally so as Stewart's nurse. Stewart is about twice Kelly's age and pretty much looks it, just the same there is a certain chemistry between the two. A pre-Mason Raymond Burr is effectively scary as the suspected killer. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A multi-layered voyeuristic masterpiece,"Rear Window is about an immobilised man Jeff who is restricted to his apartment and spies on his neighbours through boredom. He is sure he witnesses a neighbour called Thorwald murder his wife across the courtyard and is thereafter determined to prove he is right. He enrols the help of his girlfriend Lisa to help him solve the puzzle.Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest critical and commercial successes of the 50's. Starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly (introduced with a glorious dream-like slow-motion kiss), it followed the template of his earlier films such as The 39 Steps where it combined suspense, comedy and romance. It is also one of his most purely cinematic movies. The story is told by imagery whenever possible such as the opening pan where we see all the neighbours, then the bandaged Jeff and the contents of his apartment – in this brief bit of camera work we learn much about Jeff's situation without a word being spoken. The camera POV almost never leave's Jeff's apartment. We observe the people across the courtyard but we only faintly hear them at best. The film relies on an optically subjective narrative, where we see what Jeff sees, and we see how he reacts. The issue of voyeurism presents the film's moral dilemma. Is it right to spy on your neighbours? Obviously Jeff uncovers a murder so his actions seem ultimately justified but there is an underlying darkness to his motives. It could be reasonably argued that Jeff subconsciously wants Thorwald to have murdered his wife so that he has an exciting murder-mystery to solve that will alleviate the daily boredom of recovering from his broken leg.Rear Window is a film about looking. It reflects the cinematic experience itself. Jeff passively watches other lives unfold from a fixed position in a similar way to how we the audience watch movies. The neighbours could almost be said to represent different genres of film – the musician (the musical), Miss Lonelyhearts (the melodrama), the elderly couple with the dog (domestic comedy), Miss Torso (soft-core erotica), the newlyweds (social realism), the Thorwalds (murder-mystery). At the very least, his neighbours over the courtyard represent a microcosm of the society of a big city. Moreover, the scenes from the other apartments offer alternative possibilities to Jeff's own bachelor life – loneliness (Miss Lonelyhearts), the restrictions of marriage (the newlyweds) and, at a horrific extreme, domestic homicide (the Thorwalds). The roles that the immobile Jeff and the active Lisa are reversed over the court with Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife. Much of the romantic thread of the film concerns Jeff's reluctance to commit to Lisa, and unmistakable parallels can be drawn between them and the Thorwalds.Rear Window in other words is a multi-layered masterpiece. An experimental visual exercise, a romantic drama, an examination of the cinema watching experience; and of course a witty, supremely acted and immaculately directed thriller. Much more than meets the eye!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitch's best,"A taut, intelligent script and two wonderful performances from the leads make REAR WINDOW another of Hitchcock's masterpieces. The story, about a wheelchair-bound man witnessing a murder is the kind of simple, single-set setup that Hitchcock loved best and he makes full use of the premise by ladling it with humour, suspense and all kinds of tension. Stewart and Kelly make for an irresistible double act and the murder plot is delightfully dark and full of menace.While it doesn't feature the kind of intricate plotting that makes DIAL M FOR MURDER my favourite Hitchcock yet, REAR WINDOW is nonetheless an iconic and influential high concept thriller and a real one off.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Doot, Doot, Doot, Looking Out His Backdoor","While recovering from a nasty leg injury, James Stewart finds himself looking out the back window of his apartment. Grace Kelly just wishes he'd look at her. Thelma Ritter wonders what's so special outside worth looking at. Raymond Burr wishes James looked at Miss Torso a little longer.Alfred Hitchcock's directorial prowess is on full display in ""Rear Window,"" a film that IMDb viewers have made the 14th best in movie history. Not to burst your bubble, but Hitch made better flicks than this, like ""Psycho,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Strangers On A Train,"" ""The 39 Steps,"" and my all-time Hitchcock favorite, ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" But ""Rear Window"" is a hard film not to like, especially after you've seen it once or twice. The format is special, if not unique by Hitchcock standards, where we have a very controlled, limited setting, a man's Greenwich Village apartment that faces a courtyard and a number of apartment windows into various neighbors' lives. Think ""Lifeboat,"" ""Rope,"" or ""Dial M For Murder,"" only more varied. Instead of the people on the main set facing danger, they see apparent danger in a neighbor's dwelling, and sip adult beverages and chew fancy dinners while contemplating how to respond.Making it more special is the fact Stewart and Kelly do much of the thinking. Stewart's L.B. Jeffries is the main character, a bored photographer of some repute laid up by an injury he suffered while covering an auto race. Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont is the high-profile, haute couture model used to wearing $1,100 gowns (in 1954!) and dining at Manhattan's 21 Club, but somehow willing to settle for Stewart amid all the Prince Rainier and Zoolander types she undoubtedly comes across.However absurd, the central relationship is cemented by an apparent murder Jeffries thinks he witnesses, and Fremont comes to believe he did, involving a neighbor and his nagging wife. It's a bit of an irony, and a pretty marvelous one, that has Hitchcock celebrate one impeding marriage by making them apparent vultures in the untimely demise of another. Such was Hitchcock.Great Greenwich Village ambiance, circa the early 1950s and ""My Sister Eileen/Wonderful Town"" rather than the drag queens and Stonewall riots of the near future. Boho artists co-exist with Miss Lonelyhearts-spinster types and costume jewelry salesmen that may be up to something more sinister, or not.I wasn't a fan of Grace Kelly until that shot of her in Thorwald's apartment looking out the window while holding the purse upside down. Now I think she's swell. Thelma Ritter seems to have dropped in from a Neil Simon comedy next door, but she totally rules the scenes she's in. The set design, and the peeks at the neighbors, is especially well-wrought. That scene when Stewart and Miss Lonelyhearts share a silent, sad toast across the courtyard is one of cinema's finest moments.While the mystery itself is kind of hokey and patly resolved, there's something special in the way it comes together on screen. It's one of Hitchcock's best meetings of comedy and suspense, and a great romance besides despite an early handicap (a beautiful, successful woman totally devoted to the leading man.) There's nothing to really dislike in this film, and while it's still not Hitch's best despite what all the IMDb voters say, it's a good-enough standard bearer for the best director cinema's ever known.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Thriller I've Ever Seen,"I think that Alfred Hitchcock's rear window is a fantastic movie. I'd go as far as to say that it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There are a few main aspects of the film that I would like to point out that sold me on this wonderful film: the framing and filming techniques, suspense building, and pacing of the film were all perfect, and made for an interesting, thrilling, and over-all exciting display of some of theater's finest filming techniques that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.
 First, the framing of the film was excellent. Upon first hearing the premise, that the entire movie takes place from one man's room, you might be hesitant. Such a boring, consistent setting couldn't possibly make for an interesting film. But within the first few minutes of starting, you find very quickly that these first impressions were very wrong. The film manages to build a complex, active, and very real world using just the room of main character, photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, and the view from his window. By cutting from shots of his apartment to the surrounding complex outside, the movie manages to make you think there's more to this film than just Jeff's living room. On top of this, the framing techniques used keep the film exciting. To start, you never see more than Jeff can through his window; this allows you to really connect with the characters, and theorize about the events going on at the same time as they do. We'll talk more about this under pacing, but the film always gives you just enough information to make you wonder what's really going on. Using what's not shown in frame as much as what is, Hitchcock manages to keep you glued to the screen throughout the movie.
 This lasting interest is brought about just as much through the pacing and suspense of the film. While Jeff is looking out his window one day, he notices some suspicious behavior from one of his neighbors, and begins to think he has witnessed a murder. As the film continues, the evidence of this is given to you in bits and pieces. You only see half the story, and half to piece the puzzle together yourself, along with the main characters, who slowly start to believe Jeff's theories about his neighbor's actions. However, with every bit of evidence towards the crime, Jeff's detective friend strikes it down with a completely logical explanation, leading Jeff, and the audience along with him, to believe that he might be delusional. Every plot point in the film is spaced beautifully, so that every time you think you've figured it out, some new idea or suspicious act comes up and throws you completely off. As Jeff slowly convinces more people that he's witnessed a murder, there are always others who outright deny his ideas.
 Another point related to pacing is the building of suspense. The movie manages to subtly build suspense as the movie progresses, resulting in a thrilling conclusion. One method it uses to do this is by confining our hero. Due to an accident at a race track, Jeff is confined to the wheelchair in his room with a broken leg. He is unable to leave his room, which is what results in him watching his neighbors through his rear window. The suspense continues to build as he watches helplessly as the events before him unfold. There's nothing he can do but watch it happen and try to make a convincing argument. 
 With all of these filming concepts combined, Alfred Hitchcock was able to produce one of the best thrillers of all time, certainly the best I've ever seen. It was intense, interesting, and kept me theorizing until the last second. With a great cast and exceptional production value, I would easily recommend this film to anyone looking for a classic with an exciting plot and interesting premise that will keep you engaged and entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What Have You Done with Her?,"In New York, the daring photographer L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart) has been confined to his small apartment for five weeks in a wheelchair with one broken leg. He snoops his neighbors from his rear window to kill time and he is aware of the personal dramas of some of them. His fancy girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) is pressing him to marry her but he believes she will not fit and feel comfortable with his brash lifestyle. When the invalid wife of the salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) vanishes, Jeff believes the man might have killed her. He tells his concerns to Lisa and to his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and the women agree with his observations, but his friend Detective Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) finds reasonable explanation for each remark. However, Lisa decides to go further in her investigation, getting closer to the suspect.""Rear Window"" is one of my favorite classics ever and I do not know precisely how many times I have watched this film. There are many rip-offs of this simple story but none of them gets closer to this wonderful film. The first difference is in the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, a refined director with the subtle and witty British humor, capable to give meaning to a scene with one word or expression of his characters. The awesome James Stewart and the gorgeous and classy Grace Kelly show a perfect chemistry and it is impressive the beauty and elegance of the future princess of Monaco. Thelma Ritter is excellent in the role of the caustic nurse Stella. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the apartment of the composer twiddling his clock. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Janela Indiscreta"" (""Indiscreet Window"")Note: On 07 November 2024, I saw this film again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You'll never leave the blinds up again...,"They don't make movies this way anymore.  Consider how deceptively simple the plot is-A photographer, confined to a wheelchair until his broken leg heals, is spying on his neighbors in an apartment complex and thinks that he is the only witness to a murder.  The movie often seems simple, too-The camera shots are pretty much only what the lead character can see, meaning that you see everyone in the complex from outside their windows.  Yet this movie never needs the heart-pounding airplane chase of North by Northwest to build a powerful momentum that hooks you in and never lets you go.I must be fortunate-I saw this when it was re-released into theaters recently.  Twice.  I loved it so much the first time that I had to see it again.  I've seen the last hour on TV twice since.  Even when presented with only that last hour, I still couldn't stop watching until the ending credits rolled.  Yes, they don't make movies like this anymore.The leading players are well-chosen.  You've got James Stewart as the wheelchair-bound photographer and Grace Kelly as his rich, fashionable girlfriend who is head-over-heels for him.  Theirs is not the only love story-several people in the complex have their own romances to deal with, in particular, the tragic Miss Lonelyheart, who sets dinner for two every night, even though she never has company.  The characters we see from a distance are surprisingly well-developed, and live such natural lives, such as a woman who lives on the top floor of the building across from the photographer.  She puts her dog in a basket everyday and lowers him down to the ground so that he can play.  Such simple traits are also very human.Then there is the gripping story.  You're never given any more information than our protagonist has.  Stewart is forced to prove that Mrs. Anna Thorwald was murdered by her husband, Lars, and keeps trying to convince his detective friend (played by Wendall Corey) of her murder.  In the meantime, he's also trying to work out his own lovelife, and often what he sees in the windows reflect his mood, particularly a speech delivered by the woman with the dog about how neighbors should treat each other(another example of Hitchcock's masterful use of subtlety).It's these subtle details and deceptive simplicity that make this movie so fantastic.  You just don't see movies like this now-everything must now be explicitly stated to the audience.  Hitchcock does not play that game-he expects his audience to be intelligent enough to understand the meaning of every scene and to know what is going on without the characters explaining even the most minute details.  This movie should be required viewing for everyone that loves movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An enjoyable nostalgic look at an old movie,"For the third time in the last five years or more! I saw this film again on TV.  It was preceded by a film about Hitchock so this time I was looking for his identity as a Director more than the content of the film.I was disappointed with the story, the acting from two great actors, and the very limited set.  There was no suspense that normally could be expected from a Hitchcock film, even taking account that I had seen it before.The problem is that films date, we expect more now from writers, actors, producers and directors.  Everything moves on and up.  For example does anybody really enjoy silent movies anymore.  Would our children ever bother to see them?Although current technology in film making does not replace good acting and a good storyline, it does save a film which is deficient in these.  We used to accept almost anything put on the magic screen, because it was an experience.  Now we want more. I wonder if the producers of the new Star Wars epic have learnt the lesson - not rely on any one of the following three, all are important, storyline first,  acting and then the effects to stimulate the senses.  Although I have not seen the film yet, and I will when it comes to the UK,  I suspect by the many negative comments that there is too much reliance on technology and not enough on story and acting.  I hope  I'm  wrong . If not, an ideal chance to get it right would have been missed .  I will reserve judgement.",,Anonymous,Mystery
7.8/10 - A Little Bit For Everyone,"Rear Window is considered to be amongst Hitchcock's best films by many critics and fans alike. Its name is said with the same breath as Vertigo (which I love) and Psycho (which I'm yet to see), but either way you get the picture, pun intended. High expectations, that in the most TL;DR fashion I'll tell you that weren't met, though I do consider this film to be a good one.Rear Window is about this photographer guy, Jefferies, who can get out of his house for quite a while now since he broke his leg while doing his job. Anyway, this film has two main layers, I'd say.One is the way that Jefferies decides to spend the time he's grounded looking out of his window and watching the lives of his neighbours from a safe distance. He even gives them nicknames - Miss Lonelyhearts, The Salesman, Miss Torso. You got the idea. Surely but slowly he's getting pulled into the lives of others, cannot stay uninvolved as he obeserves something very peculiar.The second is his troublesom romance with young Lisa Fremont, a girl who's ""too perfect"", to quote Jefferies himself.One of the more unique aspects of Rear Window is the perspective it gives us as the audience. We do just what Jefferies does, in a way, taking a look into the mysterious world of other people's private life. It's evident in the camerawork, the way that we see most characters in this film through Jefferies window only and how most of the film actually occurs inside of Jefferie's room. You could even argue that all of it happens there, in a way, which is something that I don't remember seeing done in any other film.I also like quite a bit the way that Hitchcocks diguises this film as a mystery film genre-wise, but it's actually more of a love story reflected through the mystery that surfaces here. It's cute, even.The score is great, too, in more than one way. I mean, it's both the background music - which is really good as it is, but it immerses us even further into the film by being diegetic - and the songs that appear on the film (specifically with Miss Lonelyhearts) which allude to some interesting details about her psyche.And, the thing that's evident in all of the film, is just how witty and fun the dialogue is. It has some genuinely funny puns, it flows well and I really like it overall.Though I don't think that there was anything specific that bothered me here, I do see it as a cute love-story film with creative motifs and a moral about the dangers of voyeurism and getting sucked into the lives of others, and nothing as grand or creative as Vertigo for instance. It's solid, accessible, well made. No complaints really, besides some minor pacing stuff here and there, but generally worth watching (though it doesn't live up to the hype in my eyes). I'd even say that it's more relevant today, with social media and all.So, Rear Window has something for almost everyone - romance, mystery, philosophy, well done cinematography. A bit of everything and a good amount of charm. Sure, I think it's somewhat overrated, but it's definitely worth your time if you ask me. I'm feeling a 7.8/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Minimalist Suspense at its Best,"The night is dark, quiet. But at peace? No. Jimmy Stewart, playing a gritty photographer, sleeps in his wheel-chair, the victim of some car racing accident, the result of his attempting to obtain an extraordinary picture. Now he's fettered by a cast as the result of this daring attempt. A shadow moves over his sleeping body. Is it malevolent? A rival come to enact revenge? Or the grim reaper come to take Stewart's soul? NO! It is none other than the 1950's goddess of cinema, Grace Kelly replete with white gown, scarf and gloves. She moves over the drowsy photographer and plants a kiss on his lips. The shadow is not a monster at all but an angel from Hollywood Heaven. Stewart has died and gone to eternal Paradise where he will love and worship Princess Grace for eternity! But for most of the movie he doesn't quite realize that Kelly is a beautiful gift, even beautifully wrapped!There are films, both old and new, which boast a ""cast of thousands"" and shot in 5 different continents. Well, there are few feature-length films that were shot only on one sound state. And maybe none that I know of whose primary shots are essentially a handful of camera angles from a single vantage point on that one sound stage. Yet this is what Hitchcock does to tell a very compelling story. And the viewpoint is a laid-up photographer played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart who has nothing better to do than watch people through his rear window.The focus is Stewart's suspicion of criminal acts by one of his neighbors who he can see across the way with either his binoculars or his camera with zoom lens. His suspicion is aroused through his habit of innocently spying on the the inhabitants of the buildings on his block. What's interesting is the amount of mileage Hitchcock attains from telling a story from this peculiar vantage point in the form of other sub-stories. There is the woman on the bottom-floor of the apartment across the way who can't seem to find the right man, dubbed ""Miss Lonely Heart"". There is another younger woman, a dancer, who can't seem to keep men away from her. She is named ""Miss Torso."" A songwriter and/or composer lives in another apartment. A newlywed couple move in to another apartment. As the story unfolds, the other stories unfold as well in different ways. And in addition to the main story, most of the other stories have some sort of resolution by the end of the film.This cinematic concept is one of the most innovative techniques ever backed by a major film studio. Stewart is perfectly cast as the husky photographer turned amateur sleuth. Grace Kelly who only seems to get better with each viewing, plays Stewart's desperate girlfriend who is involved in the fashion industry on Madison Avenue. The characters seem made for each other like Dracula and sunlight. She loves the glitz and glamorous life of the sophisticated fashion crowd on Madison Avenue while he seems more at home crawling in the mud of another country to get the photograph of a lifetime. Thelma Ritter keeps Stewart in check as the reluctant nurse who tries to get him to take the plunge with Kelly and also gets caught up in the mystery. And Raymond Burr plays the man across the way to whom Stewart focuses his attention. His unsmiling haunting expressions are enough to portray his secretive character.This is an absolute masterpiece of film-making. The dialog is fun, witty, sarcastic, with constant innuendos about love and marriage. Kelly plays the ""straight-man"" while Stewart get's away with lines that he'd be lynched for today by women's groups. The only thing that doesn't make sense: why is Stewart so reluctant to tie the knot with Kelly? Grace Kelly was probably the Cary Grant of actresses in the 1950's with millions of males looking on with absolute jealousy of her leading men. (I'm sure many men's heart went bust when she became Princess Grace) Of course, Stewart sees her as ""too perfect"", ""too beautiful"", and ""too smart"" for him. Ironically, the more he pushes her away the more she wants to come back to him. Which does point to one of the strangest foibles of the human psyche: when someone can't quite have something that he or she wants, the more he or she wants it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Best Hitchcock ever,"IMHO this is the best Alfred Hitchcock movie ever made. It is even better than Psycho which I consider one of the greatest movie of all times. It is often imitated but never duplicated. And every time it's referenced, there is no doubt that it's this movie that is the originator.Photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is stuck at home in his New York apartment after breaking his leg while getting a shot. He does nothing but look out his rear window. He suspects his neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) of murder and enlists the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).This takes place all in the same place inside his apartment. First it allows for the voyeuristic tendency in everyone. It is something hidden that Hitchcock has dug up and presented wrap in a pretty bow. Second he has the perfect everyman in Jimmy Stewart. Third Hitchcock has dug his little hands into our brains. He knows that we all make up little stories for all those we spy on. I love that even the voices from the neighbors are muffled as we strain to hear them.It is the perfect film because none of it is wasted. Every frame of film is consumed as we try to decipher clues from them. Grace Kelly is impossibly gorgeous which makes it even easier on the eyes.

"Hitchcocks Best, Cinemas Best","This is the greatest movie of all time. I believe that Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest actors ever and that Grace Kelly is one of the best actresses of the era. Rear Window takes place in a small apartment complex in the village. Jimmy Stewart plays famous photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies who after an accident is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. He has nothing to do but stare out of the window and look at the neighbors. He plays this role very well. When Jeff thinks he has witnessed a murder from the apartment across the way he gets help from his high society girl friend Lisa played by Grace Kelly and his comical nurse Stella played by Thelma Ritter and his detective friend Lt. Doyle played by Wendell Corey. When you carefully watch the movie you can see that there is a great amount of humor throughout the whole film as well as a whole crap-load of suspense. Thelma Ritter is the more obvious comic relief of the film with funny one liners: "" When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway. "" One thing that this movie tackles is the subject of voyeurism the act of watching someone without there knowledge and not for sexual gratification. This is what most movies are anyway, we are in a way spying on the people in the movie and become interested in their lives.This movie just focuses on it specifically. One thing that it is interesting is how the camera never leaves Jeff's apartment. We can see conversations between the neighbors but we can not hear what they are saying so we have to figure out what is going on by their body language. The whole movie is a bunch of reaction shots from Stewart. Jeff sees something, then we see him react to it. Another thing in this movie is the relation ship between Jeff and Lisa ""Jeff: She wants me to marry her. Stella: That's normal. Jeff: I don't want to. Stella: That's abnormal."" Jeff feels that her lifestyle would not be the kind that she would want to be apart of seeing that he travels all over the world to photograph things like war and other things of that nature"" Raymond Burr stars as the suspected murderer Lars Thorwald.

One of Hitchcock's best. Nearly as great as Psycho.,"Rear Window is Alfred Hitchcock's comment on the voyeuristic quality of society (`We've become a race of peeping toms'). It is the story of a man bound to a wheelchair by a broken leg who sees what he believes to be a murder being covered up in an apartment across the courtyard from him.James Stewart delivers an excellent performance as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, the magazine photographer who is bound to a wheelchair and who finds himself spying on his neighbors, at first out of boredom but very soon out of strong suspicion. This is a very talky thriller and is limited entirely to what is seen from Jeff's large apartment window. The fact that the entire two-hour film takes place in such a small setting is a strong statement about Hitchcock's tremendous skills as a director. He makes the film interesting in countless ways, such as his excellent, meaningful use of shadows, the very thorough character development, his interesting use of symbolism (such as Jeff's difficulty in reaching itches underneath his cast), not to mention the amazingly effective suspense, a Hitchcock trademark.Just before Jeff notices some suspicious events occurring across the courtyard, he is constantly complaining about not being able to find any interesting work as a photographer, and it is ironic that he soon finds something interesting right outside his own window, and while he is confined to a wheelchair, no less. The fascinating crime story of the man across the courtyard having murdered his wife is made even creepier by the fact that it is all deducted from behavior that Jeff sees out his window, and we don't even find out for sure if he is right or not until the film's exciting climax. Hitchcock fans are also likely to notice a line of dialogue that may have foreshadowed some of the events that were to later take place in Psycho, such as the insurance company nurse's speculation that the killer must have cut up his wife's body in the bathtub (`That's the only place he could have washed away the blood').Another thing that sets Rear Window aside from other thrillers (including its own 1998 re-make which, incidentally, was far superior to the 1998 re-make of Psycho), was the way that it had several stories going on at the same time, which is one of the ways that it was able to remain so interesting. Jeff is an injured photographer, he is unsatisfied with his work, he is having a dilemma about marrying his sweetheart because he feels she is too perfect for him (the flimsiest excuse on the planet, of course, but he actually makes it make a little bit of sense), and then he comes across these events across the courtyard from his apartment that make him think that there has been a murder over there, and the murderer (Raymond Burr) is trying to cover it up.Some of the things that happen in this film are not perfect, or seem uncharacteristic of Hitchcock, but the film as a whole is still spectacularly effective. For example, as a Hitchcock scholar, I found it strange that the killer strangled the dog and left it in the middle of the courtyard for all to see (and for Jeff to make revealing conclusions about). Think about how much more effective this would have been if the woman who owned the dog had just stood out on her porch calling for him, and he never came. This way, the realization that the man had killed the dog would have been much more gradually realized, and may have made the suspense created by it that much more impressive. At any rate, this is an outstanding film, and Hitchcock definitely created an amazing amount of suspense with such limited means, leading up to a tremendous climax that provided a quick but satisfying ending to this classic film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Saucy Voyeurism,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's FINAL Hitchcock movie review is Rear Window (1954), starring Hitch's frequent collaborator, the legend James Stewart who plays Jeffries, a photographer who is currently bound to a wheelchair due to breaking his leg and is slowly recuperating. Jeffries passes his time spying on his neighbours from his apartment window during his recovery and soon becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. So, what does good old Jefferies do? He sees what he believes to be a murder and decides to solve the crime himself with the help of his nurse and love interest played by Grace Kelly. This is a beautifully constructed as a story with a few laughs throughout the flick and the master gives makes you second guess on who is in the wrong here? The flick swims through the themes of voyeurism and projecting your own narrative onto things. It would have been interesting had Stewart's character been darker such as actually taking pictures of his neighbours, which would enhance his obsession on what is happening outside his apartment window. The ending to me doesn't execute the building tension throughout the flick nor does it question on whether it is ethical and moral to meddle in others' affairs. The apartment neighbours play interesting minor characters in the film which provide interesting subplots and would have been great if the master diverged from a simple generic ending to a darker toned ending which would of emphasized how paranoia can inflict damage both internally and to others. Another great element is how Hitch effectively uses the ""three-part POV"" by using intense zoom-ins which provides the movie goer the central character POV. Overall a fun inventive flick 7/10. And that is a wrap with Hitchcock movies!!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Too much build-up, not enough payout","Honestly, I think this film is overrated. I felt that a lot of the film was just tension-building to a climax that never really arrived. The tension-building itself was very effective, but I was disappointed that it never amounted to anything. In fact I did get a little bored at times.Don't get me wrong, I don't think Rear Window was terrible, just overrated. I liked the small cast and small set, which I found really helped to convey the claustrophobia that Jeffries is feeling. It also did well in building the tension.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/6xbZO7",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A voyeuristic masterpiece of style and storytelling,"Rear Window (1954)Director Alfred Hitchcock's movies have almost always cut against one of the strongest currents in American Cinema: complete verisimilitude. Even some of his masterpieces, like North by Northwest, Vertigo, or Psycho use montage, special lighting effects, and backprojection to break out of pure believable film-making. But it's intentional. It's part of the experience of watching a movie, like watching a play, that reminds you that you are a viewer, and the movie is a separate thing, a work of art, or stretch of celluloid in a can.He even presses this point in every film by inserting himself in the movie. How can you not notice the director winking, as if to say, don't forget, this is all a big game.Rear Window makes intentional artifice the defining aesthetic of the entire shoot. And now wonderful it all works. Yes, we can totally accept it all, somehow. The events are unusual, but not unbelievable, and the acting is candid and remarkably nuanced with everyday expressions. Jimmy Stewart in particular is amazing as the wheelchair bound photographer with nothing to do but look at the neighbors in around the courtyard, but Thelma Ritter is also in top form, quirky but in a lovable, not distracting, way.The rest, outside, is all theater. We see with uncanny perfection what is happening through all these apartment windows, and so there is a dancer and a pianist and a newlywed couple and a lonely middle aged woman and a bickering couple and another couple who sleeps on the fire escape. It's exaggerated just so, partly comic, partly trenchant (who can not love the groom carrying the bride over the threshold?), and we see it more or less through Stewart's eyes, and appreciate his reactions up close. What a great set up for a movie, and for storytelling in general.And so, night and day and beautiful twilight, we learn about the neighbors and events begin to sort out and suspicions about one neighbor's activities rise. And rise higher, causing disruption among those in Stewart's apartment (including his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly). It goes from there, always a little lighthearted, but with such visual, quiet, deft handling you just sweep along happily, sometimes joyously. The echoes of camera angles, the moving in and out in space, the layering of close views and far as he looks through his camera's telephoto on and off, all make for a steady visual pace that gives a sense of control and confidence. We know we are in a deliberate movie, and that the artifice will surprise us and delight us both. And that we will come away unscathed, but enchanted.There might be better made films, or more ingenious films, or movies that have deeper messages and funnier lines, or ones that move you one way or another, but there are few films this carefully flawless. You might say that about any number of Hitchcock films, but in fact those brief moments of montage or backprojection in those films are distracting to us now, coming in a movie of greater verisimilitude. In Rear Window, as in Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter the next year, the artificial style and structure is part of the movie, and we accept it and require it to remain so.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

THE Ultimate Hitchcock Movie,"""Rear Window"" represents Alfred Hitchcock at his most playful.This is Hitchcock's most fully realized comment about the obsession with voyeurism that reared its head repeatedly throughout his ouvre, an obsession not only of his, but one shared by the characters in his films and the audience watching them -- for without the delight that comes in watching other people, who would filmmakers be making films for?""Rear Window"" is a nearly perfect movie: perfectly plotted, perfectly directed, perfectly acted. James Stewart could play characters like this in his sleep, but that fact does not make his performance any less entertaining. Some of the ice melts off of Grace Kelly's facade, and she gives the wittiest and sexiest performance of her career. And who can say enough about Thelma Ritter? A truly unique character actor in the history of cinema, Ritter always played the audience's id, thinking and saying all of the things all of the other characters in the film were too polite or nervous to think and say themselves. She could recite a weather forecast in that sardonic, world-weary monotone of hers, and it would still be funny.Hitchcock was always able to blend suspense, romance and social commentary to varying degrees of success, but almost always better than most other directors could manage. ""Rear Window"" stands as an example of what happened when he struck a perfect balance between all three.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sweating the details with the Master,"It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABOTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched. The result is not just Hitchcock's greatest film but one of the greatest films ever made.The marvelous detail of this film is just amazing. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are legends of the cinema and Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr are actor's actors. But the real star is the set, a world unto itself. And the photography of that set, all that was needed to allow us to see into the rooms clearly- it's amazing stuff, (the lighting needed was so hot it set off the sprinkler system). But even better than that is the sound. It's not all just flat on the soundtrack, like actors in a dubbing session. Like good radio drama, it recognizes that people who are some distance away sound different. The voices coming from across the courtyard are just perfectly done and do more than even the camera work to `put you there'.The musical score for this film is not a film score at all- it's the music of these people, also heard across the courtyard. We hear the composer composing his song. We don't hear him doing it in five minutes, as we have heard in all the musicals. Instead it evolves over time. The dramatic piano cords he plays underscore the drama to come. We also hear some opera music that does the same. Everyone seems to have their own music-everyone except Thorwald, the murderer. And what a brilliant touch it is to make the murder a pathetic man, instead of some brilliant mastermind. In the end, he is one of us, as well, in a twisted way.I can't think of another movie that creates a world so vivid for the audience to live in. ROPE was strictly about the action in the apartment. The view out the window is just a painted backdrop. Maybe a better comparison could me made to DEAD END, but as good as that film it's not really the same. Our perspective changes too much. Perhaps my favorite scene in REAR WINDOW is the one moment, (seconds, really), the perspective does change. It's when Jefferies is struggling with Thorwald and everyone in the apartment house looks in the direction of his apartment for a change. Now there's a twist!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock has done it again!,"This is the 3rd Hitchcock film I have seen, and like I predicted, it is a great film. The dialogue between the two main characters is smooth and engaging, and the mystery is riveting and suspenseful. Hitchcock is a master at suspense of course, and this film is no exception. The set design and the cinematography allowing the viewer to witness all of the different characters living in this neighborhood is simply amazing and unforgettable, and Hitchcock was able to really pull me into every scene. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are magnificent together and I loved how the film had just as much intimacy and romance as mystery. Outstanding film!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Vastly Over-rated,"I recently saw the restored print of this ""classic"" with some friends at the Music Box Theatre in Chicago.  After it was over, we all kind of stared at each other with slightly pained looks on our faces as if afraid to say what we really felt.  But none of us is truly that bashful about voicing opinions and it turned out we all shared the same one: namely that Rear Window was decent, but it was certainly no masterpiece and fell well short of our expectations.  I suspect the entire audience felt that way as there was very little crowd reaction to the film throughout and only polite applause at the end.  This is in marked contrast to the palpable thrill that the crowds at the Music Box's recent Kubrick film festival exhibited.I thought the film was slow paced and rather dull, and was over-dominated by subplots.  The suspense level was low throughout much of the film.  There were a few interesting vignettes about the lives of the various people who lived in the apartment building on the far side of the Greenwich Village courtyard, but ultimately these weren't enough to put this one into the above average category.I will confess that I've never been a big Hitchcock fan despite enjoying psychological thrillers.  So maybe that accounts for part of my shoulder shrug of this film.  Regardless, while I'm glad to have seen the film, I don't think I'll ever take the time to watch it again and I didn't come away impressed from my first screening.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Here's a good question,"Who is the hero in this film? Or Is the a hero in this film?Jimmy Stewart plays a helpless baby in this film. Stuck in a chair and unable to scream ""WATCH OUT"" to Grace Kelly, Rear Window has no hero character. Well what about Grace Kelly? She's adventurous enough to go jumping into windows, maybe she's the hero? Maybe not. A hero saves the day which Grace Kelly does not. She is unsuccessful in this case. So is this a thriller without a hero.....you tell me.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It didn't work for me, the suspense was missing.","I am aware that many people like this film a lot, and after many years it has indeed become a classic, and that's why I saw it for the first time yesterday. And I found it updated which is not very strange since we are talking about a film made in the early fifties. There is not much suspense in the plot mostly because as the story goes by, it is very obvious who the murderer is. The definition of suspense is: that the spectator should be guessing who the guilty person is, or even better: guessing who the bad guy is. In this film, we do know who the bad guy is, but we don't know if he really did it or not. Real suspense would have been that the guy that everyone thought that did it, in fact didn't, and that the one that looks innocent had done it. Now that would've been a twist! There are a couple of other things that killed the suspense in me. Why a man that is a photographer and tries to convince a policeman that his neighbour killed his wife and has no evidence and is looking through the window with a telephoto camera, doesn't take pictures of the scene of the crime and use them as evidence. And how come that a man that is going to murder his wife and cut her in small pieces doesn't draw down the window blinds so no one can see what he is doing and testify against him!?. But I have to admit, typically Hitchcock, delivers a proffesional job because he makes you see things that only a great director like him can. He will make you believe that Jeff and Lisa are absolutely right and everyone else is wrong just by watching this couple's attitude, created through their acting. And there is the strength of these actors; they are extremely reassuring in their personalities that as such, it impregnates the whole film. Just by the way they pose and sit and look you can almost smell that whatever they do is right. On the contrary, Thorwald hasn't a chance because from the very first scene he is doomed; he is the bad guy almost before the film has started. And I intuitively guessed it and killed all the suspense. I liked ""Vertigo"" even if some scenes are a little bit slow and long and I liked ""Psycho"", that's a masterpiece. But ""Rear Window"" it's too obvious.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Repeat watch this Classic,"As a Hitchcock fan, I am guilty of serial-watching his oeuvres. An engaging tale about spying on your neighbours, which perhaps many of us are guilty of, James Stewart and Grace Kelly are timeless on screen. Is it paranoia or is it real ? If you're hindered and your leg is on a cast, will you take note of every single thing happening around you which may be only baseless, unfounded fear? Is there a killer on the loose? What are you going to do about it? These are the myriads of questions you ask when you watch this film. I am one of those skeptics when a Classic such as this gets adapted and recycled ( e.g. Disturbia with Shia Leboeuf )since there was only one Hitchcock, one James Stewart and one Grace Kelly.

L.B. watching you ...,"An everyday man trapped in an out-of-control situation, a cool and sophisticated blonde with a burning flame and a heart-pounding paranoid sensation driving the narrative until a suffocating and suspenseful climax. On the surface, ""Rear Window"" is made of the same usual Hitchcockian ingredients, but the film has a specificity that elevates it above all the other Hitchcock experiences and best exemplifies his brilliance as a director and a storyteller.The secret of ""Rear Window""'s timeless appeal relies on its self-reflexive approach to whatever defined Hitchcock's style, in the first place, the identification with the hero. Here, we root for L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, not just because he's an ordinary man, but also because he's stuck in a condition similar to us with his leg casted after a car accident. He's still above ordinariness through his job, he's a photographer and from what it seems, quite an adventurer, the very cause of his accident happens to be due to his closeness to a car just to get the perfect shot. His métier, cleverly hinted in the opening scene with the shots on his material and pictures, is the perfect device to justify the presence of binoculars, and sort of redeem Jeffries' voyeurism by translating it into a simple case of job conditioning. But apart from these considerations, it's still not Jeffries the photographer whom we identify with, but Jeffries, the man.The man can't move, can't wear other clothes than his pajamas, a nice visual touch that makes the film even more memorable, he can't go outside and basically, he's condemned for a seven-week passivity. Therefore, the only area of freedom that is offered to him is to watch his neighbors from the titular window, and discovering their private lives. Hitchcock uses a clever plot device by setting the film in a hot summer week so it justifies why all the windows are open. We discover a beautiful neighborhood setting where each window represents a little vignette of action within a movie, there is Miss Lonelyhearts, the old maid seeking love desperately, Miss Torso, a pretty dancer who invites many guys at parties, a couple of newlyweds, another used to sleep in a balcony and owning a little pet dog, and there are the Thornwalds, the typical constantly-arguing couple. If only for the setting, the film is a remarkable technical and artistic achievement.Now, ""Rear Window"" doesn't question if watching the neighbors is morally defendable, Hitch is just stating the obvious, if we were put in Jeffries' situation, we would watch, because human nature has a tendency for voyeurism. It kind of reminds me of the French adage that says: 'when I see myself, I feel bad, when I see the others, I feel better'. Jeffries seems to enjoy watching people precisely to reconcile himself with his own condition. It's human and this is where we identify with him, especially when Hitchcock tricks us into admiring the voluptuous body of Miss Torso, or laugh at the couple caught by the rain. We're even more voyeur when we tend not to see what's wrong inside us, and this is the psychological dimension that enriches an already clever script. More than a mystery, ""Rear Window"" acts as an excellent character study and introspection into the mechanism of voyeurism. And the two female characters play a significant part by indirectly mirroring Jeffries' inner weaknesses that we'd notice if we weren't too busy watching what he watches.The first one is Thelma Ritter as Stella the no-nonsense caregiver who can't understand many of Jeffries' attitudes: why doesn't he marry Lisa, if she loves her? Why is he spending time watching other people, it will only cause trouble (and we know it will). Stella is the common sense of the story, and the reflection of Jeffries' own indecision. Lisa, on the other hand, provides the romantic aspect of the film, which is essential -her entrance with this extraordinary close-up is one of the most beautiful from any film-, Lisa is a fashion designer, elegant and classy, she spoils Jeffries, bringing a whole restaurant to his modest room, but he doesn't share her passion and doesn't feel like she could follow him. They love each other but they can't make up their minds, and while we see them arguing about the way to handle their relationship, we –viewers- experience exactly what Jeffries does every day.Indeed, Jeffries embodies our own perspective, and the neighbor's windows symbolize what we see on-screen. The film is remarkably told in focal perspective where we're put in the same position than the character, and the directing, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is particularly attentive to very simple but subtle details. Basically, each important moment of Jeffries' watching is regulated in three times, he sees- we see what he sees and then his reaction (a smile, a surprise, a shock ) betrays his interpretation. A voice-over would have cheated with the concept, now we only see and try to figure out what happened from what he saw. And when Thornwald leaves the house many times during a rainy night, taking saw and ropes, and suddenly his wife isn't here for the next days, anyone can get suspicious. But Hitch also teases us by showing us things that gets unnoticed by Jeffries. We're frustrated because we know something he doesn't and can't do anything, we're powerless, but ironically, so is Jeffries.And this is where the power of the climax relies, because Jeffries can't do anything, he can't move, he can't even cry for help if he becomes the watched or if he sees his beloved Lisa in danger in Thronswald's house. The suspense here allows us to experiment the viewer's condition on the character and uses the romance to drive the narrative: Lisa becoming a bit of an adventurer and Jeffries starting to put his own troubles and torments into perspective, and learning that any watcher should watch himself first  which of course, applies for us too.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Oldie but goodie from Hitchcock,"A nice example of an old classic. Movie, made in 1954, compels with likeable and truthful characters of that time. Story takes place only in one city backyard.

Eventually, main characters who observe others get to dwell deep into something they find suspiciously shady.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Look Through Any Window,"One of Hitchcock's abiding masterpieces where he got everything just about right, from the screenplay, cast and above all execution of his ideas. He exposes the voyeur in himself but also in the viewer by pointing his subjective camera at the occupants of a block of flats which sits directly opposite James Stewart's crocked photo-journalist, L. B. Jeffries. Laid up in a cast after an accident at his last assignment, assimilated in a brilliant panning shot around the objects in his flat, he's bored rigid and thirsting for action. With his enforced fixed location, adjacent telephoto lens and I presume lack of television, he's drawn to the lives of the neighbours right in front of him, going about their everyday lives unaware of the prying eyes looking in from across the way.The only company L. B. receives is from his masseuse, the worldly, feisty Thelma Ritter and his glamorous, beautiful girlfriend, played by a luminous Grace Kelly. Kelly's Lisa Fremont is mad for L. B. and wants to marry him but he's cool on the idea, suspecting her of being a shallow, domesticated fashion-obsessed airhead and a poor fit for his preferred exciting life-style.Then a particular couple in his eyeline catch his attention, Raymond Burr's Lars Thorwald and the prickly relationship he has with his bedridden wife. They clearly don't get on, she forever nagging him while he seems to have another chick on the side. When the wife disappears and Thorwald is seen to be acting suspiciously, at least in Jeffries' eyes, it's not long before the journalist in him thinks he's onto a real-live murder case so that sure enough he tries to inveigle a cop friend, Wendell Corey as well as Kelly and Ritter into believing him.It's just a wonderful movie, with the Master clearly on top-form throughout. From the opening image of Stewart's restricted viewpoint, to the classy cinematography and fluid camerawork, sharp, at times risqué and darkly humorous dialogue and top acting by not only the leads but also all of those who act out their little vignettes, it's just about the perfect thriller, with more than a little concealed subversion, for good measure.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Possibly Hitchcock's best,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is one of his best known films, along with the likes of ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"" & ""North by Northwest"". It is perhaps his most purely cinematic film while also showcasing his mastery of the art of suspense.The story concerns a photographer (James Stewart) who is stuck in his apartment nursing a broken leg. He occupies his time by watching the actions of his neighbours. When he begins to suspect one of them of murder he enlists the aid of his socialite girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter).While the film's cast members didn't land any Oscar nominations there were nevertheless several fine performances. You could say that James Stewart's performance almost single-handedly carried the picture but that would seem dismissive of the quality support given by Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey & Raymond Burr. Meanwhile, Grace Kelly looks exquisite in the female lead and she gives an excellent performance to boot.The direction of Alfred Hitchcock and the screenplay of John Michael Hayes (both Oscar-nominated) are best considered in tandem. The separate threads of the intricate storyline are masterfully manipulated by Hitchcock with a visual approach that puts us squarely in Stewart's position. Also, I'm not usually one who notices sound design in films but the sound in this film is superb. Little wonder that it was nominated for an Oscar, as was the attractive cinematography. The Edith Head costumes also deserve special mention.Ultimately, ""Rear Window"" is practically flawless. It's highly satisfying both as a piece of entertainment and as a piece of cinematic art. Anyone looking to experience Hitchcock at his best would be well advised to start here.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A culture that loves to watch,"Only in the hands of master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock could a seemingly simple tale about a man in a wheelchair watching his neighbours be twisted into a captivating tale of suspense and intrigue, mixed with a sturdy backbone of moral and ethical dilemmas and a social commentary on the culture that would be viewing the film. Hitchcock, who was notorious for mixing in such deeper themes with seemingly superficial suspense epics seemed to particularly relish the tale of Rear Window, a film entirely devoted to a man simply watching. At first glance, the plot sounds overly contrived, even downright dull, but under Hitchcock's careful grasp, the film never drifts into anything less than crackling with low key intrigue and tension - but always equally thought provoking as well as entertaining throughout.Rear Window proved innovative in film-making style as well as supremely entertaining movie - a masterpiece in pacing, as well as a unique narrative style. The story plays itself out as a murder mystery, but as the plot unfolds, the solution remains abundantly clear to the audience watching the events transpire. Rather than throwing in a hackneyed forced plot twist near the end, Hitchcock is content to simply let the climax unfold exactly as the viewer would have predicted all along - after all, the joy of the film is not solving a mystery, but merely observing the murderous event itself transpire. In a day and age grown so accustomed to climatic plot twists, the absence of any is in itself more of a surprise than another forced plot twist would have been. Unfortunately, one of the film's minuscule flaws is that its ending comes across as a touch abrupt and forced; a minor lapse in pacing in a film which proves an otherwise stellar example of it.But Hitchcock is not content with simply telling his story in an innovative fashion - his trademark deeper and darker themes make their way into a story which seems deceptively simple, brilliantly written by John Michael Hayes. In many ways, the premise of Rear Window serves as a social commentary on mass culture: people love to watch. How else to explain the enormous generation of income of the film industry than the general public's fascination with the stories of other people; often moreso than in their own lives. James Stewart's character seems to act as a representation of most audience members - too captivated by the social dramas of his neighbours and the glamour of potential murder (another trademark Hitchcock theme) to pay attention to his own life.And there is no denying that it is enjoyable to watch, as we, the audience, get easily drawn into the private lives of these seemingly inconsequential characters (""Miss Torso"", ""Ms. Lonelyhearts"" and ""The Pianist"" as Stewart refers to them) framed by the spectacular cinematography, all shot from the room of Stewart's apartment - another reference as to how little it takes to entertain an audience. Indeed, Rear Window seems to serve as a precursor to the world of reality television, and the fascination ensuing from watching shows such as Survivor or Big Brother - simply observing ""real life"" as it is billed.Hitchcock also raises moral issues as to the ethics of observing to the point of intrusion of privacy in a scene where Stewart debates the ethics of spying on his neighbours, even if he may bring a murderer to justice. Hitchcock seems to be silently making raising the question to his audiences - we are a culture that loves to watch, but is it always right to watch, and are we always meant to see what we see? Whatever decisions or interpretations audiences may take out of Hitchcock's social commentaries, their mere presence in the film make the unfolding of the plot that much more interesting to follow, and add strongly to the quality of the film overall.An already brilliantly realized film is only made more powerful by the immensely capable cast - James Stewart proves perfect casting as the ornery yet charming L. B. Jeffries, the wheelchair bound photographer with a bizarre interest in his neighbours' private lives, determined to prove one of them to be a murderer. The peerlessly elegant Grace Kelly brings sheer class to the film as Jeffries' socialite girlfriend, though how could Jeffries ever be capable of pushing such an ideal woman away, and why she continue to be interested in one who comes across as a cranky older man is truly a question for the ages. Character actress Thelma Ritter proves an unquestionable scene stealer, raising many a laugh and making use of many of the film's best lines as Jeffries' unassuming but sharp tongued nurse. Wendell Corey is a similarly strong presence as Jeffries' detective friend who is eventually drawn into the conflict. Raymond Burr, seen almost entirely in extreme long shots still establishes himself as a formidable and intimidating presence as the suspected murderer, and some of the suspenseful scenes involving his character are some of the best nail biting sequences Hitchcock ever churned up. All the supporting players, also seen only in long shots still manage to draw the audience into their personal lives, forcing them to care even when they realize they should be observing dispassionately - an inspired directorial touch.All in all Rear Window proves to be one of Hitchcock's most fascinating yet philosophical films in a career demonstrating many of the same traits. Though Rear Window may sound slow and uninteresting at first glance, there is a certain fascination the film evokes which triggers inevitable repeat viewing after viewing.

Even though I've seen the most famous Hitchcock films when I was a teenager (e.g. The Birds and Psycho) I haven't actively been looking for Hitchcock films in the video store or the library until now. And you know, it feels like I've stumbled upon a treasure. To know that I haven't even seen half of Hitchcock's films is a source of happiness. To know that I have so many good films to look forward to Well, everyone who is a Hitchcock-fan knows what I mean.""Rear Window"" is one of the best Hitchcock films I have seen. I like James Stewart and I think he's brilliant here. Grace Kelly is very good as well and the whole film is, of course, masterfully made. A pure joy to watch and experience, I can recommend ""Rear Window"" to everyone. I still think that ""Strangers on a Train"" is the best Hitchcock I have seen but then again, I have so many Hitchcock films yet to see",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic Hitchcock from a unique perspective,"With the acting talent of two of Alfred Hitchcock's favourite actors, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and a strong supporting cast of Thelma Ritter, as his nurse, Cornell Wilde, the detective buddy, and Raymond Burr, a neighbouring tenant, we have the ingredients of a great movie. However, this movie is much more than a great cast since the directing genius of Hitchcock is more than evident. The location is in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan. The movie takes place on a small set-a bachelor apartment with distance scenes in the courtyard and other apartments seen through the lens of a camera. It seems a stretch that everyone in the complex would leave their blinds open but then, no one suspects that one tenant has a telephoto lens to zoom in on their private lives.Jeff, a photographer sidelined by an accident, takes to watching the antics of his neighbours in his spare time. The comic and the sad come together as his camera explores the rear window from one apartment to another. The neighbour he is mainly interested in is Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr. Jeff believes he has killed his wife. Thorwald has no clue there is an intruder looking on from the other side of the courtyard. Raymond Burr gives a convincing portrayal of the sinister Mr. Thorwald - a far cry from the suave, courtly lawyer known on T. V. as Perry Mason. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Carol Freemont, enhances the look of this movie every time she walks on the set. In every scene, she appears like a model from the 1950's. I didn't count the number of costume changes she made but they must have been numerous and she made the most of each one, with due respect to Edith Head, Hitchcock's costume designer. She is a class act every time she appears and plays the role of the uptown Manhattan girl to a tee. The close-ups of her are eye candy of the first order. In fact, Jimmy Stewart hesitates to marry her because as he says, ""she's too perfect"". Thelma Ritter (Stella) as the housebound photographer's nurse/masseuse/housekeeper is an absolute marvel playing a shrewd devil's advocate to Jeff. During her career, she was nominated for several Academy Awards and is a rich talent, giving her own two cents worth on the love match between Lisa and Jeff, particularly Jeff's reluctance to wed.Some hands-on detective work by Lisa and Stella moves the story towards its climax. This classic movie will hold your interest from its amusing start to goose-bump finish. Along the way, there is a fine script and lots of wit. The vignettes involving the neighbours highlight the degree to which Jeff has taken to voyeurism, honing his observation of human behaviour. Photography forms a major role in this film, especially the use of the telephoto lens. Views through the camera form part of the key visuals. Hitchcock makes good use of the growing appreciation for professional photography as the skills of one photographer become the basis for a case of murder. This movie is full of repartee, humour, romance and some of the finest suspense in any Hitchcock film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Time Capsule,"Hitchock's smart review on voyeurism and human composed need for entertainment is fantastically stamped within ""Rear Window"". Those who see just a suspense story will overlook the most important backbone of the movie itself: the arrangement of a fauna of great, interesting human beings, each with their problems, happiness and something to scoop on.The story quickly digests important views where a man with his broken leg gets no other option than to spend time watching and examining his neighbors' life. Before Television arrived, this endearing inspection like Big Brother brings the fantastic nexus that ties up the story. But there will be a transformation where the watching will transform into an obsession, and the most inner feelings of connection with the other will be arisen by what we call voyeurism, or morbidness. We will unite sober James Stewart in his progressive burial over the neighborhood's secrets.There is in the movie one crucial analogy: the eyes watching the window. The eyes are subjective, and see what the mind wants to see. Curiously, eyes are the so called windows of the souls. Whereas the window exposes the reality, the fact to be interpreted (in many ways): here ambiguity strikes and in Jeffries situation it will present itself in the mood of paranoia. All of this scrutinizing over the others life is presented as unethical, but irresistible. Hitchcock uses Franz Waxman's moody music to alter the spectator's disposition to each scene, that lightens throughout the chilling sessions and paralyzes within the climax moments. There is a sense of fear, of being also observed and panicking of being discovered while enjoying the watch. The story seems possible and everyday, presented in a superb way, it will be more effective than what you expect it so. The photography is immense, roaming delicately over the used setting profiting on the smooth editing. We also can expect the most sophisticated and somewhat naive sense of humor to lighten the sordid tension of the movie.""Rear Window"" lives clearly up to the reputation. It is a movie to be examined closely and enjoyed with a good glass of freezing cold water to set the mood right. I believe the movie is somewhat of a time capsule, a very good one indeed, because it has gone over more than fifty years since released, and its a beautiful way of being entertained as it paints a wonderful picture of the era: the way they talked, they dressed, they spent their time. Time cannot falter pieces of art as this one. It renders past oblivion.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock keeps the suspense going!,"Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greats, a story where photographer Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) spends his time looking out of his apartment window while confined to his wheelchair (due to a broken leg). While observing his neighbors, he grows suspicious of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) and believes he may have murdered his wife.From Jeff and fashion consultant girlfriend Lisa Fremont's (Grace Kelly) dramatic talks of their relationship in the beginning to them getting themselves involved in the alleged murder case, Hitchcock brilliantly combines drama and thrills in the movie that, as a result, will keep you engaged from start to finish.Hitchcock keeps the suspense going throughout the film, filling you with intrigue and making you guess if Thorwald really committed the heinous deeds as Jeff describes. There is also humor in abundance in the form of acid wit, quick comebacks and sarcasm delivered by the movie leads, especially that of Thelma Ritter. It puts added charm in this thriller and it will make you laugh and fill you with suspense at the same time.Hands-down to the very clever and decent acting - each actor gave a memorable performance, from the witty James Stewart to the spellbinding Grace Kelly, and from the cynical Thelma Ritter to the mysterious Raymond Burr.For a movie made in 1954, it holds up very well throughout the test of time.

"Precursor to ""Dekalog 6"" and ""Cache""","After my third viewing of the film over a span of 20 odd years, I went beyond appreciating the cinematic challenges that Hitchcock sets for himself to overcome. For instance, I was not appreciating that this film is one of the rare instances in cinema where all the sounds are ""diegetic"" recorded on the soundtrack.are sounds from within the visual world captured by the camera. After the earlier viewings, I was no longer intrigued by the amoral perspective of the voyeur, represented by L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), the good, average American bachelor with a robust, modest, creative career and a rich doting girl friend, Lisa, trying to rope him into marriage. No longer was blending of the viewer's perspective and that of Jefferies' perspective a major feat of Hitchcock.My third viewing threw up new perspectives of the film because I had now got to see over 20 Hitchcock films.First, ""Rear window"" is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where women emerge smarter and stronger than menthe last scene has the hero with two legs in a cast and his lady love switching reading material to what she prefers to read over what the hero would prefer her to read, even though for the first time she has switched to trousers to humor her future husband's vision of his kind of wife. Similar ends were obvious in ""Family Plot,"" ""Spellbound,"" ""Rebecca"" and, by inference of the final choice, in ""Marnie."" The final shot in ""Rear window"" is a sexual reversal of the final shot of ""Mr and Mrs Smith.""Second, ""Rear window"" is yet another film on marriagea recurring theme in Hitchcock's films. Jefferies and Lisa do not tie the knot but the end inferred this would eventually happen. But the switching of the reading material gives the viewer a clue who among the duo would rule the marriage. In another perspective on marriage, within the film a husband kills his wife. A wedding ring is stolen of all objects. Other perspectives in the film reflect on the sex in marriage and another looks at a woman dreaming of a virtual husband, a dream to which Jefferies involuntarily raises his own glass!Third, this is a film on photographers, photography and voyeurs. Only the photographer looks out of the window, when all have windows open, except when a dog or housebreak is involved. Many years after Hitchcock made the film, the Polish director Krystof Kiesolwski in his ""Dekalog no. 6"" explored the same theme with astonishing results. Recently, Austrian filmmaker Michael Hanneke's ""Cache"" presented videos of an anonymous voyeur as the pivotal essay on racial interaction. All the three films infer that the crime is in watching other people commit crime. The watcher and the watched emerge as flip sides of an individual or alter egos.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stupendously good,"Based upon a.1942 Cornell Woolrich story, ""It Had to Be Murder,"" REAR WINDOW is one of the very greatest of Alfred Hitchcock's many great films.We originally saw the film in it's 1983-84 theatrical re-release run, which was most fortuitous.Seeing this film on the big screen in an art house theater, as we saw it, in the 1980s, an experience not often shared today by movie goers, was a revelation.The cinematography was brilliant, the colors rich and real.Grace Kelly has never looked better or more seductive. Cary Grant is brilliant as the laid up wheelchair bound boyfriend of Grace Kelly who takes an interest in his neighbors' goings ons, originally from boredom, eventually engrossing even his girlfriend Grace Kelly in his oh so naughty hobby.The rest of the film I leave to the viewing public, but suffice it to say, it is a remarkable tour de force.Genius, sheer genius, buttressed by great film angles, cinematography & superb acting.Just a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good 50's suspense movie,At times this movie seems way ahead of its time. Camera work is great and pioneering and holds up to even today's standards. The sets desgin works perfectly with the story shown with in the film. Evenly paced with no cheap gimmicks or tricks. The dialogue suffers alittle at times and is confusing however all the characters are well defined. Towards the end of the movie some really bad primal CGI is used and the tension didn't hold out like I had hoped.

A Hitchcock Masterpiece,"L. B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a professional photographer who travels the world in search of the next conflict or adventure. But he is spending most of his time in a wheelchair, in his apartment, while his leg heals--the result of a photo assignment involving racecars. Outside his windows is an array of neighbors living their lives in their own apartments. Confined as he is, ""Jeff"" comes to view their activities as entertainment.He is visited regularly by Stella (Thelma Ritter), the insurance company nurse assigned to care for him. She administers massages and advice, telling Jeff he should ask his girlfriend, Lisa to marry him, and maybe he should spend less time spying on his neighbors, because she smells ""trouble"".But Jeff feels that he and Lisa (Grace Kelly) are too different from each other. She comes from the world of high fashion and refinement, whereas he lives his life (usually) on the go in danger and dirt.Besides wondering if he should break up with Lisa, Jeff's energies are directed mostly toward dealing with the summer heat and insufferable under-cast itching. But then he becomes caught up in the intrigue surrounding one neighbor. His own imagination runs wild, drawing him into the private drama outside his windows.This Hitchcock masterpiece spends some time wondering about the morality of spying on one's neighbors, but mostly it takes us deeper and deeper into Jeff's world and his suspicions about some curious comings and goings.Filmed from the point of view of Jeffries, ""Rear Window"" is a masterful film, filled with character studies and Hitchcock's economy of storytelling. The set is one of the best ever created. The music is wonderful, both in setting mood and in helping to create the world of the apartment complex. The story starts out lazily, then progressively becomes more and more urgent, building to a tense climax. Hitchcock is the master of suspense and this film is one of his best.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A voyeuristic classic,"I was fairly young when I first watched ""Rear Window""; early enough that the sheer radiance of Grace Kelly was my primary takeaway.But as an adult, it's easy to see why this movie is taught in film school; the gliding camerawork, the lighting, the mise en scène. Hitchcock's use of framing is nothing short of brilliant, and draws you into the story from the very beginning (such a seduction is key to the fun of all of this).One thing that really stood out to me was the ability to create the vibe of that sweltering Summer day, given that this was shot on a soundstage. And speaking of, that set is amazing. It'd have to be, given how long the camera lingers, but still, impressive production design nonetheless.There was much more to appreciate this time around. It's tense, engrossing and technically masterful. And Grace Kelly still lights up the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The silent observer is as guilty as the criminal themselves.,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic Rear Window is the ultimate reflection of human conscience. As the protagonist continues to violate the privacies of other people, we also continue to take part in this voyeurism. And as the protagonist develops the sense of justification by saying ""What else to do?"" we also do the same by watching the film of it's entirety. We may escape our guilt and uphold our moral conscience saying that we are not in the wrong as we're not the one committing this immoral activity but the silent observer is as guilty as the criminal themselves.I've never felt so manipulated by a movie since Michael Hanake's Funny Games.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There were several times in the first hour or so that I almost gave up on it, but once things started happening, it was just as exciting and sometimes even more so than current action films today. I've heard so much about Grace Kelly and she really was wonderful in this movie. Biographies have said that she truly missed being an actress after her marriage, and you can tell in this movie how much she loved her craft. Jimmy Stewart plays the part well, although it is hard to imagine that someone like Grace Kelly would be interested in him. I loved the character of the nurse, Stella.

Full-frontal Window,"One reviewer has pointed out that anyone who wanted to spy on his neighbours would surely prevent them from spying back on him. In fact everyone in this courtyard seems to perform in full exposure --- although there are one or two occasional exceptions. It is explained it is because the weather was very hot.The fan-like structure of this movie is creative. The central theme, played out between Stewart and Kelly, concerns the relationship between the sexes. Every playlet observed through the window, offers an ingenious courtyard commentary on the variety of these relationships, from celibate solitude, via frantic partying, through loneliness, newly-weds and long-term marriage, to marital murder. The little dog seems to take the place of a kid; kids being otherwise relegated to the half-seen street at the back.The dog, and its fate, is one of the two mysteries in the plot. What was the point of killing the little dog ? Why did murderer Burr bury something in a flower-bed ? What was it ? Did I miss something ? Seems completely pointless. He got rid of everything else by other means, simply enough. The other mystery which no-one seems to mention, concerns the curious black-clad female figure at one point seen emerging with Burr from his flat. Who was that ? Did I miss something ? Brilliant film, though. I like Grace Kelly. She is civilised because she says either, not eether.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In a world where nobody ever heard of window blinds...,"While I thoroughly enjoyed REAR WINDOW and think it's among Hitch's best films, I always observe how easy it was for Stewart's character to view the lives around him. It seems that nobody in the entire neighborhood ever heard of keeping curtains or window blinds in more discreet positions. We are forced to believe that all of these people leave their windows totally exposed to the naked eye even though they face an apartment building not more than fifty feet away, and even when scantily clad or seeking a romantic rendezvous.Of course, little do they suspect that a wheelchair-bound photographer is stalking them through his binoculars and keeping tabs on their everyday quirks and foibles. This is where the story taps into the psyche of the main character, brilliantly played by JAMES STEWART.He gets excellent support from a first-rate cast, although I think GRACE KELLY was a bit arch as his female companion. However, it's RAYMOND BURR (as a man Stewart suspects has killed his wife), JUDITH EVELYN (as ""Miss Lonelyhearts""), WENDELL COREY (as a skeptical detective), and most of all, THELMA RITTER as a wise-cracking nurse, who really stir things up.Hitchcock shows complete control of his camera, forcing us to view everything just the way Stewart sees things and focusing our attention where it ought to be through the development of the story, which is loosely based on a Cornel Woolrich short story.It's the kind of film where you have to be watching and on the alert all the time so as not to miss anything.Highly satisfying and typically good Hitchcock suspense that builds to a tense stand-off at the climax.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
wonderful!,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a definite classic. The movie is about a successful photographer with a broken leg, whom is stuck in his apartment in a cast for 6 weeks. 	This story takes place during a one-week period, where this man has nothing to do but to stair out of his back window of his living room into a courtyard that is in the center of other apartment complexes. What is seen in the other apartments is a mystery you will have to reveal on your own. And when you do; you will be stunned with that you've concluded. 	Alfred Hitchcock did a brilliant job filming this story, as he does with all of his films. The different techniques that he uses play such an enormous part in this film. For example: when the man in the apartment tries to hide in a particular scene from another man, instead of running to another room, he scoots himself into a shadow, and it is so much more practical. The shadow across his face adds suspense and mystery that running away does not.Another powerful touch on the film was the soundtrack. All of the music and noise that is heard in this video are all from something going on in the scene. Whether it is the tapping of a hand on a table, or a man in his apartment across the courtyard playing his piano. None of the music was added in, it is all from the scene. Very Powerful!!!The movie as a whole is not necessarily a spook, but more of a possible murder mystery. This film is very good and gripping. Even though its not exactly scary, it still draws in its viewer. 	It is definitely a Hitchcock classic that all should see. It is definetly a respected film because of the way it was filmed my Hitchcock. So definetly check it out, you will not be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's tale of voyeurism !!!!,"A photographer named L.B. Jefferies has broken his leg. With nothing to do throughout the day, he starts observing his neighbours from his window which leads him to grow more and more suspicious about one particular neighbour's behaviour which leads to extremely suspenseful consequences.Clearly Hitchcock's theme for this film is voyeurism. We all have at least once watched someone from the window secretively. The thrill of observing people who are completely unaware of our peeping has always fascinated us. This very concept of intrusion of privacy has been the primary reason behind the success of the innumerable reality shows which have become so popular nowadays. The current scenario with reality shows makes Rear Window seem profound. The neighbourhood which is being observed by Jefferies is a representation of the whole society. There is the poor couple who struggle to get by,there is the rich lady who is tortured by her loneliness, there is the young ballet dancer who is trying to make her presence felt in the social scene, the musician who is desperate to achieve success with his talent, the old bickering couple and the young newlyweds.James Stewart has a commanding presence as Jefferies. Everyone knows about Grace Kelly's looks, but what is great about this film is that Kelly is not there just to look beautiful. She is actually the one who does all the physical thrilling dirty work while Stewart remains attached to his wheel chair.The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is absolutely brilliant. The whole story gets told from the point of view of Jefferies. This is a rare suspense thriller without any chases or thrilling action sequences. The movie depends completely on atmospheric tension. Hitchcock is not called the Master of Suspense for nothing. He shows how minimalistic filmmaking can also generate spine chilling moments of suspense. The film is grounded in realism. Although at first the other characters disapprove of Jefferies' obsession with keeping an eye on his neighbours, but gradually they also become addicted to this practice of voyeurism.Rear Window is arguably Alfred Hitchcock's best film(which is saying a lot). The movie grabs your attention immediately and never lets got of it. It is an immensely engaging watch and a genuine masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Redundant But Insightful Reflection On Rear Window,"I am sitting here wondering why I am commenting on Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. It is a definitive classic of enduring interest, quality, and style. The last sentence is as redundant as this review will be. I mean, what can I say that not only hasn't already been said but isn't already known? Its masterful voyeuristic cinematography, its impeccably atmospheric sound and John Michael Hays's screen adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's short story have been quite sufficiently recognized over the past half century. I suppose there is one thing that people don't tend to think about, or at least it is one thing I haven't heard anyone say, and that is that Rear Window is a virtuoso portrait the human element of privacy, and feeling naked when we notice that it is invaded. What's more, that invasion is another element of human nature: Voyeurism.What else is left to debate for incessantly lovable Jimmy Stewart, a successful photographer whose restlessness takes him all over the world and into situations where he takes pictures no one else gets, recuperating from a broken leg during a scorching hot summer? Here is a restless daredevil who makes a living with his eyes, laid up in a wheelchair in a small, apartment. This is 1954. He's not going to sit at the computer and blast people on IMDb message boards. He does what any one of his neighbors could be found doing in his situation: Alleviating boredom by spying on the lives of his neighbors. Furthermore, his view is perfect! Through his rear window, he can see into the building across the courtyard of the complex and glimpse from front row seats the residents' daily routines. There's the ubersexy dancer who exercises in her underwear, the couple who sleep on their small balcony because they don't have air conditioning, a lonely woman who lives by herself (who alternately gains great sympathy from us and generates cruel laughs at her expense; true to the spirit of voyeurism), and a frustrated songwriter always at his piano. And, there is the salesman, a pitch-perfect Raymond Burr, who lives directly across the courtyard from Jimmy Stewart, the one with the pesky, harassing invalid wife.I can safely assume that nearly everyone who reads this generally knows the gist of the plot. It is a fine plot, ever condusive to everything Hitchcock. What is so significant about it to me is how it takes two seemingly conflicting sides of human nature and turns the suspenseful corner by dangling by a thread the inevitable, which is that an everyday person, no matter how fixed they are in their day-by-day algorithms, just may eventually discover that feeling of nakedness, of intrusion.Though there are films by Hitchcock that I favor more, like The Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, and Rope, Rear Window stands as pure cinema: Blatantly and shamelessly visual, full of layers of audible details from the ambient to deafening.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Fascination of Cinematic Gaze,"""Rear Window"", directed by Alfred Hitchcock and released in 1954, continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. Critics praise its modernity, narrative fluidity, and inventiveness. This film noir classic is a masterpiece that transcends generations, captivating both casual viewers seeking entertainment and more discerning intellectuals seeking deeper meaning.The plot, based on a story by Cornell Woolrich, follows a photographer, brilliantly portrayed by James Stewart, who, confined to a wheelchair after an accident, spends his time observing his neighbors through his window. This seemingly simple premise unfolds into an intricate tale of voyeurism, suspicion, and suspense as the protagonist becomes convinced that one of his neighbors has committed a crime.Hitchcock's genius lies in how he turns the screen into an extension of the protagonist's vision, immobilized in his wheelchair. The windows of the neighboring apartments become like movie screens, where the photographer, and by extension the viewer, witnesses a variety of human dramas. This dynamic between observer and observed reflects the relationship between the audience and the characters in the cinematic experience.One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is its ability to provoke multiple layers of interpretation. On one level, it is a gripping story of mystery and intrigue, with sharp dialogue and moments of subtle humor. On another level, it is a profound reflection on human nature, its hidden desires, and the ethics of observation.Grace Kelly's performance also stands out, her elegant and magnetic presence adding an extra dimension to the film. Her partnership with Hitchcock, evidenced by the meticulous choice of her wardrobe and attention to detail on screen, is an essential part of the film's charm and visual appeal.Behind the scenes, Hitchcock was at the height of his career, enjoying collaboration with his muse Grace Kelly and the creative freedom the film afforded. His obsessive care with every aspect of the production, from the script to the editing, resulted in a masterpiece that continues to be studied and appreciated to this day.In summary, ""Rear Window"" is more than a film; it is a celebration of the power of cinema to captivate, provoke, and deliver pleasure to the audience. With its engaging narrative, talented cast, and masterful direction, it is a lasting testament to Alfred Hitchcock's genius and the magic of cinema as an art form.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A masterpiece,"What does a genius have to have for a compelling movie? A good story, good actors, good set dressing. Hitchcock builds up tension like nobody else, with James Stewart hardly moving in his wheelchair ans Grace Kelly cracking unforgettable lines, challenging and/or seducing the protagonist in every scene.
What colours. What rhythm. What music and sound syncing in. What eminently played out little scenes seen from Jeff's window.
It is the darker dimension that makes this film perfect. The audience is kept in suspense over many plotlines, carefully developed an masterly filmed. Seen in this way, the building opposite is the main attraction, with about five stories going on at the same time, some with very dark outcomes.

Less is more,"No music... except what you hear from the neighbours. No scene changing. And for Hitchcock, very little direction of the actors. ""Just do your thing"". Like looking in at the lives of neighbours. Hitchs favorite actor, Jimmy Stewart, in a wheelchair, so obssessed with looking at what might be a murderer, that he completely ignore Lisa (cinemas most gorgeous actress, Grace Kelly). It's actually been remade under different names at least 3 times (one with Christopher Reeve after his accident), so it's highly influental. And proves, like Rope (but better) that with the right man behind the camera, you CAN make a movie suspenseful with only one location. We are peeping toms alongside Stewart (I remember a quote from Ricky Gervais: ""If I walk past a house without curtains, I look inside. It's they're bloody fault), staring in on happy and sad lifes. And again Hitch steps out of the curve, making Grace Kelly the adventerous hero, and James Stewart... well, impotent, as Hitchcock himself said. He is a man of adventure, but cant do anything with a broken leg, other than spying. Btw, some of the dialogue is funny as hell, considered when it was filmed.

The romance makes for an interesting subplot also showing up its era. Grace Kelly plays a society sweetheart who has fallen for a photographer. She wants to marry and he doesn't.  She imagines him as a fashion photographer in a suit and married to her.  James Stewart plays the 'louse' who declares she could never follow him through the middle east photographing on dangerous assignments and he could never fit into her ideal.  Far from wanting to break-up he asks her to keep things 'status quo'.  There's an interesting scene between his police detective friend and her overnight bag.  But this is the movies - he has to marry her!,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Cinematic Mastery of 'Rear Window',"In my view, the most compelling aspect of the film is its setting. We find ourselves confined to the perspective of James Stewart's character, confined to a wheelchair with a broken foot, peering out his window. With minimal action, the suspense thrives on the interactions of just a few characters with the main character. Through his lens, we uncover the mystery without relying on exposition dialogue. Hitchcock masterfully plants seeds of deception while keeping the audience engaged.Moreover, Stewart's physical vulnerability adds another layer of tension, as we remain wary of a potential confrontation with the antagonist.I've often heard that Hitchcock crafted his films with the audience experience in mind, and ""Rear Window"" stands as a timeless classic due to the immersive position he places us in throughout the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
'Voyeurism and It's Consquences' By Alfred Hitchcock,"Rear Window may not be my favorite Hitchcock film, but it's still a timely classic thriller with a lot of influential material that has been passed down for years and years, there's an obvious reason why he's hailed as the master of suspense, he knows his style and he owns it proudly, wearing it right on his sleeve. I would say this is one of the best films for a newcomer of Hitchcock, and it has pretty much everything that makes a Hitchcock film just that, it has beautiful style and revealing cinematography, making the camera its own character, fully fleshed out characters that are built slowly from the beginning, and of course plenty of intensity and suspense revolving around this brutal murder mystery. It's sharp script helps elevate some of the more dated, for the times sort of material, which there's a decent amount here. And while the ending didn't satisfy me, it still has plenty of closure and a pretty cool final confrontation between the killer and Jeff, all led by fine performances which makes Rear Window a treat to watch every time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hitchcock At His Best,"Technically, this is the reverse of 1948's ROPE. ROPE's murder happens behind a closed curtain. This films observes everything through open windows & curtains. There was so little wasted footage in this because Hitch knew what he wanted to shoot before he shot it, that there was less than 10 minutes edited from the film as shot. The efficiency is almost as good as ROPE but the sequences are shorter.Jimmy Stewart plays a man with a broken leg in an apartment complex (so large a set that the crew came to think of the set as home during the shooting of this film) with nothing better to do than gawk out at all the neighbors while he is recovering. Grace Kelly in one of her last & best complex roles before becoming Princess Grace is Stewarts girlfriend (also presented as a bit of a tomboy as well as being a sensuous beauty) who winds up along with Stewart's maid getting involved in the mystery that a neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) presents because of how he is observed by Stewart.This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, presenting situations in which the viewer gets emotionally involved & wants to help the folks on screen with their dilemma. From the short story is added other folks in the story from Miss Lonely Hearts, to others as Stewart, much more comfortable in this film than he was in ROPE, is on the mend from a broken leg peering in on the multiple apartments & people in this little world.It is a fine film because even though the action is all limited to one huge set (apartment & window to a multi-apartment complex) for the most part, it explores & surprises the viewer with what can happen in such a static situation. I am thankful the studio came out with a restored version as this is a film that is well worth restoring to it's original form. Thelma Ritter is exceptional in her role as Stewarts maid.The tension when the salesman (Burr) confronts Stewart in his apartment is brilliant & the technical use of now outdated flashbulb photography still plays well as setting the tension in this sequence.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I didn't feel much suspense.,"So I decided to check out this movie after being told countless times how Hitchcock was the master of suspense and seeing that it had an 8.5 on IMDB, the highest for any Hitchcock movie.It started off well with some camerawork that I liked and a LOT of focus on the women, I found this use of the female actors as eye candy a bit out of touch with the tonality of the film.The film builds some suspense towards the end and I was curious as to what had happened, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending. It's not that the reveal wasn't any good, there was no reveal at all. The idea of building suspense without ending with some ""Aha!"" moment or at least something novel is just weird to me. It's possible the ending was novel at the time of it's release, I don't know about that.Overall it was a pretty disappointing viewing especially after all the high praise that made me form my expectations. This was despite my being willing to suspend my disbelief to how pretty much all of the major happenings take place within the protagonist's line of view, this NEVER happens in real life, even with the kind of apartment complex they were living in the blinds would be drawn(Maybe things were different back then).The leading pair were great. The acting was convincing(except for one character, the lady with dog, it may have been the writing). The movie seemed to be sped up at some wrong places, maybe some technical issue.I'll check out Vertigo and if that doesn't work either, maybe Hitchcock's not for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Perfect match of Director and material,"1954's REAR WINDOW is my favorite of all of the Alfred Hitchock films. So when it came time to expose my college-aged children to the works of ""the Master of Suspense"", it was a ""no-brainer"" as to which film it would be.And...they loved it.Starring ""everyman"" Jimmy Stewart and the always fabulous Grace Kelly, REAR WINDOW tells the tale of photographer L.B. Jefferies (Stewart) who is laid up in his New York apartment with a broken leg. His only means of entertainment is looking out of the ""rear window"" of his apartment into the courtyard - and the other apartments (and the people) therein.This is a treatise on voyeurism and the pairing of this material with a master of film like Hitchcock is a marriage made in heaven. He sets up most of the movie so you are viewing the events as though you are Jefferies - confined to his apartment. Each apartment around the courtyard are their own little viewing boxes. He does a neat, subtle trick in this film. When he pans counter-clockwise, he is just browsing the apartments (like channel surfing on TV). When he pans clockwise - or goes straight to an apartment - he is focusing on that place/story. More often than not, the scenes in the apartments that Jefferies is looking at is mirroring what is going on in the relationship between Stewart and Kelly - sometimes with a sinister undertone. As always, Hitchcock ratchets up the suspense in a way only he can - focusing on a mundane item/thing until it becomes malevolent. This could have easily been a boring/static film, but in Hitchcock's capable hands, there is movement aplenty and the film flows beautifully.As for the performances, Stewart has never been better as the audience stand-in/everyman who goes from charming scamp just snatching peeks of his neighbors to ""peeping-tom"" voyeur who is intruding in the private lives of his fellow courtyard denizens. Grace Kelly is just radiant in the way Hitchcock photographs her and in the way that all-time great costumer Edith Head dresses her. She is perfectly made-up and costumed to make her ""the most beautiful woman in the world"". But...what caught me in this viewing was how good of an acting job she does in this film. In previous viewings I was swept up in the look and feel of the actress. This time, I was taken in by the character and she became the one in this film I was rooting for. Well...either Grace Kelly or the great character actress Thelma Ritter as insurance nurse (and willing accomplice) Stella. She almost steals the movie from the two leads...almost.All of the elements at play in this film work - acting, costuming, scenic design, cinematography and script - all wrapped up by a Master Director at the top of his game.If you only watch one Alfred Hitchock film, make it REAR WINDOW. You'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""An Idle Mind Is The Devil's Plaything""","Rating: 8A straightforward, well laid out, gripping plot. It is a classic Hitchcock film which ranks up in terms of acting, sound, cinematography and the storyline.The Good - The movie is a work of art. It emphasizes on the theme of voyeurism.

Wish there was a bit more,"I love this movie a lot. The set design, cinematography, sound, and acting are all excellent as to be expected from a Hitchcock film. The movie is entirely shot from one bedroom and plays a lot with the theme of perspective. Hitchcock intentionally gives you a one sided perspective on Lars Thorwald, never revealing more than the characters in the movie would also know, making the mystery more intense and intriguing.
My one complaint is the relatively abrupt ending to the film. It isn't unsatisfying per se, but I wish more was revealed as to what actually happened with Lars Thorwald and his wife rather than leaving the audience bread crumbs of information.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspense through lighting,"Rear Window is a great example of Hitchcock's mastery of cinematography. This movie follows the story of Jefferies, an adventure seeking photographer that is stuck in his small apartment due to a leg injury he received while on the job. He resorts to finding entertainment by watching his neighbors through his rear window. When he notices some suspicious behavior from one of the occupants across the way his boring recovery becomes a lot more interesting. Through solving this mystery Jefferies learns a lot about himself, his relationships with others, and how people interact with each other.
This movie is a great example of using lights and shadows to create suspense. By having the entire movie filmed from one vantage point, Jeffeirie's apartment, the light was pretty restricted. However, Hitchcock creates amazing effects with minimal light. By using the window blinds to highlight certain parts of the room Hitchcock is able to make certain moments in the film more intense for the viewers. One of the most effective ways lighting was used to create suspense was by only having the eyes of the actors in the light. This made the characters more mysterious and invoked a sense of fear into the viewers.
Overall this was a fantastic film that incorporated the elements of cinematography extremely well and had a entertaining and captivating story line.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A true classic. A masterclass in how to do this type of film.,"There's a reason this film is so often imitated, but never duplicated. That phrase is applied to so many things, sometimes correctly, sometimes not, but it is most aptly applied here. To borrow another cliche, Alfred Hitchcock truly broke them old with this particular film. It took the ""voyeur witnesses a crime"" trope and blended it with THE LADY VANISHES style ""or did they?"" subgenre of thriller to marvelous effect.Interestingly, this is neither Jimmy Stewart nor Grace Kelly's best work. They don't have a particularly sizzling type of chemistry, and the material is no more suited to them than any other star of the time (or any of Hitchcock's other work starring them), but somehow when it all comes together under Hitchcock's excellent direction, it just works. 1 + 1 = 3 here and it's an incredible watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfection.,"My joint favourite Hitchcock film (the other being North By Northwest). This is just perfection. Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly and a cast of top class support flex their muscles through 2 hours of dramatic, mysterious, speculative bliss. If the apartment bound Jimmy Stewart isn't enough as the action hungry photographer in search of adventure from his wheelchair, you have his girlfriend Grace Kelly, bringing pure class with some socialite sophistication. J.B. (Stewart) really is punching way above his weight. On top of that you've got Thelma Ritter as nurse Stella with the razor sharp wit threatening to steal every scene she graces. J.B. is seeking danger, missing his assignments having acquired a broken leg in the last one two months ago. He thinks he's found it too, through his telephoto lens looking out of his rear window at a myriad of stories in every one of his neighbours apartments. He has an over active imagination, his paranoia growing at what he witnesses, much to the annoyance of Lisa (Kelly) who wants him to settle down and join her in respectable social circles. He draws you in though and Lisa too, who senses excitement as they find some much needed common ground and the conspiracy grows with each new snippet of information. It's a breath of fresh air, as the dialogue drops and we watch the windows, picking up fragments of sound and snap shots of actions. Almost like silent film in places. This is Hitchcock at the top of his game, ramping up the tension as we near the flawless finale with the danger dialled up and a killer on the loose! Surely everyone has seen this film? But on the off chance you've not, stop what you're doing and watch it right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Window Worth Staring Through,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window tells the story of magazine photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) as he recovers from an accident that left him confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. Jeffries finds himself with little to do except sit in his apartment and look out through his window into the courtyard. From here he begins to casually spy on the day to day activities of his neighbors through their open windows. The plot thickens when he begins to suspect on of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) of killing his wife. Jeffries convinces his insurance company nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelley), and detective friend Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of his suspicions and together they work to find out what happened to Mrs. Thorwald.Hitchcock's genius shines in this film as he decides to leave the camera (and so the audience) trapped in the apartment alongside Jeffries. The plot is viewed through Jeffries point of view, nearly every shot of the view from his window is accompanied by a shot of him reacting to what he and the audience just saw. The movie is a study into the compulsive voyeurism and natural curiosity of humans. The audience shares in Jeffries's compulsive curiosity to find out where Mrs. Thorwald had disappeared too. And just like how Jeffries eagerly watches Thorwald searching for another piece to the mystery the audience watches too, awaiting the next development with the same zeal. The limited camera also helps to create a wonderful sense of suspense throughout the whole film. Until the final moments of the film here is enough conflicting evidence that Thorwald could be either a murderer or an innocent salesman, creating a tense climax with a superbly suspenseful build up.The entire set itself is so well built and tells such a story by itself that it almost feels like a character. Each other apartment Jeffries can see is visually distinct and looks like a real lived in place, and each of their inhabitants seem to have full lives despite only having small glimpses into them. There seems to be a whole other set of movies playing for Jeffries outside his window, Miss Lonelyhearts's hopeless quest for a companion, the newlyweds' transition from the honeymoon phase to the nagging relationship of a long married couple, or the songwriter's fight to get his music produced. Each of these small cursory stories is still told with such elegance and technique on the periphery of the main story that it feels as tho Jeffries could have found interest in watching any one of the windows, not just the one hiding a murder. It's quite an accomplishment that in its 2hr run time Hitchcock managed to build a completely believable little world to tell his story in.On top of all the masterful film making the acting within Rear Window is extraordinarily good. James Stewart's plays Jeffries with such subtlety and depth, especially all the wordless reaction shots in which he seems to say more with just a raised eyebrow or furrowed brow than lesser actors would with a monoloque. On top of this Grace Kelly bring a great performance to the table as well, playing Lisa with elegance that gives way to a childlike recklessness and eagerness once she becomes invested in the mystery. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey bring a lot to the stage with their supporting performances as well. Even the actors who pay the neighbors, rarely getting a word of dialogue or any real character development still give off the sense of being fully realized real people incredibly well.All in all Rear Window is a masterpiece of a movie that combined the immaculate filmmaking of Hitchcock with a truly captivating plot all centered around an incredibly well thought out and executed gimmick. Who ever thought that a rear apartment window could be all you needed for such a great film?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchkock!,"Enjoyed every minute of this movie! It's fascinating that even after 60+ years it's relevant! I'd watch this movie a million times over many movies from our current days. You can see from his work why Hitchcock is such a legend. Directed perfectly with the amazing performance by James Stewart.Watching the movie from Jeffries point of view/perspective. Decapitated, bored, and determined to discover the truth.The final 10-15 made me anxious and my heart beat. Because Hitchcock built the suspense the whole movie and I was (as a viewer) waiting patiently the whole film for this moment. Was he falsely accused or did he kill his wife? What could happen to Lisa?! Etc.The Lisa who you'd never think she would do anything was the most courageous! While Jeff the man who went to the jungles and mountains couldn't do anything!In the beginning, his relationship with Lisa was not the greatest because he didn't want to get married, Later the relationship got better and they stayed together and built a stronger relationship due to their endeavor to catch the murderer.Also, If you take a step back, it's all about relationships from the beginning. The murderer and his wife's relationship, the pianist, the dancer, Jeff and Lisa, the lonely lady. And you can see how everyone turned out at the end.What a great experience!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A wonderful movie i tell you,"Always close your windows and drains; there could be a peeping tom about.Rear window coins the phrase, ""an idle hand is the devils workshop"", as our character ""Jeff"" Jeffries played by James Stewart, who spent most of his days peeping into the houses of his neighbors, due to a broken leg that has him confined to a wheel chair.Rear window was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and is based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story ""It Had to Be Murder"".The movie stars James Stewart and the beautiful Princess Grace Kelly. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and has remained in the top 50 of AFI's 100 Years100 Movies list and on their 10th-anniversary edition.This movie is my third best James Stewart movie so far (I hope to see more) after It's A Wonderful Life (1946) and Mr Smith Goes To Washington (1939).The movie is considered to be one of Hitchcock's finest films. On the website Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of a 100%, so definitely it is a movie to watch.The movie plot is about a Professional photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries who breaks his leg while getting an action shot at an auto race.Now he is on a wheel chair with a cast on his leg and he can't leave his New York apartment. To pass time he peeps out his rear window observing the neighbors, memorising their patterns and trying not to miss a thing happening in their lives.Things starts getting thrilling when he begins to suspect that a man across the courtyard may have murdered his wife.There are movies whose themes can be said to have been based on Rear Window like Michael Davis's Eight Days a Week in 1999, Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath in 2000 and Disturbia in 2007 which kinda reminds you of Rear Window itself except the protagonist (Shia LaBeouf) is under house arrest instead of on a wheel chair with a broken leg, and his neighbor is a serial killer other than having committed a single murder.Many TV shows too have used this Rear Window idea like The Simpsons, White Collar and more. But the TV movie that was done 1998 which was a remake of the 1954 classic is my best, I actually saw the TV movie first before seeing the original it stared Christopher Reeve, who himself was paralyzed as the result of a 1995 horse-riding accident, so he fitted the role perfectly.Well enough has been said about Rear Window, it is a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller that I can say if you are watching all Alfred Hitchcock classic then you must see this one.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the best movies ever!,"L.B. Jefferies aka ""Jeff"" (James Stewart) is an adventurous magazine photographer who is housebound in his Manhattan apartment due to a broken leg. He passes the time by spying on his neighbours across his building's courtyard. In time, he suspects a murder has taken place in one of the neighbouring apartments.First things first: ""Rear Window"" is absolutely one of the greatest movies of all time. Even after a seventh viewing, it still gets the highest possible rating like it did for all the previous viewings. And while director Alfred Hitchcock has clearly made a great list of other films (""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Rope"", ""The Lady Vanishes"", ""Rebecca"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Dial M for Murder"", and ""Strangers on a Train""), for me, ""Rear Window"" will always be his best.The mystery aspect of the film is clearly its greatest strength. But there is still so much more including the complex, push-pull relationship Jeff has with Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), a glamorous, high-society woman with a prominent position in the fashion industry (evident by her beautiful wardrobe by Edith Head). Their differences of class and social circles cause much tension even though it is clear they are quite fond of each other. Jeff's resistance to consider marriage is criticized (in amusingly snarky ways) by the insurance company nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter) who visits Jeff to assist in his recovery. The discussions and arguments on this subject create a fascinating snapshot of the mindset of a place and time long gone by.Hitchcock works well with an amazingly rare set with action taking place in Jeff's apartment while looking across at the other windows which each have their own mini-story taking place simultaneously. The director is aided by a great sound team who provide the perfect volume of the neighbours whose voices are barely audible but clear enough to be understood (this was during an era when air conditioners were rare and most people just left their windows open during hot weather). Most of the other apartment dwellers provide mild comedy: there's ""Miss Torso"", an attractive ballet dancer who practices stretches and dance moves while doing housework and preparing meals; an older couple who sleep on their balcony at night due to the extreme summer heat; and a younger newlywed couple whose window blind is almost always pulled down. There's also a musical composer who seems like a social butterfly but whose loneliness is occasionally on display. And on the dramatic side, there is ""Miss Lonelyheart"" (Judith Evelyn): a good-natured, single, middle-aged woman whose unfulfilled yearning for a mate leaves her depressed and desperate; plus Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a travelling jewelry salesman whose bedridden wife seems unappreciative of the help he provides.Another element that makes ""Rear Window"" more than a murder mystery is the blunt exploration of Jeff's voyeurism. Lisa and Stella are stand-ins for the audience. Like most of us, they initially criticize Jeff for his lack of morality in spying on others. And again, like most of us, the two women become intrigued enough to not only join in on the voyeurism; they do some of the footwork Jeff can't do due to his immobility. This leads to one of the film's most thrilling scenes that has Lisa breaking and entering an apartment where the trio suspect foul play has occurred. The choice of filming this scene is brilliant: it is all seen at a distance with a stable camera from Jeff's window; no special camera moves and no suspenseful music. And the impact causes jitters. The film's other thrilling scene follows this one: without giving any spoilers, it involves the sound of footsteps getting closer (frequent viewers of this classic will understand).The amateur sleuth trio all provide great performances. Stewart has exactly what it takes to make the audience dislike him at first but clearly understand him (with guilt) as the story progresses. Kelly shows a great intensity once she takes on the role of co-detective. And Ritter's sharp, no-nonsense remarks easily remind one of her fine work in ""All About Eve"". Even the brief, pantomime performance of Evelyn draws out much pathos. And Burr does well as the film's most mysterious character.The suspense, intrigue, and mystery make ""Rear Window"" great; the other added elements make it a true classic. I look forward to seeing it again. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 10 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Alfred HitchcockScreenplay by John Michael Hayes (based on the story ""It Had to Be Murder"" by Cornell Woolrich)Acting Ensemble",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Something different,"Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece `Rear Window,' was something a bit different for the time. Known as the master of suspense, Hitchcock, used camera angles, plot structure and an overall atmosphere to give a sense that you're in the movie. `Rear Window' was filmed on only one set and in one room making this movie truly unique. This movie stars James Stewart as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Wendell Corey as Lt. Thomas Doyle and Thelma Ritter as Stella. All of who give a wonderful performance and gibe the story life. Jeff, who is the main character in the movie, is a professional photographer who travels the world and is unfortunately stuck inside his apartment because of a broken leg hi had received. This film is viewed from his prospective as he views his neighborhood and his fellow neighbors. Hitchcock's choice of music was very interesting for this film because there is none, or at least no official sound track. All music that was used in the film was from his near by neighbors, or music playing on the street, which in turn was in sync with what was going on. This films battles a lot of controversy over ethics and morals as James Stewart `peeps' out his windows of his apartment, is it okay? Is it wrong? Although Hitchcock is known for his fantastic horror movies, this is a great mystery movie to watch. Hitchcock did a great job casting this film, James Stewart was a perfect choice, because many viewers at the time felt like they could identify with him. This film really gets you hooked and making you ask what exactly is next. I give it 8.5 out of 10 stars, for the spectacular work put into making the set of `Rear Window' and also the great job the performers and Hitchcock putting together this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Rear Window (1954): Hitchcock's Masterpiece of Voyeurism,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) stands as one of his finest works, an enthralling blend of suspense, intrigue, and psychological depth. Set within the confines of a single apartment, Rear Window explores the themes of voyeurism, paranoia, and human curiosity, all while delivering a tense, edge-of-your-seat experience that keeps the audience engrossed from start to finish. The film is a masterclass in how to build tension using limited space, and Hitchcock's skillful direction ensures that this cinematic experience is as riveting today as it was over half a century ago.The genius of Rear Window lies in its simplicity. The entire film takes place in one location: the apartment of L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, a professional photographer. Confined to a wheelchair due to a broken leg, Jeff spends his time gazing out of his rear window, observing the lives of his neighbors in the surrounding apartment complex. This seemingly mundane activity sets the stage for Hitchcock's brilliant exploration of human nature-how we become engrossed in the lives of others, and the consequences of such curiosity. As the movie progresses, Jeff's passive observations take a darker turn, raising questions about morality, ethics, and what it means to be an observer.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sneaky Peepy Cameras,"If ever a film was asking for a presentation on the IMAX this would be the film.With good reason Jimmy Stewart claimed 'Rear Window' was his personal favourite of the four films he made with Hitchcock and it remains The Master's definitive analysis of voyeurism.Hitchcock's embrace of colour is seldom remarked upon, but it helped him accomplish effects that would have quite impossible in black & white (such as the tip of Thorwold's cigarette glowing in his darkened apartment and red flashes to simulate dazzle).It was probably also the most accomplished example of Hitchcock's long held desire to generate suspense in a confined space, the main set never looking like anything but a set. But charmingly so.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredibly Suspenseful and Tense!,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's most important auteurs and every motion picture release with his name attached was a big event. The sharp-detailed director had two movies released in 1954. The first was the thrilling, perhaps a bit minor Dial M for Murder. His second film is the subject of this review, Rear Window. Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best, if not the best thrillers he has ever made. The story is simple enough, but the film envelopes you in a world of nonstop tension. I was biting my nails from start to finish, and that is habit that rarely comes out. Good job, Mr. Hitchcock!The story, written by John Michael Hayes seems quite simple, but I love the complexity that is given to the film. Just like Hitchcock's other 1954 feature, most of the film takes place in one location-the apartment of James Stewart's character, L.B Jeffries. The one set based off Greenwich Village in New York City, that Hitchcock built on the set of Paramount studios is very elaborate and it really works well with the film. Did you know that he even created a drainage system that would allow the water used as rain to drain? One thing that Hitchcock excels at in each film of his is his excellent sense of detail.L.B Jeffries aka Jeff (James Stewart) is confined to his apartment after his breaking his leg. He has two women coming to his apartment to take care him: his wisecracking nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his beautiful longtime girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) who works as a fashion model. To save him from boredom, Jeff decides to spy on his neighbors with his binocular. There is Miss Lonely Hearts who cooks fancy dinners for imaginary guests and there is Miss Torso who entertains various males just to name some of the people he sees. One rainy night, he notices a neighbor named Thorwald (Raymond Burr) leaving a with a trunk three times and that his nagging and invalid wife is no longer present. That leaves Jeff suspicious of his neighbor and he believes a murder took place. Along with Stella, Lisa, and his police lieutenant friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), Jeff begins to put the pieces together to find the truth.When there is only location, you need great direction and great acting to make up for that closed location. We already know Hitchcock directed the hell out of the film, and he earned an Academy Award nomination. What about the acting? I can happily report that the acting is phenomenal. James Stewart really crushes it here, considering his character is immobilized the entire time. Pre-war, Jimmy Stewart was known for his comedies, westerns, and taking nice guy roles in general. After WW2 ended, he began taking more complex and darker roles. Hitchcock exploited that side of him not only with this film, but in 1958's Vertigo as well. He does well with the coldness of his character. Grace Kelly, who appeared in Dial M for Murder, does well here. She is cool and elegant and is more than just the beautiful blonde. She also does some unexpecting stuff such as sneaking in the apartment of the suspect-and that scene is dripping with tension, I promise!There is a lot that goes behind Hitchcock's head. One idea he prominently displays here is the idea of voyeurism. The basic definition of voyeurism is taking pleasure in watching someone unobserved. The term can be used in a sexual way, or it could be used in a way that watching someone else's pain relieves the watcher of his/her pain. Also, what about us viewers of the movie? Are we not taking pleasure or interest in watching the pain or emotions of these characters? Voyeurism is the central theme at play here. There are also themes that can be discussed regarding impotence of male figures and how women are just not supposed to be seen as beautiful, but how they can be regarded as puzzles or even threats. For such a simple story, there can be much to think about!Rear Window is a Hitchcock masterpiece. It really thrills you from start to finish and I am not talking about any of those cheap thrills. The characters are built up so well that by the time we get to the payoff in the end, do we really care about that payoff? I mean that in a positive way! With only one set location, the use of diegetic (natural) sound outside the main titles, this really is a thriller to behold. I can't be sure if this is my favorite Hitchcock film as there are so many masterpieces, but this is up there!My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cinema 101,"Probably one of the most beautiful films that has ever existed or will exist.Love, as a theme intertwined with a murder mystery to captivate the audience, takes us on this adventure.The way Grace Kelly enters the film is penetrating and surreal and remains so throughout her screen presence, in addition to the stunning beauty of the entire film, from the natural lighting and angles to Hitchcock's mastery of how to capture emotions on the human face, the film is enhanced by a timeless sense of humor that complements the story and makes every second of dialogue between the characters captivating.Hitchcock's ability to make so many interesting characters without speaking, just by the way they are filmed, is magnificent and a lesson in narrative and world development without dialogue.James Stewart delivers an iconic protagonist worthy of the actor's level and his partnerships with Hitchcock.Supported by a fantastic performance by Thelma Ritter, who, alongside Wendell Corey, brings moral and rational balance to the story, Rear Window proves worthy of all the appreciation and impact it has had on cinema.Lisa Fremont, despite being passionate and sensitive, is far from a lady who just watches events unfold. She is shrewd, intelligent, argumentative, courageous and full of personality, and her exploits in this adventure are some of the best moments in the film, far from being a damsel in distress.As a fashion designer, Grace has some of the best costumes I've ever seen in this film. I'm amazed at how Edith Head captured the essence of the character by accentuating Grace's aura with each costume.A film that is a masterclass in storytelling about love, comedy, suspense and mystery, all in just 1 hour and 50 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Hitchcock Masterpiece,"""We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their house and look in for a change.""Alfred Hitchcock directs the suspenseful, mysterious crime thriller known as Rear Window. As one of his greatest works this film is classic and inventive to the world of cinema. The acting throughout is fantastic. The audience sees perfection from every character throughout the film. When talking about atmospheric cinema this is a picture that cannot be overlooked. Hitchcock successfully sinks the audience into this city neighborhood. The themes that are presented throughout this film make the audience look internally as the initial quote suggests. This is a critique of human society and our nosiness which has aged to perfection. Instead of looking at our own lives we use others as distractions. This is a story about a news photographer who has suffered an injury and is confined to his apartment for months. During this time his only entertainment is looking into the homes of people who live in his neighborhood. One day he suspects a murder has happened and tries to solve this case. This a beautiful and timeless piece of cinema brought to us by one of the greatest directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not quite Hitchcock,"`Rear Window' is a great movie, if the viewer is into more drawn out plots. If they are only into movies that catch their attention quickly, this is not the movie for them.This film had a very unique set.  The entire movie is filmed in an indoor set.  It also is filmed so that everything is inside the apartment of the main character.  Things happen outside, but all of the camera angles are simply looking out the window.When compared to most movies, `Rear Window' is very good.  The only time this movie does not `measure up' is when compared to `Psycho', Hitchcock's more notable movie.  The Master of Suspense didn't really live up to his name in this movie.  This is supposed to be a suspenseful movie, but comparatively, it is not suspenseful at all.  Though good camera angles, and good music selection, did help things along, it did not seem to have the Alfred Hitchcock touch.Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a seven out of ten.  It is good if you have the attention span for drawn out movies.  But if the viewer is looking for `entertain me, quick' they are looking at the wrong movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite puzzled as to how it got in to IMDb top 20,"This movie being in IMDb top 20 puzzles me somewhat. I have seen most of the IMDb top 20 movies and they lived up to my expectations or exceeded expectations apart from perhaps The Dark Knight, Star Wars, and Lord of the ring. Those movies are up there understandably due the votes of the huge fan base. But how did Rear Window got up there? Due to the fan base of Hitchcock? Probably... and may be also due to the fact this is a pioneering movie of its genre. I can try and agree with reasons given by reviewers who has given very high rating for this movie. However, the whole package is bit disappointing, specially when you put this movie in current context. I cannot agree that this is a timeless classic. Anyway, you have to put my rating of 5 in context as well. I am rating it for the entertainment value forgetting about the fact that Hitchcock did this movie in 1954 and he was a pioneer of the genre.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock's True Classic?,"This film is pretty much set in Jefferies flat throughout the whole 2 hours (reminding me somewhat of The Glass Menagerie, which is never a good thing), and no shot outside of the apartment block is shot, and although Hitchcock ensures the audience aren't too aware of this, it doesn't help the static feeling that this film creates.The most interesting level to the flick is the relationship between Jefferies and his girlfriend, which at the start of the film is mismatched, disjointed and mainly physical (Kelly's sexuality is on full display here), yet through the supposedly horrific circumstances they are able to use murder as a lubrication to a better relationship. Kelly especially seems aware of this yet, almost acknowledging the sacrifice of a life as a fair act for the salvation of their relationship. In many ways this complex relationship means the murder itself plays second fiddle.The murder plot itself is fairly basic and uninspiring, yet it is the unlikable Jefferies response to the proceedings which mean the viewer doesn't lose interest.Compared to many of Hitchcock's true classics this film does not have a tense edge to it (not to the modern audience anyway, when the idea of voyeurism or being watched all the time is reality not fantasy), till the final 10 minutes of climax. Perhaps the idea of being watched from afar is accepted to the point where the pivotal point of the flick is somewhat lost.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A true classic of cinema,"Rear Window plays out like a piece of theatre. The staging of the film was magnificent. From the start Rear Window will draw you in, with the opening shot so rich in detail and promising so much for the rest of the film. Unsurprisingly Rear Window delivers on this promise. The plot was really intriguing, holding a true sense of mystery and suspense which will have you on tenterhooks. The character list is limited, with only really four genuine speaking parts in the film, the main two of course being James Stewart and Grace Kelly. The relationship between them was fun and had a good element of depth to it. It was nicely explored and felt real enough.The direction from Hitchcock was sublime. Rear Window would appear to be a tricky film to execute, taking place solely within one, confined room, albeit with constant glimpses of the (yet again confined) outside world. Despite this the film never feels claustrophobic or bland, maintaining a strong element of intrigue and freshness, which is a testament to Hitchcock's brilliance. The way that Hitchcock explored the various windows and lives of Stewart's neighbours so seamlessly and effectively was marvellous, injecting lots of humour into the piece.By god though, the final encounter was let down by some laughable effects. Obviously this film is nearly 70 years old so I shouldn't judge these effects too harshly, however the entire final scene, which should have been one of suspense, effectively became one of comedy. A real shame, but that comes with the territory of watching a film from the 50s I suppose.Rear Window is a great experience and a fantastic piece of cinema. The plot is sufficiently mysterious and engaging, the characters believable and enjoyable, and the direction spot on. A true classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitch's greatest film,"This is the master director's greatest film, slightly edging out ""North by Northwest"" and ""Vertigo.""  Even the absence of a score by Bernard Herrmann cannot dim this masterpiece.  Everything comes together in a seamless whole. To begin with, the set is impressive.  The fact that the viewers are seeing so much happening in so many different people's lives makes them forget that, except for one or two scenes near the end, the camera never moves from the protagonist's apartment.  What Jeff sees we see and nothing more.  The voyeuristic fantasy is so complete, we forget that no one in his or her right mind would put on a brassiere, attempt suicide, or commit murder in front of an open window.  I can't help wondering whether this looking in on so many people's private goings-on had anything to do with the still new medium of television, which enabled people for the first time to sit in the comfort of their own living rooms and watch, as if through an open window, the antics of Lucy and Ricky, Ozzie and Harriet and others in the supposed privacy of their own homes.I mentioned the score.  This film apparently marked Hitch's last collaboration with composer Franz Waxman, who scored the earliest of the director's American films, including ""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion.""  Yet it's not a conventional score.  Apart from the opening theme, the music is part of the action and pours out of various apartments overlooking the courtyard, particularly the penthouse apartment of the songwriter, whose evolving composition provides a melodic--and sometimes not so melodic--backdrop for the developing plot.  (What a noisy place!  And this was in the days before boom boxes.  Yet somehow it looks like a delightful neighbourhood to live in.)Then, of course, there are the three stars, Stewart, Kelly and Ritter, who are wonderful together.  In many respects all three are character actors, but the characters blend in so charming a fashion that the viewer is taken in as much by the personalities as by the suspense-filled story line. Each character is surrounded by a certain ironic twist.  Stewart is the adventurer whose wanderlust is forcibly curtailed by confinement to a wheelchair.  Kelly is the pampered socialite who nevertheless summons up the courage to collect clues to a suspected murder in a most unconventional way. And Ritter is an apparently ordinary insurance company nurse whose homespun wisdom makes her part psychoanalyst and part clairvoyant.  The chemistry is marvellous and would be difficult to replicate.What about the 1998 made-for-television remake?  It's interesting enough entertainment in its own right, but not as a remake of the 1954 film.  The original is definitely the one to see.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I agree that it is well made and directed, and I liked the whole concept of seeing through the eyes of the protagonist, and how all of the neighbors had their own little story, but the movie just moved too slow. There was not enough suspense or surprise that it should be considered it a masterpiece thriller. Maybe this movie is just so highly rated because it was one of the firsts of its kind, but I can think of many movies I enjoyed more than this.

Rear window,"Unique shooting techniques, with the hero's eyes as the lens, to peer into the lives of the neighbors.

It's attractive enough.Talk a little bit more about role setting.The hero is set as a photojournalist unable to move freely due to illness.
As a photojournalist, the man's instinctive curiosity and observation led him to focus on the smallest things, and the neighbors' parents catered to this habit, relieving the boredom and boredom caused by his absence from work.

Great classic,"Great Hitchcock classic - Jeff is an intrepid photojournalist whose daredevil dedication to his job has left him confined to a wheelchair in his small Greenwich apartment. With no television to alleviate his boredom, he takes to spying on the neighbors across the courtyard, getting to know them intimately without their knowledge. For starters, we've got Miss Torso, a young beauty who practices dancing in her restrictive lodgings. There's also a frustrated composer going through songwriter's block {where Hitchcock makes his obligatory cameo}; a young married couple christening their new abode as only honeymooners can; Miss Lonelyhearts, a desperately forlorn middle-aged spinster; a busybody neighbor; and an older couple with a terrier. But the neighbor who piques Jeff's interest most of all is Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a henpecked traveling salesman with a nagging invalid wife. Even without the binoculars {or even a high-powered lens} Jeff can see the tension between them as they bicker back and forth.

Clever stuff from a master filmmaker,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' takes us to the apartment of LB Jefferies, a photographer who is confined to his room after an accident. And there, physically at least, is where we will stay for the entire film.LB's leg is broken and in plaster, and he has little else to do but observe the comings and goings of his neighbours. The view through his rear window overlooks opposing apartments, and he uses binoculars and his camera zoom lense to 'spy' on the lives of others through their windows.Grace Kelly plays Lisa Fremont, his love interest, who along with Stella, the maid/physio, pop into the apartment from time to time and eventually get roped into LB's obsession.What starts out as simple snooping (innocent or creepy - you decide) soon turns into something bigger as LB suspects foul play in one of the apartments, and becomes obsessed with discovering if a murder has occurred.In theory, this film has every chance of failing - we are confined to one room (either witnessing events inside, or looking out), not much happens for a good while (especially at the start of the film) and we never properly get to meet the neighbours we see from a distance. But of course, it doesn't even come close to failing.The confines of the apartment are perfect, since we see what LB sees - and in doing so, we are unwitting voyeurs as well. The dialogue is natural and sharp, even during the slower moments, and the apparant lack of action (at least until the end) is exactly as it should be. And we get just enough of a glimpse into the lives of the neighbours to like, dislike or empathise with them. Each one we see is different, but characterised to be in harmony with the overall story.It's a clever concept, brilliantly delivered. Brave as well, to let events play out at a relaxed pace rather than rely on thrills and spills to keep us engaged. And we are never really sure about whether a murder has taken place until the film's reveal. Is LB reading too much into what he thinks he has seen? We can't be sure.One of those multilayered films that can be seen more than once, with each new viewing bringing up something you missed the time before and a fresh appreciation of the plot, setting, characters, script and direction.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very good on many levels,"For some of the (younger???) viewers who have commented on Rear Window's lack of charm au courant, I'd like to say ""Open your eyes and ears, and use that grey matter between them."" Once upon a time, movies didn't involve explosions and zooming surround sound. They were about dialogue and the unfolding of events, pausing long enough for the viewer to participate in the plot, being allowed to think ahead, and make sense of what came behind. It involved more than one level of the brain. Well done movies such as Rear Window quickened the heart's pace as well as stimulated the mind.The visuals are wonderful in Rear Window. The 'creeping camera' shots at the beginning of the film states where, what, who, and why in the matter of a few moments without a bit of dialogue (when is stated early on but uses dialogue, unless I've missed it in the earlier shots). The colors are wonderful as well and the dreamlike quality of the court's interior, versus the harsher shades just outside, tells the viewer that there is something otherworldly about this particular location. It sets up the real story told in this movie; it's a study of male/female relationships at various stages, from miss lonely hearts to the violent Thorwalds and everything in between. The suspense is the (interesting) hook keeping the viewer watching. You can compare and contrast the occupant/s of each apartment to one another, as well as Jeffries' relationship to Lisa, and possibly to your own.I'm not an art house movie aficionado. I enjoy actions movies with the best of 'em; there's nothing wrong with a bit of escapism like Die Hard. But I can also appreciate a movie that doesn't rely on boobs and explosions to entertain and possibly makes a synapse pop with electricity once in a while. If explosions are all you can understand, and more than one dimension to a movie brings on a migraine, then by all means don't buy or rent this movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery

How taut and suspenseful the 'investigation' is probably doesnt need to be covered.

Grace Kelly isn't given anything to do but give Jimmy suggestively naughty looks (that he's more than happy to return), but she looks beautiful. They had an amusing non-affair during the filming. Mrs. Stewart famously accompanied her husband to the set every day, just in case; and Grace declared Jimmy one of the most attractive men she'd ever met (probably because she couldn't have him!).

I heard about this film from one of 'The Simpsons' episodes (the one where Bart broke his leg and spied on his neighbor from his bedroom window), so then I was curious about this movie. I watched the remastered version of this film in high definition and I'm blown away at how good this movie was. I haven't seen much classic films but I think this movie was ahead of its time, Alfred Hitchcock puts a lot of effort into his art and it really shows.The view from the window of the apartment out into the courtyard is absolutely beautiful, there's a clear view of everyone's apartments and what they're doing and you can even see people dining in the restaurant in the far distance of the background, I applaud for this much attention to detail. This film takes me back in time to New York City in the 1950's, it gave me a taste of what life might've looked like back in the day (especially watching the remastered version in color and high definition). The acting was surprisingly good and the storyline is good (though the ending was not what I expected, but it was still good). There is a little bit of romance and humor in this film, and lots of suspense. The Alfred Hitchcock knows about human behavior and how we love being curious and looking at other people's lives and seeing their happiness and pain.It felt like I was there in the movie, watching these people's lives through the window and bring curious, just like the main character, and wondered what will happen next.

As well as the composers Lenoard Bernstein and Fraz WaxmanRear Window tells the story of a photographer who is confined to using a wheelchair after an injury. He never goes outside during this time but shares a courtyard view with many others, and he spends his days watching his neighbors through the window. As time passes, Jeff becomes familiar with those who live near him, giving them nicknames representing what he has viewed. After a few days, he noticed the disappearance of Thorvlads (Raymond Burr) wife, and after piecing together several other clues, he believes a murder has taken place.Jeff does, however, have two visitors that come to the house regularly. His fiance Lisa Fremont, who fears he will never commit himself to her but rather continue his current lifestyle. The other Jeff's nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), often lectures him about making assumptions rather than getting to know people and their stories through interaction and talking to them.The performance by James Stewert and his costars is exemplary. Stewart truly embodies his character and captures the attention of the audience. His tone and facial expressions expertly convey the character's emotions as he watches out the window.Rear Window was nominated for a BAFTA Award, WGA Award, DGA Award, and four Acadamy Awards. The film won an NBR Award for Best Actress (Grace Kelly), NYFCC Awards for Best Actress (Grace Kelly), won an Edgar for Best Motion Picture, and was added to the national film registry. In addition to this, Rear Window ranked #42 in the list of AFI: 100 Greatest American Movies and ranked #14 in the list of AFI: 100 Most Thrilling Movies Ever.Every film has a weakness, and for Rear Window, that weakness is minor continuity errors throughout the film. While these do not take away from the movie itself or create any plot hole, when noticed, they can be irritating to viewers.This film should rate an eight out of ten. It's the best fit for people looking for mystery mixed with thrill. The movie, with parental guidance, is excellent for all ages. Overall, Rear Window is a fantastic and timeless movie that many can enjoy for years and years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock does it agian,"How this movie was made was interesting. When Alfred Hitchcock created this movie he wanted to explore different things in movie making, privacy and community. When it came to making the set, Paramount Studios allowed him to destroy the main floor to use the basement as a part of the set, making the set the biggest indoor set made (probably for that time) Hitchcock also explored with the dialog, there were a select few people talking. The way the actors acted was their dialog. He also puts you into the movie by making you guess what's going to happen and also the excitement, he does this by showing you what happened then Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) reaction to what just happened. Stewart also in the move resembled himself so it wasn't hard for him to act. When Hitchcock was shooting rainy scene he told one actor to go one way and the other another way, and they didn't know about the water so when you watch the movie watch it closely.When the movie was made it actually was based on a true story when a man killed his wife and tried to cover it up, that didn't work. The movie was also based on the book `It had to be Murder'. Then Hitchcock put into his own perspective, creating a original piece of work",,Anonymous,Mystery
Claustrophobic And Beautiful,"Once again, Hitchcock is effortless in his pacing and virtue to the philosophy of an advantaged and privileged victim. Unfortunately and disappointingly, the film is often slow-moving and unlike others in the Hitchcock canon, the slow-mounting tension and thrill of the chase is often rendered monotonous. Nevertheless it is enjoyable and incredibly taut, the paranoid and claustrophobic tension is eased by the glistening of Grace Kelly and the ridiculously dry wit in the back and forth between Thelma Ritter and James Stewart. Definitely worth a watch and a necessity for any Hitchcock collection - the imagery and pace are both really unique to Hitchcock's style but are more on show in Rear Window.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hitchcock at his finest.,"This movie has you on the edge of your seat with every little thing that plays on. It's chilling and thrilling in every scene and towards the end you are uncertain of what will happen to the protagonists. Hitchcock's genius is shown in the film every time the camera turns. It's the illusion of voyeurism that keeps us watching. The ability to see what happens without being seen. You start to care about the characters as soon as the film starts. Marriage is the theme overshadowed by murder. James Stewart's finest performance if you ask me and the captivating Grace Kelly as beautiful as ever. This movie is 65 years old, but if you watched the movie without knowing the date of the release, you wouldn't think of it to be older than 10 years old.

Classic Hitchcock,"Alfred Hitchcock has always had a penchant to focus on the mental psyche, or an obsession such as fear of heights, birds or kleptomania to name a few, and in Rear Window he puts voyeurism under the spotlight - people watching that becomes dangerous for people watcher, and in this riveting Hitchcock thriller James Stewart stars as the window watcher who witnesses murder.The story: Confined to a wheelchair following an accident, magazine photographer Jeff Jeffries passes the time by observing the behaviour of his neighbours. When an invalid wife he has been watching seemingly disappears, Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa decide to investigate - putting themselves in deadly danger.Also starring a menacing Raymond Burr as the killer and Grace Kelly as Stewart's girlfriend, Rear Window is a gem of a thriller that ratchets up the tension gradually and it reaches an unbearable fever pitch towards the end, especially when the killer realises he's being observed.

Classic Hitchcock,"Rear Window(1954) in its restored edition is better than ever with improvements made with the look and sound of the film.  It is Alfred Hitchcock's second great film right after Vertigo(1958).  Rear Window was Alfred Hitchcock's first box office hit.  The colors of the movie are fresher and make the movie seem brand new.Alfred Hitchcock's top five movies are 1.Vertigo(1958), 2.Rear Window(1954), 3.Psycho(1960), 4.The Birds(1963), and 5.North By Northwest(1959).  It is filled with terrific scenes of suspense and nerve wecaking mystery.  James Stewart is great as usual as a curious photographer.  Thelma Ritter adds some morbid humor to the film with her dialogue.My ten favorite Hitchcock films are 1.Strangers on a Train(1951), 2.Notorious(1946), 3.The 39 Steps(1934), 4.Vertigo(1958), 5.Rear Window(1954), 6.The Birds(1963), 7.Frenzy(1972), 8.North By Northwest(1959), 9.Rope(1948), and 10.Marnie(1964).  Raymond Burr is menacing as the mysterious salesman.  The protagonist is someone who likes to look into the lives of his fellow neighboors.  Grace Kelly is alluing as Jeffery's girlfriend.Rear Window(1954) deals with the theme of voyeurism although without the explicit nature of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom(1960) which took a more extreme viewpoint.  This movie is filled with Hitchcock humor.  This is a film that will stand the test of time as all great movies eventually do.  It is best to see it on the big screen because it is the best way to View Rear Window(1954).",,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing but Quite Disappointing,"I found Rear Window, on the whole, very interesting. However I think the end was pretty... well... stupid. Disapointly, really. People say ""it isn't about the mystery, it's about the relationships"" etc. I suppose with a Hitchcock movie, you really expect a thrilling mystery. Of course I found it entertaining, but just a let down. Jimmy Stewart nails the role of the injured photographer, and Grace Kelly is very good too as the rich girlfriend. It's all very simple and well done and does Definitely keep your attention.I did like Rear Window (and Grace Kelly's fashions). It's a very good film.. perhaps a bit overrated, though.

"Gripping Thriller, Fantastic World Building","This was a fantastic thriller that started slow but by the time it was done, I was on the edge of my seat. It begins with a normal apartment scene with Stewart as the main character but the way Hitchcock was able to slowly introduce the entire apartment block through world-building was so well done and paced. I wanted to know more about each set of neighbors and Hitchcock did an amazing job having each apartment play off each other simultaneously. Stewart and Kelly were a fantastic duo in this one and were able to have great chemistry in some scenes but perfect tension in others. The cinematography was also top-notch but had some limitations due to the time it was shot having not developed the technology yet. It's not a masterpiece to me since it felt like a couple of scenes were drawn out a bit too long with dialogue but it didn't kill the pacing either. 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jeff's being paranoid...,"I love Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' and 'Notorious', so I thought I'd enjoy Rear Window since it's his highest ranked film on IMDb. I thought wrong. As a matter of fact I think this film was just a tab above average, and definitely not as good as the two other films mentioned above. My main beef with Rear Window is that there was simply not enough condemning evidence before the dog got killed to suspect a man of possibly committing murder.First of all, I didn't think it's too out of ordinary for a jewelry dealer to go out at night. He might be doing business with someone only available at night, and he might have forgotten to bring a few things that the buyer wanted so he came back a couple of times. Maybe he had a argument with his wife and went out a couple of times to clear his mind because he couldn't sleep. Maybe he was smuggling drugs this one time or some other illegal merchandise, and as bad as this is that's still not murder! The possibilities are simply endless.Second of all, I have knives and saws in my house, and if I'm moving I'd certainly pack everything. Does that make me a murderer if a neighbor should see me packing these things? I wouldn't write this if I am. I think it's quite ridiculous to suspect the husband of CUTTING UP HIS WIFE'S CORPSE simply because he was packing up his knives and saws for relocation.I have a problem with the purse as well. How in heck did Jeff and Lisa come to the conclusion that the purse they saw was the wife's favorite? My mom's got more than one purse, and she never takes all of them wherever she goes. And how are they so sure that the ring was the wife's wedding band? I bet neither of them had met the wife in person let alone taking notice of her ring.Lastly, if I was the neighbor, I would laugh off Jeff's accusation, and tell him to get a real hobby 'cause he's got nothing on me. Instead the neighbor freaks out even though he was cool as a cucumber while disposing of his wife's remains.With all this said, I think the overall plot really fall apart due to these holes. But I did like the concept of Rear Windows. I thought it was really clever how Jeff used his photos to conclude that the flower bed was disturbed, and I enjoyed the suspense when the two women went sleuthing while Jeff watched for the neighbor. I just think there should be more condemning evidence planted to make this film more believable.All in all: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pure Hitchcock mystery magic until . . .,"I've seen the film once before. This last time I watched it and couldn't get over a couple things. First, if Stewart and Kelly were so concerned about everything going on in the other apartments, especially Thorwald's movements, why did they sit there with the lights on the entire movie observing all the comings and goings while thinking no one could see them. And the biggest disappointment for me, as a professional photographer, was to see ""Jeffries"" who supposedly traveled the world as an assignment photographer not know how to handle his camera. He held the Exacta as if it was a large sausage. With the large telephoto lens attached I think Stewart was more afraid he would drop it. He never held the camera with his right hand wrapped around the camera body and his index finger poised on the trigger button. The image shown of his view through the lens was round as if seen through a telescope instead of rectangular as seen through a 35mm camera frame. Could not any of the cinematographers on the crew instructed him in how to hold the camera? I was stunned at that obvious flub. He seemed to figure out the flash gun and how to change the bulbs and trigger the lights in the villain' s eyes. Bummer for me! The rest of the film was genius?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Groundbreaking,"(1954) Rear Window
SUSPENSE/ MYSTERY/ COMEDYThe most popular director Alfred Hitchcock had ever done and is probably one of his finest, if not influential. This film which started a whole slew of other 'Peeping Tom' movies like the teenager film from 2007 ""Disturbia"" to the chilling 1960 film ""Peeping Tom"" starring Carl Boehm and Moira Shearer and ""Body Double"" directed by Brian DePalma. The film that started it all starring James Stewart and the ravishing Grace Kelly can also be personified as who they're in real life, using their real life personas to liven the story, like for example when Jeff (James Stewart) tells Leeza Freemont (Grace Kelly) that she belongs to this luxurious lifestyle who Jeff is not, just so he could find a excuse not to be with her, she denies these kind of comments and becomes very stubborn and really want to be with Jeff. I mention this because in real life, Grace Kelly does marry an actual Prince of Monaco and James Stewart went to war serving his country during WWII. This film is a natural reflection of who they're and is used to great effect to enhance the story because the audience identifies with them, for the exception of Raymond Burr as the suspect who may or may have not have murdered his wife.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

slow but good,"This film is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular movies. The movie seems to start out slow and doesn't really pickup the pace until the concluding end. The film is about a man  L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries  played by James Stewart. Jeff has a broken leg and sits in a wheelchair, spending his time spying on his neighbors through a courtyard. When Jeff starts to suspect that one of his neighbors may have killed his wife, he asks his girlfriend Lisa, played by Grace Kelly, what he should do. At first Lisa thinks he might be going mad until she starts to get into the courtyard drama herself. As Jeff's curiosity grows toward his neighbor's abnormal behavior, the suspense starts and you're on the edge of your seat.The only great thing in this film is the acting.  Since Stewart can't move much, he uses facial expressions. Those expressions seem to say it all, it adds a lot to his characters behavior. Grace Kelly's performance is also good, as she plays the concerned girlfriend and detective at the same time.The reviewer noticed the most peculiar thing about the music in the film. There was no actual background music placed in the movie, all the music that is heard comes from the neighbor's piano or someone's radio/record player.

Everything is pointing towards this being a wild goose chase and just when he's about to give up on the idea something arouses his suspicion again.Hitchcock is the master of thrill and horror and he will have you wavering between siding with Jeff or with reason throughout the movie, never truly settling on a side for too long.Beautifully shot, smooth editing... and Grace Kelly is her radiant self in it!

Best use of lighting in the history of cinema,"The Rear Windows showed the best type of lighting skills at that period of time when movie tools and techniques were not at the best. The whole movie kept audiences' attentions and tensions in them before the climax of the film. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to keep the movie so concentrated throughout the movie and the keylightings mixing lowkey light and highkey lights gave the highlight effects that helped mainly to make the mood or the atmosphere of the movie suspenseful. By putting really bright light on the face of the main character, it's triggering the audiences to look at his emotions and what he's thinking of the whole situation in the film. It was interesting that when, the main character, got into the shadow of his room, it made it seem like that he's no longer being seen by the neighbors outside through his window. The way the highkey lightings worked with the neighbor's building showed precisely what the neighbors do and how their lives are like. The angles of the camera also was interesting in a way when it shows the aspects of the neighbors lives, it uses the perspective shots as if the scene is seen with the character's eyes.

Movie Review,"It's great to experience a movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat, very rarely does a movie have a story that has you so immersed that you forget you are watching a movie. The movie was so good I had my roommates join me in the movie viewing. I enjoyed a lot of the subtle camera work in the movie because it made you feel like you are seeing everything though Jeff's perspective.
A good example is when Jeff is looking out his window to see his neighbor, Lars Thorwald, bringing his wife food to her bed on a tray, the camera is zoomed out, showing that Jeff is just passively watching not seeing anything interesting happening. Then it shows Jeff sitting in his wheelchair suddenly being enticed in something that's going on off camera, so the camera pans back to Lars and his wife but this time the camera is slowly zooming in as the scene progresses to show that Jeff is interested in what's going on, it's as if we are seeing this scene through Jeff's eyes.
Something that I found very interesting about rear window that I didn't realize until we talked about it in class, is the fact that the whole movie takes place in the same room for the whole length of the movie. That's very impressive since showing the same room for the whole movie would normally lose the audiences interest. The only other movies that I've seen pull this off was the breakfast club and 12 angry men.
I thought It was very cool that Jeff was watching all his neighbors as if it was some crystal ball showing him all the different futures that he could have. I liked that each neighbor represented something that Jeff was thinking about, whether it was the young couple who just got married and are happy that they just got married, showing that Jeff was thinking about how happy he would be if he was to marry Lisa. Miss. Torso representing some girl of his dreams that he just can't take look away from her. Lars Thorwald representing an older version of Jeff who is unhappy with his marriage. The young musician, representing Jeff because he's successful and well recognized but unhappy because he feels alone. Miss. Lonely heart representing an older version of Jeff who choose not to marry Lisa and feeling alone.
I loved the fact that you can see Hitchcock in the movie when the musician is at the piano and someone is winding the mantel clock, I like it because I thought Orson Welles was one of the first movie directors to cameo in their own movies.
Something I thought was interesting was the fact that at the end of the movie it shows the young couple's window, the newly wed husband comes out to smoke and have a small break from his new wife and she calls out to him and it shows his face that he's annoyed representing that the honey moon was over.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He won awards while covering WWII with his lens.That being said, why doesn't he take a single picture while witnessing a murder being committed, across the courtyard from his apartment?Furthermore, Jefferies uses his camera as a telescopic device, never pressing the shutter, his finger is perched on.

Great,In an attempt not to ruin this movie for anyone reading this review I will refrain from discussing plot elements and I will focus more on the genius in the way it is filmed and the music that is used in the movie.This movie was filmed entirely in one set that was built indoors this is part of the genius of this movie. The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of one mans apartment and in the entire movie the view only leaves the apparent once. The view of this mans window over looks a courtyard that is in the middle of four other apartment buildings. Each building has several windows facing the courtyard and the viewer through this window learns much of the occupants. Each of these occupants seemingly represents an aspect of the human condition.Also apart of this movies greatness is the casting. The main character is cast very well and is very convincing. In the movie the viewer finds them self feeling as if they are the main character and becomes extremely connected to him. Also very well cast is the girl friend of the main character. The viewer gets very distinct impressions of her that change as the movie continues.The sound in this movie is very unique because there is very little music and sounds that are out of place. Though this movie is considered to be a classic Hitchcock film the lack of unexplained music makes it stick out from his other movies such as Psycho which is full of it.,,Anonymous,Mystery

Bored amateur sleuth witnesses crime across courtyard,"Hitchcock's favorite leading man, Jimmy Stewart, wheelchair bound and bored, does what every guy in this situation would do: He grabs a pair of binoculars and ""explores"" the apartment windows across the yard. Of course he eventually gets an eye-full of funny business in one of the windows (someone murdered a woman and then disposed of the body by burrying it in the yard). Love interest Grace Kelly, totally keeping her cool, aides the handicapped amateur sluth in his quest to bring the murderer to justice. Also part of the fun is Thelma Ritter in one of her 6 career Oscar-nominated performances.This ""thriller"" is certainly predictable, limping by on a bit of nail-biting tension and several ""almost caught by the bad guy"" scenes. Otherwise it's just not up to Hitchcock's usual best. To anyone just discovering The Master of Mahem, I can highly recommend ""Frenzy"", ""The 39 Steps"" and the dark comedy ""The Trouble With Harry"", assuming that everyone starts (and has already seen) ""Psycho"". If you are new to ""Rear Window"", there are many better ways to spend 2 hours of your life (that you'll never get back).As a big fan of ""The Master"", I find this to be his weakest work. He offers the beautiful, ultra-glamorous Grace Kelly (soon to be Princess of Monacco) and a visibly much older, favorite leading man Jimmy Stewart, further perpetuating the chronic ""older man, gorgeous young woman"" love story that endured Barrymore/Garbo, Bogey/Bacall, Gable/Monroe and the likes.

"YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS, NOT YOUR NEIGHBORS.","If only they had tie winners for Oscars, Alfred Hitchcock would have won (and most certainly deserved to win) the award for Best Director. Even critics have argued this was his best film of the decade, and that's saying a lot considering all his other masterpieces. Alas, Hitch lost the award to George Seaton (THE COUNTRY GIRL).Some of the best screenplays are simple stories. This is a prime example. Newspaper photographer James Stewart breaks his leg, passes the time sitting home watching his neighbors -- and witnesses a murder.Amazing. The difference is Hitch takes it to the next level and has some fun with it, in a dark comedy way naturally. Stewart is perfectly cast as our hero, attempting to solve the case himself, nearly getting himself killed. Grace Kelly compliments him as his wary girlfriend, and toss in Thelma Ritter as Stewart's philosphical nurse. Ritter is a hoot, with the best lines, and could have doubled as Stewart's mother!Warning; beware of tall, dark and deadly Raymond Burr, just a few years before fame as PERRY MASON, which would completely take him away from villainous roles for the rest of his career.Production notes indicate this was largely filmed at one of Paramount's biggest sound stages, thus the setting for the famous courtyard sequence, and an intricate drainage system added to handle the pouring rain. The behind the scenes crew deserved special credit for creating a masterpiece setting, even by today's standards.Based on a story by suspense writer Cornell Woolrich, who created the WHISTLER mystery series, also known for THE WINDOW (1949). Franz Waxman did the music score. Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Screenplay. Oscar nominations also for Best Screenplay and Best Sound. Long running, and worth every second at 112 minutes.Hitch followed this with TO CATCH A THIEF, also starring Grace Kelly, where she met her future husband, Prince Ranier.Always on dvd and remastered blu ray for generations to come.

A classic movie,"The use of lenses in limited space is fantastic. Because it is ""peeping "", most of them are subjective lens with the meaning of examination and observation, but the arrangement of human eyes, binoculars, cameras and other media changes, visual is not tasteless. Under different depth of field, different characters take turns to go on stage and exit, after each window there is a auxiliary line story, intertwined with each other, and then under the ingenious scheduling, completed a ""multi-line narrative"" of another meaning.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just because it's Hitch doesn't mean it's good!,I consider this one of Hitch's below average films. Why would a gorgeous and highly bred woman like Grace Kelley put up with a nerd photographer in a little room who's a Peeping Tom?? If Mitchum or Douglas played him........Maybe yes. I think Stewart is great But he IS the greatest portrayer of nerds and silly men.I find the film contrived and boring. What's with Raymond Burr and the snow white hair??It's OK for a one time look at.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Voyeur's delight.,"Both a suspenseful thriller and brilliant murder mystery, to which nothing before or since is quite comparable. All the action takes place from just one room, either in the stated cramp't apartment, or for most of the time spying on the neighbours through the main protagonist's rear window. One of Hitchcock's regarded classics, which has certainly stood the test of time, and in every aspect of quality film making. The ending was a tad predictable but there are enough 'Red Herrings' thrown into the plot to pretty much keep you intrigued to the very final frame. Creepy and truly atmospheric to boot.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece of visual storytelling,"The best Alfred Hitchcock film he made. Tracking shot in the beginning makes one of the best beginnings in the history of motion pictures. The way Hitchcock shows as all the pre-story without any peace of word was spectacular and true example of pure cinema. The rest of movie was still very visual and interesting like we can expect from father of suspense. This film plays with you like it should be because it's Alfred Hitchcock film. In one minute you think you are really smart and start telling that it's all clear how this film would ends, but very next scene makes you feel like a fool. My favorite Hitchcock film!

A Masterful Hitchcockian Thriller that Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat,"The story centers around L. B. Jefferies, played by James Stewart, a photographer confined to his apartment due to a broken leg. As Jefferies passes the time peering through his rear window, he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors has committed a murder. With the help of his girlfriend Lisa Fremont, portrayed by Grace Kelly, and his nurse Stella, played by Thelma Ritter, Jefferies sets out to uncover the truth, leading to a gripping and suspenseful narrative.""Rear Window"" is an exercise in tension and voyeurism, expertly crafted by Hitchcock. The confined setting of Jefferies' apartment, from which he observes the intimate lives of his neighbors, creates a sense of claustrophobia and amplifies the suspense. The film skillfully plays with the audience's curiosity and forces them to become active participants in solving the mystery alongside Jefferies.James Stewart delivers a remarkable performance as the inquisitive and wheelchair-bound Jefferies. He effortlessly portrays a mix of curiosity, vulnerability, and determination, drawing the audience into his perspective and making them emotionally invested in his discoveries. Grace Kelly shines as Lisa, exuding elegance and intelligence, while Thelma Ritter provides memorable moments of comic relief and grounded wisdom.The film's meticulous attention to detail is evident in its set design and cinematography. Hitchcock's use of long takes, precise framing, and strategic camera movements immerses the audience in Jefferies' voyeuristic world, heightening the tension and suspense. The film's visual style, combined with the effective use of sound design, creates a palpable atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.Thematically, ""Rear Window"" explores ideas of moral ambiguity, the nature of voyeurism, and the consequences of curiosity. It raises questions about the ethics of observing others' lives and the line between being an observer and an active participant. These thought-provoking themes add depth to the film and elevate it beyond a mere thriller.""Rear Window"" is a masterful Hitchcockian thriller that showcases the director's brilliance in creating suspenseful and captivating narratives. With its stellar performances, meticulous craftsmanship, and thought-provoking themes, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to entertain and engage audiences. It is a testament to Hitchcock's status as the ""Master of Suspense"" and a must-watch for any lover of thrilling cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Something too frightful to utter...""","As an American actor/ screenwriter, I think ""Rear Window"" not only shows Hitchcock's genius as a director, but also his eye for casting the lovely and enormously talented Grace Kelly, and allowing her to blossom as an actress. The best moment in the film is when James Stewart, ignoring Kelly while she kisses him, as he talks about the people across the way, asks her what she thinks. She then knowingly replies, ""Something too frightful to utter""... This film has everything modern films lack: style, suspense, humour, imagination, sublety, romance and a leading lady who is extremely sexy, but never trys to be.. Modern filmmakers could learn a lesson from Hitch...

"Hey Lars, where are you going with that suitcase in your hand?","It is a hot evening in an attendance apartment complex. There is no air-conditioning or self-consciousness that open windows attract voyeurs. L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is wheelchair-bound and bored.

He adamantly tells his girlfriend and eventually the authorities. Naturally, there is no forthcoming evidence despite the incessant snooping of his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly.)Could be he was wrong in his assumption. Or will Lars get Jeff and the little dog too?This is a typical Alfred Hitchcock movie. That this is typical, is not to say that it is not great, and lots of fun to watch.

"""Slow and steady wins the race""","Once again, the Master of Suspense does not disappoint.  Being a cinematic offspring with Hitchcock genes, one can expect the usual dose of intriguing mystery, baffling murders, beautiful blondes, never-ending suspense, and of course an occasional twist or two by the time the end rolls near.  Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a steady paced thriller that is guaranteed to keep your voyeuristic tendencies satisfied till the very end.What's so special about Hitchcock's films is the fact that even though they seem to follow a certain suit, containing mysteries and murders, every one of them is original and one-of-a-kind, keeping them exciting and enticing to watch from time to time.  This film achieves its excellence with its unique panoramas and buttery smooth cinematography.  Hitchcock captures the very essence of L.B. Jeffries' neighborhood and its peculiarity without ever leaving his apartment, thus providing the audience an innovative cinematic setting with an obscure first-person view.Jimmy Stewart plays the role of L.B. Jeffries, an adventurous photographer restricted to a wheelchair while waiting for his broken leg to mend. Confined in his New York apartment, he spends his time observing his unusual neighbors through his rear window provided with the subtle distractions of his blonde bombshell of a girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), who gives him the TLC he needs, and his trusty house nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), who provides the laughter for both him and the audience.  In a flash, the film takes a different route with Hitchcock finesse and Jeffries is left with a view that leaves him baffled and stirred...The suspense that progresses and builds throughout the story is nothing short of breathtaking.  Many will be pleased with the intensity that binds this film's storyline as it fastens its pace.  Even in this film Hitchcock still manages to hook the audience with perfect timing and skill that can only be attained through his many years of experience.Many modern-day teenage viewers will complain that the beginning is rather slow. Without an objection, this reviewer can relate to their angst, but also reminds them that the reason for the slow pace is so that they can identify each of the characters as well as what's happening in the story as it picks up its speed till the very end, where hopefully, will have already stimulated their senses enough for them to enjoy the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this film is yet another favored classic to add under Hitchcock's belt for its simple, but forceful storyline and cinematic symbolism.  Rear Window is a great film for anyone in the mood for a good mystery; just be sure to keep your voyeuristic tendencies at a safe, sane, and legal level.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Rear end window,"Although many rave about this as being one of Hitchcock's best I,after two viewings was still indifferent.Certainly it is flawlessly directed,beautifully,but I found the film to be a little on the slow side.Certainly no 'North by Northwest' or 'Vertigo',although James Stewart is great as usual,and the scene when he can see Grace Kelly getting attacked is really great.I found it a bit on the seedy side with the camera lingering on the newly married couples room,and the constant shots of the ballet dancers in her undies.Maybe Hitchcock himself was a closet voyeur?.Maybe Hitchcock's own high standards sometimes make me think badly of films that I would have liked more by another director,but in this case,to me it is only a average thriller,that without fantastic direction & James Stewart would be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Trivial, Unresolved Mystery","The film centres around L.B. Jeffries, a newspaper journalist stuck in his apartment as he recovers from a broken leg. We're brought into his conspiracy theories about what the neighbours are doing; and it's up to as as viewers to decide what's indeed happening, and whether we even care about it.Those who enjoy the film inevitably seem to cite the exploration of voyeurism. Some of the neighbours certainly seem to exist as characters in the film only for the voyeuristic pleasure of L.B. and the audience.L.B. comes to suspect that one of his neighbours has just committed a crime; and as the film progresses, the question is not just about the neighbour's guilt, but whether the crime even happened.In parallel to this crime plot are other stories that fail to ever relate to the crime. The film inevitably concludes with the end of the crime plot, but that's not to say that this plot is actually resolved, with all its questions answered. How many of the film's plots end up being resolved is obviously dependent on the viewer, but I myself found the conclusion unsatisfactory and frankly, uninteresting.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a classic in the true sense of the word,"""Rear Window"" begins with some curtains opening in front of a window, as though the curtain in front of a movie screen is opening. Then, in several shots of the apartment, we learn through some photographs that reporter L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart), the apartment's inhabitant, is wheelchair-bound due to an accident. Jeff passes time looking at the various goings-on in the surrounding apartments. Currently, his only true companion is his neighbor Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly). Then, after observing some unclear incidents, Jeff begins to get suspicious that one of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may be up to something.Whether or not Thorwald did anything is not really the movie's point. ""Rear Window"" is almost like several movies within one: Ms. Lonelyhearts, the Musician, the Dancer, and others (the opening scene reinforces the movies-within-a-movie theme). Hitchcock uses the ingenious trick of giving the audience Jeff's POV shot (that's point-of-view, for non-movie buffs), particularly when Jeff looks through the camera lens. Of course, Hitchcock would later famously use voyeurism in ""Psycho"", but here, it is essentially part of the plot.Aside from camera angle, the characters are important. Jeff is the main character, but Lisa takes an unusual approach. She introduces herself as: Lisa (she turns on a lamp)...Carol (she turns on a second lamp)...Fremont (she turns on a third lamp). This not only makes her more imposing, but it figures in the question of who ""wears the pants"" in this apartment (which comes up again in the movie's final scene).I guess that ""Rear Window""'s overall point is that no one truly knows anyone else. But, as Hitchcock said in promoting the movie: ""If you do not experience a delicious chill while watching 'Rear Window', then pinch yourself. You are most probably dead."" I couldn't have said it better myself.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Voyeristic suspense,"I think this movie is a real masterpiece. Hitchcock's original style combined with a great cast deliver a beautiful outcome.First of all I really enjoy the atmosphere of the movie. It is a combination of suspense and voyeurism. It is achieved by keeping us inside Jeff's apartment all the time. We look with him out of the window and this is how we get to know his neighbors and collect information and clues about the potential murder that occurred. One is always a bit on the edge wondering what really has happened and one also develops an interest in other residents of the neighborhood.Hitchcock achieved it well by creating some outstanding residents. No, they are not the main characters and we don't even get to know them all that well, but they all have their little issues and quirks that grab our attention. Be it the great dancing of Miss Torso or our empathy for Miss Lonelyheart. He also went through doing a great casting. All those small characters are portrayed by great actors who can deliver a feeling and character without doing or saying much. Ross Bagdasarian who was the songwriter in this movie has a great resume in composing himself and his songs are still used now as soundtracks, over 40 years after his death.The main cast was also great. I was not a fan of James Stewart in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but he was absolutely great in Rear Window. It was his acting and reactions towards what he saw outside his window that lead us towards our own feelings and ideas in this movie. And also that moment when he realizes that Lisa is the right woman for him, he never says it but we can see it in his face that he changed his mind about her, now she doesn't seem so different than him and unable to go for an adventure.Grace Kelly also was shining in this movie. Didn't know her as an actress before, just as a well deserved beauty icon. But this movie showed her acting talent to me. We see her being the graceful woman with interest in fashion but we also get to see that spark in her when she is so eager to go out of the house to investigate the issue. She is very believable in it. Her character is also very great for a main female character in the 50's as she is the one who does the dangerous work since Jeff is in his cast. Sure, she doesn't want to give up her fashion magazines at the end, but why should she? She can have it all in her life, the adventure with her man, and her own personal interest.One should not forget about Stella. The supporting character that provides us some laughter in tense situations. Thelma Ritter was great in this part. Made me check her credits and she sure had an impressive career, many classics on that list.Last but not least, we have the guy who possibly has committed the murder. Raymond Burr did it perfectly. He has some magnetism that combined with the clues makes one think that he could do it. And yet there is some sadness and something else in him that makes one feel for him and hope that he is innocent.A movie where everything was done right. And a very well deserved classic. Makes me want to grab binoculars and start exploring the lives of my neighbors.But in our time everyone, wisely, is using blinds.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitchcock's Best,"A wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder.This plot is simple yet extraordinarily complex in its own way and incredibly effective. What comes out of it is one of the most influential films of all time, and arguably Hitchcock's best (though others, including ""Rope"", could claim that honor).James Stewart is an impressive lead, and this is likely the finest role for Grace Kelly in her relatively short Hollywood career (before getting swept off to Monaco). Raymond Burr? Very subtle, as he is among the bigger stars here in a surprisingly small part.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock classic,"This was my first Alfred Hitchcock movie, and I wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from this masterful director, but Rear Window generates such a tangible feeling of suspense you won't soon forget it. Plus, it's laden with symbolism--so much, in fact, that I won't go into detail here; many film review web sites offer extensive summaries of the movie. The apartment complex in which the movie is set entirely in seems so familiar, so very possible that when James Stewart suspects a neighbor of murder, you suddenly find yourself wondering, Well, what would one do?? All the so-called evidence he has is purely circumstancial: only what he witnesses in his neighbor's apartment through his window.  The best, most intense moments come near the end.  I will not reveal what exactly happens here but when one specific person looks up and realizes he's being watched, it's the creepiest moment I've seen on film.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Simple, and engaging.","Jeff (James Stewart) broke his leg taking photographs on a race track. Now he is stuck in his apartment with his leg in cast.

However, Tom doesn't believe a crime has been committed and believes the woman went away for a while.Lisa, who also was reluctant to believe Jeff at first, also becomes suspicious of the man and they decide to investigate themselves.

Why Leave the Door Unlocked?,"There are always forced ending climaxes in Hitchcock's films, such as the on-time rescues in North by Northwest and Psycho, and this film is no exception.In Rear Window, James Stewart has a cast on his leg, but that doesn't mean he cannot move at all. We see him standing up when Thelma Ritter comes to give him a massage. We can also assume that he takes care most of his meals and goes to the toilet by himself. But when the murderer finds out where he is and comes over to teach him a final lesson, Stewart just sits there listening to this guy's footsteps. There's certainly enough time for him to ""walk"" or crawl over and lock the door of his apartment.I do admire Hitchcock's cinematic ability to handle a story about a character who is confined to the wheelchair, but it seems that he never paid his attention to the logic of the plots too much.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superbly Suspenseful,"Rear Window is such a great movie because it manages to create suspense with ease, and manages to sustain that throughout the entire film. You only really see what Jeffries sees; and, of course, this guy must be feeling a little nervous seeing as though he thinks he knows about a murder. By making the viewers see it has he does, Hitchcock manages to make the viewer as nervous about the situation as Jeffries does.There isn't much plot here, instead, it's one linear storyline with little tidbits from the other people's lives. Each of these stories are brilliantly complete in and of themselves, from Ms. Torso's freewheeling to Ms. Lonelyheart's... lonely heart. Still, this movie is, completely and totally, about voyeurism in every way. Jeffries's profession is about taking pictures of other people's situation. Him and his girlfriend are worried that they just won't work as a married couple, because of their vast differences in lifestyle. The murder plot unfolds carefully, and slowly (like a puzzle slowly being solved), and the viewer manages to see only as much as Jeffries does, in effect turning each viewer into a voyeur. Jeffries' paranoia ends up consuming just about everyone else he knows, and it all leads to a very suspenseful climax that does not disappoint the rest of the movie.With Rear Window, Hitchcock manages to latch onto a subject that just about every person could be compelled with, and follows through with such precision and flair that is practically the norm for him. Absolutely one of the best movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
10/10,"Rear Window is one of the most famous movies ever done. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring James Stewart, Rear Window conveys a strong anxiety to the viewer from beginning to end. The acting performances are incredible, of the highest level, but what surprised me the most is the production of the film. It's awfully hard to shoot an entire film in one room and also build an intriguing story, full of mystery and stuffed with a lot of characters. All my respect to the way this movie was shot, the cinematography is truly gorgeous and the soundtrack is sublime and beautiful- the silence and the noise are perfectly balanced, the calm and the suspense are equally charming.The story itself is pretty basic, with no real twist along the way, but it is improved by the clever and profound dialogue between the characters- the real beauty of Rear Window is not in the crime mystery, but,I would say, in the daily conversations between Jeff and Lisa. It is a calm, flowing movie with a simple story to tell, sometimes too simple for its own good- the ending hits too normally and peacefully and the revelation you would want has not ever came.If you ask me, Rear Window is slightly overrated, but I truly understand why- it is an example for other directors that you don't need bombastic locations and places in order to make a good movie- just write a somewhat interesting story with good dialogue, and maybe add some twists here and there to keep the mystery alive.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"More than a nail-biter, a work of art...","There are two things about this film that make it my favorite of all the Hitchcock films I've seen:  #1, Grace Kelly's performance and #2, the level of art achieved by the story.Grace Kelly was certainly a great actress and a lovely lady, but for some reason this is the film I think of whenever I think of her.  I never wanted to be a princess, but as a kid I used to imagine reprising her role in this movie.More intellectually, the story is so fabulous because it varies the pace, builds and plays with the suspense, rather than trying to keep us on the edge of our seats every second.  Life plays in varied tempos.  Also, it is so realistic in depicting the guy in his room with a broken leg (been there, though thankfully by my day they'd invented the VCR).  Yet, within this realistic and believable situation, the ordinary man's rather understandable voyeurism works so well because it becomes a metaphor for our own inescapable solipsism.  We're all prisoners of our own little room (self), looking out on the world and trying to understand it and the other people in it.  We get glimpses of their lives through their windows, but that is all we can get.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of my favorite Hitchcock movies,"I adore this movie!  James Stewart and Grace Kelly are great as the main characters, Jeff and Lisa.  There are also fantastic performances by the supporting cast: Thelma Ritter as Stella, Wendell Corey as detective and friend of Jeff Tom Doyle, and Raymond Burr as the bad guy Lars Thorwald.My favorite part is the whole sequence when Jeff, Lisa, and Stella try to get Thorwald.  It begins with Lisa entering Thorwald's apartment, and reaches a climax when Thorwald gets home and discovers her.  He wrestles with her and Jeff gets panicky, but luckily he had called the police and they arrived before Thorwald could hurt Lisa.  The truly frightening part is when Lisa is wiggling her finger back and forth so Jeff could see Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.  Thorwald sees what she's doing, and looks up into Jeff's apartment, and right into the camera.The really climatic part comes when Jeff answers his phone, thinking that the caller is Doyle.  He blurts out a lot of information about Thorwald, but then stops suddenly.  He realizes that the person on the other end hasn't said anything, and then the person hangs up.  The look on Jeff's face says it all: he knows Thorwald is coming to kill him.  And since he's in a wheelchair, and now the only one in the apartment, there's nothing that can be done.  He can't even get up and lock the door.""Rear Window"" combines suspense with romance and comedy.  It's truly one entertaining movie!  Anyone who is a Hitchcock fan should see this movie.

A man recovering from a serious accident is left in his apartment while his neighbors go on living. This man is L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart), who is a photographer with quite an imagination. This Hitchcock flick has to do with Jeffries possibly seeing a murder by one of his neighbors.The set for this film was gigantic in the sense the studio was smaller that the set. The entire movie being shot in a studio Hitchcock did a great job at making it seem believable. Also, there was no score for this movie. Only background music was used as the score.How the characters did were pretty good in the sense most of them had no dialogue. The way it was filmed was to show the protagonist `spying' on his neighbors out of boredom. During the movie there is much talk on `spying' being morally right.Now this filmed started slow at first, but gradually picked up speed.

Look Through Any Window,"Alfred Hitchcock directed the first British ""talkie"" in 1929. Ten years later, producer David O Selznick lured him over to Hollywood. There, Hitchcock created the masterpieces ""Rebecca"", ""Lifeboat"" and ""Spellbound"", all of which were nominated for Academy Awards. However, there was no Oscar for the director himself. With ""Rear Window"" Alfred Hitchcock hoped to correct that.In the film, James Stewart plays an injured photographer, confined to a wheelchair in his Greenwich Village apartment. To pass the time, he spies on his neighbors from his backroom window. Innocent at first, but soon Stewart becomes convinced that a man in an apartment across the yard has murdered his own wife. Being immobile himself, James Stewart persuades his girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) to investigate.For the film, a gigantic indoor set was built at Paramount Studios. It was modelled after an apartment courtyard in New York City and consisted of 31 apartments. Eight of them were completely furnished and had electricity and running water.That the director wanted the future princess of Monaco in the role was no coincidence. On the contrary. Grace Kelly is a typical leading lady in a Hitchcock film. Just think of Ingrid Bergman in ""Spellbound"", Kim Novak in ""Vertigo"", Eva Marie Saint in ""North by Northwest"", Janet Leigh in ""Psycho"" and Tippi Hedren in ""The Birds"". They are blonde. They are icy. They are remote. And sooner or later, most Hitchcock women are going to be humiliated.Alfred Hitchcock was nominated for a best director's Oscar for ""Rear Window"". But as before, the voting members of the Academy chose to reward another filmmaker instead. And so it continued. Year after year. Although Alfred Hitchcock is widely regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time, he never received the coveted golden statuette.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good clean Hitchcock,"The great thing about ""Rear Window"" is how Hitchcock puts the viewer in the point of view of Jimmy Stewart's lead character L. B. Jeffries. It's a bit weird actually how you find yourself anticipating Jeffries' reactions because you're thinking the way he does as he scans his neighbors' apartments in an almost lurid act of voyeurism. What's problematic though, and what comes across as unrealistic today is how so many apartment dwellers can live without ever worrying that their activities ought to be concealed. Forget about the murderer for a minute and consider every other tenant featured in their mini-vignettes - Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, the Songwriter, the newlyweds, the doggy elevator couple. It seems to be a precarious way to live, like being in a glass enclosure or a cage in a zoo.That's why Jeffries' solution of Mrs. Thorwald's murder is just a little too pat. He's got all the twists and turns worked out in the face of conflicting evidence to the contrary, mostly supplied by his detective friend Doyle (Wendell Corey). Yet it's important to be in on the identity of the murderer to keep the tension building to a dramatic conclusion. Jeffries has ample support in building the case with the help of fiancée Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and his temporary caregiver Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella is the perfect character to inject needed comic relief as Hitchcock layers the film with increasing levels of mystery and suspense. In fact, she's got the best line in the movie - ""... just where do you suppose he cut her up?""One of the neat things I learned about the film is how Hitchcock got around Paramount's limited set to replicate a city apartment complex. The building used in the film was only two stories high, so to get the illusion of a much larger unit, Hitchcock got the studio to cut into the basement. Jimmy Stewart's apartment was really at ground level on the actual set, thereby creating the impression that he was spying on apartments above, below and across from his own.One of the other cool tricks used in the story revolved around the Songwriter, and how the music emanating from his apartment served as a sound track for those scenes. It's where the director appeared in one of his trademark cameo appearances. If you were paying attention, you also learned that the writer got the inspiration for his songs from the landlady once a month!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Feeding McCarthyism,"While the predictable plot, agonizingly slow pace, and excessive dialog weighed heavily against this so-called ""classic"", apparently Hitchcock was feeding the baseless flames of McCarthyism with this film. I bet a million housewives left the film thinking ""I bet I'm right about my neighbor..."" or ""as a good citizen, I should keep an eye on mine"". Blatantly, Hitchcock was glorifying voyeurism and exploiting contemporary fears.The only reason I can figure why this movie has such extremely high ratings is that people are (still) really afraid of what their neighbors might be up to (greatly renewed post-9/11), are proud voyeurs themselves, or are simply lobotomized.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
surely taken by surprise!,"I have just two words for this movie-BLOODY BRILLIANT! .to be honest all i knew about Hitchcock before watching 'Rear window' today was that he is the master of mysteries and thrillers though i never really watched any of his movies.after all this one was made 36 years before my birth and that is quite a long period as far as movies are concerned.i started watching this without any idea of director,cast or genre and only because i had no other movie to watch.as the movie started and the scenes only suggested a dull drama or sugar coated romance that i associate with old movies.it was only after 40 minutes or so that i got interested and from then on there was no looking back.by the time the movie finished i had skipped my lunch which i intended to have during the course of the movie.i couldn't find any faults in the script or logical loopholes.The cast was excellent.everyone played their part quite convincingly and background score was quite apt for this genre.and finally the cinematography-the problem with these kind of movies is that the movie is so good that u miss the technical excellence.the movie had to be portrayed through Jeffreys' window for most part and that can get quite boring but this surely wasn't dull.i read a lot of novels(all genre but mysteries are a favorite) and believe that novels are far more powerful medium compared to the big screen.the type of excitement i felt towards the climax was similar to what i felt while reading a novel and that speaks volumes of this masterpiece.one thing that this film surely did was change my opinion of old movies.after this i watched 'psycho'.i wasn't as impressed by it because many such movies have come on the same line.but i am sure 'psycho' started that genre of movies.next thing on my list is to watch all Hitchcock movies i can get hold of.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the few films to get a deserving 10!,"After seeing Rear Window, I have to say that it is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Sure, there was no twist at the end, but I still feel that Rear Window leaves a good thrill aspect on the viewer.What I think made Rear Window so good is the fact that it takes place in such a claustrophobic setting. Rear Window may very well be the most claustrophobic movie I have ever seen in my life, considering that it takes place all in one room. Hitch also did this with ""Dial M For Murder"" but I feel that he did an even better job here in Rear Window.I also like the interesting camera shots in the sense that all the important ones pointing out the window (the important shots) are done from the character's point of view. The characters themselves are very well developed and acted. The chemistry between James Stewert and Grace Kelly are amazing and unforgettable.The first 3 quarters of this movie plays out more like a murder mystery than a true suspense film, but the last quarter is extremely suspense driven. This is true with most Hitchcock films. The suspense in Rear Window comes from the danger that the main characters outside the window are in, with nothing that the other characters can do about it.Overall, Rear Window is a must see for every movie fan, and a must own for every Hitch fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Simply the best,"Pretentious film scholars may say Citizen Kane, hopeless romantics point to Casablanca and Gone With the Wind, IMDB voters love the Godfather, and Brittany Spears fans choose Titanic, but for my money this Hitchcock movie is the all time best American movie. It was the first movie by the master I ever saw, and 26 films later, it's still my favorite. Anybody who only knows Hitchcock for Psycho or the Birds, or Stewart for overbloated Capra fare, should definitely check it out.The basic story is one of voyeurism, and the first half hour has no real plot. But you'll find yourself engrossed in the lives of the people the wheelchair bound Stewart is peering at. This being a Hitchcock film, of course, there has to be a murder, too, and that's when the real fun begins. To reveal anything else would be criminal. The performances all around are astounding, particularly Thelma Ritter as Stewart's nurse. Grace Kelly is mesmerizing as always. But this is Stewart's movie. I am confounded by those who claim Vertigo to be his better performance. He was so disturbed and unlikeable in that film. This is *the* masterpiece of his, Hitchcock's, and all of film history.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Alfred Hitchcock wasn't called the Master of Suspense for nothing,"Alfred Hitchcock's theory about suspense was that there was no horror in the final moments of something terrible, only the ominous anticipation of it. And his impressive collection of masterpieces and the many mimickers—those successful and unsuccessful—who imitated his techniques prove that he was correct. Alfred Hitchcock was known as the Master of Suspense. ""Rear Window"" is one of the reasons why.Hitchcock's frequent leading man, Academy Award-winner James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries: a cynical wheelchair-bound photographer who finds himself with yet another week of lying beside his apartment window with nothing to do but look out at his neighbors both down below and across the street. He becomes particularly interested in a salesman (Raymond Burr) who lives in the apartment building parallel to his' with a bedridden wife. And he as well as his fiancée (Grace Kelly) become particularly interested when they notice that the salesman is making odd trips at night, hiding sharp tools such as saws, and the sick wife has conveniently disappeared.Alfred Hitchcock seemed to have a fascination with the crime of murder. His most famous films which include ""Rope"" (1948), ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""Dial M for Murder"" (1954), and ""Psycho"" (1960) all relate to it in one way or another. Thus ""Rear Window"" was the quintessential vehicle for his vision of a two-hour journey of merciless suspense.""Rear Window"" is, believe it or not, foundationally a very simple film. Most of the movie is shot from and takes place in James Stewart's apartment overlooking the neighborhood. Everything that happens occurs within a bird's-eye view of his window. Another one of Hitchcock's theory was ""less is more"" and at least in the case of this 1954 masterpiece, he was right again. Even with such a simple scenario and concept, Hitchcock does not fail. It's amazing how intense this movie becomes especially within the last hour, where Hitchcock utilized all of his horror theories, techniques, ideas, and formulas. Like he did in ""Vertigo"" (1958) four years later, Hitchcock used his leading actor James Stewart as an everyman personification so that the audiences identified with him, saw what he saw, thought what he thought, and thus we felt suspicious when he was suspicious, curious when he was curious, and scared when he was scared. And nearing the end of the film, Stewart is sweating and gripping furiously into the armrests of his chair. Guess what? So are we.But on top of this, Hitchcock also installed what he tried to do with every film. He tried to put in a story and characters into his films. He always liked to show audiences a familiar setting (in this case, New York), relatable characters, and then shock us with relentless and unexpected malice. James Stewart does not merely portray the peeping tom looking out the window, but a human being with problems beyond having a cast-bound leg.To be frank, Stewart's character isn't that likable of a man. He's cynical, pessimistic, inexplicably rude, sarcastic, and vindictive. And the fact that he's stuck in a wheelchair in a sweltering apartment room for six (going on seven) weeks does not help his personality any. And yet we identify with him for we do see his more tender sides without him being transformed into an emotional mope like many too-be-changed characters today seem to. He's a three-dimensional human being, not a stick figure, played magnificently by the man whose continuously considered one of the greatest actors who ever lived alongside names such as Humphrey Bogart and Laurence Olivier.It is a real shame that Grace Kelly only made a few films in her short, but brilliant career, for she always seemed to end up with films of the highest caliber and gave such mesmerizing performances. She's great here as well and we also identify with her and see her problems, but these do not get fully in the way of the murder mystery that soon overtakes the full focus of the story.Is this Alfred Hitchcock's best film? Some like to think so. I personally would actually have to go with ""Vertigo"" (1958) because it evoked more thoughts, emotions, and sympathy from the deepest regions of my soul, but ""Rear Window"" is most certainly not far behind. Hardly a day goes by where I don't look back on the first time I started watching it late at night and found myself gripping my bed sheets and my chest hurting from a hammering heart two hours later.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Classic,"Wheelchairbound Photographer James Stewart spends all day and night spying on neighbours from his ""Rear Window"". Believing he has witnessed a murder in apartment opposite he tries in vain to alert others to the vile crime.This film was way ahead of its time and is even more amazing in the way it tackles the relationship between men and women in a time when in thrillers men where the boss and women screamed. were kissed and did little else.The mere mention of sex was not an option in hollywood movies. The way Kelly invites herself to stay at the apartment and is the more active in suggesting an obvious sexual relationship must have been shocking for the time.In a way, the role of manly male and feeble frightend female are reversed. James Stewart although desperate to maintain his credibility as a man, is a mere onlooker on the microcosm of society that is represented by the closed block of apartments that he inhabits. By contrast, his girlfriend Grace Kelly is fearless and inclined to action once she begins to believe also, that a crime has been committed.The callous way that Stewart rebuffs the obvious sexual advances of Kelly adds to the impression that deep within Stewarts psyche he believes that without the ability to control events he is not a man.The photography is superb, from the way that you see the lives of the other inhabitants from a distance through their ever open windows, (haven't these people heard of curtains?) but in silence, apart from the ever present music of the composer, trying to finish his film score.Raymond Burr as the suspected villian is superbly sinister,  but James Stewart really showed what a magnificent actor he was by shedding the tough guy image and taking on a role that took guts in real life. For me the most frightening part of the movie  is when Kelly is discovered in the apartment opposite and Stewart is powerless to help her. This reminds me of all those nightmares when you are powerless to move and avert disaster.Grace Kelly is possibly the most gorgeous woman ever, and has that innocent yet woman of the world quality that most guys would gladly jump over cliffs for.A Classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hitchcock used to say he was into spectator direction rather than actors direction. Think of it. Beside notice how third sequence tells half the story. Greatest ""commedia-del-arte"" ever where spectator would love to tell character to beware while character strolls unaware of danger.Kelly offers great acting where she disbelieves fiancé James Stewart during the first half, realizes he's right during a few frames and agrees he's right during the rest of the film.1954 was a great year for masterpieces.

Clearly still a good film but rather drawn out and theatrical without, if truth be told, very much going on. James Stewart is fine but I've never been a fan of Grace Kelly.

Hitchcock masterpiece,"There's something so terrible and tragic about Jeff Jeffries, Jimmy Stewart's character. Confined to a wheelchair at home with his leg in a cast, the photographer seems to be incredibly lonely, a photographer who seems to have lost some of his humane instincts by not allowing mostly decent people to have their privacy. We see through his eyes what he believes to be a murder, but what we don't see is all the rest of what happened as his suspicions all come exclusively from his point of view.This was one of the best Hitchcock films ever made, and is second only to ""North by Northwest"". The Hitch managed to assemble top talent for his movies, beginning with ""Rope"" for Jimmy. ""Rear Window"" was Jimmy's personal favourite of the Hitchcock movies. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Freemont, the rich, beautiful girlfriend does not have the most essential part but her presence does manage to unearth Jeff's solitude. Notable performances from the supporting cast include Thelma Ritter, as Stella the maid and Raymond Burr, as Lars, suspected murderer.Certainly the movie has in tow all the great elements on its side. The best of scripts, the best of talent from the acting stable and a mastermind director of suspense. Another of the more interesting elements is the musical score, which is provided courtesy of the songwriting man as he attempts to unleash his musical masterpiece.Does this provide an excuse for prying into the lives of other people, by unearthing the curious inner person of us all? I hardly think so, but it brings a very real insight to the lives of others, particularly shown through the character of Miss Lonely Hearts, that there are a lot of lonely people out there. It also shows that our neighbours can be doing a lot of interesting things if we are watching at the right moment.After the whole murder business which pulled Jeff further and further into the mystery to the point of no escape, I think I will stop spying on my brother and his girlfriend. It after all, was my new year's resolution before I turn fifteen. But just by writing the words to this review makes me want to watch the movie again.Hitchcock created an intriguing treat which cannot be spoiled by repeated viewings of his 50s thriller classic.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Buy some binoculars before buying this movie.,"I saw this movie in my teens and I dare say I owe it a re-watch but I remember it as a slow and flaccid affair that doesn't do much with its theme of voyeurism.Instead it is just a straightforward thriller that could have been a neat twilight zone episode or certainly a good 20 minute film but is stretched way too thin with a romantic subplot just shoehorned in.I can't help but think he could have just ignored everything and been fine. The movie doesn't even explore the nature of his obsession, you just have to role with how he puts himself in peril even though he has a broken leg. I guess he's trying to be a conscientious citizen but he's not going to bring the wife back to life and it isn't worth putting an uxorcidal husband to justice if another person has to get killed in the process.People call it a classic and i don't like to think I'm unable to appreciate those but this is another one of those Hitchcocks where you get a lot of showy cinematography around a tepid, over-long story.It also has no atmosphere, the tone being more like a sitcom, making the moments of tenseness seem jarring rather than creepy.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sheer brilliance of film making,"I believe most Hitchcock buffs consider ""Rear Window"" the director's best accomplishment. And why not, although ""Vertigo"" is a serious competitor. ""North by Northwest"" is my favourite Hitchcock film, but I think it's ""Rear Window"" that proves his mastery perhaps most perfectly.Aside from being a highly enjoyable murder mystery, ""Rear Window"" plays like a lesson on film making. Even though when you're familiar with the plot, you can still watch the movie over and over again, admiring how brilliantly it's put together. Elaborate camera work compounded with flawless editing - simply marvellous.John Michael Hayes' script - containing interesting, lively dialogue - is downright delicious; one of the best Hitchcock worked with, not to mention the excellent cast. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are fantastic, and Thelma Ritter adds plenty of comic relief.In a way I can understand some people who say ""Rear Window"" is boring. Occasionally it may seem a bit sluggish, because nowadays' audiences are used to much quicker pacing. But when Stewart makes Kelly to believe his murder theory, the story gains momentum at a stroke. From there forward, it's topnotch thrilling all the way to the tingling climax.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A classic, but also an old favourite ...","Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his apartment for some weeks.  Lacking anything more interesting to do, spends his time watching all the people in the apartments across the courtyard, one of whom, he soon thinks, has murdered his wife ... and so on.  Everyone knows everything about this film already.  Everyone knows that every single shot is taken FROM Jeff's apartment.  There are no gratuitous close-ups of the people on the other side - except, of course, when Jeff gets out his telephoto lens.  So there's never any doubt what we're meant to know, or what we're meant to think that Jeff knows, or anything of that kind.It's soon obvious to most people that the open windows across the courtyard look exactly like movie screens.  Many consider this to be a comment on the voyeuristic nature of cinema.  Hitchcock himself thought as much (perhaps prompted by François Truffaut).  Well, it isn't.  It's clear that Jeff is looking at the lives of the people in other apartments AS IF they're movies, screened for his amusement; but the film is really saying, `Jeff is acting as if he's watching a movie'; rather than, `We, in watching the movie, are acting as if we're staring through other people's windows.'  That's if you MUST read anything at all into Hitchcock's neat visual idea.There's also an uneasy love story taking place between Jeff and a much richer woman, Lisa (Grace Kelly).  Personally, if I were Jeff, I'd forget about Lisa Whatsername and concentrate on Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy), somewhere to the upper right.  But even though the love story is beside the point the film wouldn't be nearly so good without it.  Jeff needs someone close enough to be an ally when the story requires it, not so close as to simply be on the same quest he's on.This is Hitchcock's most purely enjoyable film since he left Britain - which is to say, since `The Lady Vanishes' (1938).  It still works even when you know it all by heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the greatest movies ever made,"If ever you needed an example of cinema as an art form, this is it. Amazingly brilliant.The plot and dialogue are great on their own, but, as always, it is Hitchcock's direction that turns this into a masterpiece. He pulls out every trick here - the clever setting of a man being able to view other people's everyday lives from afar, the camera angles, the scene setting, the character building, the growing suspense. In the end the plot doesn't matter, you just want to soak in all of Hitchcock's cinematic genius.Another key factor to the brilliance of this movie is the Jimmy Stewart- Grace Kelly interaction. They are both superb in their roles, but together they are even better.For me, this is Hitchcock's magnum opus. Yes, even better than Psycho, which to some may be a sacrilegious thing to say, but it shows how good it is.Surely one of the greatest movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
one of the best movies ever made,"I think that this is Hitchcock's best, although I won't argue with someone picking something else. It's too bad that they keep yanking the thing from circulation, since I believe that there is enough ongoing interest that they'd do just as well selling it all the time.One thing to notice in this movie is how skilled everyone is. Even Grace Kelly, who wasn't that experienced an actress does a more than creditable job (although she does flub the line about ""ghouls"" in the middle of the film a little), but Stewart and Ritter are just amazing. I think that having a career in which you make 100 movies, something that apparently will never happen again, makes talented actors and directors into something more. The movie is a straight suspense picture, and the fact that it's about something more profound than just whodunnit adds to the tension, since you care about the characters.

All human life is here,"Hitch's finest: containing more humanity than his earlier films, but with the same precision to detail and technical excellence that first made his name.That said, what really separates this from all his other work, and that of the other great directors, is that the lead character is as impotent to alter his view-point, or act on what he sees, as is the viewer. Stewart becomes a de facto member of the audience , and all this while not only retaining all his phlegmatic charm and charisma, but also adding a hitherto rarely seen hard edge.Kelly is given a rare chance to portray a character other than a porcelain doll, and in doing so elicits the audience sympathy. Perhaps the most interesting part of the picture though, are the voyeuristic overtones of not only Stewart, but also the audience observing snippets of the life across the court-yard. Is he justified in keeping himself entertained, in his injury imposed monotony, by intruding on his neighbours private lives? Are we?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Hitchcock masterpiece,"It's as if Hitchcock got bored making superb suspense movies that included grand sets and special effects, and decided that he would put shackles on himself.

Her radiance and allure are stunning. She is all-at-once strong and self-confident, caring and sensitive, provocative yet demure. In a word, she is breathtaking.Jimmy Stewart is brilliant in this very difficult role. His helpless frustration at his condition as the film nears it's climax is suspense at it's finest. I can feel my skin crawl with anxiety as the plot is revealed, and you can watch the same thing happen to Jeffries.Finally, this is another AH movie that it pays to see over and over. The details you notice will continue to appear anew even after the fifth, seventh, tenth time you see it.

a great creative movie,"Rear Window is another genius film made by Alfred Hitchcock.  The depth and directing of this movie is amazing. There is no other movie like it and maybe never will be.Rear Window is about a wheelchair bound man named L.B. Jeff Jeffries who is stuck in his apartment due to a broken leg and ends up spying on his neighbors through his apartment window. He notices something fishy while watching his neighbor and the story becomes suspenseful.Though the movie starts out slow, which is the only negative thing to mention, it definitely becomes more exciting as the movie goes on. The whole film takes place in one area, L.B. Jeff Jeffries's apartment and the view he has of the outside and of his neighbors apartments through their windows. It was a huge risk making this film using only that area for all of the scenes. Alfred Hitchcock is most likely the only director who could pull off making a film like this.  The camera angles and the symbolism of each of the apartment floors representing something different is inventive.  Each of his skills keep the movie interesting.The acting was well-done, but it wasn't what made the movie. Jimmy Stewart who played L.B. Jeff Jefferies did well portraying his character like in most of the movies he is in. The glamorous Grace Kelly who played Lisa Fremont (Jeff Jefferies girlfriend) did a great job playing a sophisticated character.  Though the acting wasn't amazing, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly's chemistry on screen was enjoyable.Although this movie wasn't as frightening as Hitchcock's other film Psycho, it is more creative.

One of the most tense thrillers.,"It are often the most simplistic movies that are the most tense ones. ""Rear Window"" is a movie with a very simple concept and the entire movie is set at just one location but yet it manages to become a great and tense, mystery/thriller.This movie is voyeurism at its very best. In essence everybody is voyeuristic. People love to watch other people. Just like at all the reality shows we have got now days. Those shows exist because there is a popular demand for it, not because they are all so brilliant to watch. But everybody is just interested to look in other person's lives and when something strange or unusual occurs across the street you'll all be watching through the window to see what is going on or what happened. This movie seems to understand this human nature and it exploits it with a great story about a man who suspects his neighbor from across the street to have killed his wife.It's a very simple concept that is being executed to the max. We as the viewers also don't know what has happened, since we, as well as the movie its main character, are stuck in this one room, that looks out on the rear side of a building-block. It makes the movie its mystery work out well, since we only get provided with little pieces of information all the time. It's pretty much a big mystery what had happened all across the street and if the neighbor is indeed guilty of killing his wife, or has she just simply left town, as he claims, for the fresh air to cure her illness. The movie can go either way with its story all of the time, which really adds to the overall tension and mystery of the movie. Hitchcock really manages to build up the mystery and tension well with this one.This movie is also visually and technically a great accomplishment. Hitchcock has always been a director that tries on some new experimental stuff for its movies and found new ways to tell a story. This movie is entirely set at one location, that got build inside of a studio. A real accomplishment to build such a massive apartment complex inside a studio and work with this just one view for the entire movie.The movie has Hitchcock regulars James Stewart and Grace Kelly as the main leads. It's especially a big and important role for Stewart, since he really has to carry this movie, as a temporarily wheelchair bounded photographer who has nothing else to do but to spy on his neighbors. Also Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr play some excellent roles.One of the most unique and genuinely tense made thrillers from the master of suspense.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The short answer is that I know a lot of people, some of them are even friends, who have, in my opinion, fallen for the hype, because by now the myth is self-perpetuating, and keep pressing dvds on me in the hope of converting me. They're something akin to those well-meaning folks who can't see an unattached person without attempted matchmaking. So far I'm holding out. Whilst I acknowledge a competent filmmaker that's as far as it goes. On the other hand any director would have his work cut out to coax even a mediocre, let alone a bad performance out of Jimmy Stewart just as any director would have his work cut out to elicit anything resembling acting from Grace Kelly. So now we have a stand-off. On the plus side we have Thelma Ritter, who enhances anything she appears in but then he spoils it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A stylish mystery by the master of suspense that only gets better with age,"Alfred Hitchcock had the ability to take an ordinary citizen, project a possible mishap, or even worse, a capital crime on the person, and then completely involve the viewing audience in living through the solving of the matter.  That talent is superbly used in the 1954 classic, ""Rear Window"", which starred James Stewart and Grace Kelly.The story is a very simple one; James Stewart portrays a photographer who lives in a New York apartment building with a rear window that faces other apartments in the complex.  Due to an accident he sustained while on assignment, he is recuperating from a broken leg, and that has him confined to a wheelchair.  Still, he is somewhat mobile, and his mind and ability to sense things, is very active.  Grace Kelly, in a stunning portrayal of his girlfriend, adds a screen beauty that very few were able to duplicate. Stewart and Kelly both begin to suspect that one of the neighbors in the complex has committed a murder, and they face the tough task of convincing the local police of such an happening.  Wendell Corey handles this role in good fashion.  Eventually, Hitchcock neatly wraps all the elements together in his usual manner, and the viewing audience sees the Suspense Master unfold a truly classical masterpiece. Well worth the chance to view.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eh kinda okey,I thought the characters and the actors were Jeff was good at spying one people I thought the story he was with broken leg that he got in accident and he was good at spying at people and the settings were actually good but when he fell throw the window not really good and what I liked about the movie was the acting was really good i liked it what I liked at least about the movie was I actually I don't know cus I think they were all good and I think I would recommend to people who watch thrillers or slow or something.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not so much!,"Um, Where do I start?  There wasn't enough evidence to accuse the neighbor of murder...there was way too much dialogue....the plot line was a little shaky and very boring.  I would have to say that this movie is a huge disappointment for me.  Could there be any more talking, please? (note the sarcasm) A movie is supposed to depict story through imagery and finite dialogue, I seriously fell asleep after the droning on and on and on and....on.  After the first 30-45 minutes, I couldn't stay awake, I actually had to fast forward through a large portion in the middle.  And where does Jeffries get off suspecting his neighbor?  That was not believable in the least.  Uh, if I were to spy on any of my neighbors, which is a little, no a lot, weird in the first place, I wouldn't be so bold as to jump to the conclusion that he murdered his wife based on his going in and out of his apartment in the rain at odd hours and carrying a saw and knife around the house.  I got the impression that the neighbor's wife was so ill that she was taken to her family's home out of town via the train due to the husband's incapability of caring for her any longer.  In other words, he moved her home to mom and dad because he couldn't take on the responsibility anymore.  And if you are as ill as she seemed to be, why would you need your purse or jewelry of all things?  Not going anywhere anyway.  I didn't get that the neighbor was a killer or a threat.  I understand that Jeffries thought so, but when anyone is that bored and lonely with nothing else to do but sit near a window and neighbor watch, your imagination gets the best of you.  Needless to say when it was all said and done, I was very displeased, but had a good nap.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Epitome of Hitchcock,"Alfred Hitchcock reached the epitome of his career with a clever little thriller named ""Rear Window"" (1954), about a temporarily disabled photographer (played by James Stewart) who is convinced he saw one of his apartment neighbors commit a murder. I shall not reveal anything else; you really should see this one for yourself.I've been trying to come up with a list of the ten greatest Hitchcock films, but I haven't been happy with one yet. For sure, though, I can tell you my numbers one, two, three, four, and ten. ""Rear Window"" is his best, his epitome; ""Vertigo"" is his second; ""Psycho"" is his third and most purely entertaining work; ""Rebecca"" is his fourth best picture; and I'm pretty sure my ten spot is going to remain with ""Rope,"" Hitchcock's great experimental, ten minute shots film.

"stunning,suspenseful, and full of mystery","Not your typical Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Or Is it? People who have not seen many Hitchcock Movies, don't know, that  he does more than horror movies, but he does mysteries too. 	Alfred Hitchcock does a careful job at selecting the perfect cast for this movie. James Stewart as L.B. Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Freemont. He especially does a great job of casting Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald. Raymond was in his thirties when this movie was made, but they made him look twenty five years older. Throughout this movie, Jeffries is stuck in his apartment with a broken leg. He is not left alone though. Stella (Thelma Ritter) comes in every day in the morning to take care of him, and Lisa (Grace Kelly) visits him at night. Being stuck in his apartment all day has him bored to death. He has nothing better to do than to look out the rear window at others, either walking around, or across the court yard. Jeffries has a suspicion that Lars Thorwald (across the courtyard) has murdered his wife. Both Stella and Lisa thought he was just going nuts from being cooped up so long in that apartment. But they started to believe him.There are a few differences in this movie compared to psycho. This movie is in color, not black and white. It is a mystery, not a horror film. The back ground music in this movie is either a radio, somebody singing or playing a musical instrument. Not Dissonant string arrangements.It doesn't matter what anyone says, this is without a doubt one of his best movies. If you don't like horror movies, but you are interested in Hitchcock, then you should rent this movie. Even though this is not a horror movie, Alfred Hitchcock still keeps his word at holding all of us in suspense.As I watched the movie, I was literally riveted to my seat. At the beginning, I was inclined to feel the same way as Lisa and Stella. It was apparent that Jeffries had become too involved with the lives of his neighbors and it was this involvement which initially turned Lisa and Stella off. However, as they became concerned about his interest in the neighbors, they started noticing that Lars Thorwald's wife was no longer around. This movie is filled with suspense. I found myself becoming interested in the lives of Jeffries neighbors even though I knew they were just fictional characters. Just as I was drawn in to their lives, I found myself following Thorwald's actions. When Thorwald realized he was being watched and it became apparent that he was going to come after Jeffries, I found myself becoming anxious because I knew that Jeffries was alone and because of his injury, he could not escape Thorwald. Did Thorwald Murder his wife? Find out by watching this suspenseful thriller!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitchcock's better movies,"Rear Window unfolds brilliantly and somehow manages to maintain its staying power after multiple subsequent viewings even though you already know what's going to happen.

Call it female intuitionRear Window,"After seeing Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window for the second time, I am even more convinced that the broo-haha surrounding Disturbia and its ripping it off was uncalled for. Besides the premise of a person confined to their window, seeing what they think is a murder, the two could not be anymore different. This film is one that will never age, whether it story, acting, or sheer inventiveness in its execution. Only Hitchcock could build the suspense as high as he does for almost two hours never leaving one room the entire time. Our hero is in a full leg cast and a prisoner to his room and window. Besides that interior, everything else we see is from his vantage point across to the rest of the apartment complex and a sliver of space opening to the street beyond. A clinic or choreography and showing us only what we need to know, Rear Window leaves you guessing right up until the final scene, unaware of what the whole truth to the situation is.Technically, the film has no flaws. Its utilization of a pivoting camera that pans left to right out L.B. Jefferies apartment is one-of-a-kind. With only the zooms from his camera lens and binoculars, we are allowed to see everything he does, letting us as the audience come to our own conclusions as well as become a part of his. This is a slow burn of a story, revealing each new discovery as though the layers of an onion peeled away. The sheer amount of rehearsals must have been staggering. There are plenty of long takes that go from window to window, catching the precise moment of activity we need in order to continue the story. Each actor had to be able to hit their mark at the exact moment necessary; timed to perfection. It is a joy to think about the work that went into the film every time we are shown characters moving from room to room, stopping at each window for our benefit, yet never feeling unnatural. Full credit goes to the cinematographer for orchestrating it all.The premise and craft are not the only things going for it. Acting-wise, there is not one misstep. James Stewart truly was the greatest actor of his generation. His delivery is uncanny and he can go from serious drama to light comedy without a blink. There is a lot of heavy emotional tension between him and his girlfriend that is treated with the same amount of care every other plot thread is. His relationship with Lisa Fremont, the gorgeous Grace Kelly, is mirrored in that of the quarrels and love trysts happening all around him. Without the murder mystery and the peeping into the lives of other couples, they may end up breaking up forever. His middle-class upbringing and photojournalist lifestyle just doesn't match well with her patrician ways and necessity of wearing a dress only once to keep appearances up for her job. The two could not be anymore different except for the fact they are madly in love with the other.Kelly is not just a pretty face either. Her performance is realistic at all times, keeping up with Stewart's sarcastic wit and playing the girlfriend being spurned all while slowly becoming engrossed in the story of the Thorwalds across the way. She becomes a photojournalist herself in many ways, looking through the camera and coming to conclusions for what the story may entail. In opposition to this, Stewart morphs into that which he thinks can never change in his love, her ability to stay on the fringe while others do the hard labor. Many times towards the end, he is the one left to watch others risk their safety for his manifested theories. He himself is the helpless being unable to go into the trenches, but instead prepare everything for the others to carry out. Whether Thorwald killed his wife or she has taken a train to visit family, the hold the mystery has on them finally shows the two what the other goes through and their respect for the other blossoms to become as strong as their love.My favorite aspect of the complete achievement, however, is the levity infused at all times. Sure the subject matter is very seriousI wouldn't be surprised if it was at first created to be a commentary on the Red Scare and worrying about what your neighbors could be up tobut at every turn we get witty banter helping to alleviate the tension and give us viewers a breather. Stewart and Kelly are quite the team and they perform the words of John Michael Hayes' script with ease. The timing is superb and many of the best lines are mixed into the dramatic dialogue always breaking up the suspense. We aren't talking gags and jokes, but instead puns and sly shots taken as a result of the conversations at hand. This is one smart script and I find myself even more interested in seeing The Man Who Knew Too Muchthe second version Hitchcock directedto see how well the team does, joined together again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent, much better than 90% of the films made today","One of the best films by Hitchcock. While I did not love Vertigo and The Birds, this one was exceptional: in contrast to other old films (I define a film as old when it was made before 1977 (Star Wars), since films before that date were slow and ""boring"" while films made after that date tend to be faster and more visceral), it is a quite driving film with a well constructed plot and the director handles very well the overall tension and payoff. It is also more light-handed than later films by the director, such as the quite scary Psycho.But I found it to be hugely entertaining and I am well prepared to see it again, its much better than 90% of the films made today.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Far, far more than a ""Murder Mystery""","Look to one of the other nearly 400 IMDB reviews for a detailed description of this movie about an injured photographer with a broken leg, who observes many of his neighbors in their apartments from his rear window. He comes to believe that Perry Mason (or at least Raymond Burr) killed his invalid wife, without having seen any physical attack, nor has he seen any signs of a body.He enlists his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and later detective friend (old army buddy) Wendell Corey to help him find evidence to prove what he believes happened.It is interesting to read reviews of people who hated this movie, some saying if they left out all the unimportant dialogue, this could have been a 15-30 minute show. I believe these folks are missing the whole point of the film. They were looking for a B-movie, amateur detective story with no character development at all, no plot whatsoever beyond that of there being a murder and following clues to solve it.Hitchcock was offering us a look at the lives of several people, from the songwriter to the newlyweds to Miss Lonely Hearts to Miss Torso, as well as the two leads, showing how they can love each other even though they seem to have nothing else in common in terms of where they want to live and what kind of lives they want to lead. It wasn't just a movie where someone sees a crime and winds up chasing a suspect all over town, or all over the country.Jeff and Lisa talked about the neighbors and their lives, and were concerned-such as when he called the police when it appeared one was on the verge of suicide. And we even saw that something good happened to that person and suicide was no longer a question.I believe if you go into this movie with the thought that only part of it is about the possibility of a murder and the rest is about the lives of various people-with sorrow and happiness-you will like it far more than if you think it to be only a ""murder mystery.""This film is also criticized by people saying they couldn't believe all these people left their back window blinds pulled up so much. They wonder how come none of them were looking in at Jeff? Well, our star had only taken to looking at his neighbors when he was forced to spend 6 weeks in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg. Perhaps the neighbors had lives busy enough that they didn't care to look in at their neighbors anymore than he did before he broke his leg.The setting was a roasting hot summer and in 1954 very few folks had air conditioning in their homes. It was quite believable that these folks kept their rear windows open and blinds up to let in as much cool air as possible. In the same way they didn't spend their time looking in other people's windows, they didn't expect others to waste their time looking in theirs. Of course, some blinds were pulled down at various times including the suspected murderer during the time when Jeff thought he was doing something with his wife's body. As a kid, we certainly didn't pull our curtains or shut the windows when we wanted the house to be cooler. I know I pulled my front window curtains when undressing, but otherwise wanted the air to circulate.There were many tense moments, and most, not all, of the actions were logical--much more so than most of the IMDB amateur critics' complaints about this film. I think it is a film that is unique in the way the whole thing, while it doesn't take place IN Jeff's apartment, is either there or seen from his apartment. So many of the scenes and just the picture of this massive 98-foot wide, 185-foot long set stick in your mind long after you see this filmIts popularity, with many other shows doing some sort of version of it, is testimony to what a memorable movie it is. Two of the best I've seen are episodes of Get Smart and the British comedy series The Detectives. I don't hesitate in scoring this one a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hitchcock's best, bar none","""Rear Window"" is, as ""Rope"" was, a study of setting a story in a confined place. ""Rope is notable for the smallness of its set; one studio apartment, rarely leaving the main living, and edited in such a way as to appear as one continuous take. ""Rear Window"" is famous for just the opposite; it had a giant set, occupying he biggest studio on the lot, with and extra level excavated to provide a life-sized, four-story set. Hitchcock also uses many more cuts, using the shot-reaction-shot technique with L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) as he uses cameras and binoculars to observe the goings on outside the rear widow of his apartment.The main theme of ""Rear Window is privacy  how far those standards extend, and what people do when they think they are secure in the privacy of their own home. Jeffries, a magazine photographer trapped in his apartment with a broken leg, turns to the view out his window to while away the hours until his cast comes off. His only contact with the outside world arrives in the form of his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and female friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), a rich socialite who has a romantic interest in Jeffries (who seems to abandon his photographer skills as an observer when it comes to her).Hitchcock played with audiences by having them play the role of voyeur along with Jeffries  he knew that human nature compels us to keep staring, even when polite society tells us to look away and mind our own business. By capturing our interest with a variety of characters and a portion of their lives  Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, etc.  Hitchcock creates an interesting character study as well as his usual thriller. We are only allowed to see what Jeffries sees, bits and pieces presented out of context, and we are left to make our own theories about what these bits mean in the overall lives of these characters.The main focus of the movie is Jeffries suspicion of Lars Thorwald, who occupies a second-story apartment across from Jeffries'. He notices Thorwald's strained relationship with his wife, then her sudden disappearance. A number of events that could be related follows. As he pries more and more into Thorvald's life, he gets closer and closer to the man himself; climaxing in Lisa's entry into Thorwald's home to search for clues, and the mano-a-mano confrontation between the Jeffries and Thorwald at the film's end.By the movie's end, resolution has been achieved for most of the characters in the film; the truth about Thorwald is discovered, Miss Torso's husband arrives back from war, the couple that sleeps outside is training a new puppy, Miss Lonelyhearts and the musician with the studio apartment have linked up romantically. Even pessimistic Jeffries, bound yet again in his apartment with two broken legs, has found resolution, finally accepting Lisa as an equal. As the movie ends, the shutters on the window are drawn  he doesn't need them anymore.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Hitchcock's masterpiece,"""Intelligence. Nothing has caused the human race so much trouble as intelligence.""Rear Window was my first Hitchcock film, and what a lasting impression it has had on me ever since. I remember watching scenes for it in a film course I was taking in college and I enjoyed it so much that I immediately decided to see it in its entirety. Alfred Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors ever since. It helps that suspense is one of my favorite genres so leave it to the master to deliver plenty of thrills in all his films. In Rear Window the suspense was elevated to its highest potential and what a fun experience it was. The first thing that stuck out for me in this film was the voyeuristic nature that Hitchcock is exploring through the main character of the movie, played magnificently by James Stewart. Just like his character I remember spending some summers in the balcony of my apartment looking at the passing by neighbors in order to fight my boredom. In Rear Window I too felt I was alongside Stewart's Jeff obsessing over the possibility that a horrendous crime had been committed. We also suffer with Jeff when he sends his beloved Lisa (played by the gorgeous Grace Kelly) to investigate the suspect's apartment while we see that he is arriving, and just like Jeff there is nothing we can do about it other than hope she manages to hide before she's caught. This film is so well made that it continues to thrill today without having to rely on impressive visual effects. There is a reason why Alfred Hitchcock is considered the Master of Suspense, and this is perhaps the greatest proof for that claim. I can't think of another film that's as involving as Rear Window is with its audience. We become participants in Hitchcock's latest experimentation with voyeurism and that is its major appeal.""We have become a race of Peeping Toms.""http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A great movie that sadly, the modern generation will not see.","First off, hats off to Alfred Hitchcock, he's one of the greatest directors ever. This is certainly one of his masterpieces.Now for the movie review. This is what a thriller mystery should be like, I look at all of these modern films and with most of them you just don't get that feeling that movies like this give you, the real thrill.Hitchcock did a great job of not letting the audience in on what was happening and giving a genuine first person view. If you don't know what I am talking about, just look at most of the modern thrillers/horrors. Most of those movies will give little hints as to when a scary part is coming or when the movie is about to climax. As a fan of the cinema, I do not like that. I like to be surprised and this movie did just that. You will not have any more knowledge than the lead protagonist does during the course of the movie. This is important for the development of the mystery.The setting is quite simple, it's an apartment building. This is perfect, as the main character is in a wheelchair and cannot leave. Therefor the plot has to develop while being in the apartment building. Most of the movie takes place looking out a window. The main character observes his neighbors actions, and well, I'll leave it at that so I don't spoil it for you.The acting is superb, as expected from a Hitchcock movie. There are not many actors, well, not that many that actually talk.Overall, this movie is a must watch.

As a viewer you share and experience everything from Jeffries' perspective which automatically creates a certain suspense. Personally, I found the authenticity of this movie to be quite charming.

"""Rear Window"" is great and the theme is worth it.","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" lasts in many reviewers' minds simply because of its quality.  The sets and characters add perfectly to the idea and feel of the film.  One of the largest indoor scenes was made for this movie, and used to expose the vulnerability of privacy in daily life.  Jimmy Stewart all alone in an apartment for hours with nothing to do but watch people go by in their own way.  All the while, with his lovely girlfriend trying to win his heart even further.Along with suspense, great actors, and excellent scenes, Hitchcock silently seeks the right of privacy.  From any open window in the summertime a person can see out, and with a lack of television or an occasional visitor it's much more likely that that window may be his only form of entertainment.""Rear Window"" is an excellent movie; it uses small things that make it unique.  During the entire film, no background music is played, just the sounds from neighbors and down the street, making the connections even more exciting.  It is definitely a film to watch, but with the attention that it was something new, and something real.  Not paying attention to detail and specific supports would ruin the movie, but if looked at it is truly a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thematic Elements,"Directly quoting from Webster's Dictionary, a theme is `the subject of a work of art.'  If this is true, which it undoubtedly is, then perhaps the main theme in Hitchcock's masterpiece Rear Window is the notion of appearance versus reality.  Accordingly, the underlying message of such a theme is that what one sees in everyday life could in fact be nothing more than a facade, or simply put, a mere deception of one's genuine character.How Hitchcock portrays this particular theme is quite subtle.  But through the eyes of L.B. Jeffries, the audience is revealed to the extremely personal side of life by spying on several local neighbors whom both Jeffries and the audience can view from a rear window.  Of course, the personal side of life in this film encompasses the actions and secrets that are occur in the home and hence this is what really constitutes the reality of individuals.  Therefore, what is done in society and in public by people can be interpreted as being solely superficial.  Thus, as Jeffries continues his acts of voyeurism, he discovers several truths that contrast the perceptions of these people held by the rest of society.Oddly enough, this is a very common theme among many Hitchcock films. For example, the character of Charles Oakley in Shadow of a Doubt gives the appearance of the very intelligent and likeable guy to many of the local dwellers in Santa Rosa, California.  However, once his niece Charlotte becomes aware of his personal secrets, her appearance of him forever changed into the image of a ruthless killer, which in reality Uncle Charlie was all along.One scene that demonstrates this theme is when the husband of the newly wed couple is resting on his elbows and leaning outside the window.  To the local neighbors and society in general, this newly wed couple would more than likely portray the appearance of happiness out in public due to the fact that they are a recently married couple.  However, what the audience sees through Jeffries point of view is that in reality the husband is obviously displeased and bored with his current situation, which is distinctly represented by a look of misery.Another scene that contains the concept of appearance versus reality is when the boyfriend of the ballet dancer finally returns home from some kind of military service or war.  For a majority of the film, this dancer is given constant attention by several men.  Though, this occurs in her bedroom, the appearance this gives to others who know her either in town or in the same building is that she is very promiscuous.  In truth, this idea of her being very sexually active is far from reality.  Regardless if many men are pursuing her, this character never makes advances towards them sexually, but she also never denies them the luxury of her company.  And when her boyfriend finally comes home, the audience is well aware that this is the only man that she has been waiting for and loves because of the ecstatic reaction she displays towards his homecoming.There are several film techniques that Hitchcock utilized to highlight this main theme.  One area that added to this thematic atmosphere was the lighting in Rear Window.  True to his reputation of being a cinematic genius, Hitchcock used the lack of light and unique shadows to characterize times when people did not want their personal lives or reality to be discovered and known by others.  In some sense, by hiding in these shadows, the characters felt comfort in the dark blanket that served as a barrier for them against individuals in the outside world who were trying to uncover their secrets.Perhaps the scene that best demonstrates this technical characteristic is when a local dog in the film is found dead.  The female owner of the dog upon discovering this tragedy is clearly outraged and horrified.  She in response creates a vocal ruckus so loud that everyone in the neighborhood looks out their window or walks onto their deck to see what all the commotion is about.  One neighborhood by the name of Lars Thorwald however does not get up to see what is happening.  Jeffries attempts to see what Thorwald is doing, but his efforts are soon thwarted when he realizes that Thorwald has turned off all of the lights and can no longer be seen through Jeffries' telephoto camera lens.  Thus, in order to escape the reality that Jeffries suspects of him, Thorwald hides in the darkness while smoking a cigarette of his apartment.The camera angles used by Hitchcock also articulate this theory of appearance versus reality.  Many of the shots that comprise the neighbors within this film are that of close-ups.  In particular, these close-ups serve as representations of the point of view of Jeffries when he is spying on his neighbors through his camera lens.  But another way to define these close-ups is that they also represent the truth of these individuals that are being spied on because they are so up close and personal.  Wide-angle shots are not very personal and give the outer appearance and surface of a given subject only.  While a close-up on the other hand gets past the surface of something and really gets down in depth about one specific image. Symbolically then, the close-ups of characters within this film could serve as a method to get passed the superficial images portrayed by these people in society.  And thus, they serve as the ultimate means of seeing the truth and reality of these characters.An example of a scene that depicts this use of close-ups is when Jeffries is watching a character that is dubbed the title Miss Lonelyhearts.  At first Jeffries only sees the surface of this character from afar as she happily prepares a fancy dinner for two in her apartment.  However, it is only after Jeffries watches her closely that a close-up reveals the truth regarding the situation, which is that there is no one there at all but herself.  It is then found out that Miss Lonelyhearts is indeed a very melancholy woman who is looking for love, but unable to find it roles-plays scenarios of romantic evenings in her spare time.In the end, Hitchcock with the use of technical brilliance accomplishes the perfect mood and theme for this movie.  For that reason alone, Rear Window stands as one of the greatest films within the Hitchcock collection.  A film that at first appears to be nothing more than the voyeuristic journey of a photographer quickly adapts to offer an insight look into the notion of appearance and reality that dominates peoples' lives.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Disenchanted with Hitchcock,"I watched ""Rear Window"" again last night. Seeing it again only serves to confirm this growing sense I've had for quite a while. It's the feeling that, actually, for all his innovation, Hitchcock, by today's standards was a sloppy, inattentive, rigid and formulaic director. His movies cause me more annoyance than anything else.The egregious and prolific cinematic ""goofs"" in this movie are beautifully itemized elsewhere on this site. It was the same sort of embarrassing inattentiveness in ""North by Northwest"", ""The Birds"" and many other Hitchcock movies. He would miss little details from scene to scene which are much less frequent in movies directed by today's top-tier counterparts.Hitchcock's well-known abhorrence for outdoor shots resulted in the creation of painfully artificial indoor sets - to the point of looking rank amateur.I'm sure he thought his camera angles at critical moments of his movies contributed to the dramatic intensity of the scene: the camera looking down into the shower in ""Psycho"", the camera looking down again at Stewart as he is approached by Raymond Burr - it gets repeated in several movies. By today's standards, frankly, the shots are rigid, routine, predictable and boring.Hitchcock's principal actors are interesting which, I suppose, is why he used them again and again. But many of the other relatively minor characters in his movies are wooden, silent, under-developed and under-utilized to the point of being quite dispensable. They are nothing more than interchangeable props: the two thugs in ""North by Northwest"" for example or the honeymooners in ""Rear Window"" illustrate my point.Nope, I've made-up my mind on this: compared to a Spielberg or Ron Howard, Hitchcock, for all of the praise he has received comes across to me as a so-so director who really didn't have the eye for detail and precision required of directors today and expected by their more technically sophisticated audiences.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rear Window is a Rarity - Even by Hitchcockian Standards!,"Rear Window is an intriguing, brilliant, chilling Hitchcockian study of obsessive human curiosity and voyeurism. It plays as the ultimate guilty pleasure treat (comparing the viewer to a voyeur who sits in the dark judging what he sees while being unobserved) and an extended metaphor to the illusory workings of the cinema.The premise echoes the director's simple but lucrative narrative launching points. Jeff (James Stewart) is an action-hungry photographer who has spent several weeks in isolation, as a result of a broken leg that has relegated him to a wheelchair in his New York apartment. His social interactions are limited to his sarcastic massage therapist Stella (the deliciously acerbic Thelma Ritter) and a romantic interest with an unqualified patience (the marvelous Grace Kelly). From his apartment window overlooking a closed courtyard, the audaciously observant Jeff peeks at the busy lives of an assemblage of suburban tenants in perplexed fascination and witnesses everyone's dirty linen: suicide, broken dreams, and cheap death! There is an unsettling resonance in what his eyes and ears absorb. During a particularly humid night while Jeff drifts in and out of slumber, the foreboding figures across the yard are heard and seen in lightning-fast increments. There is a spine-tingling scream followed by stoic silence. The husband leaves the apartment in the dead of night, seemingly shaken, only to return later. By the following morning the wife is no longer seen from Jeff's vantage point, but where did she go?Alfred Hitchcock crafts one of his most intelligently thrilling films (a sadistic pleasure in meddling in the questionable private lives of others), adapting an incredible tale of pure misanthropy. All those characters we glimpse across from Jeff's window are real people, given dimension by basic but brilliant filmmaking techniques. The most remarkable aspect is the way that it is filmed: the camera never strays from inside Stewart's apartment, and you never really realize that while watching the film. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is an insightful amalgamation of character and behavior, and the dialogue is wonderfully used to accentuate details. Also, due mention is rightfully reserved for the three lead actors (Stewart, Kelly and Ritter) who play the material with orthodox conviction, as if oblivious to the monumental profundity stirring beneath them.Rear Window has an infectious and savage charm that leaps beyond even the highest of expectations. What's more, it is also a vivid reminder of who Hitchcock was and continues to be: the quintessential voice of audacity in an industry starved for the guidance of progressive voices. Rear Window is a joy from start to finish!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Hitchcock's best,"This film, although ostensibly a murder mystery, is more about relationships. James Stewart marooned in his apartment overlooking the rear of his block sees into the windows of his neighbours and observes their stories. The girl dancer with the many admirers, the honeymoon couple, the woman without a partner, the couple with their beloved dog, the couple who quarrel, the happily married insurance nurse. And there is James Stewart and Grace Kelly, working out their relationship in a mature and modern way. The film weaves all these stories with the murder mystery hypnotically.Technically it is faultless. The editing is particularly good with things happening on several levels at once. The lighting gives a real impression of the movement of the day. The dialogue is wonderful and makes each character an individual. The actors do a sterling job. It is difficult not to be drawn into this world and feel the emotions of the people in it.Hitchcock shows himself not only as great director of the suspense film but a film maker able to see into the human heart. If we look into Rear Window we may find ourselves looking back out. More a rear mirror really.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A journey through the lens of a voyeur.,"We all have been on the receiving end of being a voyeur once in our life. There are times in our childhood, I am sure, when we spied on someone whether it was our parents, siblings or neighbors. As humans, we have the compelling feeling to be nosy and try to find out about business that is none of ours whatsoever. Alfred Hitchcock knew this feeling, so much so that he knew he could make a murder mystery out of it. Here, L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) represents all of us, unable to be satisfied with our own lives, so we pry into the lives of others. Unfortunately for him, he is also stuck with a cast for a broken leg, and is so bored with his current situation, he takes his overactive imagination and comes to the conclusion that one of his neighbors has committed murder.A set-up that has inspired many movies since then, Rear Window is one of the finest achievements of Hitchcock as well as an interesting and compelling thriller that really has more of a lack of thrills. But, like many Hitchcock films, it is the possibility of what might happen that keeps us in tune as well as the reason Jeffries stays involved. Nearly all of Hitchcock's heroes have an obsession, whether it is with a woman, clearing their name or trying to solve a murder, they do not let up but continue on until they either fail or succeed.I believe Hitchcock is also saying something about the balance of interest between our own lives and how much we should have in others. Jeffries is obsessed with bringing a possible murderer to justice, but he also tends to ignore those closest to him, his girlfriend Lisa (the beautiful and flawless Grace Kelly) as well as return to his job as a photographer. This voyeurism will put him in serious harm's way, but for him it is worth it to get some excitement into his life.As much as the story is interesting, so is the way it is told. Nearly all shots start out from Jeffrie's apartment, and there is tremendous detail paid to the characters that really don't have anything to do with the murder. Really, when you think about it, Hitchcock tells two stories here; the murder mystery and the lives of others amidst this hot and steamy week in New York. It is an eyeful and takes more than one viewing to get it all, but it is well-made enough that it is never boring and the last twenty minutes will still thrill you, even though you're being a voyeur.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie Majesty,"To take one movie set and transform it into a window to the world is genius.The intelligence, grace and beauty of Grace Kelly combined with the charm, talent and eloquence of James Stewart and the brilliance of the entire cast makes this a winner out of the gate. I have watched this film numerous times and never tire of it. Not so much because of the voyeurism, but the concern the lead characters display for their neighbors pulls at my heart, and that is all but lost today in movies and reality.I find myself relating to Lisa, a woman who for all intensive purposes does PR and falls for a photojournalist, Jeff. He tries to deter her love and admiration with all kinds of excuses why the don't go together. I find myself experiencing the same situation. Her love and devotion for this man was wonderful.

"Great actors, great plot, great story....","Rear Window is a classic suspense movie without all the blood and guts.The whole plot takes place inside L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries (James Stuart) New York apartment.  He is recovering from a broken leg and is confined to his wheel chair.  Trying to get through the days while not doing much besides visiting with his Stella (Thelma Ritter) his nurse and Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) his girlfriend, he looks through the rear window to his apartment and observes his neighbors in the apartments across the courtyard. Miss Torso, Miss Loneyheart, a composer, newlyweds and a bickering couple captures his attention and Jeff is soon caught up in his neighbors' lives noticing the odd things that they do day by day.  One day he notices that the wife of the man across the courtyard is no longer in the apartment and the man is packing her things.  Jeff also notices that his strange neighbor is coming home at odd hours of the night with knives and ropes.  Soon Jeff becomes suspicious thinking that a murder has just been committed across from his own apartment. Hitchcock used a lot of symbolism throughout the movie.  When Miss Lonelyheart was depressed, she would be on the lower floor of the apartment, but when she became happier she would go to the higher floors of the apartment building.  The apartment of the suspicious neighbor was dark and uninviting.  The music from the composer's apartment would always start to play when Jeff and Lisa would talk about the suspicious neighbor.  It was very interesting to look for the symbolism throughout the movie because it took the theme of the movie to a deeper level.  Also, when Jeff is looking into all the different apartment buildings he seeing more than neighbors go through their daily tasks: he's seeing different stages of people lives.  I think that is what makes this movie so interesting and captivating in a way. Hitchcock's movies have multiple levels. I would rate this movie 10/10.  It is definitely something everyone should see.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not up to Hitchcock standards,"As a huge Hitchcock fan, I had been predisposed to the belief that Rear Window would be an incredibly entertaining, mysterious, and suspenseful piece of film work.  I found it to be rather the opposite.  I am truly amazed that it impresses others with its ""depth and meaning.""  Hitchcock's other films entertain, excite, and satisfy the viewer.  Rear Window is slow-moving, meaningless, and anti-climatic.  In my opinion, nothing about it was scary or suspenseful, so if you want a real thriller of Hitchcock's that's not ""Psycho,"" I suggest ""Rebecca,"" (1940).  It was his only movie to win Best Picture, and it's a much better way to spend 2+ hours of free time. I feel the only other person who might share my sentiment is the IMDB staff person who suggested ""Body Double"" for those who like Rear Window- if you've seen it, you know what I mean!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A brilliantly conceived classic masterpiece of suspenseful mystery that has steamy romance, entertaining drama and a bit of humor thrown in","It's amazing how they got the whole set to look like an apartment neighborhood in New York City - it looks immaculate. It's impressive how they constructed it all inside of a Paramount studio. That sliver of area down the alley where you can see outside of the neighborhood was brilliantly conceived. They implemented it so that the set doesn't feel so claustrophobic and shut-in. It helps it to feel alive, natural and lived-in. It makes you wonder what's out there. It makes you curious of the outside world and reminds you that there is a world outside of the buildings. The set also feels quite cozy, the whole movie feels that way in fact. There's so much brilliant storytelling done just with images and the way Hitchcock moves the camera around adds to it as well. He films with such a curious and observant eye. A true master at his craft. He was an innovator with a brilliant mind and made movies that were ahead of their time. I love how he always makes a cameo in his movies.I'm so glad they filmed this movie in technicolor cuz it looks gorgeous. I don't think this movie would've had the same effect if it were in black & white. I love how right off the bat they're giving all the neighbors their own distinct quirks and personality that sets them apart from each other. Very sharp and clever dialogue throughout this movie, especially when Stella comes along. Grace Kelly, who plays Lisa Fremont, is beautiful. She has such a wonderful charm and grace about her. James Stewart is great as Jeff Jeffries. The character dynamics are fantastic. The relationship between Lisa and Jeff is an interesting one. Two people who love each other but come from different backgrounds and tastes. Lisa is a socialite and lives a quite high maintenance/high life style while Jeff is more bare bones, rugged and is always surrounded by action. That kissing scene between them was pretty hot, Grace is something else. I don't know if it's the casting in Hitchcock's films, but he's always able to have both the female and male leads in his movies have a chemistry and connection that feels so natural - look at Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant in Notorious. It was kind of annoying in a silly way how during that scene where they all have a glass of brandy in their hands, they keep swirling it around while talking. Eventually it becomes funny though.This movie proves that TV isn't the only form of entertainment. Why need a TV when you can people-watch and tune in to people's personal lives from your own apartment? The visual storytelling is masterful in this movie. The cinematography and movement of the camera is phenomenal. The darkness that exists in the neighbors apartment when he's not there is so dark that it creates an uneasy and unnerving feeling. As if something or someone could be lurking in that darkness looking back. The last climatic 20 minutes of the movie were incredible, truly unforgettable.It's interesting how Jeff's theory of the neighbor killing his wife could be interpreted as a metaphor for the fear he might feel about marriage with Lisa or how it could end up. This movie is about a man's fear of marriage and long term commitment. A suspenseful mystery, a steamy romance, a drama with bits of comedy - yeah, this movie's perfect. A brilliant and cleverly conceived film. The storytelling is so tight and immaculate that the movie goes by in the blink of an eye. I highly highly recommend it and I consider it one of my favorites of all time. I'd watch this movie again in a heartbeat.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Stunning View,"Bound to a wheelchair following an accident, a photographer passes time by spying on his neighbors and believes that one of them has committed a murder. Hitchcock was at the peak of his creative powers in the 1950s, and this is one of his masterpieces. He's quite innovative in using a single, confined set to tell his suspenseful story. Stewart perfectly conveys the frustrations, fears, and vulnerabilities of the hapless photographer. Kelly's brief career peaked in 1954 and this is arguably her best film. Ritter is marvelous as Stewart's wisecracking caregiver. Interestingly, Burr, who plays the murder suspect here, would go on to play the wheelchair-bound cop Ironside on TV.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting social commentary wrapped up in Hitchcock's best film so far,"Not having seen every film that Hitchcock made, and therefore not entirely qualified to analyze what makes a film ""his,"" REAR WINDOW is definitely getting closer to what my idea of the ideal Hitchcock film is. Like his other pictures, it takes a simple premise and puts the audience through the wringer as to how it will turn out. Here, James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photojournalist who passes the time by looking at his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. However, based on some things he sees, he begins to think that a murder may have been committed. Having just come off of ROPE, where the film was edited to appear as one single take, I noticed another technical challenge with this. The entire view the audience is given is from Jeff's apartment, which essentially forces us into his perspective. We see exactly what he sees, and know what he knows (with a few exceptions). In the hands of a weaker director, having basically only one fully developed character would have resulted in a very weak film, but Hitchcock makes it work somehow. It also doesn't hurt that James Stewart has a likable screen presence. And boy, is Grace Kelly easy on the eyes (and a talented actress, too)! However, what made the film so much more interesting was the social commentary that Hitchcock flirted with for part of the running time. Most of it is contained in some first-half conversations between Jeff and his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly). Although I could just be reading this onto the film, it seems like Jeff's apartment-bound snoop is a metaphor for society's growing passivity. This is kind of supported by the fact that he's averse to getting married, is content with the status quo, etc. This is in contrast to his girlfriend, who is more ambitious. It's almost tragically ironic that they end up bonding over a murder they think has been committed based on their limited point of view from Jeff's apartment. Also, given the interconnectedness that the internet provides, and the privacy concerns that come along with it, one could certainly read the ethics of surveillance onto the film as well. Even if that wasn't the intention (and Hitchcock's primary concern was entertainment), you can certainly see how the film was prescient in that regard. Just substitute the digital world for the apartment complex, where you think that you know people based on what they post on Facebook. If anything, you can take away that life is better experienced than merely observed. However, my only minor complaint has to do with the ending (again). Hitchcock is a master when it comes to building tension and suspense, but after so much cinematic foreplay there wasn't enough time to savor the release when it comes. I will say that Raymond Burr, even though you only got really one scene to appreciate his character up close, was quite menacing. There were also lots of cool little moments that you get to see as Jeff spies on his neighbors. And, I was able to catch Hitchcock's cameo this time! From my limited perspective of only having seen a handful of Hitchcock's films at this point, I can still safely say that this is the best so far. I also can't wait to dig further into to his filmography.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A welcome change of pace from current thrillers,"I finally got around to watching Rear Window for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I couldn't help contrasting it--favourably--with modern thrillers.Unlike a modern thriller, where the movie-makers try to jolt you within the first few seconds, Hitchcock was content to take his time. He spent the bulk of the first act on character development. Instead of cheap thrills, he used complex, interesting, appealing characters portrayed by skilled actors to draw us into his story.I confess that it took my MTV-shortened attention span some time to adjust; I kept wondering, during the first half hour or so, when the plot was going to get under way. But I was never bored. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly had great chemistry and were fascinating to watch, and Thelma Ritter was a hoot. The characters hooked me and pulled me into the story. By the climax, I was squirming anxiously as I watched these people I'd come to know and care about getting into danger.There's also a depth to this film that most modern thrillers lack. Rear Window raises a lot of disturbing questions. Where's the line between neighbourly concern and voyeurism? Can men and women ever be really happy together? And can you always believe what you've seen with your own eyes? This film isn't just chewing gum for the mind, occupying your attention for a couple of hours and then forgotten. I didn't find it as heart-pounding as Psycho, but I was entertained and enthralled nonetheless. Great stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Love Thy Neighbour?,"Rear Window is arguably Hitchcock's finest film. It encapsulates a tale of intrigue, suspense, paranoia and voyeurism, but also features an underlying tone exploring the subject of human relationships and love.L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart) is a wheelchair-bound photographer recovering from a broken leg. His frustration and boredom at being confined within his own home leads to an obsession with the lives of the people through his rear window. The wealth of relationships before his eyes highlight the various stages of coupling, and Jefferies is forced to examine his own love life, following a recent proposal from his doting beau Lisa (Grace Kelly). Using binoculars and high power lenses, Jefferies is alerted to the suspicious behaviour of Lars Thorwell (Raymond Burr), and becomes convinced that he has witnessed the events surrounding a murder. Soon, both Lisa and his unflappable nurse (the wonderful Thelma Ritter), become convinced that something is seriously awry. When cynicism comes from Jefferies' friend on the force, Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey), he is forced to examine his actions, intuitions and motives as the plot unfolds.Hitchcock creates a tense environment, with the small, unchanging set complemented by incidental street noises, and the occasional playing of a local pianist. Like Jefferies, the viewer becomes absorbed with the lives of ordinary people, as the many incidental characters embark upon their daily routines. It is a thriller which entices the audience into sharing the intrigue, emotions and suspicions of the main characters, as the subtle script weaves its way to conclusion. Rear Window is a tense, yet understated mystery, and a delightful exploration of human nature.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A great look into the lives of others!,"Alfred Hitchcocks movie ""Rear Window"" is a great perspective on the different stages in a persons life. The stage is the largest indoor set ever made, the view is set entirely from an apartment.  The different levels show the neighbors at their best or worst. As these people develop, this shows how the different stages of life develop into other stages. The music is very unique during this movie, it is either played on a piano, on a radio, or sung. This is very different then many of his other movies, unlike the birds where there is no sound track. The music is uplifting and is a characteristic to the neighbors. Jimmy Stewart is perfect for this role, he is known and loved by many people, and that adds sympathy to his character. Although during the movie his ""sanity"" is sometimes questioned, it helps the viewer to get passed the fact that he has been stuck in his apartment for 6 weeks, and except his credibility. Even though the viewer is forced to accept it because it is all from his point of view. This movie is one of Hitch cocks best, although a mystery and not a horror film.

Neighborhood Watch,"Murder is not one of the words that comes to mind when the talking about a neighborhood. A neighborhood is supposed to be a secure, warm, and inviting place that a person can come to after a hard days work and know everything will be alright. In the world of Alfred Hitchcock, it's everything but.Rear Window is the story of L. B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart), a photographer who is currently incapacitated due to a broken leg. He must stay at home and wait until it fully heals to get back out into the world. The only pleasures he has is talking to his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), spending time with his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), and looking out his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex.Even though Jeffries can be considered a ""peeping Tom"", his motives are simply out of boredom and curiosity. All he has are the lives of the other tenants and watching them play out. There is the dancer he dubs Miss Torso. There is also the ever depressing Miss Lonelyheart. The Songwriter and the Newlyweds also live their lives outside Jeffries window. The apartment that particularly catches his attention belongs to that of Lars Thorwald. He suspects that he has killed his wife.All of his accusations are simply based on what he sees, not what he hears. Stella and Lisa both think he is crazy and should stop snooping before it consumes him entirely. Before long he has his friend Detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) investigate what is going on over at Thorwald's apartment. The stage is set for a thrill ride through a pair of binoculars.Hitchcock's use of the camera is some of the most creative to date. Almost the entire movie is filmed in Jeffries's apartment. TO make the shots look like what Jeffries is seeing through the binoculars. This same type of shot is used in Roman Polanski's Chinatown. It's an excellent first person perspective. It gives a more realistic quality, like someone could actually be seeing this.Hitchcock also uses a lot of sounds that would be heard in an urban area. The sounds of the street, the other tenants, and what elements of nature remain. The music is used to enhance a shot or a feeling that is trying to be given off.Stewart and Kelly's performances are mirror images of what a couple would be like. They fight, love, and go through the motions of just everyday life. As Stewart's character gets more and more involved with what is going on, so do the other characters. Their mood changes from concerned for Stewart to concerned for Thorwald's wife.This film takes a real setting, real people, in an extraordinary situation. Invasion of a person's privacy working towards the common good is a very peculiar subject to be shown, but Rear Window does it. It's a roller coaster of emotions where the suspense is enough to lift a person out of their seat. Each frame more engaging than the previous. Hitchcock proves that a fascinating story and a little imagination can go a long way.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An older couple who have developed a simple little system so that they can allow their pet dog to be 'let out' so to speak from the 3rd floor balcony, and there is a couple who constantly seems to be arguing about something. This is the couple that become intricate to the story. Eventually the wife disappears and the wheelchair bound man becomes obsessed with the idea that the wife has been murdered. What follows is a buildup which is Hitchcock all the way. Nobody builds suspense like him, and even though I was disappointed by the ending because I was kind of hoping for more of a twist, it's still pretty powerful. I highly recommend.

WINDOW: Observe the beauty and ugliness of human nature,"This is a great movie with profound and moral paradoxes. The premise of the film is the existence of a criminal act. So the movie seems to tell viewers that voyeurism is immoral, but it is precisely because of this immoral behavior that it prevents the crime itself and thus creates a sense of justice. Hitchcock used his films to explain this human natural desire. He used his movie to make us understand: peeping is universal in everyone's heart. However, excessive peeping goes beyond the boundaries of morality and even law. From this perspective, the restraint of civilization has caused the depression of humanity to a certain extent. We need to comply with both constraints and instincts, and there is a certain conflict between the two. As an external window, it also plays a media role for the observer to observe the inner heart of the person. Interestingly, the observer's peeping behavior is also a manifestation of human nature.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A great classic of mystery crime movies,"I love how the movie scaled up the simple initial concept of peeking at one's neighbors into a great detective movie. The detective movie aura presented isn't one with rich and intriguing details, rather it's one with so many parts built of hunches and intuition, yet it proves to be a classic after all. I like how the movie played with the mood, downplaying and emphasizing back and forth both the mood and the pace. After watching North by Northwest, Psycho, and Rear Window, in that order, I now have a greater regard toward how Alfred Hitchcock handles his movies' concepts, plots, and the general direction. James Stewart performed better in other movies, in my opinion. But I like how Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter acted out.

Kelly is also up to par as Stewart's love interest and the bait to find the truth. The great Thelma Ritter also appears and adds her perfect character performance to this, arguably one of the masters best works.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best films,"""Rear Window"" is a very good suspense thriller, and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Based on a story by noir writer Cornell Woolrich, it appeals to the voyeur in all of us. Human beings are naturally nosy and inquisitive. And that is the premise on which the film is based.L.B. Jeffries, known as ""Jeff"", (James Stewart) is a photo journalist who works for a magazine. He is wheelchair-confined in his small, seemingly cramped apartment, recovering from a leg injury sustained while on an assignment. Because he is bored, he spends a great deal of time looking at the goings-on in the block of flats opposite. As a result of what he sees, he begins to suspect that one of the residents of that block may have murdered his bed-ridden wife. He involves his fiancée, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), his carer, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and an old friend from war service, serving police detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) in his suspicions. But are those suspicions the product of an overactive imagination or is there some substance to them?""Rear Window"" keeps the viewer on tenterhooks right up until its excellent conclusion. It is a riveting and entertaining film with superb performances from its principal actors. It is proof positive that a film does not need high-octane action sequences, expensive special effects, a cast of thousands or breathtaking scenery to keep the viewer's interest. This is a film that is claustrophobic, almost theatrical in nature (""Dial M for Murder"" was apparently based on a stage play; and I can envisage ""Rear Window"" making a successful theatrical transfer, if it hasn't already done so). The direction by Hitchcock is, of course, excellent.Hitchcock makes his trademark cameo appearance in the film (about 30-40 minutes in), as a guest in one of the apartments opposite Jeff's. Incidentally, Stewart and Kelly each make a very minor error when delivering their lines in two separate scenes (they hesitate slightly and stumble over their words). These are barely noticeable but I am nonetheless surprised that both scenes were not re-shot or, if they were, that the unblemished versions were not inserted into the final version of the film.""Rear Window"" is a great film. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hitchcock at his finest...,"I am personally a fan of Alfred Hitchcock films, so my opinion may be a little bias.  Having said that, still, this is a film that anybody that watches movies should check out.It says much on the morality of peeping into other peoples lives, and if we even have the right to.  The genius of all of that is, is that we too get caught up in these lives that we view from afar.  We view them through the eyes of Stewart, but still, we are never any better.  And we always want to know more.  If that doesn't interest you, however, you can still watch a great story unfold.  A mystery that keeps us guessing until the end, and possibly after the movie ends.  I won't ruin any of that for all of you though.Hitchcocks direction is excellent.  As with all of his great films, for instance 'The Birds' and 'North by Northwest', the pacing is great, and we never get a chance to get bored.  Excellent, as well, are the performances from the entire cast.  Whats best is the whole world that is created for us, from afar, based on assumptions that are speculations at best.  Hitchcock never does tell us exactly what is going on.  That is best left up to us to decide if what we see and what we are being told that we see are the same thing.This film is so multifaceted that I really can't describe it all right now, you will have to see it all for yourself.  It has a point that is relevent still, even more so today with the huge success of reality television, and the media lust for celebrity gossip(paparazzi).  Take that away, and still you get a great suspense movie.  We are all voyeurs, and through Stewart's eyes is each and everyone of us peering into the lives of everyone else.  This is as good as Hitchcock gets, and properly earns him the title 'The Master of Suspense'.  Fantastic.  10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Still holds up today.,"Decided to delve into Hitchcock's films since I've never seen any of his before, starting with Rear Window. I was surprised from the very start of the first act how the whole concept of the story felt so unique and modern, even by today's standards. The set design combined with the constantly shifting colour palettes reflecting the time of day was beautifully done, and the sound just captures that feel of an inner city suburb late at night so well. Probably will watch again at some point.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Errors in the plot,"Very good film to watch, of course.But.The MURDERER sees that SHE, while being arrested, wears his dead wife's nuptial ring. And that ring - they tell us in the movie - could be an important clue for his indictment. (Which I don't think the case, based as it is on the supposed fact that every wife would bring her nuptial ring in any circumstances - and that is questionable). But, above all, it makes no sense that the MURDERER, having tracked down HIM, asks him whether SHE would give back the ring: he knows SHE has been arrested wearing it.Still less sense gives the fact that the MURDERER wants to kill HIM: in any case the ring will remain in possession of the police, to which SHE would have told the whole story...Anyway.Still a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfect craftsmanship,"Rear Window is a perfect example of a filmmaker's craftsmanship. In the setup, Hitchcock lets the viewer indulge in his or her natural predilection for voyeurism along with the protagonist. The huge apartment set is perfect for this. There are enough clearly delineated characters that the viewer can usually find at least one to identify with, marginally if not more (besides everyman Stewart of course). Even the villain elicits some sympathy for his circumstances. The actors aren't really challenged by the material but they perform admirably and the incremental increase in the suspense is perfectly paced. I should also mention that glamorous Grace Kelly models some very chic fashions. Another winner from The Master, 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A suspense classic. Done in a unique way by Hitchcock, it proves no matter how immobile when you have your sight it's still the greatest gift of all.","I for one know just how good of a filmmaker that Alfred Hitchcock is certainly the master of suspense. I for one enjoy his masterpiece ""Psycho"", and this 1954 classic ""Rear Window"" ranks as a good suspense classic for one it was done in a unique way by Hitchcock the way it was mostly shot in a one room apartment from the lead character who had an across the way view of his own world. The film was shot in such an insular manner. Still over the years many say this is a voyeur film, I disagree true temptation is present from his views of a sexy ballet dancer across the street. Still all in all it proves your sight can come in handy to reveal info after it sees the drama before hand.The plot is good and really suspenseful for the 1950's as legendary James Stewart is L.B. Jeffries a sidelined professional photo journalist who's in his high rise apartment with a broken leg. His life has become all to common with boredom therefore he turns his attention across the view way to the apartments watching the everyday happenings of a ballet dancer, a salesman and his nagging wife along with a piano player. True this may be spying and being to eager yet his sight will turn to be a good friend and lead to an eagerness that will produce a discovery. As when the nagging wife disappears he suspects the salesman, then he enlists the investigation to get started with his opposites attract elegant and sophisticated girlfriend(played by the beautiful Grace Kelly). The film builds with tension and pretty good suspenseful feel for a 50's film leading to a surprise kind of twist ending. Overall pretty good suspense classic from Hitch especially for the unique way he shot most of the scenes form one room of the lead character. It proves too the moral that being immobile isn't important just remember your eyes and sense of sight is the most powerful tool. As when you look out and across you never know what you may find or discover as seeing will lead to suspicion and become a truth finder.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well,"This was solid and I enjoyed it for the most part. One thing that took away from the film was Jimmy Stewart, he came off like a cry baby. I also had a hard time believing that a woman like Grace Kelly would waste her time with an old, out of shape, wimp. Stewart was good in Vertigo so I thought this would be similar, but his constant whining got to me. Stewart's physique was an embarrassment, can you say bird chest? And he is with Grace Kelly? I don't buy it. But if Jimmy Stewart's job in this role was to come across like a weak, egotistical, perverted twit, then he did good.I know it sounds like I'm complaining, but overall this movie is worth watching. I don't think this is Hitchcock's best however, I would give that nod to North by Northwest. Hitchcock is ill, so watch this and enjoy, just don't let all the Stewartisms ruin it for you.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A guy becomes a peeping tom after breaking his leg and sees too much.,"Rear WindowHitchcock's `Rear Window' was like many of his other movies. They start out slow and stay that way all the through until the end when the ending surprises you like a slap in the face. What is interesting about this movie is that it takes place in the main character's apartment a lot like a play. 56 	This movie is not dark, or frightening like a lot of Hitchcock's other movies. Instead it carries on with the immense amount of suspense like all of his movies. After all he is the master of suspense.The set in this movie is most unique. It is the largest in door studio set ever made. The courtyard is actually the basement of the stage. The movie company actually gave Alfred Hitchcock permission to cut the floor out of the stage in order to make the set.This movie was actually very racy and suggestive for it's time.

It really is nothing compared to today's standards, maybe it is even humorous.So, in the opinion of the reviewer this really was an excellent movie receives a rating of ten out of ten.

Best thriller i have seen,"This movie will steadily increase your excitement to keep you on the edge of seat and at last what a thrill.. Don't miss this movie, if you want to see a thriller movie. Alfred Hitchcock is a master for thriller films. James stewart acting is impressive. Easily one of the best triller film and one of my all time favorite movie. Choreography is astonishing. Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense. As much as the story is interesting, so is the way it is told. Nearly all shots start out from Jeffrie's apartment, and there is tremendous detail paid to the characters that really don't have anything to do with the murder. Really, when you think about it, Hitchcock tells two stories here; the murder mystery and the lives of others amidst this hot and steamy week in New York. It is an eyeful and takes more than one viewing to get it all, but it is well-made enough that it is never boring and the last twenty minutes will still thrill you, even though you're being a voyeur.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good classic,"Throughout the film it took sometime for me to actually accept the new movie style that Hitchcock portrays in this film. During this film I went through almost 3 different stages of interest. The first stage consisted mostly of confusion and trying to figure out what was going on as they were introducing the different characters and scenarios. It was a very new movie feel for me so it took time to get used to. The second phase for me was unfortunately boredom, as I couldn't really engage into what was being played out in the different apartments. It wasn't until the end of the movie, about the time when the dog is found dead with its neck snapped that I really started to enjoy and became engaged in the film. The ending was very engaging and was extremely well done. It created an excellent sense of tension and suspens.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An amazingly perfect movie,"One of the most famous movies by Hitch was Rear Window, starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly (who shined on the screen of my TV--I can't imagine how she looked on the big screen).Stewart stars as a war photographer that is confined to a wheelchair because of a broken leg or hip. The only thing to do in 1954 was to watch the neighbors through the windows. The multiple levels of voyeurism are amazing in this movie, especially noticeable after several viewings (I think I have watched this four or five times). Stewart sees a microcosm of different points of his own life as he watches Miss Torso, the happy-go-lucky gal with a million gentlemen callers, Miss Lonelyhearts, who is apparently becoming an old maid, the Wedding Couple, with their wedded bliss, and the married couple and the arguments that they are apparently facing. Stewart watches people for his job, in a movie where we the viewers are watching somebody watch others. It's enough to make anyone think they are seeing things.Stewart thinks something is fishy with the married couple when the woman seems to disappear into thin air. His deductive skills are on the move and he thinks there is foul play. Or is there? The amazing part of a movie with only one set is how deep it can actually be. It doesn't have to take place all over New York or the world. This seemingly simple man is thrust into a dire situation, and that is Hitchcock's trademark. Danger may lurk in your own backyard. Will you be up to the challenge? I wonder how many false alarms were made in the mid-1950s by other apartment dwellers because of this movie? How many today? This movie receives my highest possible recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A must-see Hitchcock picture,"Rear Window, as every other classic masterpiece directed by Alfred Hitchcock, provides a gripping tale of gripping suspense and mystery that can be felt throughout the whole picture. The very gloomy and uncanny atmosphere of this picture adds up to an amazing, and unforgettable overall experience. This is definitely Hitch at his very best.It is also one of the most memorable roles of the magnificent James Stewart. If I would have to choose only one movie out of the four, on which he collaborated with Hitchcock, I would definitely pick Rear Window.Stewart plays a journalist named L. B. Jeffries, who is forced to stay at home for a few weeks after an auto race accident. With nothing better to do, he starts observing his neighbors through that eponymous rear window of his cozy apartment. At first it all seems to be just a silly way to pass the time. But as the night falls onto the city, something strange happens right across the yard and 'Jeff' is quickly drawn into a puzzling life-and-death situation. It suddenly became possible that one of his close neighbors, Lars Thorwald, is a killer on the loose and nobody seemed to have noticed it.In order for the viewer to get acquainted with the characters, the movie opens with a 30-minute easy introduction. As soon as we know the basics the action suddenly starts to take on totally different turn. The viewer gets wound up in the conundrum that leaves the protagonist sleepless.Grace Kelly is magnificent as Jeff's high-class girlfriend, Lisa Fremont. She's got so much style and glamor, and she proves to be a brave young woman too. There is one great scene, where she has to sneak into the alleged killer's place and find out if all of the murderous assumptions can actually be proved by palpable facts. I know I was cheering so mightily for her to get out, when dangerous Mr. Thorwald was getting closer and closer to his door, ready to catch Lisa right in the act.Although the whole movie takes place only on one single street, the diversity of presented characters and a deep look into their personal lives (and apartments) account for a picture, which isn't boring even for a minute. In the end we are actually able to distinguish all the people, who live nearby, as every night and day we follow them around along with Jeff's binoculars.Every true movie fanatic should watch Rear Window, as it is definitely one of the biggest achievements in cinematic craftsmanship. The thrilling script, marvelous acting, great camera shots, and the ubiquitous suspense that won't even let you blink – it's all in here, plus many more.This film actually got so many rave reviews, that it started a wave of many (better or worse) spin-offs. It influenced such films, as Blow Up, Blow Out, or more recently, Disturbia. This is the true power of a Hitchcockian movie. The themes that it presents are untimely. This is why so many directors tried to copy his style, but it's hard to point out the ones, who were actually close to the true genius of Alfred Hitchcock.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Viewing From Afar,"Knowing whether to act out in a dire moment could be a matter of life or death. In the film ""Rear Window"" (1954), the main character, L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) tries to determine if he has witnessed a murder or not. Times like these are where making quick decisions are crucial. The plot of this film introduced itself after a wheelchair bound photographer spots unusual actions going on across from his apartment. During his confined stay in his apartment, L.B. watched the lives of his courtyard neighbors outside of his rear window. What L.B. possibly discovers later is a man murdering his wife. Certain clues keep arising that may lead to a definite murder, but nothing exact can prove the man culpable of murder. Throughout the movie, L.B. uses different resources to find the truth since he is unable to leave his apartment. Once Jefferies finds out the real truth, he could not have been more surprised. The intention that the director (Alfred Hitchcock) was trying to prove was that it was impossible to know everything about someone. L.B. had occasionally seen his neighbors, but did not really stop to think what they were really about. I'm sure he even walked passed them on the street, but never thought what happened behind closed doors in their homes. As soon as L.B. became bound to his apartment due to an accident, he began to learn new things about all of them.The viewing technique that was unique to this film was the camera L.B. used to watch all of his neighbors with. The majority of the film was viewed through the lens of L.B.'s camera. So in a sense, it was like looking through the eyes of L.B. Jefferies himself. This way of filming is different than the conventional third person view. The idea to film through a first person point of view helped me feel as if I was in L.B Jefferies's position. During the moments where third person filming was re-introduced, it was possible to step back from the movie and look over was transpiring. First person viewing had definitely enhanced the quality of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stays fresh and new throughout the decades.,"I saw this movie because of a Hitchcock exposition I attended this year, it was as delightful as Rear Window.
When I heard how this movie was placed, I was instantly noting it in my watchlist.
Rear Window is something you don't see often in the cinema, Hitchcock had the freedom to take a ""crazy"" and tough idea into the work, and the fact that it's from 1954 it's mind blowing. With this film,Hitchcock was a child playing with a doll house, and he did it properly.
Nonetheless, the end seemed like they had some trouble deciding in the editing room, some of those choices seemed out of the style.

"Hands down, Hitchcock's greatest film","You could say that Psycho is more shocking, Vertigo more psychologically probing, and North by Northwest more sheer fun - but no other single Hitchcock film fires successfully on so many cylinders all at once. Every aspect of the director's considerable artistry is on view here - his humor, his tight plot construction, his brilliant set design, his visual ingenuity, the sexy and sophisticated interplay between his two leads - each honed and refined to perfection. Everything works in this film, and works brilliantly. The physical limitations of the plot - i.e. that it all takes place on one set - could have seriously undermined the film by allowing it to become too static, but instead Hitchcock actually makes the resulting claustrophobia work to great effect; it all builds to a climactic scene that is as pulse-poundingly suspenseful as anything ever committed to film. There are not many movies which could be described as ""perfect"" - even in the best of them, there's usually at least one or two minor flaws somewhere - but Rear Window definitely earns that distinction. If you have not yet seen it, I envy you the experience you are going to have once you finally do.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A movie that doesn't need a lot of action to be really good,"Rear Window is another one of Alfred Hitchcock's successes.  The movie starts off rather slow and the viewer might get a little bored, but once it gets into all the mystery there is no way anyone could fall asleep.  It keeps the audience on their toes and it is very entertaining to watch.  The entire movie is filmed in one community which makes it different from other movies and quite interesting.The movie stars James Stewart as L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries and Grace Kelley as Lisa Fremont.      The two work great together on camera and are both very talented actors.  James Stewart, who also starred in It's a Wonderful Life, is the perfect actor to play the part of Jeffries.        His character is an old army man and you can certainly tell through his acting.  Grace Kelley's character is classy and into fashion.  She is beautiful herself which only adds to this view of her character in the movie.  Overall, Stewart and Kelley are definitely the right people to star in Rear WindowThe acting altogether throughout the film is almost never cheesy and is almost always very believable.  All the actors and actresses act so well that it's as if what's happening isn't a move and is really going on.  Even the people with very few lines are believable when they say them.The music is all digetic.  There is never any background music that was added in after filming.  It all comes from a neighbor's piano, a radio, or something in the movie itself.  The fact that there is no added in music just adds to the feeling that what you're watching is really happening.  It makes the movie seem less like a movie and more like real life.There aren't really any special effects in Rear Window because it's not a special effects kind of movie.  There are however a few times in the movie where something or somebody looks very fake and you can tell it isn't really there or that what's happening isn't really happening like the audience sees it.  But those few times don't make a big impact on what the viewer's opinion of the movie is.  It is a very good movie and a few scenes that aren't so well put together don't change that.Rear Window has to be one of the most suspenseful movies there is.  Yes, it isn't full of loads of action but it doesn't need to be.  This movie has shown me that a movie can be simple and not have much ""bad"" stuff to be a really good suspense movie.  Rear Window is an awesome movie and is definitely on my ""see again"" list.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This man seems to be afflicted with a need to watch and observe the world, and isn't happy watching TV or reading books to pass the time, because he never does throughout the film. He does however, find a human drama by observing his neighbors across the courtyard, and he can interpret who they are and what they do by watching their activities throughout the day, and night! However, with one neighbor, played by Raymond Burr, he suspects a sinister and much darker reality, he thinks the man has murdered his wife.The film is not a typical film of voyeurism, because of Hitchcock's choice of Stewart to play the photographer Jefferies. Stewart is the decent and normal 'everyman', not a twisted and perverse 'peeper'. If the photographer was played by Robert Mitchum or William Holden, men who have played darker, more morally ambiguous characters in their career, maybe the film would have a different meaning. With Jimmy Stewart however, we can be assured that Jefferies is studying his environment and not becoming gratified with what he's viewing. That said, his viewing becomes close to an obsession when he believes a murder has occurred, but not quite to the unhealthy degree as the obsession he portrayed in another Hitchcock classic, 'Vertigo'.The film is classic, and it is both a time capsule and relevant to today. The lack of air conditioning during the film's heat wave forces people to leave their windows and blinds open, where as today they would most likely be out of view. The relevance is in the relationship between the 24/7 cable news, 'Americas Most Wanted', video and photo obsessed society of today, that voyeurism and the public's desire to provide breaking news is applicable. In this era, we are all like 'Jeff' Jefferies, and that is what makes 'Rear Window' more than a quaint period piece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolute genius!,"This movie will probably be with us forever! It's a fantastic movie to say the least. And Hitchcook got once again a chance at displaying his genius. The movie is beautifully composed, you would fell that following a character that sits in his wheelchair and glances out his rear window all day would get quite boring after some time, but it's absolutely fantastic! I think that has to do with how Hitchcook composes the shots, we are always looking at what the character is looking at, it's from is point of view. Occasionally the perspective will switch and we are now interrogating the characters expression toward what just happened. He connects the emotions with the visuals perfectly. Every time, it feels like we are looking at another world, it's all the windows that are the portals which will let us see in to other peoples life. Understand them and poke our curiosity towards their movements, and actions. Which is the whole structure for the plot, curiosity. But i wouldn't be a Hitchcook movie without some love with friction. Jeff, who is the main character is a magazine photographer with a packed suit case and too many stamps on his passport, during the movie he is in a wheelchair with a cast on his right leg. Whilst his wife, Grace Kelly is a Park Avenue socialite who seems ill-adapted for his life style. She wants to marry him whilst he sees marriage as an extension of his cast on his leg. The romance is complicated to say the least, but interesting and dramatizing. In the end it's a fantastic movie which is worth watching every day as long as you are breathing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not a great film, but a good film","This is a solid Hitchcock film. It delves into the feeling of how mesmerizing it can be sitting next to an upper floor apartment window in the inner city and watching the neighbors. If you've never lived in an apartment like that you won't understand what I mean. The main plot involves a murder (obviously) but there's also a nice side plot showing the character development of Grace Kelly. She appears shallow at first and Stewart thinks she is out of his league. However, as she helps him with the investigation Stewart gains more respect and admiration for her.That was the good part of the movie. The bad part is that the movie felt too contrived. The dangerous and suspenseful situations they got them into seemed unnecessary. Why didn't Stewart call the police when he knew that Raymond Burr was coming up to his apartment? In general, the movie just wasn't as scary or suspenseful as many other Hitchcock movies. It was a good Hitchcock movie, but not one of the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
