Probably not a 7 but need to balance the ridiculous scores out,"Okay I'm a 34 year old male who watched this movie the other day. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I like Greg Kinnear a lot and the Hemsworth kid.
I'm not a Miley fan by any means but it's clear all of these low scores bashing this movie are in response to hating her.
It's a simple love story with teen angst and all that. It doesn't rewrite the genre by any means but it's not terrible. Has so some beautiful music and cinematography as well. Give it a watch if you're bored and keep an open mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This 3.0 star user rating is due to Miley Cyrus haters! Quite great movie!,"That's why sometimes I really should ignore IMDb's ratings! My parents went to see this movie last week and told me to watch it. And so I did it tonight. OK, Miley Cyrus isn't the best actress in the world and she's stuck to the Hanna Montana and so on kind of roles that she did. Even considering that, I don't get why do people hate her this much! She had a quite acceptable performance in this movie. I'd give her a 6/10 stars rate, honestly believing that she'll improve a lot through her life as an actress. BUT WAIT! I really think we should rate this movie considering all the other things that compose it: a well-written and really moving story, an amazing soundtrack, a BRILLIANT Bobby Coleman's performance (WOOW! this kid will get very far in his career!) that almost made me shed a tear, a respectful cast, great landscapes and beautiful scenarios... There were some tiny moments with lack of total sense, and some slight errors of continuity, but totally harmless to the movie itself. Just stop hating the girl like she ruined the movie, because she did not do it at all. (and I swear I'm not a MC fan)Strongly recommended to watch with your lover!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"'Last Song' hits some good notes, misses others","Enter Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, a recently graduated seventeen-year-old with an attitude problem, divorced parents, a fresh shoplifting arrest and combat boots. When Ronnie is sent from New York to Georgia to live with her dad for the summer, she is less than thrilled and at first resists letting anyone in.Enter Will Blakelee, a rich small town 'hunk' (if you will), with volleyball skill and charm. Not exactly a rebellious teen aged girl's cup of tea, right? Well... not quite.Ronnie, played by Disney's princess Miley Cyrus, seems set not falling for anyone over the summer. But she ends up doing the opposite. Will's (Liam Hemsworth, Australian newbie) consistency pays off after just a couple of run-ins. He's writing 'Forever' on Ronnie's converse and playfully pushing her into the ocean before she even comes to fairly good terms with her piano-playing father, Steve. (Greg Kinnear) The fast pace relationship was sweet, considering it's between teenagers. Nothing like cliché summer romance, huh? If only there was more depth to the relationship... (not counting Will's secretly damaged family, and Ronnie's dramatic anger towards her dad) ... then maybe it would have been a more successful movie as a whole.I'm not going to blame Cyrus' ability to act (or maybe lack thereof) on the low points of the film. I'll actually give it to her, she did a nice job transitioning from little miss Hannah Montana to a darker, not as tween-based character. There is always room for improvement, however, as she seems to get bored of her alter ego throughout the film. But all in all, I did find her likable for the most part.At the end of the day, I cannot really complain or bash The Last Song. It was a debut in a lot of ways... Julie Anne Robinson's directorial debut, Nicholas Spark writing a screenplay debut, and Miley's debut as someone other than Hannah. So, cut it some slack. Excuse the sometimes cheesy moments and keep your mind open.6/10, Not too shabby.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
For Nicholas Sparks Fans,"Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non- supportive parents: from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story (with some help from Jeff Van Wie) into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.For a brief outline of the scant story: begin with a divorced family - Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are sent to spend the summer with their father Steve (Greg Kinnear) in an indescribably beautiful waterfront town in Georgia. Ronnie resents her father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) and beginning to fall in love, Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music, something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. And there it is. Mix the story with the usual acidic girls in the town who claim Will is a Lothario, overcome that rumor with some all night watches for raccoons who may steal some sea turtle eggs, pop in some father/son meaningful contact, and there you have a Nicholas Sparks formula.Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus - and for fans of Hannah Montana that works well. The light of the film is the screen presence of Liam Hemsworth who looks and acts like someone who will succeed in movies. Otherwise, just be advised that this is another setting for a Nicholas parks familiar story; if that is to your liking you will like this. If not, then pass.Grady Harp",,Anonymous,Music
Heart Warming and Heart Breaking,To me this movie had it all. Good cast with very good characters. The story was predictable at some points in the film but the 3rd act was by far the best in the movie. Cyrus and kinnear were the best in the movie. Hemsworth was good and the son was good to. Definitely grab some tissue and enjoy this delightful entertain movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
Miley's most honest display of human emotion since deleting her Twitter account.,"Most writers would sell out by repeatedly writing screenplays that are vastly different from one another. Take Christopher Nolan for example; going from a psychological thriller where the storyline is paced backwards to an Oscar-winning blockbuster in which a world renowned superhero faces off his arch nemesis. Talk about a lack of consistency. A true writer gracefully keeps revisiting the same story over and over and OVER again and a great example for that kind of writer is Nicholas Sparks.If recycling is healthy for our environment, it has to be with movies too, right? Never before has this man forgotten to add a romantic scene at the beach of an Eastern Seaboard sunset where two lovers mutely stare at one another. And who else can gorgeously stir up a tear-inducing ending as much as he? Forget 500 Days of Summer trying to explore the complexities of falling in love with a Hall and Oates dance sequence and an Expectations vs. Reality analysis. Instead he always remembers to kill off a protagonist at the end. M. Night Shyamalan calls HIMSELF the master of unpredictable twists? Puh-lease! Mr. Sparks's death sequences are so surprising, that you could almost say they're completely unrelated to the genre that the previous two hours were aiming to be.And when a movie like Precious thinks its portrayal of a teenage girl in emotional turmoil is accurate, it's alarmingly mistaken. There, the leading lady is impregnated by her own dad, sadistically beaten down by her mother, all while dealing with obesity and illiteracy on a daily basis. Ha! Like THAT happens in real life. It's really the Last Song's Ronnie who deserves our sympathy. I mean, she has to spend the entire summer in an intimidatingly adorable Georgia beach house, embrace the pressure of getting accepted into one of the country's most respected art schools and endure the creepy smile of her overly kind father. Now that's plausible drama – I only wish I had the guts to sullenly disregard MY dad whenever he greets me with genuine concern. This vision of teen angst fantastically brought to life by none other than Miley Cyrus.Now there are those jealous haters out there, determined to bring her acting career down. But they don't understand the effort it takes from a performer to purse your lips and cross your arms for 90% of a film. Like me and my fellow Miley fans said – she's just playing herself. It's really those hacks like Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep who are destroying everything classic cinema stood for. Who do they think they are to disappear into the heart and soul of characters they don't relate to or resemble in reality? When I'm watching a character on screen, I want to see the actor playing them. That's what made the most recent, Valentine's Day, so brilliant was that I could watch Jessica Alba being Jessica Alba the whole time yet grow blissfully unaware to her character's traits, abilities...heck, I couldn't even remember her name.And mad props go out to Greg Kinnear in the role of a lifetime as the ""antagonistic"" father. A previous family drama of his called Little Miss Sunshine featured too much family and likedrama. It acted like each member had their own ambition and obstacle to deal with at the same time. What a load! This movie knows better, rather by making every other character's problems bow down to Ronnie's. In the Last Song, he delivers this performance, deserving the praise that Mo'Nique received playing Mary Jones. Never mind the fact Ronnie frequently shoplifts and snubs Julliard just to make a point. It's really him who's to blame for everything. How dare you fall out of love and pursue a career that makes you happy, only to have the audacity to want to mend the wounds of your broken hearted family? I rooted throughout for Ronnie as she continuously tried to reconstruct the layers of guilt and avoidance upon his shoulders. That leads me to my one grievance of this movie; a rebellious teenage girl visiting her estranged dad and blames one of her separated parents for breaking the family apart. Really Nick? That's all just too unfamiliar of a premise for me. At best, the closest Ronnie ever came to resembling a character from one of your previous features was Diane Keaton's daughter from Nights in Rodanthe (pauses) Ohhh!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved it!! Don't get all the bad reviews...,"The Last Song has been receiving bad reviews, and to be honest I don't really know why. When I saw the 3.9 average on this web site I was kinda chocked!!!O.K I agree, the movie is not a masterpiece. But I've seen it in theatre last Wednesday, and I was surrounded by people laughing throughout the movie, and crying by the end. If a movie is so bad as to receive a 1/10 like some people have given it, than why would people be so moved by it and respond to it so well?In my opinion, Greg Kinnear was terrific and Bobby Coleman, who plays Miley's little brother, deserves more credit that he gets! His performance in the movie is amazing! He alone makes it worth seeing the movie. As for Miley Cyrus. What's up with all the hate!?? I think people are way to harsh on her! Does her performance deserves an Oscar, of course not. But I do think that she held her own in the movie and let's not forget that it is her first role apart from Hannah Montana. Give the girl a break. I think she did a great job!As for people criticizing the storyline, saying it's too predictable, or cheesy or what not. I say this: what romantic comedy, or any romantic movie is not predictable? I thought Dear John was more predictable than this one, and what about Leap Year also released this year. Now that was cheesy and soooo predictable. But you know what, I still enjoyed it and so did a lot of people.So if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh, make you cry, feel frustration, that is beautifully shot in Georgia, then go see the Last Song without too much expectation and I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Waste of time and money,"I'll admit I was excited at first to see this movie. I had just finished the book a couple days ago and was psyched to see such an incredible book brought to the theater. The book was amazing: funny, romantic, sad, cheerful, pretty much everything you could want in a book. Well, everything that made the book great was taken out in this appallingly horrible movie. It felt torturous to watch what with Miley Cyrus absolutely slaughtering the character of Ronnie. After finishing the book, I realized I couldn't see her as the character, but I figured she couldn't be too horrible. Oh how wrong I was.I didn't believe Miley Cyrus for a second during the real pivotal scenes in the movie. Her tears/crying scenes were laughable. Her attitude problem phase was obnoxious. The only relationship I believed was the one between her and the guy and that's because they're dating off screen. Oh how difficult it must be to act like you're in love with you're real life boyfriend. I wouldn't even call her performance mediocre.And then comes the fact that this movie didn't even somewhat resemble the book. They took out the best scenes. They changed nearly EVERYTHING. They cut the preacher and the important back-story of her father. They didn't introduce the slightly similar sub plot with Scott very well at ALL. It was hinted at throughout the book, but in the movie it was sudden and not very well done at all. Actually, the majority of the scenes were done opposite of how they were done in the book, making them really bad.Scott was more important in the book. Marcus was WAY more important in the book and he was one of those characters that was really kind of creepy. He was supposed to be a sociopath in the book, but in the movie he was just an annoying jerk.They completely changed Ronnie's reasoning,the reason Will fell for Ronnie, and many more things. In the book they really showed how Ronnie was different than other girls. In this movie,Miley Cyrus made Ronnie seem like every other girl but with an attitudeproblem. Miley played her as such a clingy, needy girl instead of the independent, self-assured, and intelligent girl she was.Then again, they changed more than they kept. If you want to know the GOOD story of The Last Song, do yourself a favor and buy the book. This movie wasn't worth the time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
I am not a fan of Miley,"The movie actually surprised the heck out of me. I purposely did not watch it because I am not a fan of Miley. But tonight for whatever reason I decided to watch it. It is the first movie to make me cry in a very long time. I thought that she and Chris Helmsworth had great chemistry and the love was believable. Then I look at IMDB and 9 years after the movie came out Miley and Chris are newlyweds. The little brother was amazing, I thought his acting was great. Of course it goes without saying that Greg Kinnear play the part fantastic. I do agree that most of the bad reviews were because they were not a fan of Miley. This was a lesson to a 55 yr old woman to never judge a book or in this case a movie by its cover or to judge it for the girl that has made some poor choices in her life. Shame on me for judging....",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Touching story of a father reconnecting to his children,"(Synopsis) ""The Last Song"" is set in a small Southern beach town in Tybee Island, Georgia, where Steve (Greg Kinnear), a divorced father, gets a chance to spend the summer with his teenaged daughter Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and his young son Jonah (Bobby Coleman). Ronnie would rather be in New York City than be in this hick town, especially with her father, who she believes abandoned her three years earlier. Steve tries to reconnect with Ronnie through their love of music. Steve was a concert pianist who loved teaching Ronnie how to play the piano. Ronnie became so good at playing, that Juilliard has offered her a scholarship. This is a story of family secrets that revolves around first loves and second chances.(My Comment) This is a touching story of a father reconnecting to his children, and of his children learning the lesson of life. It shows how different types of relationships can end up breaking your heart and giving you pain and what you must do to mend your heart. I thought it was slow at the beginning of the movie, but it drew me in and I began to accept the characters. This is a good movie that shows all the trials and tribulations that teenagers go through in life. And you may even shed a tear at the end.

"One thumb down, One as confused as Miley Cyrus","Alright, first I shall note that I have not read the book. I hadn't even seen a trailer for this film before I had gone. I went with my mother and sister who had both read the book and more than enjoyed it. I really had no idea what this story was even about. I walked in with a completely open mind.The acting in this movie was wonderful. On almost every account also. Greg Kinnear was amazing in the movie and the boy who played the son I was even impressed with. Miley Cyrus seemed to be the only exception. I hated her acting from the moment the movie began. As the movie went forth, I started to change my mind at times. She had no problem changing it back though. She was so off and on through out the entire film. She looked confused at times and when she actually had to show emotion like anger it was as if she didn't know what to do. But enough of that.The story at times seemed rushed and misunderstood. Everything was predictable. The portions of the movie where I actually felt as though I was supposed to cry seemed to happen so fast that I felt like I didn't have time to understand how the characters felt. There were major holes in the plot that I still had questions about and it drove me nuts at times. There were a couple of times where I actually felt like I was enjoying it but they came and went quickly also. The whole movie, and please remember that I absolutely knew nothing about this story before hand, I felt like I had nothing to look forward to.In the end I would say that I wouldn't suggest paying to see this in theaters. I definitely wouldn't buy it on DVD and I probably wouldn't even recommend renting it later. If by some chance you get an opportunity to see it for free and you're curious then go for it. I'd also like to mention that, from what I understand from my mother and my sister, this movie completely differs from the book so don't expect what you've read and definitely don't get to excited for this.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
How can anybody not be touched by this?,"And how can it have the score of 3.2?It was one of the most touching and real movies I have ever seen, and I've seen my share of great touching movies (Casablanca, Wuthering Heights, The Notebook, It's A Wonderful Life, Rain Man).I'm not comparing this movie with the greatest movies of all time, I'm only saying that it has the heart and soul to be a film that you remember and cherish in your heart.When this world becomes more and more apathetic with each day passing, I think this film brings back the feelings that we forgot and neglected, and that's just not a bad thing.I give this movie 10/10, because it crawled underneath my skin and into my heart.

It was just so..... flat,"I didn't read the book, didn't want to. A bunch of my friends went to go see this movie, and I went with them. There are a few things wrong with this movie. First, Miley Cyrus cannot act. I mean, at all. It's painful to watch. Second, there is no originality. Just mix up a bit Twilight and most of Dear John, and you've got rather predictable The Last Song. Third, the characters. Ronnie is annoying enough without Cyrus, unbearable with her. She was such a brat at the beginning that I felt no pity the rest of the movie. Will makes several idiotic mistakes that cause Ronnie to have another temper tantrum. The little brother is cute, but irritating at times. Overall, this is just a flat, overrated chick flick that has the depth of a Disney Channel movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

A really poor storyline and poor acting,"Miley Cyrus fans might hate me for saying this, but the makers of ""The Last Song"" should have hired a real actress for the lead role. Miley obviously doesn't have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I've seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her.That said, ""The Last Song"" is a bust. It's a set of tired old recycled and clichéd experiences and really isn't worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I've always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of ""The Last Song"" signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn't save this film. They'd have to find some writers who were at a minimum mediocre-ish in order to improve this story.All I can say is save yourself and watch something else.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"The rare time that the story, script is the best part of a Sparks movie","The story is pretty standard trope driven melodrama that Sparks does. If you like his other movies-I largely do!-this one should work for you. The script is better than a lot of the other adaptations because it is missing off-putting elements or ad hoc climaxes that can crop up in Sparks' work. Indeed, I think the blend of romance with family dealing with illness is one of the more competent stories Sparks has put together.Sadly through, where other films make up for the weaker writing with casting, cinematic treatment this one is hamstrung by the cinematic elements. Cyrus and Hemsworth are ill-matched as lovers. Cyrus is not a gifted actress and the central performance is borderline hilarious. Add in that the film does not have any of the escapist fantasia of the other films and this plays like a lifetime film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Where do we start...,"It's been 5 years since I've reviewed a movie on IMDb, but oh... I am compelled! Where do we start? One of the producers has the last name of Cyrus, so I guess that explains a lot. But let's forget Miley's ""acting"" and address the story itself. I've always thought Sparks overuses death to illicit emotion in his readers/viewers (even though The Notebook and Message in a Bottle are two of my favorite films). But that aside, was there a single un-contrived moment in this film? They (whoever ""they"" is) tried to squeeze every type of plot device imaginable into this movie.

She meets a charming guy and falls for him, but unfortunately life gets in the way.""The Last Song"" is quite a weak Nicholas Sparks story because it cannot decide what it wants to be. Is it a romantic story between two teenagers, or a drama about an estranged father and daughter relationship? The first half is the former while the second half is the latter. The film appears to be a forced hybrid between the two, and is not helped by the constantly grumpy Miley Cyrus. She and Liam Hemsworth don't even look right together for this film.

Bro-Approved,"When I saw the preview to this movie I thought, ""Great. Another movie starring a singer. Troubled and Juilliard-worthy. She's trying to push those CDs out them doors eh?"" I was pleasantly surprised that that wasn't the case at all. Though the soundtrack is good, the movie isn't all about music. In fact, Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) hardly played the piano or sang. There weren't awkwardly contrived reasons for her to sing either. Well, maybe one. But it was done in good taste, and I applaud the screenplay and direction for going that route. I suspect that because the story had much more to it than a pop star lead.As a grown man (or so I like to think), I'm a bit ashamed to say that Hannah Montana nearly made me cry in public. I had to take a breath. I held it in. Like a man should! :) Don't get me wrong. The acting wasn't mind-blowing, but it wasn't bad either.

A moderately sad film with Ms Cyrus giving a surprisingly solid performance.,"I was really impressed with the acting quality of several of the actors and actresses in this film. The young boy who plays Jonah (Bobby Coleman) does a magnificent job of portraying a youngster fighting his own inner turmoil whilst bravely trying to maintain some kind of peace between his sister and their father. Greg Kinnear does a decent job of playing a man delicately balancing his desire to regain his daughter's affection against her determination to remain stubbornly distanced from him. Miley Cyrus also delivers a surprisingly mature performance; one that suggests to me that, if she keeps performances as good as this up, she will most certainly be able to ensure for herself a successful post Hannah Montana portfolio of roles. Other character parts are all adequately and believably played. The screenplay is well paced with plenty of interesting plot details and a there is a good selection of more or less likable characters with whom to empathise (or otherwise). Cinematography is unremarkable and unobtrusive - yet vibrant and colourful. The film also benefits from incorporating quite an interesting theme (one which the Ronnie character in particular has to come to terms with) as events unfold and difficult decisions have to be taken. Please don't be put off by the ridiculously low rating this film has on IMDb for some reason. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates poignant drama, sensitive acting and gorgeous beach settings.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Disappointing,"This is a perfect example of how to spoil a master piece. I am so sorry for Nicholas Sparks who wrote a wonderful book only to be ruined by a bad screenplay, terrible editing and ordinary acting. All those who have read the book should be able to appreciate what I am talking about. Julie Anne Robinson has tried to use her creativity and tweak the story here and there but all she has managed to do is to ruin the whole plot. Some things are just better left untouched is the lesson she should learn out of it. Miley Cyrus is a huge disappointment and it seems she wasn't a good choice in the first place. She failed miserably to do what Mandy Moore did to ""A Walk To Remember"". On the whole, the movie gives the impression that they have just somehow managed to narrate the whole story in the 108 minutes given to them without really worrying about retaining the emotionally charged plot Nicholas Sparks had created.

Reading This May Save Your Life,"I was in the local Target last week, and I decided to pick up a copy of The Last Song by Nicholas Sparks. I had to read The Notebook in college, so I had a feeling that I would like this novel as well. It definitely did not disappoint. It was hard to put down, and I think I may have finished it in about 2-3 days. It was just that good. I like how Sparks took the time to develop the characters and how nothing in the novel seemed forced (for lack of a better word).After reading the book, I was very excited to rent the movie (RedBox is amazing!) and watch it after work (as a part of my Wine and a Movie event). I can honestly say that I was a little nervous, especially after the debacle that was The Lovely Bones (great book, horrible movie), but I decided to give it a try. I figured that The Notebook was a great Nicholas Sparks adaptation, so why should The Last Song be? Hmmm...that was a HUGE logic FAIL! The movie was horrible! I found myself not being interested in the first 5 minutes, but I felt it necessary to finish the movie to at least give it a chance to redeem itself (which, of course, it did not).Although I am young (24), I am not so naive to believe that a movie based on a book can read exactly the same, but my goodness...were they remaking the same book that I had previously read? I was highly disappointed, mad, and confused. There was no character development, and there were sections in the book that as I read it, I knew would be great in the movie...unfortunately, those episodes went untouched.It just left me asking myself why - why did I rent this movie? why did I not turn it off in the first 5 minutes? why would they waste time and money making this movie? why Miley Cyrus? etc...In conclusion, I advise you to just read the book and use your imagination. You'll come out better that way.",,Anonymous,Music
Start rating this movie properly,"Usually you're really disappointed when you watch a movie, that's based on a book.

I read then the book again, on my way over to USA, and I remembered that there actually was a movie, so I decided that once I'd hit Blockbuster I would rent it.So I and my friends rented it, and I'd told myself to have no expectations at all, since it was a Miley Cyrus movie aka. Hannah Montana.But the movie completely surprised me. Miley Cyrus didn't shine in this movie, in fact nobody shined – but there was still something to it. It followed the book so well, like really well – and Miley Cyrus looked like Ronnie.You can say a lot about the acting, you can say that Miley sometimes sounded a little too Hannah Montana-ish, but I think she broke pretty much out of that shell, or at least she tried.I have to disagree with all the people who think it's flat? What exactly - This is when I start thinking: I think a lot of people judged this movie by the fact that Miley Cyrus plays the lead role, if it had been Emma Roberts or Emily Browning, I think this movie would have gotten a totally different ratings. I cried, I laughed and I loved some parts of this movie. But it's not a Notebook ..",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen!,"What is with the negative critical reception. I absolutely loved this film and I am definitely anticapating the DVD release.My view on Miley's performance was definitely mixed. All the negative reviews of her performance expected me to find her terrible. She was no where near it. She did pretty well for her most mature role to date. Her voice was definitely noticeable, sounding at times trying to hard to distance her origonal voice. But you could definitely still hear that southern girl inside of her. She definitely brang it with her dramatic scenes and deserved more that what people gave her for. The girl gave me shivers down my spine.The film's real breakout star was Bobby Coleman. This kid brang it. He was so believable and absolutely had me crying. The kid brang on the tears and definitely outshined his other cast. Him and Miley had great chemistry and absolutely adored the scenes between them.Another note to newcomer Carly Chaikin as the rebellious Blaze. She definitely made the performance her own and was great. Would love to see more from her in the future.Other notes to Aaron Zigman for his great music score and managed to make every song go with the film.I absolutely loved this movie and I wish this film had a more positive reaction, because this seriously deserved it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
So disappointed,"I read the book before seeing the movie. i couldn't put the book down and i was hoping the movie would be just as good but i was so let down. i (as well as another review had said) kept thinking about the book and all of the important things that were left out. I felt like my friend was missing all the major details. I really loved the book, but walking out of the theater i was actually more mad than anything. It could have been a really great movie, it just needed to be more like the book. I wish there weren't major details left out and parts being completely different from how they were in the book. Some characters weren't nearly as important as they were in the book. I would suggest not reading the book before you see it. you'll be disappointed. I would definitely read the book after though.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Goodbye Hannah Montana - Hello Miley!,"The Last Song is a great movie. It is a coming of age movie but not just a chick flick. All family members will enjoy this movie. Miley Cyrus plays a somewhat troubled teen and blames her troubles on her parents divorce. Her attitude quickly takes a turn when she falls in love and even more of a turn when she finds out that her father is dying with lung cancer. Take a box of tissues to the theatre. Miley plays this dramatic role very well.In this movie you will be introduced to turtle eggs and you will see them crawl back to the ocean when they hatch. I think this is interesting for children of all ages to watch.Go watch this movie and go as a family. We don't get many of these type movies so make it a family day and go. You won't be sorry.Although some young children are upset that the series Hannah Montana has ended, I have to say I am glad. Miley Cyrus has so much more to offer to the entertainment business than her role as Hannah Montana. I think we will see her in many, many, more movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Last Song is impressive, yet seems rushed","Before I watched The Last Song tonight, I came in with an unbiased opinion of Ms. Cyrus; I came out with the same opinion. I read the novel before I watched the film, so I knew somewhat that was going to happen; Mr. Nicholas Sparks wrote the screenplay before the novel, so something was going to be different right? Of course. Though not much was changed, I felt they could have spent more time with the characters, and shown the audience more of an emotional connection they brought to the big screen. I've got to say though, Miley Cyrus handled herself quite well for her first ""non Hannah"" film. They we're certain parts of the movie that was somewhat, corny? For example, ""How did you become so nice? Nice guy school or something?"" I thought to myself, that's an awful line. Although good for some of the audience that was attending the film.The end of the film was a beautiful tragedy with a Father-Daughter relationship at it's peak. The connection Kinnear and Cyrus share is believable; and honestly, more equipped than what I thought I was going to see. Bobby Coleman was wonderful. I loved his lines, and the emotional scenes? I was impressed.All in all, this film was not the greatest of all time, and nor was it supposed to be. It's a film about losing your way, and finding your way back home. It's about first loves, heartbreak, and tragedy; all fit into a impressive Nicholas Sparks adaption. I for one, am glad I went and experienced what this film had to offer.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
miley needs to just give up,"This girl has NO talent whatsoever. She cannot sing and she definitely cannot act. I couldn't enjoy the movie because of her. Anyone..and I mean ANYONE would have been better than miley for this role. She is just too immature for a movie like this. I'm obviously not a fan of her music, but I thought hey..why not go see her on the big screen. Big mistake. It was a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Miley should not call herself an actress. There are plenty of women out there who actually can act, yet i'm so confused as to why Miley was chosen for this movie. I hope she never gets a role like this again.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant,I've been reading all the other reviews for this movie and to be honest I think they are all wrong. The acting is excellent in this film. Miley brings her own personal touch to the character Ronnie. Yes the film is slightly different from the book but you will never find a film that's exact from the book. I would really recommend this movie it has lots of different emotions in it.Miley has also changed the way she acts.Now she is more grown up in this movie and she is playing a part where she has never used her acting in this way. This movie just shows how good of an actress she is. The rest of the cast acting is also very good. The music used in the movie is also excellent.I don't think I can find any faults to this movie and think you should really see the movie before you read the book because you will be disappointed but I didn't see the movie based on the book I saw it because of the trailer. If you like sad emotional films I would really recommend it. Best film I've seen this year.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Sentimental satisfaction can be guaranteed..................,"The movie is all about the love and affection between people. The story line also covers the mistakes done by a person. It really brings the tears from so many people.The movie was so nice when we concern about the relationship between family members. It has a deep mixture of emotions. The character Jonah miller played by the Booby Coleman was superb and his deep adieu to his father was the only reason why most of the people cry. The character played by the GREG was so nice which liveliness to the movie.The story is mainly based on the Ronnie character played by the Cyrus who shows different shade in the movie.Basically most of the people don't like this movie because there are no commercial elements to entertain. The movie was slow in certain areas and it has a great sentimental workout at the ending. It does not have any kind of comedy. We will see the same kind of locations so many times in the movie.But coming to the conclusion-------------It is a typical sentimental movie where we can predict story. It is one of the good sentimental movie but doesn't good as ""Rudy"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption""""IF YOU WANT TO SEE A SENTIMENTAL MOVIE YOU GO WATCH IT ................IT REALLY SATISFY YOU""",7.0,Anonymous,Music
seriously- Miley??,"What on earth were they thinking?? They have completely ruined the book for a lot of people by putting miley as the main protagonist! The movie does not alway need to be utterly true to the book but the audience usually expects the actors to at least try to embody the characters from the book,to try to feel and express their feelings as they do. Now that is something Miley is simply not able to achieve!Her acting is really bad and sometimes you just want to pause the movie and start doing anything else. Anything that might distract you from what she thinks is acting.I almost did that a few times but I surprisingly managed till the end. If you liked the book, I wouldn't recommend you to watch it. It is not worth it.I rated it as 4 just because I liked the other actors (especially dad) and because I still like the book.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Give it a break!,"I've never seen so much hate because of so much overreactions. Honestly.And the only reason is Miley. Because she is in this movie. Because, hadn't she been in it, hadn't there been so much hate. Believe me. This is a typical Nicolas Sparks story, and his stories are highly appreciated. Yet... this story doesn't seem to do. And for what reason? For Miley. And nothing annoys me more than people hating a movie because of the actors. How much can you let something affect you? Seriously? How much? Well, here it is. This movie shows just how much. Miley did a fair job. And this comes from one of the biggest Miley-dislikers. I've never liked her, but I wasn't going to let her affect me from watching this movie. And, I can admit to it, unlike many others, that she DID NOT RUIN THIS MOVIE. Sure, I can say that someone else most surly could've played better, but she did good. And the fact that people complain that she made 'Ronnie' an annoying character, is ridiculous. Ronnie was supposed to be an annoying character. She's a teenager, for Christ's sake! And all this annoyance was just to prove that she was going through some hurt. And that was how Nicolas wanted to portray her. This movie was Miley's own wish, and she wanted to play. And, guess what? She played.I'm not saying this movie is Oscar-worthy, but damn, it's NOT bad! In any way. People are just too blind with their Miley hate that they can't even open their eyes for one second to see the truth of the movie. And it's good. It's a beautiful story. And I find it such a shame that people can't see that. Really, such a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
What a let down...,"All I can say is that I barely got through 20 minutes, and had to stop this horrendous movie.I have really enjoyed other Nicholas Sparks adaptations. This was by far the most ridiculous attempt of a book to film adaptation I have ever seen.Miley Cyrus cannot act. It is painful.She is trying so hard that she is overdoing it. She should just stop acting altogether because there is no hope. She doesn't have the acting chops to accomplish anything (Razzies?).The only reason I gave two stars, is because Liam Hemsworth is really cute.Don't waste your time, energy, or money.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Almost there!,"Let me start by saying the book was incredible. Maybe it doesn't have the greatest plot, but it really portrays the progression and journey of love.

In agreement with pretty much everyone else on here, the young boy who played Jonah has a bright future ahead of him. He really brought emotion to the film. Miley needs a little work on her serious acting, but it can't be an easy transition from Disney to this. The movie didn't flow as well as it could have, but it was still decent! I did shed some tears - not exactly sure whether that was because I knew what was coming, or if the film itself was the cause.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
At least 'The Last Song' was a good one.,"'The Last Song' (based on the eponymous novel by 'The Notebook' scribe Nicholas Sparks) appears to have received much criticism for various aspects of its running time, many of which I can respect, however it strikes me as vicious that viewers are focusing on Miley Cyrus' likability as if it were the overall staple. For a single, external aspect to polarise the audience in such a manner is extremely unforgiving to the bigger picture, and therefore I'll address the Miley factor in a neutral manner. In a leading role separating her from alter ego Hannah Montana, Miley proves she is a blossoming young actress who just needs a few more opportunities like 'The Last Song' in order to find her feet out of a Disney character's shoes. In my opinion her main fault is to play Ronnie, a troubled and troublesome teenager, with a hanging lower lip and fixed gaze for much of the first act, failing to explore why her character is broken. This issue is short-lived however, and Miley plays a happier Ronnie later in the film to a stronger degree, benefiting from her arcing character which should have been developed sooner. In my opinion, the script is at fault for striving to depict Ronnie's demeanour through conventional methods such as bratty behaviour and cocky dialogue. Some may take issue with the watered- down characters (particularly readers of the book) but this is a difficult problem for any screenplay when adapting from the written format.Besides the sole draw of superstar Cyrus, 'The Last Song' tells a touching story about love, life, family and friendship through Ronnie's connection with her estranged father (a suitably cast Greg Kinnear) and the local heartthrob Will, played by Liam Hemsworth who, like Cyrus, should be credited with rising to the part. The comic relief in Jonah, Ronnie's younger brother, is adapted well by an enthusiastic Bobby Coleman who adds some necessary character to a number of scenes, including the overdone shopping spree montage (which in this instant, he saves). Of course the film generally serves itself as a mechanism driving itself towards its inevitable heartfelt ending, although when the time comes the subject matter is dealt with beautifully, the film remaining uplifting as the credits roll to the inspirational 'When I Look At You'. In my opinion it is moments like these which clarify film's success as a thought-provoking reflection of how we might treat our relationships with significant others; while the novel and its author can be credited with crafting this, the medium of film highlights the concept of fragility for all to see rather than interpret.'The Last Song' isn't necessarily exciting or remarkable cinema. What it is, however, is a pleasant and gentle piece that touches on the delicate aspects of life that every one of us can relate to.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Although I am not a Miley's fan, I think the movie is pretty good","Despite the fact that the movie is fairly flat in overall, the drama and emotions were shown more clearly up to the end. Personally, I think Miley may not be the best Ronnie but at least, she was trying to be one. Miley actually made her best efforts to play Ronnie righteously (That can be told through the hospital scenes). While Liam's lack of acting skill made me feel Will is not so real, the actors who play Miley's father and her brother did a great job. Their performances really brought me to tears. Anyway, in my opinion, the movie is absolute not such a waste of money and time (like someone here has said) but a good family movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
IRL Heartbreak,"It's a perfect summer romance movie, and Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint there! Just kills me knowing this onscreen love was real off screen too, but wasn't strong enough to last.

"Heart-tugging and addictive, Nicholas Sparks gives his take on teen angst","'The Last Song' is another Nicholas Sparks adaption and one of the weaker ones. It's also been aimed at the teen angst audience with Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth as the romantic leads. On that note I guess if I was 20-ish years younger I would have enjoyed it more than I did.The story is predictable and heart-wrenching, because well, Nicholas Sparks wrote it and he loves to torture us, following a father and daughter who after a long estrangement slowly reconnect over a summer in a small Southern beach town through their mutual love of music.Cyrus plays the bitter wild-child Ronnie who falls for the often shirtless but very employable Will. They both have a lot of secrets and struggle to carry this movie as newbie actors. Miley giggles and squeals her way through the romance while Liam just stands about looking good.I did enjoy Greg Kinnear as the doomed father and the boy playing his son was like a breathe of fresh air. As with all of Sparks' movies the coastal scenery is beautiful and the storyline about forgiveness, acceptance and family shamelessly manipulative but oh so addictive. 2/14/16",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A obviously bad film.,This is a obvious bad movie. I'm pretty sure everyone that went into the theaters went in and knew this was going to be crap. Everyone at least had doubts about it because Miley Cyrus is given the lead role. If you thought that Miley Cyrus was going to do a good job and show some acting chops then you were probably living in denial. To be fair this movie would had been mediocre even without Miley Cyrus in the lead (although she didn't help things) the reason why is that the book from Nicholas Spark's was crap so the odds were good that the movie was going to blow too. The movie even seemed like it was going to bad after the opening credits. Almost like the movie wanted to be seen as much as the reluctant boyfriends that were dragged to see it.,4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Interesting Movie, Really Rushed, Miley can(believe it or not) act,","I just got back from watching the Last Song. It was an interesting movie. Honestly, it's kind of hard to critique, considering there wasn't much you could really ""critique"". The movie was all in all a typical drama/family/romance movie. There is no way this movie will ever win any awards, maybe a teen choice award or something, but it does offer something, and for me, that was entertainment. I'm a guy, and I have to admit, the movie made me laugh at times, and I even cracked a smile or two. Sometimes I laughed at the somewhat corny lines, okay really corny, and sometimes I laughed because I felt it was actually funny (and not in a bad way). It was a nice movie to look at, and sometimes that's really important. The acting, for the most part, being about 60%, was believable. It was by no means completely awful, like some movie critics are making it out to be. The story was really rushed though. That was the big problem for me. It needed to be more dragged out. But, hey, maybe that's what made it entertaining to watch.People are saying that the first 30 minutes of this movie is embarrassing to watch. I thought it was my favorite part. The scenes I liked most in the movie were with Ronnie and her brother Jonah. I thought they connected more than Ronnie and Will. Ronnie and her dad were believable, but sometimes I felt it was pushed to be too lovey dovey.Miley Cyrus. I'd give her performance a 7/10, just like this review. I thought she did a reasonable, if not satisfying job at making this movie worth watching. She definitely has acting abilities. Heck, I liked her. My prediction is that she'll get better over time in her acting. I'm not even going to compare her to her previous work. If this was her first movie ever, I'd say she did a good job. I'm sort of eager to see how she does in future movies.The Last Song is a good movie, despite all the critical reviews. It has it's downfalls, but, it's still very watchable. I'd recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice Looking Foliage,"After seeing this movie, I don't think it is too harsh to say that I really do hope it lives up to its title. The Last Song is a nearly two hour cliché. An upside is the acting of Greg Kinnear who is quite moving as the ailing Steve Miller. There are moments when the drama within the Miller family is touching but you snap out of it easily as if anticipating Miley Cyrus breaking out into song. I am not even sure whether the casting is right. Miley may have her fair share of fans as a singer but as an actor, she can seem rather stiff. It's a good thing though that Georgia is scenic because there are times in the film that I did end up watching the scenery.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Only Kinnear is good and he makes it funny and dramatic,"I was wary but still optimistic about ""The Last Song"" and Miley Cyrus's foray into drama. But, oh, I was disappointed. She needs to stick to ""Hannah Montana"" and similar romantic comedies. The film's opening with Cyrus as the misunderstood, rebellious teenage daughter was just painful to watch.Not being familiar with the book, I wasn't expecting this film to be as dramatic as it was. There was more than just Cyrus and her summer love storyline. Her interactions with her father (Greg Kinnear) were funny, heartwarming, touching, mature, and sincere. That is mostly credit to Kinnear's natural ability. He's genuinely funny and honestly dramatic. His character always comes across exactly as he's supposed to. Perhaps Greg Kinnear is the next great actor of his generation? I'll certainly be watching more to find out.The movie on the whole, was all rather safe and inconsequential. The development of Cyrus's character was very obvious and expected; the ups and downs in her summer love relationship were rather pathetic; and although her relationship with her father deepened quicker than it was supposed to, that at least was enjoyable and kept me watching the film. Kinnear fans are not the target audience for ""The Last Song"" but his talent makes this film watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful tear jerker!,"I read some reviews that paint The Last Song in a bad light, but I liked it. It was a touching film, well written, well acted and directed, and in my opinion the actors were perfectly cast for their parts.The screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' bestseller is a deeply emotional story of young love, the process of maturity, the crucial choices in our lives. have not read the book, and thus cannot comment upon the fealty of this film to Sparks' manuscript, but its emotional tone and import is certainly consistent with his other works with which I am familiar. This is the kind of film where you cringe at one moment from the stilted dialogue and then burst into tears over a love that knows no bounds the next moment.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
good,"Don't like any of the Hanna Montana songs or her early career. So went to this film expecting the worst. the film actually turned out well. Not a chick flick but more of a drama. Miley Cyrus did a pretty good job considering her goofy early dramatic and music work designed for popular appeal to certain kids. This film is actually interesting with good acting by the brother, father and the rest of the cast.This film had an interesting story and is the kind of film I would not have even gone to had there been anything in the theater I had not already seen. it actually could be liked by any age. I, personally, think that Miley Cyrus may change direction in her career. She recently took her real fathers name in an official name change. I expect that Miley will not follow in the footsteps of other Disney losers like Britney Speers and Lindsay Lohan. This film is a step in the right direction but her recent American Idol appearance was pretty bad. The film is worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Miley Pouts Her Way Through The Last Song,"I read the book and although it wasn't terribly exciting or all that good I enjoyed it. The plot was simple and predictable but had it's charms. Ronnie was a very unlikable character, and I just couldn't help but picture Miley Cyrus as Ronnie because I had already seen the trailer prior to reading the book. That kind of ruined it for me. I was actually somewhat excited to watch the movie and wasn't as disappointed as others. Having been an actress all my life Miley's performance was hard to watch but at certain times I could ignore her pouty lips and try to follow what was actually happening (which wasn't much). Liam, who plays Ronnie's love interest, was not as bad as I had imagined and actually has some potential as an actor. For those of you who know they like sappy, predictable movies with bad actors go watch The Last Song but other than red eyes it will leave you with nothing. If you're really eager to see what Miley can do, like I was, I suggest watching it on the internet rather than renting it. It will save you a lot of regret.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

There were even some tears shed by my otherwise cynical 13-year-old daughter. It was a refreshing change to see the lead girl not portrayed by a plastic blonde with perfect teeth, although the lead guy was probably too good-looking and perfect. Turns out the guy's older brother got the lead in Thor, so that gives you an idea of what he looks like. I give it a solid 7, if only to balance out the Miley Cyrus haters.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Not the Hannah Montana kind of actress, I mean a decent serious actress.The plot is okay, the has to go to her dad, she did not saw him for years and hates him. Dad is ill, she likes him now. She get to know a boy and they fall a love. Then a happy end. It is standard and predictable. BUT most girls like that kind of stuff so its a good movie to cuddle to.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Considering...,"I'll be honest with other movie-goers: my college friends and I elected to see this movie during a girls night out, if only ""ironically,"" you know, to see a potentially bad movie and laugh at it. Clearly, 80% of the audience crammed in the theater with us was there for the same reason.I was pleasantly surprised.I've never been a Miley Cyrus fan because I feel like she's a poor singer riding on the coattails of her father whilst her family pushes her heavily from behind.All in all, I've seen more terrible movies.I never read the actual book and for this I apologize, but be aware I'm grading this movie as precisely that: a film.The acting was sitting somewhere between Disney channel and Oscar award-winning: not terrible but not fantastic. There were certain moments when I cringed and thought ""really, director? you couldn't fix that?"" But there were also moments when I was pleasantly surprised.Note to the audience: Miley Cyrus isn't incredible, but the boy who played her little brother was and Greg Kinnear, as per usual, was quiet awesome. Kelly Preston wasn't great but, when remembering that the filming of this movie fell somewhere near the death of her sweet son, she was fine; god bless the Travolta/Preston family.The relationship between Miley and her on/off-screen boyfriend was rushed; my friends and I were aghast by some of their actions because we couldn't tell how much time had passed since the beginning of their relationship and, we wondered, ""isn't it a little soon for this?""The emotional element of this movie was pivotal, as it is with most Nicolas Sparks book-to- screen projects. Miley Cyrus got better as the movie progressed but still didn't quite reach the level that Rachael McAdams did in ""The Notebook."" Not to compare actresses, but Nicolas Sparks is, in and of himself, a completely different genre of ""love movie.""I felt as though the subject of Ronnie's college attendance wasn't addressed aggressively enough; the movie makes several mentions of it but suddenly she makes a big decision that didn't seem contextual enough.On a completely rude note, this film was too dramatic and emo for me; I understand if that might be book related, but I just don't think it was; in the past, Mr. Sparks has wanted the audience to connect with him, not feel battered by emotional waves. i thought this movie was predictable and emo; that's not necessarily bad, but there it was.If you want a good romp through summer romance off your cuff, this movie is quite suitable. If you want to see Greg Kinnear highlighted like the star he is and sent to the Oscars for recognition, this is not it. People who love the metaphorical and subtle essence of film: look elsewhere.

"Open your eyes, this is actually a good movie..","I've just read a couple of other reviews on this movie, and it makes me sad that you people give it 1-3 stars.. So, yeah you're aloud to have your own opinion, but seriously, was it really that bad? No it wasn't! I actually liked it very much. I'm neither a fan or hater of Miley Cyrus, and I got to say her acting is far away from the best I've seen, but absolutely not the worst either. People are having way to much prejudices against her.The story itself is a bit thin and has some clichés, but it was okay. Ronnie's character can be a bit annoying, but turns out to be a very caring character as she helps both Blaze and the turtles. Otherwise, the other characters don't really stand out very much it's like they're only a part of the story in a way. Although, there is a lot about Ronnie and Will's relationship in the movie, I think that most of the movie is centered Ronnie and her relationship with her dad.It's a sweet, warm and sad story that I liked very much. Folks open your eyes, this is not a bad movie, certainly not, and that's why I give it 8 / 10 possible points. I think Miley did a good job, so did the rest of the cast, and I love Greg Kinnear, a great actor!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The Last Song""","A drama centered on a rebellious girl who is sent to a Southern beach town for the summer to stay with her father. Through their mutual love of music, the estranged duo learn to reconnect.Well you could probably already tell I would have no whatsoever 'expectation' for this movie. It did sound like an interesting film, let's get that straight. It had potential to be something at least average. It had potential to be more, possibly. But there's only one reason why this movie doesn't get it right is Miley Cyrus. If your going to try to provoke the audience to feel something, to move them, do not cast Miley Cyrus. She's a gimmick, and she has no acting talent whatsoever. Her antics are laughable, and her ways to try to ""act"" are just so funny. The rest of the cast was a bit of a joke too. Who casts two horrible lead actors? I mean, are they really trying to approach nonsense? Are they really trying to make this a serious movie? Because nothing is done in a professional way. The movie looks as if it was produced my a bunch of whiny teenagers who were such BIG fans of the novel. This was directing by a first-timer, but that doesn't give it any excuse for trying to get past the clichés. Did I forget to mention? If your going to attempt to move the audience, creating something the audience has already seen is not going to do anything. Quite frankly, it's going to make the audience cringe.This movie will only appeal to your teenage daughter. It's a chick flick, that consists of being as formulaic as most everything today. And that sucks, because maybe the movie had potential. But potential that would never be savored. If you like horribly-acted chick flicks with no depth or emotion, here it is. If you like movies in general, avoid at all costs.1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The Last Song,"When I began reading The Last Song, my first thought was this is the perfect book to read to finish out the summer. I thought it would be light, but an enjoyable read. To my delight, it became so much more as I read more of Ronnie's story.Ronnie and her brother Jonah are sent to North Carolina to spend the summer with their estranged father. Their father left his prestigious position at Julliard to pursue his dream of being a concert pianist. His time away put a strain on his family and eventually ended his marriage. He now calls Wrightville Beach, NC home.Ronnie never forgave her father for ruining their family. In fact, she hasn't spoken to him in three years. She's livid that her mother is forcing her to do this. As soon as she sets foot in her father's house, she's determined to plan her return back to New York. As soon as she enters her father's house, she puts distance between them by spending her first night away from his home. It's on this night that she first meets Will followed by Blaze. It's this night that will change her summer.The Last Song is told in four differing points of view: Ronnie, Steve, Will and Marcus. Through each perspective, Mr. Sparks reveals more of the story and at times flashing back to the past to provide more history. Each character has something to add to the events of that summer and reading it in his or her own voice adds to the realness of the story.Early on I had a hint of how the novel would end. As I realized my assumption was right, it didn't prepare me for the emotions I felt as I continued to read. The Last Song isn't only about love. It's also about learning how to forgive yourself for your past mistakes so you can move forward. This is evident as Ronnie struggles to forgive herself for allowing her anger and hurt to prevent her from having a relationship with her father. During this summer, Ronnie realizes despite her behavior, her father's love remained unconditional.Steve, Ronnie's and Jonah's father, spends time quietly reading his Bible. It's during these devotionals, that Steve has forgiven himself and draws closer to God. Mr. Sparks did a fantastic job of using Steve's devotions to illustrate that through God, new beginnings are possible, despite your past, if you have faith, believe and put your trust in God. He continues to illustrate new beginnings by restoring broken relationships between a parent and child, the destroying and reconstruction of a church and learning to love and respect yourself.The Last Song is an emotionally charged novel, one that I highly recommend. I suggest you read with tissues nearby. It will grabbed the reader and won't let go until the very last page.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The last song,"The last song is a movie based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. It was directed by Julie Anne Robinson and the principal characters, Ronnie and Will are played by Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth. It takes place in a small coastal town in southern United States, where an estranged father sets out to spend the summer with a reluctant teenage daughter, who prefers to stay at home in New York. The father tries to reconnect with his daughter through all they have in common, music. It is a story of family, friendship, secrets, forgiveness, second chances and first loves. It is a really predictable movie, with a nice story, where we can appreciate the evolution of the main character, it isn't just about a romantic story, it is a dramatic story linked with a love story. It is totally a movie for teenage girls, especially the ones who love to cry.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Who knew Miley was a robot.,"While in my opinion the movie itself had many faults in the story. The story actually wasn't that bad... it wasn't that good either. However the acting in this movie was something out of a classic horror flick. The worst actor in this movie was its star Miley Cyrus. Many times a line would call for fluctuation in tone or heck emotion. But what was give in was dead pan face with monotone voice. The male lead had his moments of charm and decent acting, but then it would seem as though he took an acting tip from Cyrus. And suddenly he to was dead pan an monotone. The only saving grace of this movie is Greg Kinnear as the father. Cause lets all just face it, it doesn't matter what role Mr. Kinnear is playing he is fabulous. Also as a pleasant surprise was Bobby Coleman as Jonah Miller. The kid is an outstanding actor who made his pain, joy, and adorably little brother incredibly believe able. As he said in the movie to Cyrus's character ""you maybe older, but I'm smarter than you"", apparently though younger he is also the better actor.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
The Last Time I'll ever see this movie!,"The movie started off with a supposedly rebel Ronnie, (Miley Cyrus did an awful portrayal of the character), who after a few things happening changed into ""Daddy's little girl"". Come on! She hated her father, wouldn't even greet him, and then THAT girl. It's hard to believe. Not even to mention that what one called ""acting"" wasn't proved so by the two love birds, Ronnie and Will, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth. In my opinion this movie was one of those that it was a great book- but wrong choices are made, and we are left with a movie that we end up hating.And so honestly if you were planning on watching this movie, because after all you watched ""The Notebook"", ""A Walk to Remember"", ""Dear John"", all of the Nicholas Sparks' books turned into movies, well I would recommend you to do the following: first, if you are at your local movie rental place, put ""The Last Song"" down. Second, grab whatever movie is at your reach. Third, run away like a mad chicken!",4.0,Anonymous,Music
This was an AMAZING moving!,"I hate that critics are giving this moving so many bad reviews, it don't deserve it! Nicholas Sparks did an amazing job writing this story and the director did an awesome job making it come alive! People need to understand that this is Miley Cyrus's first big role away from Hannah Montana....where I have you she got to play a role that hit closer to home for her. She just needs time and encouragement to break away from her role on that show. She does have a talent at acting. I thought she did a pretty darn good job at this movie, these people who say she can't act....can they act? Have they tried? I pretty much can guess no on that one. As for the the kid playing the brother....he is so darn cute and really brought the brother to life! The dad was amazing as well! Liam he is going places in his acting, he did a great job! As for the people who complain about the movie not touching base very well with the book....what do they expect? They have to turn a story with so many details into a hour or two movie! Duh! That's why they say watch the movie first then read the book so your not so disappointed with the movie. In all I give this movie a BIG two thumbs up!

Last Song is OK.,"I can't explain why I'm watching The Last Song on a snowy Monday night here in PA. I decided that it was time to stop bashing Miley Cyrus acting ability and actually watch this movie. I am NOT a Miley Cyrus fan. I am NOT fan of formulaic date movie poo. Sadly it does have a date movie feel but I can honestly say I was surprised to see a fair performance made by Cyrus. At times it was forced but she was giving an honest effort. Also this movie was not a ""Miley Cyrus songs vehicle"" either, which I was thankful. By no means is this a breakthrough performance by Cyrus! She has a long road ahead before she can achieve an A-list status. I found the chemistry between Liam Hemsworth and Cyrus ""cute"" if not a little unbelievable. Hemsworth is much taller than Cyrus. A foot taller. It looked like Cyrus was suffering from dwarfism. Kinnear and Preston are good as any veteran actors. Although Preston ""Divorced Mom-I got kids"" bit makes me wonder if Preston has lost her acting focus. There is no need for me to go into a plot summary about The Last Song because if you seen one date movie you seen them all. It's better than most summer love movies. Give it a shot!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I'd see it again.,"I really wanted to see this movie for two reasons: I am a sucker for chick flicks and don't there are enough of them, so anything that Nicholas Sparks does is just amazing in my book. I found out that Hemsworth and Cyrus were dating. This meant that there would be true chemistry and there wouldn't be awkwardness.I should say, I was very happy with their chemistry on screen. No awkwardness. Their scenes just seemed to flow with ease and were seemingly realistic to a real teenage romance.Miley Cyrus's acting could have been better. However, I don't necessarily think it *should* have been better. Hannah Montana is more of an amateur show... you don't have to act well to get a kid's attention. This was Cyrus first 'professional' role and I think that she held her own. Was her performance amazing? No. But it wasn't completely awful. Some parts of the movie she had better acting then others... and I think that is what showed promise. Her acting will improve. I don't think we have to worry about that. Her performance, was none-the-less refreshing. I think that this was a difficult role to fulfill with a non-stop range of emotions. She was able to captivate all of those emotions, even if they weren't all perfect.Liam Hemsworth... I thought he did wonderfully with his accent. I am from the South (South Carolina). I know my Southern accents. There were some points in the movie where he had a straight Southern accent. (No overdoing... it just sounded natural to me.) Other points it sounded like he just had an average American accent. I think, though, this was probably because of the way they filmed it. My guess is that the more he worked on the movie, the better his accent got. Anyways... he definitely NEVER overdid it, which is something that always bothers me. I was very happy with his accent.As far as his performance... it was great... I loved it. Yes, it could have been better, but again, I don't think it should have been better. This was his first American film... and he held his own.As far as the other parts of the movie... I felt the acting was fine. It wasn't awkward or non-realistic. The story line was good.And my last comment...They didn't destroy the South! I hate it when movies try to make the south out to be such a horrible place with stupid idiots. This movie didn't do that and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I'd see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The Last Song"" is excessively melodramatic because it offers a story that is composed of numerous dramatic and romantic themes, that are not properly explored","The young American actress Miley Cyrus burst into her first television role right away playing Hannah Montana, a child-teen popstar who, without anyone noticing, wore a tacky blonde wig to perform in the art world. Without the wig, the girl was simply Miley and, in this way, she could go about her anonymous student life. Like High School Musical, Camp Rock and others, the series became a major financial success for Disney, with movies and millions of licensed products. But Miley got tired of wearing the wig and decided to become an actress. The Last Song, 2010) is her first dramatic challenge. But apparently, the young woman still has a lot to learn ahead of her.The story is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, the fashion author, who since Message in a Bottle (1999) has seen his novels hit the big screen on an almost industrial scale: A Walk to Remember, 2002) made countless teenagers cry over the interrupted love story; Nights in Rodanthe, 2008) followed the same path, but targeting more mature audiences; Dear John, 2010) came soon after, following the difficult-to-maintain romantic line, with a hint of 'war' seasoning the story. Here we come to The Last Song, which begins to establish recurring characteristics of the writer, such as his fixation on beaches far from 'society', love letters (in this case of paternal love), and illnesses interrupting the dreams of those who populate their worlds.Miley Cyrus is Ronnie Miller, a teenager disgusted with everything and everyone who is forced to spend a summer season at her father's house (Greg Kinnear, once again excellent), with whom she has had a difficult relationship since he and her mother (Kelly Preston) broke up. With his younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman, surprisingly good) he will live moments of rapprochement, discovery and redemption, from the point of view of the thoughts and attitudes of an extremely irritating teenager from the big city who sees herself as a fish out of water in a small beach town.Despite not taking any risks - you can't go wrong with romances and tragedies in the genre -, the film errs precisely in giving Cyrus the lead role. Embodying the typical revolt that spends much of the film fighting with everything and everyone, the character becomes even more unbearable lived by the young woman. It is only in the sequence in which the girl sings one of her love ballads that a quality edge is found. Perhaps Cyrus should give up acting and really focus on the music, in which she was even nominated for an Oscar for a song she composed in the movie Bolt. In the key moments of the plot, when she was supposed to convince and draw tears, we couldn't feel anything; and this is terrible for the pretensions of the film. Bobby Coleman, who plays his younger brother, is much more convincing and a good actor, showing that Hollywood really has the ability to discover young talents for these roles that, in Brazil, are almost always a pity. His character is very reminiscent of those innocent and imaginative young people of the 80's.Visually very beautiful, the film reminds a little of the country air of the Dawson's Creek series, and some scenes will really stay in the memory of young people, especially Miley Cyrus fans - if one or the other will find this film exceptional, the singer's fans will have the certainty that this is the best they have ever seen in their lives. But don't be fooled: with an obvious structure and all rigged to make people cry at the end, everything that involves The Last Song is premeditated and reused - there's summer love, people's imperfection, young people who do stupid things, the rapprochement with the father, in short, fulfills the manual on how to make a juvenile romance well.The narrative of ""The Last Song"" is excessively melodramatic because it offers the viewer a story that is composed of numerous dramatic and romantic themes, themes that are poorly and superficially explored, therefore, between weak family dramas and vulgar youthful passions, we are confronted with an extremely frivolous production that tries, without great success, to thrill and surprise the viewer through countless sequences that are mostly made up of Romanesque and dramatic stereotypes. The dialogues also follow an unimaginative and stereotyped construction and do little more than state the most obvious facts.Julie Anne Robinson's work is very insufficient. ""The Last Song"" needed a director who could be more ambitious and more imaginative than those responsible for its script, so that it could achieve some qualitative success in a market that is already completely saturated with projects of the same genre. The songs are not very creative and are clearly aimed at a younger and more innocent audience. The high melodramatic load that is presented to us in ""The Last Song"" is not efficient, because the spectator cannot properly follow the successive problems that occur throughout the story. Its romantic aspect is also very superficial and unimaginative, since it obeys a stereotyped construction that puts it on the same level as the overwhelming majority of romantic stories that are carried out by teenagers.There are many themes in The Last Song (The Last Song). There's trust, forgiveness, family - if you can get these themes right, they're sure to touch viewers, because they'll identify with them in their own lives. This is not a dream and fantasy movie. It's about true love on many levels - the love between parents and children, young love that blooms for the first time, affection and mature tenderness between adults. Unfortunately, all these topics are treated superficially, without any depth and full of clichés. In many moments, a lot of time is wasted with idiot teenagers (like the abusive and scrotum boyfriend plot of the first friend Ronnie made on the beach), which ends up postponing the plot of the big turning point of the film (Ronnie's father's illness and Jonah). In the end, it all ends up being a bit rushed and sort of abruptly resolved.The good truth is that this The Last Song doesn't offend anyone and, on top of that, it will still win a good dose of fans for being a beaten story, but told in an intelligently commercial way, even if it adds nothing to the most demanding. The lesson is really for Nicholas Sparks, who also signs the script here, since he has been showing repetitive tendencies and kind of lacking ideas. If he wants to continue seeing his novels conquer the four corners of the world, he needs to reinvent himself. Last Music does not escape the author's tiresome structure.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Nutshell Review: The Last Song,"Once in a while, I'm game for a good dose of sappy romance, and what more than one by Nicholas Sparks, who have had a number of his books, from Message in a Bottle to Dear John all being translated from page to screen. But I guess too much of anything rarely work wonders, even if you throw big name stars in the film to shore up and try and mask all the clichés, and frankly off the heels of Dear John, The Last Song just feels like the neglected twin clamouring hard for attention.Miley Cyrus finally sheds her Hannah Montana persona for the big screen, and it's about time she takes on a role without putting on that blonde wig, or break out into song (although she does for a while here when singing off a few phrases of Maroon 5's She Will Be Loved) and dance. And when I say being too close to Dear John, I mean it through her character Ronnie Miller (Miley Cyrus) being just about the xeroxed copy of Channing Tatum's John Tyree, being taciturn and mean toward the father. But of course with the promise of a budding romantic relationship, all that is about to change, doesn't it always?Enter Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) as the car technician (some brains) / volleyball player (some topless brawn) / aquarium volunteer (with that heart of gold) / tycoon of a rich son (always helps), whose initial arrogance provided that gung-ho spirit in trying to woo Ms Grumpy, before slowly melting away to reveal surprise after surprise that he's Mr Perfect through his patience and troubled backstory that involves an unhappy household. But that aside, boy and girl spend plenty of time frolicking in the sand, sea, and aquarium even, before jealous parties and ex-girlfriends come spoil everything so that it's not as smooth sailing as we'd like to think.Being in love probably means becoming a better person, and through that comes the narrative opportunity for Ronnie to bond with her father Steve (Greg Kinnear), who's spending a lot of time with son Jonah (Bobby Coleman) given her daughter's new found relationship and the trouble in connecting with her nasty demeanour slowly unravelled by Will. I found this part about reconnecting with a loved one a lot more powerful than the romantic one, which in part is thanks to Kinnear's superior performance over Liam Hemsworth, who;s like a cross between Keanu Reeves and Hayden Christensen.For all the real life romance between Cyrus and Hemsworth that came out from this film, I can't deny that it's likely curiosity more than anything else that would put bums on seats, wondering if kisses shown were for reel or for real (I'm inclined to think the latter from what's seen in the film). But the one thing that will irritate, though Twilight fans will come to adore, is the ever-flipping mood swings that Ronnie will have for Will. Oh someone said something bad about you, I'm breaking up with you. Oh wait a minute, your father owns a huge mansion and you're that pained son, I'm so sympathizing with you here's some loving. And it goes on a wash-rinse-repeat cycle. One scene causes problems, the next one patches things back up, and seriously, it's fickle-mindedness and confusion of the highest order.Trust Nicholas Sparks to include into his story more than just the notion of romantic love, and complete with little saccharine sweet things such as sea-turtle hatching, and to break your heart with some tragedy as always. If it's a card to send, you'll likely make it Hallmark, and if a romantic story, you can rely on a NIcholas Sparks written film if only you can stand repetitive thematic clichés getting thrown at you, constantly. It's not perfect, just what you'd come to expect. For once, I'd beg Miley Cyrus to break out into song and dance to shake things up.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
a drama that pulls on the heart strings,"This movie was much better than I expected. Mylie Cyrus is certainly no great actor but she does a believable job in this once she drops the tough girl act. She plays Ronnie, a girl whose been hurt by her parents divorce. She is very talented at playing the piano, earning a place at Juliard, but isn't sure if she will go since she hasn't played since her dad left. Ronnie and her younger brother, Jonah, are spending the summer with their dad at his beach house. Ronnie has no plans to make nice with her dad. She meets a cute guy, Will, that she blows off at first, but once she loses the tough girl act, they start dating.Then, as we suspect, we find out everything isn't so great with her dad and he is writing a last song for her. This is where the tear-jerker scenes come in. The movie certainly tries to be quite sad and everything gets wrapped up at the end.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for fans of Cyrus and teen girls who want to see a sad romantic drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful song,"The last song is a beautiful story of a troubled teen and her love life and her father.Miley Cyrus shows she can do more than sing and dance. She does a great job as troubled Ronnie.

The rest of the cast does a great job as well.I haven't read the book but i hear people talking of the differences. Most people think the movie was written after the book was released, Nicholas Sparks wrote the movie for Miley Cyrus and then preceded to make a book out of the movie. so the differences are simply authors choice.

Jonah ( Bobby Coleman) looked perfect for the 'little brother' kind of person in the movies,and I really love his character in both the book and the movie. As for Steve Miller, his character is good but I think he needs to look paler and more artistic,or more musician-ish. Anyways, this is a great movie, the production and everything.

It was okay,"I never expect that reading a book and watching a movie will tell me the same story, so I never do both. And according to other reviews, the book and the movie do not correspond with each other. If you read the ""trivia"" for this movie, I believe it indicates that the movie was written first for Miley. However, either way, you have to keep in mind that you have to set a time limit for movies so you will not get as much in a movie as you do in a book.I watched this movie on Netflix and chose it because I like Miley. I think she is cute and interesting. It wasn't a bad movie, I was just confused about a few things such as why were they sent to live with their Dad. It didn't seem like he had seen them in a while. The shoplifting thing seemed thrown in there as if that was supposed to answer some sort of question. Overall, I liked the characters. As with most Nicholas Sparks books/movies, you know what the ""sad part"" is going to be. Overall it was predictable but I was just looking for a story where I didn't have to think too much and this fit the bill. I liked watching the relationship between Miley and the blond haired guy.Overall I gave it 6 out of 10. Not a cinematic masterpiece but not crap on a stick either.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"By the Time You Start to Care About the Characters, It's Much Too Late","This movie may as well go down as one of the worst films of 2010. The Last Song features Miley Cyrus in an uneven and whiny performance as a teenage girl experiencing the love of her life during the summer. There is also a church fire, a pyromaniac, family problems, and other things which you probably should but won't care about. Cyrus does have fantastic chemistry with her co-star Liam Hemsworth, but the movie's pluses truly end there. Characters and plot-lines seem to be pulled randomly out of a hat, and scenes which should be emotionally powerful are paired with conflicting music. The scenes between Ronnie and her father are particularly manipulative and forced. Ronnie and Will seem to be on and off, seeing as they are constantly arguing and apologizing instead of having their relationship develop. It is never said why Ronnie (Cyrus) is in love with Will (Hemsworth). The last third saves the film from receiving a 2, but doesn't save the film as a whole. Ronnie is supposed to be unlikable, but you are eventually supposed to feel for her as well. The supporting characters are supposed to be just as interesting as Ronnie, but aren't developed at all. The film is very superficial, underdeveloped, and empty, and fans of the surprisingly well-crafted novel will be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Miley did a wonderful job in this role, however I do think the little boy playing Jonah did better.Greg was amazing as the father and brought tears to my eyes throughout the whole ending of the movie.

"Forced and predictable, but better than it could've been","I saw this movie for two reasons. One is that it is based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. The other is the wonderful Greg Kinnear. I will be frank, the book is much more engrossing emotionally and the characters and story are far more believable. The Last Song isn't completely unwatchable. Greg Kinnear is brilliant and definitely the best asset of the film, the film does look good with pleasant scenery and cinematography and the soundtrack is tolerable.However, I didn't find myself connecting to any of the characters except for Steve or their situations. Here, the characters are quite clichéd and I found myself frustrated with the titular character so many times. The story is weak and predictable and the script is poor too with any attempt at evoking emotion feeling uncomfortably forced.The direction is lacking and the pace is sluggish. The acting apart from Kinnear is hardly noteworthy, I do not like Miley Cyrus and I never found her acting and her attempts to come across as sympathetic and honest believable at all. Out of all the movies based on Sparks' books, which includes the wonderful Notebook, surprisingly decent Dear John and the touching Message in a Bottle, The Last Song is my least favourite. On a positive note, it did have one or two good assets which altogether made it better than it could have been. 3/10 Bethany Cox",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Naive, melodramatic yet wooden. A glorious mess.","Someone told me that the main character in this film reminded them of me at 13 years old (an insult to this film in the first place, seeing as this character is supposed to be that age I am now) so I watched it out of interest.I was amused beyond belief.I loathed the depiction of teenagers. In the weak scene with Blaize and her boyfriend leaving her, I almost laughed, with the ridiculous acting. She looked like she simply had no idea what she was doing so she was simply reading her lines (example, actually saying ""Um"" like it was written, rather than a pause and stutter) and it really trivialised the pain some teenagers go through in that type of abusive relationship. The plot line with Blaize and Marcus could have been very interesting, but the actors were pathetic, I don't even think this was a case of bad writing.Another scene that annoyed/amused me was the ""revelation scene"" when Will was saying about his past, and why he had all those girls etc. his pain, blah, blah, blah. It could have been done so well, but he went for the obvious, and Ronnie pouted, losing all intensity and connection, for me.I actually found Will's character quite likable, and the one scene that made me smile for the right reasons was when they were singing ""she will be loved"" even though it was ruined by another ""Oh my God, Ronnie, there are so many things you are good at."" Being a pianist, and seeing how closely it is connected to the soul, I could understand why Ronnie wouldn't want to play after the divorce, but when she played again the relief and transformation was superficial. At the start, when she wouldn't play, she seemed more moody, I would suggest if she was as special as she thought she was, she would have a depression, not teenage angst. So maybe this is mockery of teenagers, oh, God I hope so. The feeling when she played again should have been immense, like it had never changed inside, not just her ability, and that should have been glorious, but no. She was just cute, and happy, so she kissed her boyfriend a little more and stopped being such a moody cow to her family. That should have been the surface, but apparently it was the depth. The hospital scene was painful to watch, because of the horrible action. Though the scene between Will and the little brother was quite touching.When Will saw Ronnie all glammed up at the wedding, there were even strings and tinkly sounds, which is an example of the glorious clichés used in this film.The ""Don't touch me"" scene could have been incredible, again, but it was weak. There wans't even a quiet power.And the turtles. Ridiculous.The one thing I liked about this film was in fact the music. The way they handled musicianship was horrible, but the music was very nicely used.Maybe I did like that when she started to play again, she showed emotions, it shows how music taps into you true self and soul, but I'm not sure that was the intention of this film.""At least you have the courage to feel"" was a ridiculous thing to sayt o a teenager. More like ""Stop whoring out your emotions to make a pretty face and get a bit of attention."" her playing at the funeral was predictable, but quite lovely, another little saving grace.I suppose true musicianship is something a non-musician will ever understand, and this film does not help to elaborate upon it, so they explore the shallow levels of family and stupid romances.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Miley Cyrus has destroyed a perfectly acceptable movie again,"The Last Song is a nice movie which could have been much better if they found someone else, anyone else, but not Miley Cyrus, to play the part of the teenage girl. Miley certainly has passionate fans. But movie producers pandering to that narrow audience is not the way to build an audience for a movie. Having seen how extremely badly the plump, chubby out of shape Miley ""acted"" without any acting skills - well,this one movie has so turned me off from her, that I will NEVER watch any movie ever again in which she has even a small bit, non-speaking part.Greg Kinnear does a very credible job of carrying the movie as far as it can get carried. The plot and writing are acceptable. But who can stand listening to the gravelly male voice of Miley, let alone having to look at her disgusting face and body. It is little wonder that the costumers of the movie did their best to hide every part of her that they could, despite the fact that the movie is set in the south in the summertime, with other young ladies wearing skimpy bikinis.Even if you like her singing, you have to admit that Miley Cyrus has absolutely no acting skills. In fact they are so bad as to be non-existent, or at least indiscernible.If producers want to make a decent movie, with any respectability at all, and have a chance of making a few dollars profit for their trouble, this movie, The Last Song, says clearly that they need to stay away from Miley Cyrus. Just look at the vote distribution for the movie, practically all 1's or 10's, with very little in between. With more 1's than 10's. All those 1's are votes against the polarizing Miley and how disgusting her performance was in this otherwise decent movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't listen to the critics!,"This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Last Song is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story! Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The dialogue was stilted, the characters never really finish their sentences and shall I go on?

"over-top-acting by Miley Cyrus, terrible screenplay and poor direction will give you headache","When you have Nicholas Spark's credibility to a film, next moment is to get romantic and feel the love and tenderness after watching his novel- turned-into-a-film. The Last Song , however, will spoil the moodA moody girl is forced to stay with her father after her parents got divorced sometime back during one summer in Southern Beach where she finds new love and also re-kindles her affection towards her father.The Last Song was a complete letdown to Nicholas Spark's esteemed novel thanks to over-top-acting by Miley Cyrus, terrible screenplay and poor direction. Frankly speaking , if you have high hopes pinned down on this film , you will be thoroughly disappointed with the pace of the film. It is difficult to find any good scene from the film and that is what will end my review here.Overall , a very bad film in all the context.

This was the best movie ever!,"Fantastic movie! Miley Cyrus is a super actress and she really showed it in this movie. I really liked how she got into character, and showed a special bond with the fellow actors. She also showed movies can be fun without the weighing down of conventions or stereotypes. Many people dislike this movie because it stars Miley Cyrus, but people are going to like this movie, so them giving this movie a 1 is pointless because there are Miley fans who are going to watch it and buy it on DVD.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Last SongLike their seasonal namesake, summer flings are sweaty, sleepless affairs that generally last for two-months before abruptly ending, leaving your body covered in strange rashes and bite marks.Sadly, the summer tryst of the troubled teen in this romantic/drama ends on a much more tragic note.Forced to spend the summer with her estranged/musician father (Greg Kinnear), the unruly, yet gifted, Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) is disgruntled.Her gloomy disposition, however, doesn't dissuade a local (Liam Hemsworth) from romantically pursuing her. Unfortunately, his efforts are trumped by news her father has cancer.Layered with lachrymose love and loss motifs, The Last Song is typical Nicolas Sparks schmaltz made even worse by a lead actress whose awkward jaw is apposite evidence of her scene chewing abilities.As for the best part of a summer romance: You only have to stay fit and look sexually attractive for, like, 12-weeks out of the year.

Sappy Cyrus vehicle,"Miley Cyrus takes on her first dramatic role and like most of this film's critics, I rolled my eyes. However, she was not bad and neither was Kinnear in his part. The flaw of the storytelling lies in Nicholas Sparks's atrociously sentimental and conventional writing. Nothing here is original and the ending is as sappy as always. Yet this is a lot better than the last Sparks film adaptation, Dear John. I could not sit through that idiot piece. This is much better than that and is more watchable, but it still is nothing that cannot be missed in the long run. The beaches are nice to look at and are more compelling than the story we are watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointment...,"I read the book first and it was OK for the summer evening reading. I read Miley Cyrus played the main character in the movie. I had never seen her playing before, but I thought, Ronnie could kinda looked like her - why not...As soon as the movie started, I got so disappointed by her acting. I just could not believe her playing it. I could not believe her lips, her crying, her emotions. Nothing. The only thing I appreciated was the way she looked in the movie - that could be Ronnie :) and Miley's song at the end of the movie. That was nice.However, the very first scene with Ronnie's brother - I was like, yes! this little one is exactly like in the book. I think, Ronnie's father was OK and Will, well he was OK. Did not have much to say in the movie. But I could believe the actor.The movie was in many ways different from the book, but I didn't mind it.All in all, I am happy to have read the book but I could do well without seeing the movie...",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Pretty decent, it's not like we're dealing with a second round of Gigli or Glitter here","So I saw this movie with a friend of mine tonight, who is a big Nicholas Sparks fan. Mid way through the movie, she turned to me and said ""If you haven't read the book, this probably makes little to no sense"". That statement pretty much covers this movie. I haven't read the book, so I knew pretty quickly I was watching a cliché and bad screen play. That being said, what seemed like a train wreck in progress turned out being pretty decent.If anyone deserves something good out of this flick, it is Greg Kinnear (who plays the father character) and Bobby Coleman (who plays Miley's brother). Both did fantastic with their roles. While the movie was filled to the brim with cliché's and excessive montages, these two were able to grab your attention in a positive way. Bobby was exceptional on making you feel for his character on an emotional level, which for a child actor is a rare ability. Greg Kinnear reminded us why he is an underrated actor, eliciting laughter (the good kind) in the most unexpected and emotional places, while at the same time making you feel for his character.As for Miley; I'll be blunt, she wasn't that great. However, I must give credit where it's due: While she displayed limited range, she did not once overact, even if the scene was 'begging' for it. Miley definitely showed a presence in the movie, and while she wasn't the best thing about it, her performance was hardly the worst. Her performance was fairly uneven; bad at some points, but fairly good at others. I think with more practise/instruction, Cyrus could definitely become a better actress.Overall, I'd give this flick a 5/10. It was decent. It's nothing to write home about, but it's not an abomination of Gigli or Glitter proportions either. Despite it's weak screen play and abundance of cliché's, it did hit several people in the theatre in an emotional way, which is kinda the whole point.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Miley Cyrus has got a long way to go.,"Miley Cyrus is trying to prove she is more than just a good singer, but she can be a good actress as well, but her acting needs some work, not that it was all bad, but it just was'nt real in spots. Trying to get away from Hannah Montana is gonna be a long road.Now Liam Hensworth is alright his role, not just being a typical pretty boy. Liam and Miley have good chemistry, but not enough to make the movie interesting. Now Greg Kinnear is quite good as the dad, and so was Bobby Coleman as the little brother, and both of them give quite good performances. And it does have nice scenery. But the rest of the film just does'nt do much, some of the characters are not very interesting.

A Meaningful and Worthwhile Family Drama,"16 June 2013. This teen pop star Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear movie vehicle presents a series of consistently connected family and community life issues that while predictable are intertwined in such a fashion as to make them entertaining, believable, and emotional, and meaningfully relevant. While one could stereotype or be turned off by Miley's character, there is something that seems more significant going here and while the many plot tragedies that continue to build up in this movie, there is oddly enough a rather authentic possibility of such events occurring in with such compelling convergence. This movie deals with the aftermath of divorce and its impact on children, about family, about coming of age, impulsive decision-making, blame and gossip making, jealously, love, hate, making mistakes, and death and forgiveness. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on in this movie in it all something makes sense and never becomes overly juvenile nor nauseatingly repetitive or crisis just for crisis sakes.What is particularly fascinating is that this popular teen format shot in the traditional classic mass audience cinematic photographic and directorial style found in much movie such as Uptown Girls (2003) or Fly Away Home (1996) Whale Rider (2002) that have at their core a animal preservation themes unlike the more raw and gritty independent video approach such Margot at the Wedding (2007) or The Tree of Life (2011), it nevertheless captures the emotive and intellectual interest by its subject matter and what appears to be a close to reality outcomes of each scene as well as the connections between them. The biggest weakness if one can could it that is that this movie doesn't have the focused emotive intensity as one finds in such movies as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or the innovative and dazzling cinematic imagination as found in Moonrise Kingdom (2012) or the scintillating and chilling factor as in The Lovely Bones (2009) or the big screen epic nature as the historical Chinese themed The Joy Luck Club (1993), the more layered emotional diverse comedy drama of Little Miss Sunshine (2006) or even perhaps the singular anguishing search of meaning as Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011). This movie might be more associated with the family dramas as Georgia Rule (2007) or Nanny Diaries (2007).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Greg Kinnear is too good of an actor to be in this film lol. Liam Hemsworth tries too hard in his role, also miscast. The coming-of-age plot feels listless and overdone, and the film doesn't execute it well at all, so you're left with pacing issues and unbelievable characterization growth as the plot moves forward. Yeah, as you can see there's nothing worth watching in this film, skip it.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Personal opinion of The Last Song,"A teenage summer romance, very clique. The storyline was typical and fairly straight forward. The actors performances were good although i had the feeling that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth wanted to laugh on several occasions. The setting was well chosen for the story.I like the fact that there isn't as much talking and arguing as other romantic films and that most emotions are displayed through facial expressions and body language. However, i don't think the film needed to be as long as it was and i found the atmosphere quite boring. The slight twist scenario in this film was the only part that caught my attention.This film wasn't anything extraordinary.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Story is OK but miley is unromantic,"The story isn't bad of course there are some clichéd things but it is a Sparks romance. This was better than Dear John which was irritating.Miley's acting has been criticised roundly. I don't think she entirely spoiled the movie. She wasn't bad all the time. She was better in the upbeat snappy moments and not so good at the tear jerking moments. Because she is not pretty (let's face it she has a rather ugly smile and her body is hunched), the sad moments weren't moving. And the romance didn't ring true. It was a rather dry eyed tear jerker at the end. If there had been a prettier better actress it might have been more romantic and moving. The kid brother wasn't that moving either.Kinnear is good though the didn't look sick enough at the end. Liam is OK but not very facially expressive. Other supporting characters were a bit annoying and unattractive.The song they played (the Last Song) kind of sucked. Couldn't they get a better composer? As if Juillard would want someone who composed that kind of nonsense.Overall not as good as the Notebook but better than Dear John.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

NAIVE with psychologically poor themes,"If a good director and screen writer had taken the steering sth good could have been extracted from this whole movie.Apparently the movie was targeted for teenagers so they didn't want to create anything too complicated and overly psychologised.They showed some well known themes in life of marriages, families and teens' issues. The major concern are their motivations, super fast change of mood, changing negative emotions and thoughts to positive just like that. It's well known that if an anger has been accumulated for years then a quick change of thoughts, opinion from bad to good is very unlikely.Issues which existed for years need to be reworked and reprocessed what takes time and emotional effort.In this movie everything happens too quickly as the script was designed with poor psychological considerations as the creators didn't need to release anything well thought but sth mediocre was just fine.If they could remake this movie with an intention of telling sth deeper about the life and relations, it would be truly great.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Don't Let the Rating Fool You,"I watched The Last Song with very low expectations given its low rating and walked away pleasantly surprised.First, the bad points. It's not that great of a film and isn't very memorable; it certainly could have been much better (particularly the pacing, which was slow for the first half and rushed in the second), Miley Cyrus's acting left a lot to be desired for, and the love story itself was rather bland. The overall story at times felt aimless where the only way to move the plot was to add some random surprise, which I think is a sign of poor screenplay.Despite all of this, the film holds its own and if it weren't for the hate Miley Cyrus receives, I would expect the film would otherwise be somewhere in the 5-range; at least a full point above what it's currently rated as. I was able to identify with the characters, particularly Greg Kinnear's character. I felt the story between Miley Cyrus's and Greg Kinnear's character was rather intriguing and the moral derived from it inspiring (but again, could have been done better, but it's enjoyable enough on its own).The film itself is okay and worth watching if you have the time and enjoy these types of films.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"A good attempt, but not a good film","Just as Zac Efron did with films such as 'Me and Orson Welles', fellow teen star Miley Cyrus uses 'The Last Song' as a bridge between Disney kiddie films to adult roles.And while this is admirable I think the fact that she teamed up with Nicholas Sparks, a man who seems quite happy to repeat his 'Notebook' trick for as long as the public can stomach it, for this film.It's sappy, it's overly sentimental, and overall despite the best efforts of Cryrus, this film isn't that good.Cyrus does well in her role, and holds it all together well, but I don't think this was the best choice of project.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

OK teen soap start but ends in a bored yawn,"Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her little brother Jonah are staying with their father Steve Miller (Greg Kinnear) in his beach house for the summer. The rebellious teen is not happy and feels out of place. She got in trouble for shoplifting in NYC. She makes a frienenemy in Blaze (Carly Chaikin), and catches the eye of local Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth). When she tries to save some turtles, she and Will starts a summer romance. He's trying to move on from a loss and she reconnects with music. The local girls aren't too happy. Meanwhile everybody still blames her father for burning down the church.It's not a particularly original teen rom-com to start. It's a little too light and too sappy. Then as in all Nicholas Sparks novels, this must have some melodrama. Somebody must die or be already dead! Miley Cyrus is a perfectly fine grumpy teen. Liam Hemsworth is the hot young beach dude. The two leads are nice likable kids. Nobody is winning any acting awards here, but it's a fine little teen melodramatic soap start. However the turn does nothing particularly compelling except to let the little air out of the story. The only hope is to have Liam and Miley on screen together no matter what. It doesn't matter if they're fighting or making up. When Liam goes away, the movie's spirit goes away too.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

One Word: AWESOME!,"As an eighteen year old girl, I am in the target demographic for the book and movie of The Last Song. I think that the opinion of Miley Cyrus here is a 50/50. Some hate her while others love her. I'd tend to fall into the latter category. I can't believe the crux of hate reviews are about how Miley can't act or just general ""Miley shouldn't of played the role of Ronnie"" comments. Just so all those reviewers who wrote that know this: Nicholas Sparks WROTE the character of Ronnie FOR Miley.Anyway since I'm one of those people that likes to see the real portrayal of a character from book to screen I COULDN'T wait to see it and after it was over see it again (I'm going w/ one of my BFFs to see today even though I'd seen it yesterday. I'd have to say the scene they let the baby turtles go was sweet. I think the portrayal of Ronnie was spot-on because that's pretty much how she acts in the beginning of the book. Another thing was the portrayal of Will's mom. In the book,she was really snobby and didn't approve of Ronnie, but in the movie, it was the TOTAL opposite. Overall, The Last Song was a good breakout role for Miley. Liam was for lack of a better word, perfect as Will. It didn't hurt that he looks good shirtless. The only thing that surprised me was that the whole Blaze getting caught on fire part didn't happen. It was a pretty big part of the book. Marcus was how I thought of him in my head. Bobby Coleman (Jonah) was hilarious! I'm SO getting it when it's out on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I cried like a baby!,"I'm so sick of reading bad reviews of Miley Cyrus' new movie, 'The Last Song'.Before seeing the movie I'd only ever seen Miley in her Hannah Montana / Miley Stewart role and thought she was funny but never had any strong opinion on her until I saw this movie. I loved it! After seeing the movie I spent that weekend reading Miley's biography of her life to date and now have much more respect for her and understand her way better as a person. She is much more mature than everyone thinks she is. If you read her book I think you would see that.I think her maturity shines through so much in this movie no matter what everyone has said. How can you not watch this and then watch Hannah Montana and see a difference? It takes a lot for an actor or actress to be able to pull off children's comedy and drama as well. And when I say drama, I mean it! I cried like a baby the whole way through the second half of the movie and that sort of emotion totally comes from the acting. I felt an emotional connection to the character, especially Miley's character Ronnie and her Dad during the hard times. I thought they were great and the father / daughter relationship was so believable. And of course so was relationship between Ronnie and Will. Miley and Liam have amazing chemistry and yeah, it was cheesy in parts but it was a drama / romance so of course it was going to be. I loved it.I think too many people have just gone into this movie hating on Miley Cyrus or better yet, refusing to dive into the story because she is in it - that is after all, what films are there for, as an escape from reality or what is real. If you sat in the theatre and stopped being so macho I guarantee you would cry, or at least tear up a little!I look forward to seeing Miley Cyrus in many more movies to come.

Contained and controlled,"(2010) The Last Song
ROMANTIC DRAMAThere seems to be a connection whenever a Nicolas Sparks book gets adapted into a feature film where whenever love start to blossom, they always either start on a popular beach or on some carnival or fun land and this film seem to carry on to this kind of trend! Starting with ""Message in a Bottle"" where it happened on a beach, ""The Notebook"" started at the carnival, ""Dear John"" started at the beach, and now ""The Last Song"" where the two lovebirds start their chemistry off a beach/carnival! Also, should be expected are the use of letters not cell phones this time or other forms of technology! Perfect rich boyfriend material, Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) knocks drink onto rebellious teen, Ronnie Miller (Miley Cyrus) who was supposed to be a child piano prodigy player, but chose the life of rebellion instead!. And this is just the beginning! It's very contained and controlled in terms of wooden personalities. I think I would've liked this film more had it starred some other unknown actress or another, other than Miley Cyrus because she doesn't fit this kind of description at all! Greg Kinnear does his best on it and Kelly Preston also stars in this too.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
This is what you call romance and the best movie ever!,"For anyone who is looking for love, or in love already, this movie brings back the pureness and trueness that love should be about. It makes you remember what it felt to love for the first time, that there is no wrong in finding that one that is meant to be, your soulmate. This movie is very realistic and inspiring, and it makes you feel that you should never give up on love, regardless of the flaws that come with it. Great movie, can't wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD. This is the most incredible moving, cinematic, best looking film out there. The acting is superb. The story is wonderful. You will not think of getting up in the middle of this movie. What a great love story.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Great Movie!!,"This was a very good movie. Miley Cyrus played the part very well for her first lead role in something other than Hannah Montana. The cast really all seemed to fit into their roles really well. Liam Hemsworth did an excellent job too. Even though I have never seen any of Nicholas Sparks other movies or read any of his books, from how they are described, I think this movie is definitely a Nicholas Sparks movie. There are some times when you will cry. You'll laugh at some parts as well. Overall, this movie is definitely worth going to see. I will say though, it is definitely a chick flick. I don't think many guys will enjoy it. That is the only reason I gave it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Awesome! Watch, Watch, Watch!","I went into this movie expecting it to be pretty good, but it is awesome! It's a very very good movie, an awesome story and Miley Cyrus does a very good job playing Ronnie. I have not read the book so I cannot compare the two, but I loved it. My sister, who doesn't like Miley Cyrus even loved the movie, and says that it is one of her favourite movies. I don't understand why so many people are so critical on it, I think they just refuse to like Miley no matter what, but I definitely think it's worth seeing, and buying when it comes out on DVD! It is a very clean movie, great for the whole family and the acting is all very well done.Great Job Miley!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The best love story since Titanic! ;),"This film stars Miley Cyrus as Ronnie and Liam Hemsworth as Will. The film is funny, sad and thought provoking all at the same time. It sends out a brilliant message that anyone can relate to. It is the best love story I have ever seen and it deserves to be remembered as the best love story ever and an excellent film for a father who wants to reconnect with his children. Much better than Titanic and a movie I will be sharing with others. This is my new favorite movie! I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. My boyfriend and I cried so much through this movie. We were still crying as we walked outside of the theater! And we don't normally cry about a movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie deserves better ratings than it has received!,"My perspective is that of a mother of teenage daughters. I didn't read the book. Yet keep in mind that most of those who've read any book previous to seeing the movie are quite disappointed in the movie. I almost hesitated seeing the movie once I read a bad review of it, though I saw the ratings on www.kidsinmind.com, giving it a 3.3.3 out of 10 for sex/nudity, violence, and profanity.This is a clean movie, a PG.I thought Miley Cyrus did a wonderful job of acting her part(My own daughters act just like this at times)! She was assertive and the acting of her mood was appropriate for the various situations.There are also virtuous aspects throughout this movie such as forgiveness, redemption, and sharing talents with others.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Better Than I Expected,"I'm definitely in a minority demographic, a 69 year old man who took his long time lady friend to see this because she loved ""The Notebook"", and as we age, we tend to like sweet, somewhat corny, love stories. I have never seen or heard any ""Hannah Montana"" material, but the review in Entertainment Weekly gave this movie a ""B"", so we went. I thought Miley Cyrus did an okay job, and Liam, her love interest, while too perfect, typified these types of movies. However, Greg Kinnear, and particularly, Bobby Coleman, who I later learned was the child star of ""Martian Child"",which I liked, were both excellent, and gave the predictable story some really fine moments. It isn't meant to be a ""great film"", just a pleasant teen first-love story, with a little pathos added, like the Erich Segal stories of the 70's. I think critics that panned this, while praising movies like ""There Will Be Blood"", are writing more for themselves than for most of the people who actually attend movies regularly. I really enjoyed this movie, and while it had some shortcomings, overall we both had a very nice time. I recommend it as a date movie that will make you laugh a little and shed a few tears, while hopefully having a good time too.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Yayyy!! I LOVE MILEY!,"This movie was the best movie ever! I drove an hour away just to watch this movie and trust me.it was worth it! Miley Cyrus gave an outstanding performance in this movie. I really couldn't understand why this movie struck so hard with meI never had a dad there for me, so that's probably why. This movie tells you that the people who are around you, wont be there forever so just make the best of it! I picked ""The Last Song"" book up at Walmart and finished it within a few days. It was the best book ever and that's when I knew that I just had to watch the movie. The movie isn't as good as the book, but pretty close. As soon as this movie comes out on DVD – I'M BUYING IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely amazing!!!!,"I went all the way to London yesterday for the European premiere of this film. It is undoubtedly the best film i have ever seen!! It's so emotional and for anyone planning on seeing it, i would advise you take tissues along as tears were streaming down my face during many scenes.Miley Cyrus is an incredible actress and plays the part really well. The supporting actors in this film are also amazing, particularly the young boy that plays her brother.I really believe this film will appeal to a really wide age range, as it can relate to people in so many different ways!

loved it!,"I have always relied on IMD B before I go and see a movie. I mean who wants to waste their precious hard earned money as well as time to sit in front of a boring and poor movie. IMDb is where I have always turned, but you guys have let me down here. Having got through ¾ of Nicholas Sparks book ""The Last Song"" I couldn't wait to see the movie. It looked to be so good. However, from your recommendations and ratings from all the users, I was expecting a hopeless movie with only the title to recommend itself as being a Nicholas Sparks novel. The amazing author who brought us The Notebook and Dear John as well as many others. I was ready for a disappointment in Miley Cyrus acting. How wrong all of you were. Not being a massive Miley Cyrus fan of Hanna Montana, I was expecting the worst. However, the girl came through. What are all of you talking about? Are you expecting an actress with academy award written all over it, or what? I think that's what all us critics expect these days. We are the critics too. We complain about everything. Are you jealous or what? If the story is not for you, then I suggest you find out what it is about first of all, before you pay for the ticket. And those of you expecting to see a Hanna Montana type movie in the cinema, umm, should also find out about the story. I learnt from this movie too not to stereotype people. I think the story was great. Miley did well. I am just so disappointed in where they changed the story line. Don't like when they change the story. It is the directors and writers fault. When I go to watch a movie on a book. I don't expect for those in the movie world to put there own spin on it. What is so wrong with copying the book. Why change the story? It just makes people upset anyway and the original is usually better. Maybe it keeps the writers in a job, if they feel they can change something of the movie. No, don't do it I tell you! Think all of you how many good books have been ruined by some silly writer changing the story line for the movie. I admit that sometimes it is need to fit into a 2hr block, but please make minimal adjustments.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
movie written before book!,"I have seen many people saying the movie left out so much but Just so everyone know, Nicholas Sparks wrote the movie script before the book. So obviously he had to add more detail and events into the book to make it long ya know. So the movie was good. Yes it didn't have some big events in the book but the movie was written first. So it was a great movie! The book is my favorite book now and i was a little afraid to see Miley Cyrus as Ronnie but she did a wonderful job. Great movie i wouldn't take little kids though All in all 8/10. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and this is one of his better books. The Last Song was 10x better than the movie Dear John.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Beautiful movie! Miley Cyrus' best work of the year!,"Since 2006, Miley Cyrus has capture the heart of both younger or older girls since her famous hit TV series Hannah Montana. But now...as her old show is coming close to an end soon with an upcoming next season, which is sure to be the last and final one, we take a new look on Miley that we haven't seen yet; something that's non-Disney and non-Hannah Montana related.Based on the 2009 novel by Nicholas Sparks, who is known for making such wonderful love stories such as A Walk to Remember and The Notebook for example, makes something new! More romance yes, but it has an interesting turn about love.In the movie, Miley plays a 17 year old girl named Veronica, Ronnie for short, whose is sent to her dad's beach home for the summer, meets and falls in love with a cute guy named Will, play by her real-life new boyfriend Liam Hemsworth. As the film goes on, Ronnie re-connects with her dad at a whole new level and learns the true meaning about relationships.Now I haven't read all of Nicolas Sparks' stories yet, but I can tell that he seems very good at them when mostly all of his classic novels have been turn into movies. I have heard about The Last Song for a while now before the book came out one year ago, and I was happy to hear that the role for Ronnie was written directly for Miley Cyrus. I thought it was sweet! Her acting on the character was very bitchy in the beginning, but I think that's how it is with most of the kids that have to live with one single parent after their folks are divorced and it isn't easy for them to move on. Sometimes the things in life have to change and some of them can't be brought back but it can blossom into something new that's incredible! And I think that's the lesson of it when you're sitting down and watching the movie. The film will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and by the end of it when it's all over, it will put a warm glowing feeling into your heart.I rank The Last Song a 9 out of a 10! Wonderful work Miley has ever done and I think she will keep making more beautiful stuff for many generations to come as long as she shall live!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Every story has its day,"To be honest i never really considered reading or watching the Last Song. I was just bored and wanted to DO something. Sparks never really interested me, but as i picked up the book i soon found i couldn't put it down. So i just had to watch the movie! The Last Song is about a summer like no other. Veronica,""Ronnie"", Miller is a young women who is forced into seeing her dad for the summer by her mother. Ronnie is far from thrilled. She blames her mom and dad's divorce on her fathers love for music, and therefore hates that she loves it too. When Ronnie and her brother arrive at her fathers house in North Carolina, she is determined to ruin the summer.On the first day there though, after Ronnie runs away to the fair, she meets two very interesting strangers. The first is Will. The amazingly lovable boy. Then Blaze, the girl who runs with the wrong kind of crowd. Soon Ronnie finds her self mixed into it all, the love for Will, her fear and betrayal from Blaze, and her unconditional love and hate for her dad.As the story raged on, i found i could guess at parts of the ending. Still i kept reading and again the story became more entrusting. It was painful at the end, and ill admit i cried like a baby, but it goes to show the hardships of life, the choices we don't always understand, and the love of a father. I loved also how Sparks intertwined God into it all. Ronnies dad Steve found God, and in the end, everything turned out better than id have hoped.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing work Nicholas Sparks! Thank you for picking Miley Cyrus!!,"I had seen the movie in the theater shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. I'm a big Nicholas Sparks fan and I try to see all the movies made from his books. I really don't understand why everybody is bashing this film because of Miley Cyrus cause she wasn't that bad. Her acting really surprised me. It's about time she moves on from Hannah Montana. I already preordered the DVD because it is the type movie that I will want to watch over and over again. I especially liked the chemistry between Miley Cyrus and Liam Harmsworth. I thought it was very romantic and sexy and Liam is quite a hunk.

This movie is underrated.,"This movie is underrated. Sometimes just cannot look the reviews and votes before movie, for luck I watched the movie regardless. Usually I don't like movies with low votes but this time I must confess I didn't found nothing I didn't like in this movie. I liked the story, it was emotional and also educational. The trailer was too similar with the older Miley movie Hannah Montana the Movie, but the story is actually totally different.Also no bad words about Miley and her acting thing and talents. I think she's different kind of person as we have used to with people and the difference is good, not bad :) My theory is that Miley have got much attention from youths so some older or even a little foolish people think it's flat to like someone so famous. Similar case to Britney Spears or Aqua. But it's not a shame to like someone if u really like what you see not just watch and listen what's popular. People should fend for their taste not let feel bad for the taste. There are actors and music for all kind of tastes :)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The movie was excellent!!!,"I read a lot of negative reviews on The Last Song on IMDb before going to see it in theaters today and I have to admit that I was a little skeptical on how Miley Cyrus would be without her Hannah Montana persona to lean on, but her performance in this movie is sensational and portrays the life of a teenager changing into a young woman when she is forced to grow up quickly and without warning. The performances of nearly every actor in this movie was great and the actor who played Jonah was excellent! The screenplay for the movie was created before Nicholas Sparks even wrote the novel which is why the movie contains some differences than the book, and even without some key parts of the novel the movie was still entertaining and great to watch. The performance of Miley Cyrus was awesome, she played the role of Ronnie exactly how I imagined the character; edgy and mean layering her exterior, but having a soft heart which she shows with the grace of a promising actress. Her costars Liam Hemsworth and Greg Kinnear are equally as charming and great on the screen, completing a great film. If you are looking for a great love story that can make you laugh and cry along with the characters in the movie then this is definitely a worthy watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie,"I've been to see this movie twice and enjoyed it immensely both times. I have not been a big fan of Miley Cyrus, but I thought this was the perfect transitional role for her. Even if her acting wasn't Oscar-worthy, it was a huge step up from her previous acting roles.I also thought Greg Kinnear (Ronnie's Dad) did an excellent job with his character. Liam Hemsworth (Will) was pretty good in his role, too. It's nice to see a really tall actor on the screen for a change.I didn't feel that the movie was rushed at all, but actually thought the pace was perfect and was glad the ending wasn't dragged out any more.For those of you who don't know, the screen play for the movie was written before the book, so it seems unfair to critique the movie based on the book.I've read the book, too, but I like the movie more. I think a bunch of the bad reviews the movie has been getting aren't fair- they are either comparing the book to the movie (which, as I said, doesn't seem right), or berating Miley Cyrus's acting skills.But I don't care what the other reviews say. This was a great movie in my opinion. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Only OK.,"I read the book especially for this movie because i am a huge fan of Miley Cyrus. I went to see the first show on opening day preparing to be blown away. I walk out of the theater, and they left so much out of the movie! Miley Cyrus's acting wasn't as bad as people said on the reviews, although, her younger brother ""Jonah"" in the movie did a much better job.The ending also makes no sense, and is completely random, but until then two thumbs up. I'd wouldn't take my child to see this unless ten or older. I would have also liked to see more of Marcus in the movie, and all the drama he brings along. Also this movie's soundtrack is great, i bought it on itunes as soon as i got home. The movie wasn't great, but better than what the strict critics say.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Movie!,"This movie does not have the most complex or shocking turn of events storyline ever but overall a good movie with a good storyline. No, the acting wasn't perfect but it wasn't bad either, everyone did well in my opinion. Personally I thought the actors in the movie all meshed well together and there was good chemistry. Instead of critiquing it to death I wish people would just see it more for what it is instead of what they think it should be. An enjoyable cute movie with a happy ending (aside from the fact that the dad dies) Not in my top favorite movies but I would definitely watch it again, more of a chick flick than anything else. I will admit I cannot see a lot of guys being overly interested.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

And the rest of the cast was incredible as well, I was so impressed by the kid as well. The plot may not have been very eventful but its beauty is in its simplicity. Just a normal story that could happen to any of us. Movies these days just tell stories that are too fictional to believe that it could happen in real life. I loved it and it's on my ""Favorite Movies"" list and I just can't stop watching it.

In the book he is a true physco and it makes the book all the more interesting. I feel it could've had the same effect on the movie, but what do i know, i'm only 13.but all in all i thought the book was amazing and the movie was pretty good so i would recommend it to anyone it has a truly profound message about how love can ""break our hearts...and heal them""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Loved this movie!,"I can't say enough how pleased I am with how this film evolved. I knew what to expect, 'cause I cheated and read the end of the novel. I'm not a Sparks reader. So I went in with his ending in my head. Miley has grown by huge leaps since her first entry onto the big screen. But it was all the characters who drew me in and yes, Sparks had to have provided the structure for these great characters. I cried and cried. You just have to see the film to understand. Then years ago, I wouldn't have understood the characters motivation, wouldn't have accepted it. But ""Last Song"" sure helped put things in perspective for me. And so, I have to thank Mr. Sparks for part of this new acceptance of reality.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Story...,"If you're looking for a romantic novel to get lost in this summer, this is the book for you! Nicholas Sparks has done it again. I absolutely loved every second of this story and the way it unfolded. As always, there are lots of unexpected plot twists and multiple stories within the novel itself. It's so easy to connect with any of the characters, from the wanna-be cool dad to his rebellious seventeen year old daughter.It all starts with Ronnie and her ten year old brother being shipped to their dad's house in a small North Carolina town for the summer. Throughout the novel, secrets are unfolded and strong relationships are formed (including a summer romance between Ronnie and the town's very own teenage heart throb.)Ronnie discovers and learns things about herself as well as how to treat others. She falls in love for the first time, and learns the ups and downs of romantic relationships the hard way. The father that she once despised growing up eventually becomes her closest friend. I loved her relationship with her younger brother. Even though they fought a lot, Sparks made a special connection between the two of them that was really touching.Don't think it's as predictable as it seems, though. Several plot twists will have you feeling like you can't put the book down. Keep the tissues close!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I also recommend this book for any girl who has problems with their family especially their father. This book hit home in so many ways. I am excited for the movie to come out on DVD so I can watch it.If you have never read a Nicolas Sparks I recommend",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Definitely a Favorite,"The Last Song is definitely a chick flick, but it is one of my favorites. The movie is based off of the Book by Nicholas Sparks. I am a HUGE fan of Nicholas Sparks, and yes, Miley Cyrus. I know that I sound like a 12 year old girl, but I truly do love her.The story takes place on the coast of North Carolina, where a daughter is forced to live with her father who she is not the biggest fan of. As the story unfolds we see that she hates him and she has gotten into a lot of trouble in the past. Her father refuses to give up on her and finally in the end she realizes how much she loves and needs her father. At the end her father is stricken with cancer and she stays with him until the day he dies. This movie hit home for me because I sometimes argue with my father a lot. It makes me want to put everything aside and tell my dad how much he means to me.The story was very close to the same as the book which I really like. Compared to Dear John, another Nicholas Sparks' book and movie, it was so much better. I hate when they take extremely good books and ruin them by changing the characters and their actions. This is a main reason that this movie is one of my favorites.One reason that I didn't like the movie was because of the love part. Miley's character falls in love with a rich boy. They fall in love, she gets mad at him, then they get back together. Even though I am your typical girl who loves a good love story, I get very tired of seeing the PERFECT love. It doesn't happen like that. Life isn't perfect and it will never be like the movies.Overall this movie is on my top ten list!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie,"I loved this movie because of so many different elements. The cast was super well casted and were amazing actors and actresses.

I overall recommend this movie to all ages. It is such a great romance and an overall enjoyable movie. Warning its a tearjerker, but it's also filled with love and happiness. Love the scenery and the music. The music is so amazing. I love the music, it fits in with the story so well! I am a hopeless romantic and I love to see these movies. It makes you feel good about love and life and just because Miley Cyrus is in it, it doesn't mean its just for little kids.

A very good movie full of emotions,"My mom and I went to see this movie, and we both LOVED it. Since neither of us had read the book,i guess we liked it more than those who had read the book. We both cried, i mean SOBBED, through most of it, because it was just so touching, yet there was a very unexpected twist involving Ronni's(Miley Cyrus) father. However, Miley Cyrus always has roles where she is a little over-dramatic, and she had a very unusual role in this movie. I actually liked her acting in this movie, whereas I usually find her acting to be ""cheesy"" and very fake. This movie is full of surprises and emotions, and as far as i remember, its one of my favorites.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
True love will never leave you..,"I have seeing my fare share of love stories, dramas and touching tales for the past couple of years without counting my years of watching movies for the sake of passing time. Some love stories have 'it' while many actually lost 'it' in the name of love. In my opinion Love is a hard thing to understand and experience so portraying it correctly and effectively on screen also is not that easier. ""The Last Song"" is in exception. Right at the beginning it vastly looks familiar if you have watched 'Dear John' recently. The beach places, games, a girl moving in the from the big city, a hunk on the beach get to get in touch with her and so on. But when the story runs it begins to take shape in to a memorable experience and if you actually watch it with your full heart and mind, you may find interesting pieces of puzzles about the things call love and life start to solve by itself. Don't have much to say about the cast. I personally don't think there is anything wrong there. And the acting is not bad as well. The scenes are beautiful; locations are calm and blissful which puts you in the beach mood. What matters most is the story. It's about love and relationships which is so fragile and tends to break off easily and the struggle of life to keep it alive. Making mistakes, realizing it and then forgiving your self do make one strong and then face life with more confidence. ""The Last Song"" is about that mostly. This movie will stay in your heart for a long time if you actually made an attempt to realize it deep enough. And finally I have to tell that the music is just fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good,"Before watching this film I had heard mixed reviews about it. When it first came out in theaters I was hearing how terrible it was and not to waist my money. I have never read the book, though my girl friend has, and she considers it her favorite book of all time. Because of this I was expecting the movie to be fairly good, I enjoy all types of genres so a chick flick doesn't bother me. I never got around to seeing this picture in the theaters and ended up renting it. After trying relentlessly to find it, I was finally able to sit down and watch it. I agree with others who say that the story seems a bit rushed, as the viewer you are thrown into a situation without much warning, and it barely has enough length in the scene to make you, the viewer, feel what the characters are feeling. I had heard from others that Miley Cyrus had done a terrible acting job. I disagree with this, I didn't feel as if I was watching a musician try to act, she came across confident and believable. All and all this was a good movie, and by the time it was all said and done my girl friend was in tears, I would watch this movie again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Miley did a great job acting in the movie. she did a excellent turn around from being a Disney channel girl. it was sweet and i recommend this movie to anyone :)One of the best movies Nicholas sparks has produced and one of the best books he has wrote.The movie had a great plot to it, i cried and teared up in some scenes. the water parts were amazing. she had great compassion like any other teen. She may have seen she came off strong but any teenager who has been misunderstood is going to react to some situations like she did. I think Sparks fitted the characters really good from the book to the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved It,I loved it. Then again I've loved every Nicolas Sparks movie I've seen. I saw it when I got it on netflix and then just within a couple hours of watching it for the first time I went out and bought it. It really hit a cord with me in many ways more than any other of his. My dad and I don't have the best of relationships and so I can relate in a similar way. It made me realize how fragil and short life is. So I'm now working on a better relationship with my dad. I thought the acting was well done. By all the cast. I'm not a fan of Miley and this is the first thing I've seen of her's but she was good. You could tell that all the actors but real emotion in their roles. Still there is yet to be a movie based on one of Nicolas Sparks' books that I haven't cried in and this was no expection to that.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Teenage drama that definitely goes that extra Miley,"Wow wee, what can i say apart from sad, funny and in away amazing in this movie... Miley Cyrus is a girl from New york who comes down to see her father down on the seaside. She is a strange young lady and very different from when she came down years back. She falls in love with a local boy and starts to spend all the time she has with him. Years back when she came to visit her father she loved to play the piano. She was so talented and won awards for it. This time she wouldn't touch it and she is a bit of a goth. THIS IS A STORY OF LOVE AND WILL LIFT UP YOUR HEART. i would recommend it to anyone even if you don't like miley cyrus.ACTING 97% really good acting!Music 80% some really nice music specially at the end.Romance 84% They do love each other!Crying Rate 91% you will cryall together 9/10GREAT FILM",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Truly Moving, and Heart-Touching!","The problem with the film is people had biased opinions about it before it was even released. The moment people found out Miley Cyrus was going to star as Ronnie Miller, people immediately disliked the film.To my surprise however, I was truly touched by the film. It's a story about family, finding love, and going through hardships. And personally, I left the theater in tears. In fact, I went to see the film THREE TIMES while it was still in theaters. A lot can be learned from the movie. It's definitely something that a family could watch together.The character's were so complex, and each actor/actress displayed the plot of each individual character SO well. Truly a good film, no matter what people say!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
WOW!! Only the second film to jerk a tear from me.,I wasn't really expecting a lot from this film seeing as it was Miley Cyrus. But then I started to absorb the story. The characters were so realistic it wasn't the typical romance film until the end and that is why I gave it 9/10. Miley really surprised me in this I thought she would be just terrible but she actually gave the character meaning and you really feel her pain and that is rare from many actors and actresses let alone Miley. I just thought WOW!! I've watched many romance films that have a sad element to them and the only other film to jerk a tear from me is My Girl. Overall I think this film is great I would recommend it to ANYONE.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing movie!!! On of my faves now!,"I just watched this movie for the first time ever. There are very few movies that i actually enjoy watching whole way through, but this one kept me entertained every second! So emotional!The amount of tears I cried could be enough to fill a pool. You get so attached to the characters. As for the acting, i honestly don't see any wrong in it, both Miley and Liam did a good job! They are obviously not the best actors I have ever seen but i don't think they did bad, so do not understand why people are saying it was terrible. And i also don't't understand why people are giving it such low reviews, and i believe they are just doing it cause Miley is in it and cause of the way she is now!. It really makes me upset seeing Miley in this, then seeing her now! It's honestly disheartening.Will definitely watch again!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth watching,"I honestly don't get all the bad reviews on this movie. I saw it twice and bawled my eyes out both times. Maybe Miley isn't the best actress in the world to play such a dramatic part, but I think she did a nice job. Instead of being negative, let's sum up all the good things about this movie. The story is very moving and touching and will definitely make you cry, the chemistry between Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus is beautiful, the soundtrack is gorgeous and the performance of young Bobby Coleman is exceptional! He deserves so much credit for this part! All together, it's sad to see that the ratings are so bad. It will keep people from watching which is such a shame since this movie is really worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I'm Miley Cyrus hater .. But I love the movie,"Yes I hate Miley Cyrus because what she doing right now. But in this movie she was acting very good. the movie show the love between the couples and the family. very good acting at the movie. I was surprising when I saw all these negative reviews. this is why sometimes you should ignore IMDb reviews. Honestly I hate the romantic movies. I don't know why but I love this movie so much. It controls my emotions. Mley acting was amazing specially when she knew that her father has a cancer. Also when he died it was very sadly. I almost cries even though Im a big fan of crime and action movies only ! Big thanks to Liam , Miley and to everyone who worked in this movie. Awesome movie and you better watch even though you love or hate Miley Cyrus.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not her last song for sure!,"Some need to hear their song,some need to see their expressions,before they can recognize them. Miley was nothing more than a teenie bopper in my eyes, until I saw her in ""The Last Song"" I have read some peoples comments about Mileys acting and they were harsh. Really people, give her a break. How many musicians do you know who can act? Could Miley have done better? Probably not this time. Does she have what it takes to do better in future films? This, I know for SURE. I cried watching this movie, and found her acting more than good. Not Oscar winning, but very good. I wish her well, and good luck in her double music/acting efforts, I believe she is a talented hard worker with a heart who WILL deliver more and more. Keep on sparkling Miley, you make me smile :)",,Anonymous,Music
Such an amazing film. Gets me in tears every time,"Oh my god. I have seen this film 5 times. It is such an amazing and moving film. The actors are great, especially the little brother Jonah. This film had me in tears and even though I know what going to happen, it still chokes me up every time. Such a great film. I have just got this film on DVD and and about to watch it... again. I would definitely recommend this film to people. When I reviewed this film, people were saying how awful it was but I decided to watch it anyway and I just think 'you're so wrong about this film'. All of the actors are amazing, with moving performances from Miley and Greg. This film is an amazing movie and I would recommend people to watch it",,Anonymous,Music
the stained-glass window,"The stained glass - window of church. And the first images of salvation from burned church of an inconstient man . This are the basic virtues , for me, of film.Far to be bad, it has a precise target.It is loved or hated for Milley Cyrus or for Liam Hemsworth, it offers a decent role, correct performed to Greg Kinnear and nothing more. Sure, romance, family, inspired portrait of rebelious teenager and the social differences, tortues and Anna Karenina as good spices for an easy romance with some salt of heartbreaking moments.Maybe, it is fair and enough. The message is moving, the acting not bad but, being, maybe, too old for nicholas SSparks superficial stories, I remain admirer only of tained glass window and its fabrication. And just it is enough.",,Anonymous,Music
