Let's go to the other side,"It took me almost a year to rewatch Cold War, not for lack of want, but for how hard film was to revisit. The pain, torment and anguish is very tangible, and despite the fact the key characters keep making terrible mistakes that lead them into worse and worse positions, I can't help but feel I would make the same steps. What else do you do when you can't stand each other, but you can't stand to be apart from each other? Is this love? Or is love a concept mislabeled, propelled by films like this that seem to glorify harmful and destructive relationships by malicious and foolish people?Shot in sumptuous black and white, with a stunning soundtrack and stellar performances, Cold War is not a romance film, but rather a tragedy. You know the end when you start, but you drag yourself through the mud to reanalyse every single painful detail. A film that never answers any questions, but lets you resonate with the relationship, actions and consequences of these ill pared, out of sync lovers. Oh oh oh.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Completely engrossing and stunningly beautiful. An arthouse masterpiece.,"The first thing to state about this beautiful movie is that it's monochrome. So stunningly so that at times you feel you are in a photographic gallery rather than a cinema. The quality of the cinematography is quite extraordinary thanks to Lucas Zal.It's also in 4:3 format. Not the square format of Instagram, but close.We don't see 4:3 very often these days but Wes Anderson used it to immense effect in Grand Budapest Hotel and so did Lazslo Melis in Son of Saul.It's an engaging format that draws you in. It suggests a time before cinemascope (16:9 etc) and only really works in period cinema of a time.This time.But it also lends itself to incredible framing, such as when our female protagonist floats down a river gradually disappearing out of shot, and later in the movie when the chief protagonists leave a bus and walk out of frame in a composition that Henri Cartier Breson would be proud of.It's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in many years.In truth that's probably its biggest strength.It is, but it isn't really, narrative driven. More episodic than story driven but it does tell a tale about director Pawel Pawlikowski's parents' love affair set against the Cold War backdrop in his native Poland.It's fairly sordid in a way (his mother was abused by her father as a child) but without anything shocking to see.Imagine, yes.The two leads ( Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot) are magnificent. Brooding, beautiful (although unconventionally so) and real.Lucas Zal has a great time dwelling on three particular things. Crowd shots. Amazing, Dance sequences. Amazing. Joanna Kulig (the lead). Amazing.In particular, Joanna Kulig has a stand out performance. She's not one to show her enjoyment in life. Sullen most would say. But it is an immense performance.It's a love story, set against the challenges that Cold War Poland put in front of people of artistic belief where communist doctrine made creativity very difficult.What Pawel Pawlikowski achieves is a mood piece of exemplary, peerless really, detail.And it's a musical.I was constantly drawn to comparing it to La La Land, yet it is so NOT La La Land. Partly it's down to Kulig who shares the unorthodox looks (beauty) of Emma Stone. Partly it's the framing of Zal.And the music fuses from Polish country folk to French basement jazz (which La La Land would have been so comfortable with).This is an Oscar nomination shoe in. It's absolutely brilliant.And, at 88 minutes, certainly does not outstay its welcome.Bravo!A Straight 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Unparalleled Cinematography,"Well, first off, the cinematography was not underrated. It is incredibly beautiful in a way that American Filmmakers have almost seemed to forget. We live in an era of cinema where color and computer graphics are our main tools for communicating at the theater. We want bigger (IMAX), louder/immersive (Atmos), and flashy/bright/color epileptic seizure inducing displays of digital fireworks.Don't get me wrong. I love a movie that blends those things effectively, but there is a simple beauty to a black and white, 4x3 frame. The main thing I see in this sort of film is light. With no color to distract you, the emphasis of the film revolves around areas of light and dark.The diffuse soft light of the cold air in winter and a stand of trees gains a mystical quality sometimes as the snow which clings to the dark trunks of trees seems to disappear into the distant fog. The hard light of a night club is seen for what it is, small sliver of light in a darkness that people long to disappear into and can't seem but help to be consumed by.""Cold War"" uses this light effectively as neither the star of the show nor a simple utilitarian instrument. It communicates an emotion that can't be portrayed through acting or production design alone.The story is a classic one. A couple, torn apart by the love that binds them together and the forces of the world which conspire to keep them apart. Honestly, it's the main weakness of the film. I don't begrudge it that hard though. It was made by a Polish director and this is his own country's history and I'm sure there is a reason that that the war torn romance is a classic of literature and cinema. People identify with it.In ""Cold War,"" Zula is a young woman trying out for a Polish Heritage singing and dancing troupe. Wiktor is the director and, upon her first audition, he is intrigued by her. As they work together the troupe gains popularity till the state expresses interest in sponsoring the show. Wiktor doesn't like the control that the state is exerting over his art so he plots with Zula to escape Communist rule through Berlin.They agree, but Zula gets cold feet and doesn't meet him at the rendezvous, opting instead to stay in Poland. The rest of the film revolves around a romance that only finds expression in passing as her career eventually takes her out of Poland and the the two of them reconnect and struggle with life abroad.""Cold War"" isn't a film for everyone. It's a little slow and reserved. The passion of their love is very muted, seeming more like passing interest at times than a fiery love affair and that makes it hard to connect with the characters at times.Slow Cinema is seeing a bit of a resurgence right now, though, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out a highly acclaimed movie which exemplifies this style without falling into the trap of a 3 hour runtime as many slow cinema films do.At a tight hour and a half, there are few people who can't afford to see something a little outside of their comfort zone. I certainly enjoyed it and more so even as I think about the film and the themes it presents once I left the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
An extraordinary achievement,"I had the good fortune to see this excellent film at the Pod Baranami film house in Krak√≥w in July... at the (heartbreaking) end of the film the audience sat in silence while the credits rolled. At 88 minutes it is a short film, it is in a subtle black and white, there are no fancy effects, one scene follows another with a brief blank screen between, and yet the film grips from beginning to end. The ensemble performances are strong, the two leads are magnificent and the sense of place and period are perfect. What is extraordinary is the way in which the film creates a potent reminder of the ways in which the human spirit and love can survive the worst that a totalitarian state can inflict on its people. In our time, while far right politics rears its ugly head, there is also a timely warning in this extraordinary achievement in European cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Style over Content,"This is another case of style over content. The look of this film is stunning , deliberately reminiscent of the European films of the 50'sand 60's however there is no substance to the story. The script jumps years and places so many times that we never care enough about the main characters and their love story which is the main focus of the film (some would say only focus) as the major political changes that took place during this period are kept so far in the background that they seem insignificant and ultimately irrelevant.The jazz sequences in a Paris cafe only seem to be included to show some great smoky black and white photography rather than to move the plot forward. I appreciate that this is a very personal story for the director but in the transition to the screen he has lost the tragedy and emotion that he wanted to convey to audiences... and what could have been a great film is only 'quite good'.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
A Stale & Soulless Story Of Cursed Love In Cursed Times,"From the Academy Award-winning director of Ida comes another cold, stark & emotionally distant feature, this time centred around a couple that can neither stay together nor live apart. Taking inspiration from his own parents' turbulent history, Pawel Pawlikowski's latest is a tale of cursed love in cursed times.Set in the ruins of post-war Europe, the story concerns a musical director who discovers a young singer and helps her refine her talent. The plot follows their romance over the years as their different backgrounds, varying temperaments & politics of the era keep separating them apart & bringing them back together.Co-written & directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, the film definitely benefits from its splendid camerawork & wonderful music but the romance aspect is both stale & soulless. Watching the same episode repeated time n again in different places & years gets old & boring real soon, plus we never even grow to care about them.The two lovebirds have no individual lives of their own. The story never digs into that aspect, for it only shows us the segments that brings them together before driving them apart again. And the repetitive nature of it makes sure that we are never invested in them or their relationship or the troubles they find themselves in over the years.Difficulties of living in exile or under totalitarian regime are only glimpsed at but never explored. Joanna Kulig & Tomasz Kot do well with what they are given and while their work looks impressive, it doesn't truly resonate on an emotional level. It's a good thing that the film is only 85 minutes long and ends before it becomes an ordeal to sit through.On an overall scale, Cold War is beautiful to look at but its story doesn't stimulate the senses the way its arresting imagery does. The frame composition, greyscale photography, crisp camerawork and excellent musical choices actually turned out to be its saving grace, for without them, this Polish drama would be no less than an absolute chore. In a word, underwhelming.",,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Beautifully Made Drama from Poland,"This superbly shot and acted black-and-white drama from Poland is a worthy film from Pawel Pawlikowski. It doesn't quite live up to his outstanding previous film ""Ida,"" but it comes close. Like ""Ida,"" this film runs a fleeting 90 minutes and is shot in black and white using simple (but gorgeous) cinematography. For a film of such short runtime, ""Cold War"" is deeply ambitious, and for the most part, the ambition pays off. It is set over a considerable period of time both inside and outside of the Iron Curtain, and centers on a love story between a man and his student who meet at a state-run music academy in communist Poland.The film's use of a variety of filmmaking techniques to depict the history and culture of postwar Europe through using historical context is outstanding. The simple and very powerful music is beautiful, as is every key shot in black-and-white. The two leads both give excellent performances, mixing desire for purpose in life with an intense feeling of passion that is prevalent among ambitious individuals in the era. Some of these strengths in the movie are even combined together to excellent results, such as a chilling scene when young women from the state music academy sing songs pledging absolute loyalty to Stalin on stage in performance. The juxtaposition of the different scenes in the movie is also done very well, as each scene simply cuts to black before the next major scene (set in a different region or area of Europe) begins. The only real complaint I have about this film is that while I really appreciated the ending for the most part, the tone of the film's finale felt slightly anti-climactic. Otherwise, this is a gem. Gladly recommended. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Not Much Chemistry,"A musician and his muse carry out an on-again-off-again romance in the two decades following WWII.""Cold War"" left me feeling like my lack of understanding about Poland and post-war Polish identity prevented me from fully appreciating this movie. The whole time I was watching it, I felt like there was something I was missing. But I have to judge a movie based on my personal reaction to it, and this one left me cold. The two leads have little chemistry, and the movie doesn't make a compelling case that these two damaged souls can't live without each other. We're just told they can't, but we're never shown. Because I didn't care about their relationship, and I didn't much care for them as individuals (we never learn very much about either of them), I never felt vested in anything happening and I couldn't care less about whether they ended up together, apart, alive, or dead.The film has some rapturous followers, so I'll have to just live with the fact that I missed the boat on this one.Nominated for three Oscars at the upcoming 2018 Academy Awards: Best Foreign Language Film (Poland), Best Director (Pawel Pawlikowski), and Best Cinematography.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

"A critic for a good movie, but ""Nothing special""","I must admit that the movie is not bad. The black and white color style creates a romantic and nostalgic atmoshere, during the era of the beginning of the cold war. There are some impressive and well-played scenes (and that is something the director must be praised for, his visual aesthetic), especially in the beginning of the movie, showing the life in Poland after the war and the folkore culture. The perfume and sense of old times and the illustration of another era are so clear. This is the good side of the movie, that reminds us something of the old romantic movies. On the other hand, a movie that could simply be a masterpiece, it just ends to be ""nothing special"". The main reason is that, although it considers to be a love-film, love is not clearly illustrated. The spectator cannot really understand why their love is so strong, why these people are so stuck to its other. They continue to move all the time and make love and argue, while there is not enough ""heaviness"" to their relationship. It becomes boring at some point, just to watch people go around and argue and love each other without a reason.
In cocnlusion, while I liked the way that the director presents the capitalist world, giving emphasis to the differences between the east and the west ethics and culture, I didn't like the way of presentation of the communist side, because he concentrates only to authority, power, jails and no freedom at all.

This is why I love film,"I had forgotten what it was like to be surprised and enraptured by a film, to be taken to another place visually and aurally.Maybe it is because I knew nothing about this film before I watched it - I found it, an old recommendation on my 'to watch' list and say it was available, and so pressed play, so tired was I of looking for something to fit my mood - but I cannot understand why some people didn't connect with this movie.
Maybe they had some expecations that were unmet.For me though, I was pulled along, telling myself 'it is too late, I'll watch it tomorrow' before being dragged into another beautiful and perfectly timed (in length) scene.Originally I was just enchanted by the music, composition and the hint of a story unfolding, but as it unfolded I was surprised to recognise and be involved in the distantly viewed and stilted portrayal of emotional damage and love.I haven't seen this good a film for years, and it will stick with me",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
"Dig deeper, People!","It's amazing how so many people miss the real meaning of this film, even though the title literally hits you over the head with it - COLD WAR.
Yes, superficially it is a love story between two people, but it's so much more than that.
Put yourself in Poland in 1949 when the movie begins - What was going on? Russia was grinding out the souls of the Polish people and replacing it with Communist doctrine, turning human beings into bricks in the wall.
The essence of this film is the fight to remain a Pole while a mass dehumanization is going on all around you.
Both leads struggle with it, within the system and without.
They're pulled away and then drawn back, both to each other and to Poland.
Compromises are made along the way, humiliations are swept under the rug but they still tear at the heart.
When you're under someone's thumb, you fight back in little ways - The girl gets married to an official, not for love but for advantage, then as she tells her true love later - it doesn't count because it was not in church.
Poland is one of the most Catholic countries in the world, we're brought back to that for the ending where the two lovers finally 'get married' in a real church, or what the Soviet Union failed to destroy. It was a symbol of love but even more than that a symbol of defiance during the... COLD WAR.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Not as Good of a Film as the Camera Wants You to Believe,"The first time I saw Cold War, I fell asleep halfway through it at AFI Fest 2018. That was my fourth film of the day, and I was extremely tired. I felt very bad, so I was very eager for when the film would be released to the public so that I could give it another try. Today is that day.Well, after seeing it for a second time (and unfortunately being two to three minutes late), I actually think there was more than tiredness that caused me to fall asleep in the first screening. I truly think that Cold War is the epitome of what style over substance is. This film has such a bad plot, uninteresting characters, and a story that flashed through more than a decade in eighty-five minutes. Cold War tries to disguise its faults with spectacular black and white cinematography, a stunning vocal score, and a pretentious choice of a historical time period, but I was not fooled for one bit.The plot was so thin that I could not even begin to describe how ridiculously simple, yet annoying it was:""Man who is a musical director finds a female singer with incredible talent. He leads her to fame. One day they eye-flirt at a party. They bang pretty intensely. Then, one year goes by without talking to each other. They meet one day on the sidewalk. They both declare they have significant others. But, because of their erratic attraction for each other, they have intercourse again. And then they bang again and again. Then they go on tour. She gets more famous. Then, five years go by. After not speaking to each other, they meet each other yet again. They both declare they are married to other people. But because of their lustful nature, they BANG yet again. And again. Then they decide to drop their husband/wife and become a couple. They start to fight. Then they bang to make up. Then she gets mad at him. Then she slaps him. Then seven years go by. They bang. Then, they get married. The end.""In other words, the plot of this film revolves around two people whose love affair can be simplified as ""hey baby, let's get it on."" There is hardly any dialogue between them that is romantically sincere. It is all just sexual or boring exposition. I felt nothing for these two people. And I really didn't care.For all you love it to death, good for you. But I prefer films with better developed characters at the expense of extremely pretentious cinematography. How about the Before Trilogy that isn't beautifully shot by any means, but the characters are excellently portrayed.All in all, I wish this film was better than the camera thinks it is.",,Anonymous,"History, Music"
A Cold War Romance,"Pawel Pawlikowski's Cannes hit is a tragic romance in background of the Cold War. After winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film for Ida (2013), the Polish director pays tribute to his parents with a love story threatened by historic conflict. Its rather poignant for me to be seeing and hearing outrageously positive things about Pawlowski's latest film, as my own university; Oxford Brookes has been once been home of teaching for the director. Although I haven't myself had the pleasure to be lectured by the man himself, his education in film is reaching me through his craft and non-more superbly shown then through Cold War.While recruiting a group of Polish citizens to perform communist propaganda songs in a traveling concert, composer Wiktor Warski (Tomasz Kot) becomes infatuated with a peasant girl Zulu (Joanna Kulig) rumored to have killed her father. As their secret love is kept hidden during the tour, Warski and Zulu struggle to find true happiness in their bond while the events of the Cold War unfold over 15 years.Loosely based on the lives of his parents, Pawilowski takes us on an powerful journey into war and love simultaneously. As Zulu and Warski cross paths over different sides of the Iron curtain their attraction to each over is invaded by their political contexts that prevent them from being together. You could easily mistake this couple for Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman from Casablanca (1943).Its not just the central romance that rings the bell of Rick's Caf√©, but indeed in the look and feel of the film the golden age of cinema is seeping out. Pawel Pawlowski's takes us back to a more traditional form of cinema with a 1:33 ratio, black and white, and more classical cinematography from Lukasz Zal. We are transported back in time, with Zal's camerawork with movements and stills that could very well have come from films from the same era.The central performers of Kulig and Kot bring authentic and immersive energy to their roles, building a beautiful relationship that we are engrossed by for the entire film. But its Joanne Kulig's electrifying performance that's the stand out. From her journey to small peasant girl to a concert star is a natural as the flourishing of a flower. One sequence with Kulig's Zulu dancing in a bar is poetry itself.Cold War's jazz soundtrack is narration of the story itself with an early melody about a forbidden love already foreshadowing the star crossed lover's tale. With some unforgettable music sequences in the dark smoke room clubs with glimpses of tormented eyes of Zulu as she sings. You can almost see a lot of Damien Chazelle's La La Land (2016) in the nightclub scenes.Pawlikowski's portrayal of love in war is a masterful construction of beauty and melancholy, led by the wonderful central performances. A tale that says much more with its visual than dialogue another pure testimonial to cinema itself as well as the director's parents. Marvellous.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Close to being a masterpiece.,"There are two cold wars going on in Pawel Pawlikowski astonishingly good film, (he won the Best Director prize at Cannes). The most obvious one is the one between East and West during the period in which the film is set, (it covers the years 1949 to 1964), a time when, simply moving from one country to another 'illegally' is enough to get you called a spy and sent to a prison camp for 15 years but the other cold war is the one between its protagonists, Wiktor, (an excellent Tomasz Kot), and Zula, (a stunning Joanna Kulig), who are almost crazy with love for each other but who can't live together or, it would appear, apart.We first meet them in Poland in 1949 when Wiktor is one of a group of musicians touring rural Poland in search of authentic folk artists that they would mould into a musical company. Zula is the exceedingly pretty and talented young girl who catches Wiktor's eye; in time they have sex and start a love affair. Years pass; they meet and part and move from East to West and back again. The Cold War going on around them does little for their self-esteem. As Wiktor tries to hold it together, earning a living playing piano in a Parisian jazz club, Zula hits the bottle. Hollywood has done this kind of thing in the past but seldom with this degree of fierceness.Pawlikowski shoots his relatively short film, (it clocks in at under 90 minutes), in a series of compact scenes that simply fade to black, mostly to denote the passage of time, in stunning black and white, (his DoP is Lukasz Zal). He also uses music to great effect, both Eastern European folk and in the second half, American jazz. If the term 'musical-comedy' is an over-used one then let's call this extraordinary film a 'musical-tragedy'.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
I'm In Love With You And All That Jazz,"Joanna Kulig is recruited for a Polish folk song chorus right after the War. Tomasz Kot is the arranger/conductor, and they soon begin an affair. When the chorus begins to become popular, however, it is suggested that the folk like to sing about Stalin. When they do, they are rewarded with an appearance in East Berlin, whence they plan to escape to the West. She doesn't show up, so he goes on. It takes ten years before she shows up in Paris, where he scores movies and plays in a jazz bar.Pawel Pawlikowski's feature has been chosen as Poland's submission for this year's Best Foreign Language Movie Award, and it has a lot going for it. It has beautiful, crisp black-and-white photography - intended, no doubt to mark it as a period piece - two good looking leads and uses its musical score to cover the flowering and eventual senescence of post-war Jazz as a metaphor for the couple's relationship. However, those are the bare necessities of a good movie, which it is. As a serious contender for an Oscar, it needs to offer more than a good story, told well; at least, I would hope it should. I think it's worth seeing, if not revering.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
A very frustrating experience,"Let's get one thing out of the way - Pawel Pawlikowski is a talented beast. He knows what he wants aesthetically, he makes sure his films are the perfect visual experiences with nice music and great editing - something you don't get too often in polish mainstream cinema - and he is overall a decent guy. I enjoyed Ida less than most people, but I respect that film. At least you could call it a coherent story.When it comes to Cold War, however, things get tricky. It looks and sounds fantastic. It's a technical marvel, at least by polish standards. Having said that, you'd be better off watching it without sound.The story is a mess. The characters are walking tropes. The actors (except for Agata Kulesza and Tomasz Kot, who don't disappoint) don't seem to know what they are doing. The dialogue is simply laughable and the pacing is so terrible, I can't even describe it without swearing.How am I supposed to believe in love between two people, if we aren't shown any? And yes, it is supposedly a story about a mismatched couple that can't live without each other - what a shame there is absolutely no chemistry, nothing but point-blank declarations from the characters. I believe that you need much more than sex on screen and a person saying ""I love you"" to portray a touching romantic experience. Because if this film isn't a romance, what do we have left?It leaves out important parts of the story, like relationship development. The ending is a joke (historic accuracy much?). Joanna Kulig is infuriating. Borys Szyc left me screaming in frustration.It's a shallow film that tries really hard to be much more than it ends up being. It won't bring anything into a viewer's life, maybe except for passionate discourses about said flick on parties. But those discourses annoy everyone, so the only two people really benefitting are Pawlikowski and your inner critic. A very disappointing movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

star-crossed lovers,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good love story? The wonderfully talented filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski proves to us the massive difference between a story of 'good love' and a 'good story' of love. With two lead characters based (somewhat) on his own parents (and named after them), we witness how two people can be simultaneously meant for each other AND not meant to be together. It's the story of a man and woman forever connected, yet painfully mismatched.Director Pawlikowski's extraordinary last film, IDA (2013) won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film, and this time he starts us off with a curious montage of Polish folk musicians (including bagpipes and violins) performing their songs ... each in stark and static close-ups. This strange opening only makes sense to us much later, as we realize what a key element music plays in the numerous shifts in tone - the chapters - of the story.Former lovers Wiktor (Polish star Tomasz Kot) and Irena (Agata Kulesza, IDA) are co-directors of a Polish song and dance performance team, and as they are conducting auditions, Wiktor is immediately drawn to Zula (Joanna Kulig), one who has a pure singing voice but a questionable past to go with no previous dancing experience. Irena recognizes lust when she sees it, but Wiktor stands firm that he perceives Zula's stage presence as something special. The film covers the period of 1949 through 1964, and in that time we watch as Wiktor and Irena are both proven right. Mr. Kot and especially Ms. Kulig deliver extraordinary performances ... truly captivating.Director Pawlikowski offers up a love story unlike anything we've ever seen on the big screen. Wiktor and Zula experience the most tumultuous and romantic ride through Poland (the company first performs in Warsaw), East Berlin, Paris, Yugoslavia, back to Paris, and back to Poland. There were likely some other stops along the way, but those are the ones I made note of. Sometimes they are together, other times they are separated. It's 1952 East Berlin where they formulate a plan to defect ... only Zula is a no show, and they don't meet up again for a couple of years. In one Paris rendezvous a few years later, Zula explains to Wiktor that she married another man ""for us"". Somehow this makes sense.It's best to know no other specifics of this relationship. Star-crossed lovers is not a phrase used much these days, and perhaps even that description falls short. What causes someone to sell their soul for another - or sacrifice so much? How can so much pain and humiliation be accompanied by so much longing and yearning? What's fascinating is that the film's music styles shift in tone right along with their relationship. Sometimes the music is political (with a Stalin poster) - as that is the wall between them, and then later Zula is dancing totally free to ""Rock Around the Clock"".There are no wasted words here. The black and white images of cinematographer Lukasz Zal complements each segment with the appropriate softness or harshness depending on the characters' emotions of the moment. Certainly at the heart of this story is the role of memories ... how snapshots in time can impact our feelings, at times causing us to be oblivious to rational thought. As viewers, we experience a constant feeling of impending doom - even during the good times for Wiktor and Zula. The unusual editing style of extended cuts to black signal shifts in time ... the blackness held for an extra beat or two, allowing us to brace for the next chapter. Polish jazz pianist Marcin Masecki scored the film - a crucial element not just because our two main characters are musicians, but because the music guides us through the lives we see. The film recalls the crown jewel of mismatched lovers in CASABLANCA as two lovers apparently meant to be together, but real life circumstances prove too much. Yet another excellent film from Pawel Pawlikowski.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Powerful drama beautifully photographed. It's tough out there in the Cold War.,"""He mistook me for my mother and a knife showed him the difference."" Zula (Joanna Kulig)The heroine's tough words express the need for defiance in Cold War Poland. Cold War is a powerful film of dark and light, a love story set in Soviet dominated Poland, post WWII, that evokes the disjointed and desperate Poles trying to preserve their folk culture. Ironically, the Soviets watch over the songs that adjust to Soviet tastes and are obedient to its direction. In other words, the central love affair between very young Zula (Joanna Kulig) and older Wiktor Tomasz Kot) is punctuated by dislocation to Paris, return to Poland, and eventual tragedy.Despite the disorienting nature of one country taken by another, the music, authentic or not, captures the Polish rural roots while it looks to tomorrow with rock 'n roll. The lovers are torn between the motherland and modernity, doomed to physically and figuratively wander to find a home and an enduring love.The beauty of writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski's romantic drama is the couple's attempt to keep connected, for they are passionately in love. Along the way their music (she sings, he plays and conducts) and Poland's make a flawed attempt at preserving traditions and their loves. The crisp black and white is a perfect vehicle to exemplify the ambiguity of the political situation and the stark reality of the lovers' struggle to vanquish the forces aligned against their fulfillment.",,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Romeo and Juliet in Cold War Poland,"The Polish movie Zimna wojna (2018) was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Cold War. It was co-written and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski.The movie stars Joanna Kulig as Zula, a young woman whom we first see as a trainee at a folk dance school. It's there she falls in love with Wiktor, portrayed by Tomasz Kot.Zula is a rural girl, whereas Wiktor is a sophisticated professional. Despite this, they fall desperately in love. The plot of the movie is that of star-crossed lovers who want to be free in a time when no one was free in Poland.This was a very good movie, but not a great movie. Although the lovers endlessly say that they love each other, in my opinion the chemistry wasn't there. Also, they make very bad decisions for reasons they don't explain. So, partly, the star-crossed lovers are to blame for their bad fortune.Still, although it's grim, the film does keep your interest throughout, and the music that they create is worth hearing.The two protagonists are good actors, as is Borys Szyc, who portrays Kaczmarek. Kaczmarek probably would have chosen another role in life, but he accepts the situation as it is. He's the link between the dance group and the Polish/Russian Communist apparatus. He's always watching, and always seeing.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre as part of the outstanding Rochester Film Festival.

The leads are competent enough but don't seem to have any chemistry. The music is nice but the staged numbers should have been in wide-screen colour. The main female character, Zula, is very unsympathetic. All she wanted was to be mistreated by everyone, including the world in general.A shame, as I wanted to like it. It's not a love story.

A thoughtful meditation on love,"There are some movies that I can bang the review out the moment I leave the theater (for example, ANY movie starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). There are other films that I need to sit with for a few days and sort out my feelings and thoughts about them. Such is the case with the Polish film COLD WAR.I am an ""Oscar completist"" and, thus, needed to see this film, not because I am a big fan of foreign films or because I am culturally literate, but because the Director of this film, Pawel Pawlikowski, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.And I'm glad I saw this film, for COLD WAR is a rich, thoughtful, meditation on love and sacrifice that is full of mood and emotion. This film was conceived, written and directed by Pawlikowski and it shows on the screen. There is much heart on display here. It is said that Pawlikowski patterned the two lead characters after the tumultuous relationship of his parents (he even gave them his parents name), so I gotta think there is some knowledge and depth to these characters and their situations that resonate.I walked into this film not knowing much about the plot or characters and this actually worked in the favor of the film, so I won't say much about it now except to say that this film follows the characters Zula (Joanna Kulig) and Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) as they experience life and love in Poland in the years just following WWII, the ""Cold War"" years.As far as the acting goes, both Kulig and Kot are strong and they share a rich chemistry with each other. The film crackled when these two personalities were on the screen together and didn't crackle when they weren't together, so that must say something for their performances. Anyone else on the screen is ""fine"" (read: forgettable) in service of the plot and the two leads.But, make no mistake, this film is a Director's film and Pawlikowski deserves the Academy Award nomination he received. The scenes are lush, and very ""European"" (lots of shots of still objects with a single viola playing in the background). The film was shot in black and white and this really helps the ""behind the Iron Curtain"" feel of things.This film was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, and I think it has a good shot for that award (Pawlikowski is, I feel, a long shot for his award). Which makes this film worth seeing, just know you are getting a Polish language film, centered on two characters, with lots of long, lingering ""beauty"" shots setting up environment and feel. Don't expect fast pacing and action.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

The cinematography is pretty and the context, worthy. But that is it. I learned nothing, felt nothing for the characters and wasn't taken anywhere by this film. It's a case of the wrapping paper being better than the present.I don't want to be mean about the filmmaker or wickedly speculate on the reasons this film has gained critical acclaim. What I can say is the mark of a good film, at least for me, is that you can and feel you must see it again as there is a recognition that there are so many things to appreciate that a single viewing cannot satisfy.

Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot are luminiscent in their roles, playing a couple whose lives are lived under the shadow of sadness. The film is atmospherically shot in black and white, and the music inherent in the story (she is a singer, he is an arranger) provides a natural soundtrack. The characters (perhaps because they're Polish) have almost Kieswlowskian personalities: emotional yet fundamentally serious. The use of French and Polish settings also echoes the master.

Cold War left me COLD!,"I feel as if I was watching La La Land (my favorite Romance film, and one of my all-time favorite movies), except that I wasn't invested in the ""love story"" even for a single moment! Simply because the romantic relationship between the two main characters is not clearly illustrated and surprisingly very shallow. I even couldn't understand why their love is so strong; why these people are so stuck to each other. I would have been more convinced that they fell in love with each other if their love was at-first-sight kind of love. But their love is even more corny and superficial than I could have ever imagined. They continue to move all the time and make love and argue, while there is not enough emotional heft to their relationship. The movie never even delves into the romantic aspect; it only displays the parts that unit the ""lovers"" before driving them apart again. And I honestly wasn't invested neither in the characters, nor their relationship and the obstacles they face over the years. It comes as no surprise that the movie becomes boring at some point. Yes, that means that I wasn't bored per se all the way through the movie, and that's for some reasons.For starters, the cinematography is simply awe-inspiring! Every scene is one of breathtaking beauty. The black-and-white color style creates a romantic and nostalgic atmosphere that tricked me that I would enjoy a love story that fits its setup. Cold War hands down deserves an Oscar for best cinematography, despite the fact that there are many 2018 films I've seen that look astonishing. Cold War has a truly striking visual aesthetic.In the beginning of the movie, Pawel Pawlikowski skillfully showed us the life in Poland after the war and the folklore culture. The nostalgic sense and the illustration of another culture in another era are so pure and genuine. Let alone the mesmerizing singing scenes that serve as small feasts for the senses.As for the ""political"" territory that the movie tackles, it's equally superficial and flat as the romantic aspect. Nevertheless, I was surprised that I cared about this ""capitalist world"" more than I cared about the romance between Zula and Wiktor, considering the fact I'm not into politics at all.Both the two leads, Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot, elevated their colorless characters by delivering powerhouse performances that were enough to make me not hate Zula and Wiktor.I was prepared to see a masterpiece, and now I really feel that I've been cheated.

'Cold War' is a love story but history at the same time. Unstable and depressing time is beautifully portrayed at each stage of relationship between Zula and Wiktor.

Basically, it is the intense love story of two people (reputedly the author's parents) that spans 15 years and transects Europe. From the very beginning the character Zusa emerges as the axis upon which Wiktor's world revolves. No matter where he goes to escape oppression he cannot escape Zula's hold over him. It is impossible to take your eyes off Joanna Kulig as she inhabits this character or to escape the spell she weaves. This is fine acting. The choice of a black and white palette suits the mood of the piece while the life of the music shattters those bounds. Not a movie for everyone but there was something about it that captured me.

******* Wild Thing,"""Cold War"" is just another example of why European filmmaking is leaving Hollywood in the dust; if you want to see motion picture achievement, watch an imported film. Problem is they're not available in very many theaters, and ""Cold War"" is another casualty. In New York City it is being shown in two theaters, which a loss for moviegoers looking for something special in movies.Zula is an ambitious peasant girl with a restless spirit but is trapped behind the Iron Curtain. It 's 1949 in Poland and she comes to tryout for a Polish national musical troupe. She falls in love with its director who is looking for an excuse to defect to the west. He tries to take her with him but she is unable to follow. Years pass and they meet now and then on Tour stops. It is the saddest love story I have ever seen.Director Pawlikowski has captured the texture and feel of the post-war era behind and in front of the Iron Curtain - at least to my satisfaction, not having been there. Joanna Kulig is excellent as the beleagured Zula, a girl and then a woman tossed along in the rapids that is her life. The overriding feel is of separation and emptiness which is accentuated by the black and white cinematography. It is definitely worth your time if, like myself, you feel unfulfilled by current Hollywood fare.7/10 - Website no longer prints my star rating.",,Anonymous,"History, Music"
very fine looking film,"This is a very fine looking film with the, now unusual format, of 4:3 plus use of black and white helping to convey the period of the 1950s. Music pays a large part here and we begin with field recordings of folk music in the Polish countryside and pass through more formalised dance and music troupes until one of the same plaintive songs has been heard in various forms and ends up as a jazzy night club offering. As, if not more important, is the relationship between a singer and her mentor and we are privy to this relationship as it blazes in Poland, Yugoslavia (as was) and Paris. Some of the most beautiful sequences are in Paris, night scenes along the Seine with the trees rustling and glinting silver against the buildings and walls. I feel this wonderful looking film would have worked so much better if I had been able to become more engaged with the mismatched couple and feel that perhaps the writer/director had such a clear idea himself, whether influenced by his parents sad history exclusively or not, that perhaps insufficient effort was put into this element.

Though two artists, getting drunk on Paris life an utterly absorbed with each other (for the most part) the film is strangely devoid of passion. Unlike Betty Blue - a tragic look at a couple obsessed with each other and in love - the lack of character depth in either the father or mother lends itself a more melodramatic feel. Artistically put together and lyrically beautiful, it doesn't hit the spot in the same way as The Last Resort. There is something very sad about it (there is no child in the film - no Pawel Pavlovsky himself) which must surely stem from Pavlosvsky's relationship with his parents.

Finally they return to each other, but even then they fail to see any meaning of their relationship and just leave it at that. There is much sex here but no real tenderness, no sincerity of feelings, as if the surrounding ubiquitous cold war had to keep them constantly as cold and basically indifferent as the political reality of the war.

"Its just OK. Don't fall into the trap of ""4:3 ratio + BW = amazing"" like the director wants you to","Pawel Pawlikowski was so flimsy and uncertain during the making of his ""The Woman in the Fifth"" (Ethan Hawke, 5.4 on IMDB) that the film ended up a huge commercial fail. It seems he's then continued his run of 85ish minute films by sticking to very simple stories told in frosty black and white and the 4:3 ratio. Why, they must be incredible arthouse films! Well, no.This is not Kieslowski or Tarkovsky. There is no greater meaning or depth to be unpicked from a frame. The more you look, the more annoyingly shallow and superficial the film feels, like its been carefully constructed to hit enough notes to look like a worthy film. You can almost feel the director thinking ""how can I shoehorn in a smoky jazz scene?"" then ""how can I shoehorn in some rock'n'roll dancing?"" but there's precious little relevance to such scenes.Its not a bad film. Its often nice to look at, and its fairly engaging (although it abruptly throws you out of a scene with the episodic 'jump ahead a few years' structure, when you don't feel like the scene you just saw was particularly relevant or substantial).But what's the point? Love can't be stopped? Obsession transcends time and circumstance? Please. It gets to a point where it stops being relatable and never approaches the level of emotional maturity or intelligence that it pretends. I just don't trust or think that the director really has a clue what he's doing, and is simply throwing a lot of stuff at the wall in the hope that it 'looks' like a film.

Almost a great film,"I have not read many of the other reviews here, but I admit that I was reluctant to buy this film. I disliked ' Ida ' for its suicide of a Jew ( as if enough horror had not been enough in her life ), and I expected to dislike ' Cold War. ' Pawel Pawlikowski is genuinely a good director, if he just misses out on being in the cliched ' great ' category, overused by me sometimes and far too overused by paid critics. He has his own vision, and his own style and his use of black and white is stunning to look at. He can create very powerful scenes, and this film was a love story that I believed in but failed in its power to totally convince by its ending, and like ' Ida ' gave a kind of religious pessimism that I again disliked. I thought the hopping about countries aspect was moving and Joanna Kulig is in my opinion a great and beautiful actor. The joy when she dances to ' Rock Around the Clock ' in Paris was one of the best scenes I have ever seen on film, and she reminded me of Brigitte Bardot at her very best. Yes, I did say Bardot, still in my opinion underrated as a fine actor when she was given the chance. And it is in Paris that a decision is made that turned the film around leading it to a too easy conclusion in a ruined Catholic church. The last words of the film was of a triteness that seemed to deny all that had went before, and the truly existential feel of the bulk of the film went completely out of the window. I also felt it was put in to please certain modern currents of belief in Poland that I utterly deplore, and that would please that kind of audience. True religious films are rare. Some Berman, some Dreyer and certainly Bresson have achieved it but sadly I do not think Pawlikowski is quite in that class yet. He could be if he took things to the limit, but both ' Ida ' did not achieve it and in the ultimate analysis I feel ' Cold War ' just misses out on being what we all like to call a masterpiece.

I was waiting for more emotional development to happen but it never surpassed a passionate lust affair. This type of relationships simply didn't fit the overall tone of the movie and more development is the one thing it is missing. There were also a couple of moments that were unrealistic and without explanation (such as one character disappearing and randomly appearing again at a strange time).Overall, Cold War is obviously a well-made film, but unfortunately the story is so forgettable that it keeps it from reaching its potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Almost a great film,"Pawel Pawlikowski is a brilliant film maker, using powerful images and tackling powerful issues.

No spoilers but I thought the ending was too final, and that their existential journey should have continued. There is one joyful scene in Paris where the superb Joanna Kulig who plays one of the lovers dances to one of the iconic song of the 1950's ' Rock around the clock ', and it will linger for a long time in my memory. A beautiful actor in all ways, she captured my imagination and I utterly believed in her. Tomasz Kot as her troubled partner was the right choice, and he almost equalled her in his performance. I would willingly give this a 10 if it was not for the choice of what happens after they had left Paris but I respect those who go along with it.

"Polish drama flirts with greatness, undermined by a shocking and senseless conclusion","I have never seen a film capture the desolate despair of Eastern Europe after the Second World War as in this case. This film offers a beguiling tale of a middle-aged Polish musician who travels to a feudal area and becomes infatuated with an aspiring female singer who is among the peasant folk who audition to perform for his company. The two fall for each other and their love blossoms into a perpetual romance that survives many upheavals including the company being taken over by Stalinist ideologues and the man's decision to leave Poland for western Europe.Performances here are extraordinary by the two leads. They present a compelling and sympathetic couple who can't stay way from one another despite marked differences in their character. She as it turns out comes from a troubled family. He is an old soul who finds rejuvenation in a woman so combustible and unpredictable. It's one of those romances whose imperfections make it the perfect love story.Alas, we have this film's conclusion. I cannot abide a film's resolution that does not conform to the character arc. If there is insufficient character development or plotting for the climax that takes place, then the ending will only take away from the film's logic. That is what happens here; the resolution robs the film of its greatness because it is so senseless.

Wonderful performances but...,"Saw this at a screening last night in NYC.The film is visually striking and the two central performances are quite wonderful but it just didn't quite add up for me. I suppose seeing Alfonso Cuaron's incredible film Roma (also stunningly shot in black and white) the night before may have unfairly influenced my view of this one. Still, I wanted more from this film and ultimately didn't get it-I'm referring to the sort of character/plot/setting details which fly fast and furious throughout Roma but which rarely seem to appear in Cold War.The director Pawel Pawlikowski and leading lady Joanna Kulig (who really is superb playing a very difficult character) were at the screening for a Q&A. Both were extremely charming and articulate. I enjoyed Pawlikowski revealing that he advised Kulig to bone up on the 1940s siren Lauren Bacall to capture her character's ""sarcasm."" My main issue with the film came to the fore when Kulig said one of the reasons her character felt out of place during the film's midsection was because Zula missed her ""family"" of folk singer/dancers. The problem is we never actually SAW her interact with them like a ""family."" In fact we only saw her interact with one of them once during the audition sequence very early in the film and even then it was for an opportunistic reason.I do recommend this film, though. Many of the set pieces involving music are striking and there are many images (especially Miss Kulig floating in a lake) which will stay with you for a long time.

Not quite what I was expecting,"I have to admit that this film was extremely well marketed for what it really is. Honestly, Cold War is not the masterpiece one would expect.

However, the screenplay falls short and film editing, in my opinion, is flawed.I think Cold War was very close to be an amazing film. The main issue is that the characters have no depth, therefore, the story feels empty and unrealistic. Even when many assumptions can be made throughout the film, the love story between the main characters seems hard to believe.For an 88 minute film, Cold War feels very slow paced and boring. I felt there was no substance or emotion that could really captivate the audience. Finally, reusing the same song over and over got really annoying. I can't say I recommend this film, but acknowledge the effort of its creators. I haven't seen all the films in the race for the foreign film Oscar.

Uncompelling Love Story,"Some may be turned off in the beginning by the pretentious aesthetic of the visuals but, in my opinion, this is where to positive reviews actually rang true. The photography is great. The square aspect ratio seems a bit self-indulgent but I found myself forgiving that quickly.As many have noted in other reviews, the biggest short-coming of this movie is the so-called love between its insufferable main characters. It is difficult to invest any emotional stock in their plight because circumstances or antagonizing forces are not really standing in the way of their love, they just choose to not be together. Sometimes it's a matter of not feeling like putting forth the effort or, in the case that they do find themselves together, one of them decides that they would rather be with someone else or be somewhere else. As a result, I stopped caring about their relationship halfway through the movie, and why not? If their relationship is not a priority for them why should I care? This flat cycle of ""love"" and disinterest continues along a dramatic plateau, leading to a climax which strains the definition of the term. It was devoid of any significant emotional weight or catharsis for me.There are morsels of other interesting issues for us to consider related to the backdrop of the story (questions of cultural identity, political uses/implications of arts and entertainment, loyalty and commitment to the pursuit of one's own interests). Others seem to suggest that this movie's genius must be read between the lines so, if you decide to watch this, keep in mind that you'll need to come up with compelling central story elements yourself.",4.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

"Cold War juxtaposes slow, patient individual scenes with very quick chronological transitions to jarring effect, but the acting and story are too heartfelt not to love","While on a scene-by-scene basis Cold War seems like a slow burn, really there's so much packed into each scene and implied beneath the surface that if you're not careful, you'll miss most of the movie. Pawlikowski has created an emotionally driven romance that also uses the political climate to heighten the tension of the film. Kulig's performance is exceptional as Zula, giving her character a distinct impulsive and bold personality. Her on-screen chemistry with Kot was strong and looked like a real, obsessive mutual attraction. It wasn't until late into the movie that I realized just how quickly their lives were changing - several times they meet in a country for just one scene and move on. While I'm impressed with Pawlikowski's ability to create a coherent and moving narrative in such a short runtime, I do think the emotional investment would have been heightened by having more time spent with the characters and seeing more of their events - the combination of slow takes and short time spent in any one location means we never really settle into a rhythm. To some degree that's an intentional directorial choice and representative of their relationship, but there were times they were clearly in love and met up in a city but there's no explanation for why one leaves or why they don't make any sort of long term plan. The script gave Zula tons of room to shine and really showcased her character, but Wiktor's character wasn't as distinct. The ending is beautiful but devastating. It's a strong film that I'm glad received so much support, and I only wish I had been more ready to be intellectually aware and interpret its subtext from the start.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

"if it was uplifting, it was always through tears","Pawel Pawlikowski's follow-up to Ida that won the Best Foreign Language film at the Oscars in 2015. This polish film set during the Cold War, feels like it was plucked straight out of the 50's. From the gorgeous black and white cinematography, to the stunning music that has such a variety but still seems to fit in every scene, and to the two main actors Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot. They did a fantastic job, I believed their chemistry, their desire to be together, but also their frustrations. There is a scene where Zula and Wiktor are on a boat and it reminds me of a scene in Charade with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, just enjoying this quiet moment that they have together and looking out at people as they pass by. They know that this moment is fleeting, but they still take it in. It almost feels like a silent movie, and I wouldn't have minded if it was, but the music is so great in this that I'm glad it's not.

The beautiful black and white photography is the main attraction of this film,"""Cold war"" has much in common with ""The unbearable lightness of being"" (1988, Philip Kaufman), a romance amidst political turmoil.In ""Cold war"" the romance gets more emphasis than the political turmoil. On first intance this seems logical as ""The unbearable lightness of being"" is situated during the Prague spring of 1968. However, less well known than Hungary 1956 and Czechoslovakia 1968, Poland has had his own uprising in 1956.Whereas in ""The unbearable lightness of being"" the romance is divided over two women (the self confident Sabina (Lena Olin) and the shy Tereza (Juliette Binoche)) in ""Cold war it is brought together in one woman (Zula played by Joanna Kulig).Zula is not to be trifled with. When she tells about the abuse by her father she says: ""My father mistook me for my mother and a knife showed him the difference"".At a critical moment in time Zula also hesitates between the East and the West. In the West she will have more freedom, but in the East she is already a star. Who guarantees the she will also become a star in the West?This brings me to another difference between the two movies. In ""Cold war"" the contrast between West and East does not coincide with the contrast between Good and Evil.Zula experiences that both in the East and in the West you cannot always uphold your principles when you want to reach the top. In the East there is political pressure to include pieces of propaganda into your stage performance. In the West you sometimes have to open an extra button on your blouse while doing an audition.Beautiful black and white photography from cinematographer Lukasz Zal.In comparison with ""Ida"" (2013, Pawel Pawlikowski) ""Cold war"" was for me a slight disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Staggering,"Cold War is a high-handed tour de force of filmmaking courtesy pizzazz that in the final analysis, thrives due to its pristine inclusions of comforting original music, compulsive cinematography, stellar performances, and
sincere dialogue.In spite of these stainless insertions, Cold War didn't ""to the hilt"" secure my heart considering how hollow I found the bulk of the story to be. Some may find its unadorned, clich√© romantic efforts to mark the beauty of the film but personally, I found it to be quite fain√©ant. Fortunately, the conclusion of the movie takes a courageous and lionhearted route that at long last, redeemed the presumed lacklusterness of the previous acts' schemes.Cold War is a seductive yet, melancholy viewpoint on the state of being maligantly lovesick.

Touching Love Story,"A love story set across 15 years and many countries. The film opens in 1949 with Wiktor (Tomas Kol) and Irena (Agata Kulesza) collecting folk songs and music in the mountains of Southern Poland. Along with administrator Lech (Borys Szyc) they set up an Institute to form a Folk Song and Dance Troupe. During the auditions for students Wiktor notices a student, Zula (Joanna Kulig), who though not technically a perfect singer has something special. Two years later They become lovers and admits that she has spied on him for Lech (she is still on probation from prison), a party hack. Lech has already persuaded the Troupe to include songs praising Stalin into their folk song repertoire. When the Troupe visits East Berlin Zula agrees to defect to the West with Viktor, but changes her mind.Over the following 12 years they meet at intervals, pursuing a love which never seems to properly work out. Two artists, occasionally working together even living together in Paris, striving to find that perfect synthesis of love and music. Wiktor makes great sacrifices to try and be with Zula but he doesn't fully appreciate the losses she also suffers from pursuing their seemingly doomed relationship. Zula would always be scarred by her early life experiences and her doubts that their relationship could ever work. Great performances from Kulesza and Kol as the star-crossed lovers and Szyc as the scheming bureaucrat who carries a torch for Zula.

Their story covers many tours in Communist Europe and later includes the jazz scene in Paris in the 1960s.""Cold War"" is beautifully directed by Pawel Pawlikowski who was also directed ""Ida"" (2013). Like ""Ida"", ""Cold War is blessed with beautiful black and white cinematography. It also has stunning music in a variety of forms including peasant folk, jazz, and classical.It is inevitable to compare ""Cold War"" with ""Ida"" in other ways. Kulesza had a supporting role in both of them though her role in ""Ida"" was more prominent. In her few scenes in ""Cold War"", she plays an artistic director who is at odds with the shallow Communist authorities who work to manipulate the choir as a propaganda tool. The film would have benefited if Kulesza's role had been expanded.Also, like ""Ida"", there were some rash decisions made by main characters that were incomprehensible. In ""Ida"", this occurred only in the second major role (the one played by Kulesza). In ""Cold War"", it is both Irena and Wiktor who act oddly in ways that are not understandable - at least to those who have not lived through the harrowing experience of eastern Europeans who survived WW2 and then subsequently lived through Communism. Nevertheless, Kulig and Kot are passionate as lovers in a very difficult time and there is little doubt that ""Cold War"" is a film that pleases the senses on many levels. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Cold War,"In a lot of arguments against modern films, or I guess the case could be made for older films as well, it seems as if audiences in general want all the easy answers and don't necessarily want to have to think for themselves or ponder a film and it's meaning after they have watched it. Cold War is a film that I think many would argue has not enough character development and a lot of viewers would be left scratching their heads as to why the characters in this film do what they do and why the relationship depicted in the film often feels strained and more like a love/hate relationship than one that is based out of love. I think here as with any number of art house, or films that would leave more up to the audience's interpretation as an emotional means, but also to have a lingering if not haunting effect upon the viewers after the film is over. There is I would argue a fair bit of character study on display here and what is not shown, or maybe instead is implied to the viewers, I would still say speaks volumes about the character's tendencies, personalities and overall motives as to how they live their lives and what is the logic or reasoning behind a lot of their decisions. The two main characters are often seen fighting either verbally, or a few times physically and there seems to be a general sense of tension and hostility between them. At other times we seen them in the throws of passion and as if they would never leave each other and like they mean the absolute world to one another. And yet these characters go years and sometimes close to decades without seeing each other and forming other relationships and commitments with their lives, but there still seems to be a yearning and a tiny if yet large fire blazing inside them whenever they do reunite whether it be for a brief, or lengthy period of time. One could argue that these two lovers are often very cold both emotionally and on a romantic level with one another, but I think for both of them that it is only a part of the attraction to one another and while they have tried (how hard is up to interpretation) to live apart, we somehow know and feel that in a sense despite the peculiarities within the relationship and the lack of emotion or depth still lingers a love that will ultimately conquer the contradictory forces both in their home lives as well as the country's backdrop as to where they are living as well. This is a film that is certainly a fine example of stage and spectacle and some of the song and dance numbers whether it be a more folksy traditional number on stage, or to the smoky and yet ambiance filled scenes set in Paris clubs that feels both cool and classy at the same time. This is a film that is heavy on mood and atmosphere and some of these scenes are amongst the finest I have seen in any film of last year, or in recent memory. The cinematography here is also amazing with any number of single shots, or frames that could easily be put on display in an art gallery with how much it says in each shot as well as the beauty captured in and around the events in and out of focus. The black and white photography is probably the best looking I have seen recently and the film's cinematography nomination at the Oscars was more than well deserved. Joanna Kulig who plays the lead character, plays her with a lot of intense emotion and feeling and yet can be quiet and vulnerable at times when the role requires it as well. It is one of the most impassioned and yet heartfelt and longing performances in recent memory and she could have easily won any number of acting awards for this spot on and powerful portrayal. The film looks great and sounds great and is certainly a sight to behold and I am pleased to say that it gives it's viewers a lot to think about and does not gives us a cheap way out, but instead allows us to linger on it's beauty and it's ugliness and the film is all the more resonant and powerful for having done so.

Something that it seemed just a simple plot at first changed in something far deeper than that. The direction which was made by Pawel Pawlikowski who is also one of the writers of the movie, it was very good and he showed many truths about Poland of that time and he succeeded on making us relate to their main characters through a well establishment of them. The interpretations of both Tomasz Kot who played as Wiktor and Joanna Kulig who played as Zula were very good and they both did an excellent job on how they presented their characters, their dreams, their fears and their goals.

Style over substance - but what style!,"First of all, this film is a feast for the senses. The cinematography is flawless, and the Soundtrack a fascinating journey through the history of music in the fifties and early sixties - fitting for a film about musicians which uses music as one of its main means to convey mood.
That said, the writing and acting seem more like a frame to hang pretty pictures on (but what Pictures!). The plot is standard and contains no surprises (except maybe one) - just your average 100 % artificial extruded will-they-or-won't-they product. The writing is occasionally snappy, sometimes hilariously blunt and mostly refreshingly free from romance-movie clich√©s.The acting is spotty - a very charismatic leading lady is paired with a male co-star who always seems flat and passive, following her around. The supporting roles (of which there are few) are adequate, but nothing more than that. However, the main flaw of this film is simple - there is absolutely zero chemistry between the leads! That it manages to engage you emotionally anyway is a credit to its directing and presentation; at no point do you go ""those two are in love, alright"".

A beautifully shot film about a terrible time and terrible people which mirrors the modern day,"This is a film about compromises, and how communists in their attempt to universalize art turned it into kitsch, the final insult of enforced propaganda. The modern day counterpart does much the same with dumb down globalized films further poisoned mandatory woke messaging. Both give lip service to serving the common man, but in reality they regard them with contempt. These systems destroy art, they destroy tradition, and they destroy people by destroying standards of tradition and morality.

Repetitive and boring,"Cold War is cinematically very beautiful and clearly someone put some thought into it, but that didn't extend through character development.

Many things remain unexplained as the viewer jumps year to year, also they age zula throughout the movie more than wiktor (he is the classic silver fox and looks more or less the same throughout). As other reviews have mentioned, their relationship is not so believable- they have very little chemistry and very few full conversations throughout the movie.

"Solid 4 // Epic in scope, short in length","The trailer for Cold War suggests a languid, intimate romance set to a series of shuffling cool-jazz ballads. The film itself, however, delivers something much wider and surprisingly ambitious in scope. It's an epic, decades-spanning romance told in an incredibly tight hour-and-a-half. The passionate romance suggested by the trailer is certainly at the core, but layered around it are themes of obsession, disordered personality, art vs. politics, nationalism, classism, exploitation, and tyranny. The film accomplishes so much in such a short period of time that it's hard not to marvel at it, even if the break-neck pacing can be a bit emotionally distancing. Strip away the sociopolitical commentary and what you're left with is a powerful exploration of the pleasures and dangers of all-consuming love.

Everything I wanted LA LA Land to be as a movie,"I know it is a strange comparison to make - one movie is set in a Cold War Poland and another in Hollywood but I felt that the underlying stories of the movies were weirdly similar. I must admit that walking out of La La Land I felt disappointed, perhaps the most disappointed I had been with a movie that year, the idea was great, the execution not so much. On the other hand Zimna wojna delivers on all levels. The characters, the visuals, the story and emotion. Coming from a European country I would suspect that non-europeans will have a hard time appreciating this movie as it talks about life in a very non-american/western way and presents it from a point of view of a Polish person. There is certainly a possibility of a culture clash.Overall I think that if there is a tiny flaw in this movie it is its story. It is very good but at the same time it does not have that extra transcendent element to it. It is more of a poem than a novel. The story is the reason I gave this movie a 9 rather than a 10. I will certainly watch it again and depending on how I enjoy it the second time around I might change the rating to either an 8 or a 10. I am very happy with this movie which is, I think, a bright spot in a year full of dull remakes and superhero movies that are destined to make billions.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Love Hurts,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A beautifully made dysfunctional love story.JIM'S REVIEW: Director Pawel Pawlikowski used his own parents' love story as his inspiration for his tragic tale, Cold War. Set in 1946 Warsaw, a music teacher becomes enamored of his young talented student. (Call me a prude, but this serious lapse of judgment never becomes an issue and this Humbert and Lolita relationship shrouds this unhealthy affair throughout the film for me.)The film follows the lives of Wictor and Zula for the next 20+ years and the changing landscape of a world at war. Caught up in the politics and upheaval of Cold War Poland and the rise of Communism, these two self-centered Bohemian souls fall in love while they battle their own personal demons.The film is superbly acted by Tomasz Kot and Joanna Kulig as the two leads. Their mercurial relationship is shown episodically and the actors fill in any gaps in their characters' many mood swings and ill-advised decisions which result in many severe consequences along the bumpy road to love. All is gloriously filmed in b& w by Lukasz Zal. The stunning imagery gives the film a somber look and captures the bleakness of the period most effectively.The screenplay by Janusz Glowacki, Pioti Borkowski, and the director has some lovely dialog in its dramatic storytelling, although some clarity is lost in translation with the film's episodic structure. At times, the jumps in time frames are jarring and in need of fine tuning. Also, the characters, as written, are basically callous and too self-absorbed to really care about. Even the beginnings of their relationship may come into question by some moviegoers due to their noticeable age difference (adult vs. teenager) and ongoing destructive nature which kept them at an emotional distance from this reviewer. (I just could not justify this dance by two sexual predators, even if its powerful ending is filled with pathos and sadness. Much should be credited to the palpable chemistry by the talented Ms. Kulig and Mr. Kot and Mr. Pawlikowski's masterful direction.)Nevertheless, Cold War is a beautifully realized and well crafted love story that makes a solid case for its two doomed and very dysfunctional lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Beautiful soundtrack,"The movie starts of as bold and energetic, with reasonably good dialogue and beautiful soundtrack.

"A deep well, but confusing","Set in post WWII Poland, two musical artists are ill-fated in love, and struggle with maintaining their love while separated by politics and circumstance.
This film had its moments of brilliance, especially the musical score, but the plot was sometimes indiscernible. I felt like this story was freewheeling through space and time with no compass. Maybe this was emblematic of the jazz period that filtered through the background, but this felt more like a gothic romance set out of place.
I could not always sympathize with the characters' decisions or issues, especially since many of their issues were self-inflicted. The chemistry between the two leads was there but it did not help with the stilted, manufactured anger (which some mistake for passion) that would bubble up periodically throughout their decades long semi-relationship.
I did not like this film as a whole, although some things were good. I felt the music, the jazz era coolness and messy vibe. I felt the coldness and the settings. On the other hand, the passages of time gave me whiplash. I could barely understand the motivation for anyone's actions. The emotional arc was severely curved. I could relate to the feeling of being drawn to the same person throughout life because they were your first love, but the way that these protagonists treated each other made no sense. I'm surprised it is getting so many rave reviews. Perhaps because the soundtrack is amazing, which is why it gets a 5/10 from me.",5.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
love in times of cold war,"Pawel Pawlikowski continues a tradition of remarkable film directors that left their mark in the history of cinema in the second half of the 20th century and made of the Polish film school one of the best in Eastern Europe, competing in value and number of remarkable movies only with the Soviet school of cinema. Andrzej Wajda, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and young Roman Polanski made wonderful films despite Communist censorship, fighting and tricking the censors and using cinema as a mean of social and political protest using the tools of art. 30 years passed since the fall of the Communist regimes in Poland and the rest of Europe, but film makers from that part of the world continue to get back obsessively to those times. They do it now with a different perspective, and free of political constraints. Did time heal the wounds? Maybe, at least in part, but there are lessons to be learned, traumas carried over generations and realities that perpetuate in mentality that invite to thought and debate.'Cold War' (the original title is 'Zimna wojna') tells a non-conventional love story that takes place in troubled times. Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) is a musician and co-founder of a musical institution for talented young people trying to promote authentic Polish folklore - music and dance - in the conditions of increased ideological pressures. Zula (Joanna Kulig) is one of his pupils, a young and beautiful girl, just out of a troubled childhood. Their relationship goes against all the conventions because of age gap, social status, cultural level, puritan rules of morality. Poland is hardly a place were their relationship can blossom .Aspiring for freedom they will cross the Iron Curtain on both directions, but hardly find happiness or accomplishment in the Paris of the 1950s either. The impossibility of their love - is it caused by the hardship of time, or by personal incompatibility? I did not get a clear answer even after the last frame of the film.What I liked. The whole cinematographic concept - black and wide, narrow screen format - fits well the story and makes a reverence also to the cinema of the period when the action takes place. The music is fabulous. It starts with real folklore songs, continues with the processed folklore mixed with the hymns to Stalin which was promoted in the Communist countries at that time, switches to jazz and French chansons for the time spent by the heroes in Paris, and returns to the 'light music' of the early 60s in Poland. Music tells as much about the period as the story itself. The settings and the atmosphere are carefully designed, from the muddy desolated landscape of Poland in 1949, passing through the Berlin of 1952 still bearing the scars of war, the Paris of the 1950s undergoing the Americanized healing, and back to the Poland of the late 50s and 60s, with its own version of the Gulag but also with the false shining of life 'normalized' under Communist control. All these are realistic and credible.What I liked less. Although both Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot are fine actors and their individual performance are good, their relationship does not look at any moment too credible on screen. Hard to tell if their lack of chemistry is intentional or not, but they never seem to fit one with the other, and their love story looks as cold as the war which gives the title to the movie. This surprising lack of vibration lessens the final impression about a movie with many qualities and certainly worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
LOVE STORY DURING THE COLD WAR...!,"A nominee for Best Foreign Language at last year's Oscars. Taking place during the turbulent Communist regime'd years in Poland during the 1960's, a pianist/talent scout & the singer he discovers embark on a romance which spans time & runs the gamut of emotions. As much a romance between people of different strata while serving as a commentary on the failings of a repressive government trying to stymie the creativity of artistes, this film, shot in gorgeous black & white (much like director Pawel Pawlikowski's previous feature Ida), is episodic yet an emotionally involving treatise on love which tugs at the heartstrings but empowers one's sense of time & place when a love affair begins w/the best of intentions only to be hampered by the marching drums of history.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

"Artistic, cinematic but, missing key.","Directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, who has penchant of making gloomy background movies in black and white. Which works really good as most of these movies stories from around WWII or after war during cold war era and when his own country was under iron clad Soviet Communist rule.The story is of two lovers in the cold war era when the cultural difference and life style was very different or at least the way West used to portray from the era.Life may be bit harsh during that time in East Europe, but it didn't mean they were all sad, depressed and suicidal infact one more thing to observed, many times people from the era missed the old life, as per them life many be bit harsh or minimal but, they were happy as not much greediness or materialistic of western world exists and people were happy with simple life.So this story was about two lovers Wiktor and Zula who met under certain circumstances and fall in love.Though that movie present as a canvas in time and space, what it lacks was key element.Right from the beginning their love seems doomed.Wiktor wanted to leave communist Poland and was under the impression that Zula would follow him. Though Zula supposed to come from village area, but practically she was more mature beyond her age and understands things better and it seems the with little background into her childhood she was much better control on what she wants, compared to Wiktor which we came to know as we progress though the movie.So Wiktor left for Paris and Zula stayed in Poland, while Wiktor never get the same fame and respect in Paris and still feels outsider, Zula eventually became famous singer.These lovers meet time and again, but never able to stay together for long. They had to leave for various reasons and then, longed for each other and then meet again and then leave, finally they got together in the end, but the destination of their doomed love looks exhausted, and not really complete.There journey of love looks much better than, their destination.As it seems in reality a true love is the one that never completes and I guess to me the end where they finally say good bye and leave at train station would have much more impact than, when they finally got married and sit with clueless looks on their faces like now that or from here where? Like they found the destination, but don't know what to do with it or like the fleeing and brief encounter was much better than, this forever and ever kind of relationship.So basically, the movie missed two key things, when they entire movie presents as tragic love story, then it should end like one.Second, character development, the director never invested in their character much and more concentrate on there lives when they are together, rather than what's their life when they were alone, also they big miss was the harsh realities of cold war.The director based entire movie on cold war era, but hardly showed the life from that era.It seems in the end that, this love story could happened in any era with some modification.Overall a good watch for cinematography, scenery and artist visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Came for the Communism. Stayed for the Music.,"Pawel Pawlikowski's newest film ""Zimna wojna"" (Cold War, 2018), is an interesting depiction of European history. The film starts in 1949 in Poland, and the narrative spans for over a decade, visiting many countries on the way. The film tells the love story of Wictor (Tomasz Kot), a musician, and Zula (Joanna Kulig), a young singer. They first meet in communist Poland and gradually come to decide, that for them to have a future together, they should defect to the west.The film, shot in black and white, depicts a very interesting period of European history, although that history frequently has to make way for the romance. My biggest issue with the film was, that the love story, which is so central to the narrative, didn't feel that special. I did not really root for them to end up together, nor for them to split up. I was most interested about the societal depiction of the communist block and later, that of France.The crowning merit of this film, however, is not the cinematography, although that too is great. It is the soundtrack. This film documents the evolution of popular music in communist countries and in western Europe, and does it in an interesting way. I found many of the songs really nice to listen to, and couple of them quite funny. This film sounds and looks great, and even though the romantic narrative did not really hit home for me, this was a positive experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
UNEXPLAINED INTENSITY,"Cold War is an amazing movie in all aspects. Starting with the 4:3 screen format, almost square, in contrast to the modern trend of widescreen productions. The beautiful photograph of the young Polish cinematographer Lukasz Zal features a black and white figured out in a striking and intimate chiaroscuro.Following the track of an unlikely couple, a conductor who researches folk songs and a singer and dancer, the film recounts the relationship of 15 years, mainly occurred in the 50s, which, in any other production, would be an epic but here it is reduced to fast scenes of a passion that transits between unexplained intensity and challenged impossibility. Although time is linear, it occurs in uneven spaces and with no clue as to when the scene occurs.It is as if the script wants to prove at every moment that reality always finds a way to demolish all the plans and dreams. This is how the group of Polish traditions that intends to represent the true rural art ends up being co-opted by the communist party, unfurling a gigantic poster of Lenin. The musician Wiktor invites his beloved Zula to cross the border to the West in Berlin (there was no wall yet), but the girl has other priorities.From this first mismatch, others occur. Paris does not match the ideal dreamed by Wiktor, who becomes a pianist in a club and composes soundtracks for horror movies. Eventually, they get together, but the relationship does not work out. The musician tries to return to Poland, goes to Yugoslavia to attend a performance of the Mazurek troupe just to see Zula, but none of this works either.The ending of the movie is breathtakingly beautiful. After going through all the misfortunes and managing to overcome geographical, political and psychological barriers, the couple, named after Pawlikowski's parents, finally solve the problem of remaining together.

Stunningly shot in black and white - should be an instant classic,"In 1949, music director Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) is travelling around post war Poland seeking folk singers and artistes for a forthcoming show he is putting on. One girl stands out from the others, Zula (Joanna Kulig) who seems to come with a good deal of baggage. Wiktor begins an affair with her and after a while she tells him she has been asked to spy on him. So popular is the tour that they are instructed to sing messages about the great People's Republic under comrade Stalin that once they get to East Berlin, Wiktor plans to defect to the West and asks Zula to join him. She doesn't turn up, he goes anyway and over the years they carry on their affair.Stunningly shot in beautiful black and white by cinematographer Lukasz Zal, the film is also presented in a 4:3 ratio, perfectly capturing the atmosphere of the period, captured in so many post war Eastern European films. This includes the scenes in Paris too, with its smoke filled jazz filled cellar bars recalling many films of the period from LES 300 CENT COUPS, LES AMANTS (both 1958) or even PARIS, BLUES (1961).The Cold War of the title of course refers to the politics of the time that keeps the couple parted, as well as the classic ""can't live with each other, can't live without each other"" and destructive nature of the couple's relationship.

Another Amazing Foreign Film!,"Cold War Review:Cold War is a Polish film that follows Wiktor, a music director, who falls in love with Zulu, a singer. He tried to persuade her to flee communist Poland and go to France with him during the 1950s Cold War. This film is nominated for three Oscars this year including Best Foreign Film, Best Cinematography, and a big surprise for Best Director. Naturally I wanted to see this based on all the buzz it's been getting. People have either said they love this film or don't like this film on first viewing. I loved it! It had an interesting story throughout. Pawel Pawlikowski co-wrote and directed. He did a phenomenal job. I can definitely see why he got the directing nomination, though if I had to swap out a director for someone who is nominated, I would choose him. It's a music based story so it caught my attention right away. I knew very little about it going in. I saw the trailer once and read about it a few times and knew that it was about the Cold War and a singer. With it being a foreign film I didn't think I'd have the opportunity to see it in theaters, but I'm glad to have had the chance. Joanna Kulig was amazing and the best part. She was very good at playing singer Zula and I don't understand why she wasn't talked about more in the Oscar race. Yalitza Aparicio was talked about way more for Roma, another big foreign film this year, since it was her first movie ever. Though I thought Yalitza was better Joanna was still very good but this film wasn't praised for its acting. I can compare this film to Roma since they're competing for Best Foreign Film (I'll explain more later). Tomasz Kot as Wiktor was also another great part of the film. I liked his character and thought he was a great casting choice. The two actors were great with acting but I didn't feel their love connection entirely at first. It was just kind of there. I did like the two together and it added to the film, but it was just kind of thrown there. The cinematography was beautiful and I can see why it's nominated. Just like Roma it's all in black and white. I love black and white movies and it added effect with the time period. My vote is for Roma to win Best Cinematography because that was a beautifully shot film. There was no score to this film, just like Roma, but I loved the singing and song choices. The song performances, whether it was solo or for a concert, were another one of my favorite parts. Overall this was a very good film. My only issues were the love story being thrown in right away at the beginning and there were a few slow scenes. It was what some may consider to be a ""slow movie"" which I like but there were a couple lengthy scenes. I don't know when anyone would really have the chance to see this film but I would highly recommend this beautiful foreign film.My Grade: ANow to explain the beta between Cold War and Roma. As I explained earlier, they're both foreign films nominated for three of the same awards (Foreign Film, Cinematography, and Directing). This has been the year for foreign films. Now Roma is also up for Best Picture which some people feel is wrong. I'm personally fine with a foreign film being nominated and potentially winning the award. What I don't feel is right is a foreign film winning Best Foreign Film (it's basically their Best Picture) and Best Picture. Right now for foreign Film it's between those two movies and it's hard to tell. Roma is currently predicated as number one to win both Foreign Film and Picture. My thought and many others think that if during the awards ceremony that night, if Roma wins Best Foreign Film, it won't win Best Picture rather, in my opinion, Green Book. If Cold War wins Foreign Film that means Roma will win Best Picture which would be amazing since that's never happened and it's also a Netflix film. It opens a door for both foreign films and streaming services. This will be a very interesting year for the Oscars.

The politics of Cold War are always present, the story being told against the pressures of the ideological battle, the somber spaces of control, the dark characters.A beautiful, intelligent, poetic film, indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Delicate and cruel,"""Cold War"" the playful Polish film Pawel is beautiful, with a clear technique, a convincing script and good performances, the film is one of the best films of the year. ""Cold War"" tells a love story between two post-World War II Poles, their encounters in opposing situations, their forbidden passion, misfits, romances and separations that revolve in a period of almost 20 years aligned with Pawel's great technique are the ingredients perfect for making a great movie.A photographic dedication that uses black in white with full cinematic notion, is like watching a movie from the 1940s, the use of film filming contributes even more to its rustic and playful beauty at the same time. A firm plot that is based on a great editing and editing that make the film not be heavy, although the same is repetitive, you do not feel its weight, but may lose some interest in the course of the work. And that was the great sin for me, the non-use of external script resources to branch out the plot, which develops in a medium way its characters.The duo of actors are very well in the film, just like their director of photography, director and composer who do an excellent job that together make up a different, daring, delicate and cruel film.

"Truly excells in breathtaking visuals and sound, but is lacking A BIT in drama...","The cold war period is used as a backdrop for a story about 2 passionate lovers, who get separated at some point. Is their love strong enough to survive the separation?Unfortunately this love story is A BIT lacking in drama. Just a bit. It only lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes. That's extremely SHORT for a dramatic story and I really missed the buildup in drama, storywise speaking. Lots of plot turns happened too quickly. And especially the dramatic relationship between the 2 lovers didnt get enough screen time in my opinion. The director admitted in an interview that he cut out 30% of the scenes and although it didnt hurt the movie, the dramatic devellopment felt a bit rushed at times. You have to really pay attention to get the dramatic cues, because many dramatic plot turns happen in merely seconds.The actors, who portray these 2 lovers deliver good performances, but they dont ooze charisma. A dramatic love story is at the core of this movie, but I am not experiencing any truly dramatic romantic scenes, which should have brouhgt me to tears or should have swept me off my feet. I missed the usual intense emotions that go along with such a story. The director made a deliberate choice to portray it this way and it has it's peculiar charm, but I was baffled by the absence of emotions as well.What is truly impressive about this movie though are the visuals and the music. Only a few genius directors are capable of creating such heavenly, beautiful images, which are almost physical in nature. I could almost touch, smell and feel the images, they are THAT powerful and breathtakingly beautiful. I still get goosebumps thinking about them. The music score is truly magnificent as well. I havent been so pleasantly seduced with truly heavenly sounding music in years! Both visuals and sound are truly oscar worthy! Just for these brilliant sound and visuals alone, one should give this movie a try...Concluding: this is one heck of a gorgeous black and white portrait of 2 lovers.

Unlikable love story,"Beautifully shot and well-acted, but shallow and irritating. The film depicts the love story but takes no time to tell you who the lovers are or why they do what they do. With them at arm's length, there's so little to grasp onto and as the finale unfolds, I just ended up rolling my eyes. There were several good movies that could have come out of this - one about gathering folk songs in rural Communist Poland, one about Polish expatriates in Paris, one about working in the Soviet music industry - none of these are the movie that was made, however, and any of those would have required more detail given to character to make it work.

Another gem from writer-director Pawel Pawiilowski,"""Cold War"" 2018 release from Poland; original title ""Zimna wojna""; 90 min.) brings the story of Wiktor and Zula. As the movie opens, it is ""Poland, 1946"", and Wictor and several others are driving around in rural Poland, taping various local (mostly folksy) songs. Then they go recruit rural singers to form an ensemble of singing and dancing. Among those auditioning is Zula, and she catches Wiktor's attention right away/ Meanwhile, the Communist Party sees a great opportunity to use the ensemble for political purposes... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the last time we heard from writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski was when the stunning film ""Ida"" was released some 3-4 years ago,, to universal acclaim (and winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie). It was one of my favorite films of that year. Now he returns with another post-WW II story, but that is where the parallel ends. Let me state upfront that ""Cold War"" is plot-heavy, and hence I will not say another word what happens or doesn't happen. Instead let me heap praise on its two lead performers: Joanna Kullig (as Zula) and Tomacsa Kot (as Wiktor) are both outstanding. The movie, like ""Ida"" is shot in striking B&W, and moreover shows in an almost (but not quite) 1:1 ratio. One caution: there is a LOT of singing and dancing in the movie (although the movie is NOT a musical), so if you don't care for music, you may want to consider something else. At the end of the movie, we see that Pawlikowski dedicates the film ""to my parents"", and in fact the movie is loosely based on them.""Cold War"" premiered at last year's Cannes festival, to (once again) immediate and universal acclaim (Pawlikowski won ""Best Director""). No big surprise then that when the Oscar nominations were announced recently, ""Cold War"" picked up 3 nominations: Best Foreign Language Movie, Best Director, and Best Cinematography. I don't know that it will win, though, as it is up against ""Roma"", an even better film (with 10 Oscar nominations). Regardless, ""Cold War"" is another gem from writer-director Pawel Pawiilowski. :Cold War: opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended ok but not great (about 15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film shot in beautiful B&W, do yourself a favor and check out ""Cold War"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Cold War"" is a WINNER.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Great Cinema but I wanted a better conclusion.,"My Review-
Remember the great days of Foreign movie stars like Sophia Loren and Marcello MastrioannI and directors like Visconti and Fellini ?Well all these ingredients are evident in the Polish film Cold War with the pairing of Joanna Kulig as the luminous Zula a beautiful talented , calculating charismatic but damaged Polish refugee and Tomasz Kot as Wiktor the musician and her handsome rescuer and totally obsessed lover.
When we first meet Zula in 1949 desperate to join a Polish Folk Academy while on probation for stabbing her father , when Zula is asked why ? her chilling reply is
"" He mistook me for my mother and the knife showed him the difference""
The story filmed magnificently in Monochrome and on a smaller screen ratio 1:37:1 in keeping with the era which covers 15 years is a love story Romeo and Juliet style , which may explain my only criticism a very odd and puzzling ending.The director Pawel Pawlikowski has created a beautiful atmosphere and ambience to suit the era
and chosen a superb cast to portray the characters.I loved the 2 music styles in this movie the Polish folk songs and dancing in the beginning and the sultry jazz in The Paris night clubs that follow on as the couples story unfolds over the years.
This film is nominated for 3 Academy awards Best Foreign Movie , Best Director and Cinematography .
Ihope it wins Best Foreign Movie , it probably won't because Roma a film , which left me totally cold and bored is the favourite of The Academy I suspect purely because of its Mexicaness and as a protest to Donald Trump.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

For the couple, the passing years are unremarked, as when they see each other, all that matters is their undiminished passion.

Eye candy with no narrative or character development,"Obviously taking its inspiration from Fellini, the story of two lovers in cold war Poland and ""western"" France is one that totally did not grip me. Sure, the photography is great & the acting is OK (though not great) but that's about it. Otherwise this is a story with no surprising twists, no real plot, no secondary themes. It's empty.The scenario is boring and revolves around one single thing: the love of the two protagonists. That's it. Nothing else. There's very little about the political aspects of those times (just some details regarding censorship and the Polish communist government trying to create propaganda) and furthermore some twists are completely unbelievable (after many years of separation she suddenly finds him in an obscure bar in Paris?). Also, the eternal love, that the movie is supposedly about, is not built up at all, but rather a given at a certain point in time. Also, folk music and dance roughly amount to 1/4th of this anyway short movie (80 or so minutes). The dialogues are cringeworthy at best. In short, there's not much to like here, in my opinion.It's hard to get into the skin of the two protagonists and their love. As said, it's not built up, there's hardly any character development. The two stay the same for 20 odd years and that is basically all the movie offers. No secondary characters, no other twists, no other deeper meaning.I am boggled by how this movie (and also Pawlikowski's other tragically bad but somehow critically acclaimed movie 'Ida') received so much positive press. For me there's nothing in this movie except eye candy. Perhaps all the critics have suddenly fallen in love with Pawlikowski and the type of movies that have no message, no meaning and just superficial splendor. Maybe it's the black and white thing? I don't get it.Seriously flawed scenario with very little surprising elements. In short, simply a boring movie with unbelievable and uninteresting characters and theme.

I'm usually against it, but this movie looks amazing in black and white, especially the faces look astounding. Even though there were a few scenes that I would've liked to see in colour.And there's a lot of social and political commentary. They were rough years, it was difficult to be an artist, let alone be a woman in those times. I can understand Zula very well up to a point. But let's not romanticize destructive love, no matter how hot it looks on the screen, and it does. I could never be Zula and most men would never go all out like Wiktor.

Perhaps it would've been a little more palatable if I connected to the characters at all, but in reality, I didn't. I couldn't feel the intensity of their relationship. Maybe it was because of the length of this film and the quick time period transitions or perhaps it was just because the characters lacked that semblance of a real human being but, instead, were just cinematic caricatures.The historical backdrop was what kept me engaged throughout the film, not the characters and their arc.

Its black and white cinematography by Lukasz Zal is gorgeous, extraordinary, showing impressive mastery in the usage of (currently unusual in cinema) 1:37:1 aspect ratio. As the movie is very musical, portraying the story of a musical director and pianist who worked in the selection and training of a state-sponsored folk music ensemble, and a bold and younger aspiring singer, soudtrack is very good too. It brings together a lot of Polish folk songs (including many versions of Dwa serduszka), several songs by George & Ira Gershwin's, and many other nice ones, such as Rock Around the Clock, Cole Porter's Love for Sale, and Polish version of The Internationale, just to mention a few.On what concerns to the story, it is a Cold War Romeo and Juliet. The world was split in capitalist West v. Stalinist East, like Shakespearean Verona Capulets v. Montagues. Differently from the bard's romantic tragedy, here the couple was not composed by naive teenagers from enemy families. Wiktor and Zula did have different backgrounds, but what made their troubled love to be impossible was not their families, and even not that harsh split world where freedom of movement was choked. What made their love to be so similar to Romeo and Juliet's were their different decisions when they faced far from ideal alternatives.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
A lovely story about the heart and the true artists,"The message of the film is so lovely that it makes me weep.Since long I've been thinking of TRUE artists, as well as TRUE scientists, TRUE businesspeople, TRUE educators... wondering about their ways of choosing ""a side"" when it comes to the happening of war or such political matters. I always believe that those ones have their own side, not the two political sides. Their side is the heart and how free it can be to beat the rhythm of love. That's an important messgage many people may have learnt but we do need to make sure every next generation, young artists and young people with expertises, should acknowlege, understand and consider it as the meaning of their working life.Talented artists can make a good living anywhere because all and every human society -- no matter which side or what political background -- needs art. How beautiful it is in this movie, the film makers choose music as an incarnation of art and the context of the Cold War in Europe to tell the story of artists and how they evolve from 'talented' to 'true' artists.After all, Cold War is just a war like any other wars. After watching this movie, as a Vietnamese I imagine what if this love story should happen in the Vietnam War, two sides are the South and North Vietnam, then the couple's hearts would still be theirs and the flow would be the same, as lovely and warm as true artists' hearts.Another thing to say, artists are supposed to be born to feel lonely. So how lovely it is to see an artist couple finding love and freely choose a happy ending together.Such lovely story is told by brilliant storytellers: the movie makers.

"Interesting, and a suggestive reminder of Camus-styled existentialism","Here between us, however patriotic a Polish of the 1945 Generation might be, who would prefer the Iron Curtain to Paris? especially Wiktor, an outstanding musician, who had sufferingly left the love of his life, the pretty Zula, behind in suffering Poland. This movie is another flagrant case of style & form to the detriment of content. ¬®Cold War¬® may even win an Oscar - it has two basic ingredients - rampant passions and Soviet totalitarianism, - but it hardly reaches a comparison with the best film essays by Wajda and Kieslowski, to name only two Polish masters contemporary of the Cold War era in real life.
The cinematography, the items of the musical soundtrack and the excerpts from ballet folk choreographies are admirable attractions here. An impressive visual treatment evokes the New Waves of the 1950s and 1960s, but the plot is elliptical: loose and barely sketched, neither sufficiently enveloping the spectator nor spelling clearly its philosophical sense or the author's ultimate message, whose protagonist has a weak personality. Wiktor sacrifices his art to Stalinist Jdanovism and his life and his freedom to such an ungrateful, unfaithful partner, Zula, a selfish, spoiled and annoying young girl - herein, supposedly, a femme fatale.
One can try a Camusian approach to this film. Wiktor and Zula had already lived throughout the WWII. The Cold War, which was not properly a war, began simultaneously with the end of the horrors of WWII. The film takes place between 1949 and 1964 and places on the table, even though metonymically and indirectly, the great questions of existentialism, a doctrine that had its apogee and greater popular influence precisely in the 1950s and early 1960s - especially on account of Albert Camus.
Wiktor, an intellectual and an eclectic (folk, classical, be-bop) musician, flees from the Iron Curtain to Paris in 1951 - the year in which Camus published ""The Man in Revolt"" - L'Homme R√©volt√© or The Rebel. Because he was not a supporter of the Cold War between US/NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Camus was considered an eccentric, and therefore criticized by the right, the left, and the center. His fidelity was towards truth, not ideology. He was opposed to state assassinations, terrorism and wars in every quarter. An artistic anarchist, with a passionate spiritual hunger, an austere and moral Don Juan, a sensual man of conscience and honor who earned a reputation for a lifelong literary meditation on death in all its forms: illness (he suffered from tuberculosis ), murder, suicide, death penalty, war, etc. One of his first novels is ""The Happy Death""; death as ""happy"" as absurd, at one time as sudden as slow. Likewise in the movie ""Cold War"". Camus's enemies were social injustice, political perversion, the powerful who thought they had the right to make others suffer and die for their perverted purposes, liberal imperialism, Soviet Marxism, and abstract ideologies in general.
Popularly known for his writings on absurdity (which for Camus was only a necessary first step to revolt, and eventual suicide), when he died on January 4, 1960 in a car accident in France having in his pocket an unused train ticket, the press explored the absurdist nature of his death! The media still do so. But did it really happen like that? There is a conspiracy theory that, instead of an automobile accident, Camus might have been murdered by the KGB because of his criticism of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, the massacre of Hungarian freedom fighters and his defense of Boris Pasternak and the novel, Doctor Jivago, among other things.
According to such theory, the accident that cost Camus' life would have been organized by Soviet spies who damaged the tire of the car using sophisticated equipment that cut it, or caused it to be slashed at high speed.
Camus's exegetes soon rejected the idea. But a book called ¬®Camus must die¬® recalled another mysterious death, in 2013, of journalist Michael Hastings in the United States, when his car accelerated to more than 100 miles per hour and exploded against a tree on a highway in Los Angeles.
Whatever the cause of Camus's death was, of course we can echo his voice today. He served beauty and suffering, he defended the innocent in this basically murderous world, he was haunted by images that still haunt us, as of 2019 preys of megalomaniacs and paranoids suffering from the Syndrome of Hubris and feeding dreams of conquest. We remain in an absurd prison, threatened by madmen brandishing small and large arms.
The world as a prison is of course a metaphor with a long and popular tradition. Over the last hundred years or more, with the secularization of Western culture and the perception of God's ""alienation,"" the gates of that prison took popular imagination with a growing number of people feeling trapped in an kind of alien universe , unable to unite the abyss between themselves and a supposedly absent God. Death has become for many the symbol of the absurdity of existence and the futility of flight. It used to be, though, for the faithful like Wiktor or Zula, an open road to free eternity.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
A Star is Torn,"Told across various European locations over the span of 15 years, Cold War, shot in wonderful black and white, is a short feature-length film that feels like a series of connected short films. Characters don't so much as age, but are leveled by time. What we get to see has nothing on the abyss of stories lost in those gaps.Music ties it all together. Music is everywhere, floating, impenetrable. It can mean so many things and it can mean nothing, perhaps at once. Drunks in a passing trunk sing, the flippant metaphor of insular pop rings hollow, rollicking folk survives all violence and time, Bill Haley & His Comets descend from space, political posturing does what it can to tear out the heart and too often succeeds.On a personal level, this failed to resonate fully with me for various reasons (I...

"A cold love, from a cold world","The title of this natural-born cult to be - in the fading gallery of the ""film-noir"" genre - might be its only misleading trick; or, perhaps, a glitched metaphor about what the two leading characters ended up portraying, along the 15 years in which the drama of their passion develops, during the roughly 90 minutes length of this true piece of art, ""Cold War"": a cold love - yet, a rather deep one indeed.From the aftermaths of WWII, and the so-called ""Cold War"" period that followed, till its peak in the mid-1960s, this Shakespearean-like tragedy of doomed love story takes place in the magnificent desolation of the eastern side of the infamous ""Iron Curtain"", which then divided Europe and the world into two halves, as well as the lives and hearts of the two protagonists, as they also fought their love battles, along this decade and a half period.In a Jim Jarmusch-like style, as the plot evolves, the upcoming years and changing of countries and places are marked by a few seconds of total silence and dark gaps, as if to imply the supposedly void and equally meaningless events between these points in their lives, as time goes by.This second-of-a-kind Pawel Pawlikowski movie (following his first also gifted ""Ida"" - 2013) is arguably sustained by three main thick pillars, rather capable of granting its balance and a special place amongst the cult European film's gallery: incredibly fancy black and white cinematography, perfectly fitting the almost gothic mood of a post-war scenario; deeply touching and melancholic root folk music as you've never heard before in your entire life (unless you're a Pole); and a breathtakingly outstanding performance by leading actress Joanna Kulig, a genuine songbird, a fallen angel from a paradise in which the sky has got the scarlet colours of the flames of hell, but, still, a paradise, rising up above the debris of the deadliest of wars, with her wicked wit talent and pristine beauty, shattering the brittle heart of her lover, while healing the audience's unfulfillable longings with deadly cold redemption.

East West,"Reminiscent of Unbearable Lightness of Being through another prism, the film offers great atmosphere, cinematography and scenes, romantic melancholy, doomed love, and jazz in a place and time when history dictates the lives of artists and lovers - what's there not to like?",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
A visual art and a sonic experience,"This movie, about a music director who falls in love with a singer and tries to persuade her to flee communist Poland for France, is a great romance movie!It's a visually artistic movie that put us right into the events of the Cold War among the Polish people with music as their passion. The movie gave us a realistic experience of the lives in Poland where the communistic government suppressed its civilians, and the people pursued freedom and possibilities.The cinematography is absolutely stunning! It was shot in black and white, and it used the 1:37:1 aspect ratio, where the shots have surprisingly much depth. The camera focused a lot on symmetry. It impresses by capturing both the facial expressions and the environment with unusual angles. I could watch that all day.The story had engagement at some level. Sometimes it became slightly bland, but the visuals in general made up for most of it, especially the music scenes - they were amazing! The music itself was sonically beautiful and pleasing, and I could listen to some of the songs all day. Setting the story aside, the movie is both a visual art and a sonic experience.This is a visually stunning and sonically beautiful movie that captures the passion of the Polish people during the Cold War. The cinematography is masterful, and the music is unforgettable. While the story may be somewhat bland at times, the visuals and music more than make up for it. Overall, the movie is a must-see for anyone who appreciates visual art, music, or romance.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Beautifully filmed,A beautifully filmed but ultimately characterless piece. I understand that the direction and cinematography are pretty but one needs characters and a script you can believe.,5.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Just a bit far from being perfect,"Just like ""ida"", this movie also has indisputably good cinematography, even though there are less imageries that burned in my mind like ""ida"".In some ways, this is a more ambitious story. Just like ""ida"", this is a story that has a very thick layer of history behind it, but unlike it, this movie also tempted to tell a equally long story that stretched out in many years. Personally, I feel like in doing so, the story became less focus and carried less punch. At the same time, it is a less accessible story, unlike the holocaust which I expect people to know at least the gist of things, I actually doubt if many people can get the backgrounds that was the third main character in this story.But I love the fact that the movie didn't try to become parernalistic, it doesn't try to feed you the information in a heavy handed way. They are just there, waiting to add the weight for you when you understand what is truly happening.Overall, it is a very good movie that is just a bit far from ""ida"" But at the same time, it can easily be the best movie you can watch any year.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

"Cold War; or, Wiktor & Zula","""I just want to tell the story of two characters I'm interested in."" -Pawel Pawlikowski (director)I only saw this film because one of my movie peeps ""highly encouraged"" me... and promised to refund my ticket if I didn't like it, which I assumed I wouldn't. I liked it. Since I gave it a 4.5/5 on Letterboxd, I'll just give it a 9/10 officially.(significantly easier to read on my blog)There be slight spoilers below.Cold War was an interesting story of two totally appropriately aged lovers who couldn't make it work long enough to avoid drama and sabotage. It was essentially an adult version of Romeo and Juliet, but with more realism, adult matters, and wartime politics. I feel more sorry for him than her, but that may be due to the film focusing almost entirely on his perspective and me sharing his demographic.All of that being said, I really enjoyed the first half's performances prior to the forced politicization into propaganda. Up until that point, they had so much soul in their performances and love for what they were doing. I felt like I was being allowed to bear witness to people's cultures and appreciated it every time. Once the propaganda bulged in, it all became hollow and they themselves became smiling husks. Props to the film crew for accomplishing this. I'm now wondering how accurate that part of the film is to what was going on at the time.If you think Cold War is about the performances, fear not. They're just a major part of the first half in that the plot is centered around them in a non-overwhelming way. The second half is... let's say a story about a male making his way through life and being occasionally visited by the ghosts of his past in rather life-altering ways. No, it's not magical. Just realistic in the way people and decisions affect your life. Smaller-form performances persists throughout the second half, mind you. That reminds me, the performances are consistently used to portray the mood and feelings of the characters. I'm especially thinking of the last performance in this regard... ~and I'll leave it there.Things I Like:1) Dat cinematography1a) Lemme rave real quick about how much that reflection scene got me in the first half. To pull that simple trick so subtly and at the same time not only foreshadow but allow the audience to presume so much. üëå2) Da performancesSide Notes:I highly recommend watching the behind the scenes videos such as Amazon Studios' ""Featurette"" after the film because of how much more I'm starting to appreciate it. I say ""after"" because realizing that I was seeing it in color after all these months hit me in an strange way and I suspect doing so beforehand would have affected my experience.I don't recall what song was playing during the end credits, but I remember staying seated the entire time.Favorite Line:""He mistook me for my mother so I used a knife to show him the difference."" -ZulaFavorite Character:Zula (when she's not being drama). For her spunkiness.About the Trailers (1 & 2):Y'all, I love it when a trailer manages to show so much and reveal so little. All I'll say is that it effectively covered, say, 50% of major moments but having done so without context revealed next to nothing to the viewer. That being said, if you want to skip the slightest of spoilers, skip 1:28-1:30 and 1:40-1:44 of the first trailer and 1:26-1:32 of the second. Enjoy.Similarities:The Fire (2015). For how I feel worse for him than her.Disclosure:I saw and discussed it with a group in February, so my opinion's been affected by them and my memory of the film is lacking.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
"Amazon, you can do better than this","The first 25 minutes or so were great and then the film promptly fell into the abyss of total and utter boredom. This was one of the more disappointing films I've seen in a long while. Maybe because it was Polish or in black and white or the story wasn't very good. Whatever, I fast forwarded the last half hour in 5 minute clips and don't feel like I missed much. Amazon needs to pep up their movies.",5.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"

Boring unhappy Poles,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The first time I watched it, I actually fell asleep after about 30 minutes. Recently, I watched it again and came prepared: expresso doppio, glasses of ice-cold water and lights everywhere. The story is banal: she is young, blonde and insecure. He is dark, handsome and an old fool. She is passive aggressive, he poses as an artist in anguish. Being Polish, they are typically never happy and never satisfied with anything: even when they are together in the beautiful city of Paris, he sulks and she throws tantrums and gets drunk. The best thing about the movie is the ending, although it should have come sooner: I mean, you just wish you could step in and euthanise them half-way through the story.

Where indecision in love leaves much to be desired.,"After reading the reports and hype about this movie, I knew I had to see it.I'm glad I did, because the mise en sc√®ne of the entire story is so evocative of the 1940s and 1950s, I felt almost transported to those long-gone days, especially with the 4:3 ratio which formed all of my viewing space in those days.That all said, the movie is still somewhat disappointing. The love story is just not sufficiently interesting for me to develop any real liking of the main characters; I really did not care about either of them. The episodic nature of the narrative is somewhat jarring, and marred by relatively long cuts to a black screen before the next 'episode' begins. And the story of an on-again, off-again romance is, well, just ordinary to the point of banality, almost.On the plus side, the acting is, by and large, excellent. Camera work is up to par - despite my above comment about long cuts. The local music is interesting, to a point; background music quite fitting. Overall, the director Pawlikowski did a good job. This is the second movie of his I've seen, the first being Ida (2013) which I admire much more.Overall, I'm happy to say I'm glad I did see this movie, to the extent of recommending it for adults, despite its flaws for me. But which allows for only a five out of ten as my rating.",5.0,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Beautiful and accurate portrayal,"I find this movie a beautiful and accurate portrait of the drama in the relationships and the desire for better life of those who lived behind the iron curtain and those who ""escaped"". This story captures many similar dramas I have heard about from my parents and their friends.The split of Europe, communism, and the ensuing personal drama is well captured in this beautifully told story.",,Anonymous,"History, Music"
Pawel's companion piece to IDA seemlessly evokes the era,"Director Pawel Pawlikowski's follow up to his sublime IDA is another tale of Post WWII Poland. It's also rendered in B&W (by IDA cinematographer Lukasz Zal) and the (co) Lead character is another enigmatic woman.The movie begins with a Soviet/Polish apparatchik project to put on a propaganda show highlighting the peasant songs of old Poland. Once the troupe's artistic director Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) lays eyes on vivacious contestant Zula (Joanna Kulig) he is hooked. A heated love affair ignites almost immediately. Over the course of over a decade, we follow Wiktor and Zula's tempestuous relationship which continues despite extended separations. Using their connections and wiles, the pair also drift back and forth over the Iron Curtain border. But, as the line goes - no matter where you go, there you are. Their current location matters less than their volatile chemistry. Amour fou knows know boundaries.Normally, a short summary doesn't cover close to the full breadth of the story, but, COLD WAR is almost that schematic. Like IDA (82 minutes), Pawlikowski's latest is compactly efficient (89 minutes). There are, of course, many details a synopsis can't convey, but, this isn't a movie so much about plotting as about conveying a feeling. The symbolism about how their fiery history shadows the Soviet era of Poland goes unspoken, but, looms over their coupling. There are moments here that are breathlessly cinematic. Depending on one's own personal catalog of cinema, there are scenes here that evoke memories of Bergman, Antonioni, Resnais and Pawlikowski's fellow countryman, Andrzej Wajda (who passed only two years ago). COLD WAR doesn't just embrace 50s & 60s European cinema - it's in its DNA. Pawlikowski isn't simply making a pastiche, it's in his soul. And, that soul permeates the entire experience. (the movie is inspired by the filmmaker's parents)Kulig and Kot are superb, even with the fairly sparse plotting. Again, it's more the feeling they convey more than mere dialogue. Zal's digital camerawork blends seamlessly with his Director's vision, and similarly evokes the work of his euro predecessors behind the camera such as Nykvist, Vierny, DiVenanzo etc.. The one drawback here is the movie's brevity. While it worked fully with IDA, here the abbreviated runtime seems incomplete (with IDA there was only one main character and the time span is much shorter). While one applauds Pawlikowski's instinct to not underline and highlight each and every beat, there are some sequences (particularly the musical scenes) where it would have been richer to let them play out. It's a small, but, significant flaw in an otherwise excellent production and certainly doesn't lessen the artistry on ample and loving display here.",,Anonymous,"History, Music"
