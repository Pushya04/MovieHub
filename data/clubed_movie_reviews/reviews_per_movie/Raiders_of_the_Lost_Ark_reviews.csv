One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time,"It was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment, but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises. George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the ""Star Wars"" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with ""Jaws (1975)"" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) "".Classic recipe for matinees adored by George Lucas, the work of screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics: virtually all characters in The Raiders of the Lost Ark are based on archetypes, but none of them lack personality. Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though ""Duel"", ""Jaws"" and ""1941"" had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielberg's camera keeping a mystery about Indy's identity - Douglas Slocombe's photograph skillfully covers Ford's face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmaker's camera game, which is maintained throughout the film's other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielberg's ability to command the action is present in the most ""naive"" scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Ford's suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indy's personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero ""asks"" an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: ""I don't know, I invent on the way"". Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the cliché of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en scène that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielberg's brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters' positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologist's gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since ""Jaws"", and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the ""current times"" which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the ""spirits"" of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so don't think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in Caçadores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong ""strikes"" against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
When Harrison Ford was crapping gold,"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.
I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Will stand the test of time forever.,"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars!I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A blockbuster how it was meant to be,"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is.Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend.It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic.

There will never be another film like Raiders,"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great,"This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

cartoon for grownups?,"Everyone else seems to love this movie, so I guess I have to be the one to 'dis' it.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.   I really enjoy a good adventure, but I like it to be more than a quarter inch deep.It was so continuously noisy that I had to turn the volume down.   The music was bombastic and grating.  People die like flies.  The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies.  There is no psychology or character.  The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable.   The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.  We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. etc. and can just have some good clean fun.  But with all this freedom, what is the fun?   Knocking over piles of blocks like a three-year-old and punching the bad guy in the nose.The movie is a pastiche - almost every scene is borrowed.  The cultural vein of nostalgia that is being mined is old -obsolete - adventure fiction. If we could see most of this fiction now we would probably find it childish and dated - we know more about the world now.  The trick is to make us forget that so we can enjoy our nostalgia.Do people really need permission to regress this badly?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Typical American Mainstream Cinema in the Early 80s,"This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best action movies ever made.,"There is no denying, that this film will forever be one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre. Ahead of watching the newest Indie movie, I decided to go straight back to the first one, it's been some time since I last saw it, but it is as still fresh, exciting and downright fun as I remember.The plot is pretty wild, to reach the prized artefact, Indie has to battle through all manner of dangers, battling Nazis in the process, it sounds outlandish and outrageous, but it works.I'd still regard it as Harrison Ford's defining role, he is a huge character, Indie is a real free spirit, he's funny, daring, charming and captivating, the eternal adventurer, perhaps the reason he's back forty years on.Raiders of The Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones, and arguably the best, although I also love Temple of Doom.The perfect film for a bank holiday evening, or teatime on boxing day, it's an adventure that has something for the whole family.Expect some amazing action sequences, this has some impressive fight sequences, explosions, chases, it really is a visual feast, I'm so glad it was made before cinema was captured by The CGI wizards (not that I'm taking away from what those guys do,) but the action feels real.Four decades on, and it's still an exciting, action packed thrill ride, but then you know that already.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Classic and timeless action adventure,"Archaeologist-Adventurer Indiana Jones hunts for the ancient Ark of the Covenant.This movie is a spectacular introduction to one of the most iconic action heroes of twentieth century cinema. It has one of the greatest opening sequences of all time and follows it up with a plethora of classic cinematic moments.We have a McGuffin based plot moving through a variety of locations, encountering a rival archaeologist and hordes of Nazis hell bent on eliminating Indy and taking the Ark for themselves.Harrison Ford is a mixture of Bond and Bogart with his expressive face and rugged charm, while Karen Allen makes a combative and confrontational leading lady. ""You b*****ds! I'll get you for this"" Marion shouts at an entire platoon of Nazis. The two display excellent screen chemistry. One great aspect is the change in attitude we see from Indy towards Marion as the film progresses. Initially it's all about the Ark but by the end it's a bit more about her. Perhaps this is what saves him from the same fate as the film's antagonists.Visually it has the feel of classics like Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Yojimbo. Spielberg has also borrowed and updated action sequences from the likes of Zorro and Stagecoach to great effect. Particularly impressive are the use of shadows in several sequences, my favourite being when the Ark is first carried out of its burial site. All of it is edited so that the noisey excitement is complimented by quieter moments that are just as memorable.Spielberg's anger towards the Nazis rises to the surface in one of the film's themes covering good and evil. Images like the burning swastika and the wrath of god witnessed at the film's conclusion are examples of the Ark punishing those who have broken the covenant held within.John Williams gave the film one of his finest scores and it makes every frame that bit more special. Seeing Indy swinging from jungle vines, chasing a truck on horseback and swimming on to a German U-boat would not be the same without that famous tune to give it that air superhuman confidence.This launched a franchise for Lucas and Spielberg but it was never bettered or even equalled by any of the adventures that followed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

If not, see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't.

"Harrison Ford, in the role that suited him best...","Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist adventurer, who spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasureslike the priceless long-lost Ark of the Covenant (the Hebrew sacred artifact that held the supposed Ten Commandments).

"A wonderful movie, but I still prefer The Last Crusade.","Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style ""thrill rides."" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest ""excavation,"" he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A good film, but nothing more","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable. The special effects are solid though, as is the score by John Williams.It makes for a fun enough watch, even if I did expect better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"I'm no longer the target audience for this film, but still solid.","Before I start, I might as well address the ""sleeping with underage women"" bit which has gotten some controversy in the past few years. After watching Jones' and Marion's first scene together, I definitely raised an eyebrow at the ""You knew what you were doing"" conversation, and after reading the transcript where Spielberg and Lucas intended for Marion to be 15 and for Jones to be 25 when they had their affair, that aspect of the film stuck out as problematic. Due to that (in addition to Jones being a colonist), I wasn't able to get invested in their friendship and eventual romance. If Jones' arc was of him redeeming himself throughout the film, that would be different, but he instead seemed to be portrayed as noble and charming all throughout.So yeah, couldn't get invested in the characters this viewing. In spite of that, however, I still think this is a solid action film. It has some memorable action scenes (the opening), a couple terrific magical scenes (the God's wrath scene at the end is outstanding, in particular), and its fair share of humor here and there (Jones shooting the swordsman). Back when I was a kid, this film was everything for me. When I rewatched it a couple days ago, however, I found that the love I felt towards the film when I was a kid wore off. This isn't to say the film aged poorly per se (rather, I think the film aged great for the most part). It's just not my kind of film anymore and I'm no longer the target audience for it. Since I've watched a number of films like Battleship Potemkin, Zulu, The Wild Bunch, Apocalypse Now, Hard-Boiled, Saving Private Ryan, etc since then, which have action scenes that are far more engaging and technically outstanding, that may play a part in why my tastes have moved on. Who knows. Still though, I think this is a great gateway film and it would definitely be among my top recommendations for someone new to classic film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The mother of countless silly action movies,"Since everybody knows what this movie is about, mine will be a review of the strongest and weakest points. At the time of release, this seemed a brand new approach to storytelling. I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies:the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber manthe thin plot. The search for the Ark is just an excuse to create one action scene after the other. They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the moviethe last ""action scene"". The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles. Anyway, it is unbelievable to imagine that Nazi troops would indulge the request of the French archaeologistthe ""super hero"" nature of Indy. Despite the premise that he is a ""normal"" guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatingsall the sequels. None managed to reach even half-way the level of ""Raiders"" and considering this one already had its flaws.On the plus side:there are some moments of humour, unfortunately not enough. The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market. For one precious scene like this, we have the long and pointless fight with the German guarding the plane, back to conventional narrativean attractive hero with some intellectual pretense. Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)the ironic endingConclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Spielberg's Ultimate Adventure Movie,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones trilogy and definitely the best. This movie redefined what an action adventure movie could and should be. After the epic Horror Adventure that is Jaws comes the epic action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie easily deserves 10 stars for it's sheer innovation, directing, visuals, and entertainment ability. Here's why.Harrison Ford is a perfect choice for the awesome hero, Indiana Jones. An archaeologist who dreams of fortune and glory, he embarks on an adventure to find the Ark of the Covanent and save it from the Nazis. Harrison Ford is perfect in this role and it's so refreshing to see a badass hero that everybody can root for simply because he's awesome and embodies everything we want from an adventurer. Every moment of him is simply cinematic gold and it makes him shine against everyone else, even himself as Han Solo. That's not to say that the supporting actors aren't great, they are, but he's the main character and he steals the show which he should.Steven Spielberg really went out of his way with this masterpiece. The practical effects and stuntwork isn't just phenomenal, it's almost godlike! The action is jaw dropping in its awesomeness to the point where it almost doesn't even look like a movie, it looks like a portal into somebody else's universe: Spielberg's universe. What visual effects that are used are so good that it makes modern day action flicks look like stupid college projects that got F's. Michael Bay ain't got nothing on Golden Age Spielberg! Every scene screams with action and it just gets better and better all the way through but it never forsakes the story in place of action. Modern day directors need to take notes from this movie.Once somebody watches this movie, you soon find yourself in a trance in which you can never get sick of it. Nobody can get sick of Indiana Jones, it's not possible. Go watch this movie and you will be very pleased. Or just listen to the Golden John Williams music, that works too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Indiana Jones disguises himself as Harrison Ford, simple as that","I never set out to watch Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, because I just didn't ... like it so much. Yes, you feel like hitting me for it, but it's the truth. When I got older, I decided to give the film a chance, and it surprised me: what I thought was just an adventure film proved something else. A film in which you care for the characters, and see that it is better that the Ark is never found. The action scenes are very good and the CGI, although it may seem weak (after all, it was 1981), fulfills its role well (snakes still agonize me today). The actors are also very good, especially Harrison Ford, who was and is the right actor to live our beloved hero (also highlighted by Karen Allen).
In short, stop what you're doing and go watch The Raiders of the Lost Ark (before they find it).PS: Sorry for the mistakes (if you have), because I'm Brazilian and I'm using Google Translate (forgive me)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it.

"To me, this will always be the best of the Indianna Jones series","For me it is not only the best of the series but one of the greatest adventure films ever made. It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well. In conclusion, brilliant and if you haven't seen it do. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Magnificent action-packed adventure film that spawned two sequels and numerous copies,"It's the first part of adventures trilogy , going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comics-Books language.

He's only helped by two feisty adventurers (Karen Allen and John Rhys Davies) . Indy fights nasty Arabs , decodes hieroglyphics and faces off hundreds of snakes .

Classic bit of schoolboy action,"In the run up to WW2 Professor Jones is approached by US Intelligence to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant in order to stop it falling into the hands of the Nazi's.  With bar owner Marion in tow, Indiana takes on Nazi's across the globe to recover the ark.The story is pure Saturday morning hokum, but its all shined up with a great deal of professionalism and you don't notice.  The main strength is the tremendous sense of fun in the film - not only is it funny but the huge action scenes are all edge of the seat stuff that are hugely enjoyable to watch.  Be it the opening set piece, the truck chase, the fight around a burning airplane, the chase for a basket or the gory finish - it's all great fun to watch.The performances are pretty cardboard and stereotype - evil Nazi's et al. but it barely matters.  Ford is great - this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good - Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.Overall a good action film for older families.

Indiana Jones Paves The Way For Lara Croft And Countless Others.,"Here it is, February of 2005 and I had yet to see Raiders Of The Lost Ark (or the other 2 in the trilogy for that matter). For some reason, it did not appeal to me. I did not get into movies until the early '90s and never got around to seeing it. However, upon urging of my friend I decided to rent it. I have to give credit where credit is due. Indiana Jones paves the way for the Tomb Raiders and other various movies of the same type.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a doctor in archeology who teaches at a college and in his spare time, finds rare artifacts and saves the world from Nazis. In this case, he is trying to find the Ark Of The Covenant, which at one time held the original Ten Commandments that Moses chiseled into the stone tablets. The Nazis, along with help from Jones' arch rival Rene Belloq, are trying to find the Ark for their own purposes. Along the way, Indiana meets up with a woman named Marion (Karen Allen), who he jilted in the past, which is not really explained in this movie but they end up helping each other in the search for the Ark.The special effects and the action in Raiders Of The Lost Ark are exceptional, considering this was made in 1981. It set the bar reasonably high for action/adventure movies, even to this day as many movies are still compared to the Indiana Jones trilogy. It holds up well, considering most of the movies from the early 80's are very dated and hard to watch anymore. 8.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Extremely overrated movie,"I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, after having seen the last 2 parts of the trilogy some years ago.  I was quite disappointed overall.  The opening was entertaining and strong, but then the movie fell into a horribly boring sequence.  It picks up again during the truck chase sequence, before leaving us with a ridiculously supernatural ending.  That was a let-down for a movie where everything else was reasonably realistic.Another point I wanted to mention is I can't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating.  The amount of gratuitous violence is almost overwhelming.  The body count racked up by the end of the movie is probably greater than all of the Friday the 13th movies put together.  Granted, the amount of violence is equal to many action movies out today, but they don't have PG-13 ratings. The camera lingers on mutilated faces, gallons of blood are thrown around, and countless numbers of faceless Arabs and Nazis are killed or injured. Not exactly family material.The few exciting action sequences here save this movie from being a total wreck, but I can't seen any justification for this movie's current position in the top 20 movies of all time.  Maybe the sentimental factor is the reason.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"When you're hungry, everyone believes you","There are only so many films in history that I can watch again and again, gaining new appreciation for, one of them is this film. I went from the movies to VHS, and finally to DVD. The availability and quality of this film keep raising the bar of what I can get from it.I read someone posted that this is the king of B movies or something of that sort, while I honestly think in some scenes like when Indy is running from the Hovitos and he rises over the hill, the film had a really strange documentary feeling, like if a comic actually came to life and like in the Twilight Zone, you were stuck in it. It is great to see this film, now that I edit and produce small independent films, and have worked in post production in Los Angeles. I honestly think almost every scene in this film is better than what's coming out today in sci-fi/adventure. I might pull back that comment in regards to some nice visuals in Riddick, and maybe the new Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, but I'm not certain.The amount of time and effort put into the comedy, adventure, and depth of each character dazzles me because I really can't tell it was filmed the same year Fame was. It really has a unique look to it. The key lighting in the piece is amazing, almost everything looks like it was perfectly worked out.My only complaint is the attempt to visualize the opening of the Ark, as most of the other scenes don't deal with the supernatural except maybe a burning crate with a nazi symbol on it. George should redo that last scene in my opinion, and tighten it up, because I really think it wasn't coming together, however when I was a child it was so amazing and scary realistic. It's all perspective, but my point it that now in this modern filming era, the acting and film production is holding tight to this day.I forward you to just enjoy this film and look for things like formulas on chalkboards, skeletons in classrooms, proper patches on Nazi gear, gun accuracy. Research the film's era and background, and it only gets better. That's the ability that Spielberg and Lucas have, attention to detail and clever twists on most of their bodies of work.Watch this film again, it's worth it, I promise you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Instead, this is much more an action film with too much tedious moments, too much action, too much characters and many annoying ones, too much military patrols and many violence.The soundtrack is cool but there is much better, none of the actors amaze and the story itself isn't all that appealing.

"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark became an instant classic and have remained a masterpiece ever since, it's both a joyride and an achievement in cinema","This is a film I grew up with, loved it since my father showed it to me for the first time. Indiana Jones and Star Wars was two of the things I absolutely loved, both are stories of visionary George Lucas. Steven Spielberg directed it and his vision for George Lucas' story and the screenplay written by Lawrence Kasdan, together, they created something truly memorable and remarkable. The Raiders of the Lost Ark is an achievement in the history of cinema. Having grown up with these films, I've seen them numerous of times, except for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which is the film I've watched least time and more on that later. It was the first entry in what became the Indiana Jones franchise, which includes four more films; Temple of Doom (1984), Last Crusade (1989), Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and Dial of Destiny (2023). This review is solely about Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film has a cast of great characters and performances, actors like: Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Paul Freeman as René Belloq, Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody.In 1936, archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the U. S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can obtain its awesome powers.Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is like I wrote before, an achievement in cinema, for many reasons. It's mostly remembered and rightfully so because of Steven Spielberg, one of the best directors in the history of film. There's also the musical score by John Williams, it's one of those soundtracks that have gone down as one of the most memorable film music. But of course the lead, Harrison Ford who shows no one else could play the role of Indiana Jones. Ford performed as many of his stunts as was allowed throughout the film, suffering various injuries, he even did the iconic boulder scene ten times which is said to have been dangerous. Harrison Ford shines in every scene, dramatic like comedic but truly shining in the action sequences as he does the majority of stunts himself. There are a lot of good performances in this film, Karen Allen and Paul Freeman are two others. You see, at an older age I actually found René Belloq to be one of the better characters in the film and why's that? He's three dimensional on paper, but needed more screen time to become great, yet here we have an antagonist not evil like Major Arnold Toht who is one-dimensional. Jones and Belloq are on the same level of intellect and the skill of archeology.From the introduction of Indiana Jones in the very first scene to the Peruvian temple sequence and everything else you'll get to see and experience in this fine film. There are multiple locations you get to see in this film, starting with Peru and then Nepal, finally Egypt where the second half takes place. What's so interesting with this film is how it goes from being rated PG to PG-13 and R, but makes it work. I think the well written comedy is a huge part of why that works so well. The comedy is great and most importantly, the actors comedic timing is golden. There are also some more brutal scenes in the film, often the comedy makes it less brutal and this is one of few films which succeeds in that. There's not a single joke which falls flat, one of my favorite ones is said by Marion ""You can't do this to me, I'm an American."", it cracked me up and honestly the comedic writing is ten out of ten, so is the writing. The screenplay and story are brilliantly written. Cinematography is truly spectacular in every way, each shot is shot carefully and with perfection. What else is perfect? The pacing in my opinion, this film is an adventure you just can't get enough of, two hours which just flies away. Non-stop action, the engaging and interesting adventure, but also the performances and characters. There's so much to enjoy, so much which was worked on until it was perfect. Take the sets for an example, they are real and they used practical effects immensely with the boulder for an example. Regarding the sets, for example the Peruvian temple interiors were life-sized. The sets were brilliant, so were the special effects, something worth talking about is the backgrounds and the use of matte paintings. About the realism, in the scene at the Well of Souls, they used hundreds of real snakes, and it became one of the iconic scenes. This film is truly not one for people with phobias for snakes or spiders.I wish I could have seen it at the cinema on June 12, 1981. Steven Spielberg, a director who never made sequels, made sequels for this film. Indiana Jones would never have been made if not for George Lucas with the idea and his good friend Steven Spielberg in the chair, it's nice to see great friends work together to create a masterpiece like this. This is a masterpiece in my eyes, for the critics, it's considered one of the greatest films ever made. Raiders of the Lost Ark became the highest-grossing film of 1981, earning approximately $330.5 million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. Thus a very special film, a film which was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by The United States Library of Congress. Raiders of the Lost Ark received five Oscars; Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and received four other nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Original Score. In my opinion, it was a strong contender for those awards as well, especially the director and cinematography ones along with the original score. It also won seven Saturn Awards and one BAFTA, along with other awards. Let me finish my review with a quote from Roger Ebert; ""A series of 'breathless and incredible' adventures inspired by and celebrating childhood stories told in comic books and movies. He concluded the film was successful in its singular goal of entertaining, creating an adventure epic in the vein of Star Wars, the James Bond films, and Superman."" And that it did, creating a franchise and something people now as then finds entertainment in. As part of his The Great Movies series, Ebert said while the special effects had not aged well, they were perfect for this type of film. He concluded it was a ""whiz-bang slamarama"" made with ""heedless joy"". Critics called this an instant classic, it remains a classic but also a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
STILL THE MASTERPIECE!!!,"What are all those freakin' bulls**t reviews with 7 stars and less?
Especially 1 or 2 stars? Persons who recommend garbage movies like The Mummy or Tomb Raider instead of this instant classic!
I consider them NOT to be cineasts and not to have any clue of filmmaking.Why is INDIANA JONES a classic character? Well, you see it in the first minutes of this one. It is simply one of the best and coolest introductions of a main character.
And hands down, Harrison Ford is so much better than all other ""Adventurers"", because he is charismatic, charming, cool and smart.RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK still is an cinematic experience. Not this rubbish modern CGI, shaky cam garbage, causing headache to normal thinking people.RAIDERS has a very good cast, with Karen Allen, Paul Freeman (especially him), Ronald Lacey, John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott.
One of John Williams' best scores! A soundtrack lke this one (or the Bond movies in the 60s, 70s and 80s, Rocky, Star Wars etc.), you won't find anymore.
These were the times were a soundtrack had tunes to remember and not just loud, dumb and monotone sounds.
Legendary composers like John Williams, Ennio Morricone, John Barry, Bernard Herrmann or Jerry Goldsmith.
The cinematography, by another legend Douglas Slocombe, is just fantastic. Real sets, real locations, suspense and humour...and not humour of the silly sort like half of the MCU or The Mummy, because Indiana Jones is a serious character with a lot of irony, but he knows his situations and doesn't dance in front of the baddies in a very serious and dangerous situation (just fpr some lame, silly laughs).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An adventure of plain fun.,"A rip-roaring adventure with lots of hand-to-hand battles and plenty of guns means only one thing: entertainment for the whole family! There's not too much blood and gore, but it's still way up there in the body count department. Much of the thrill of this beloved movie is in the fright factor, so cadavers, snakes, spiders, and nasty villains (mostly Nazis and Nazi sympathizers) also abound. Throughout the film, there is a parade of anti-Nazi symbolism and sly religious satire. Harrison Ford is the embodiment of Indiana Jones -- dry, fearless, and as indestructible as a cartoon coyote. The female lead in an Indiana Jones movie is sort of an honorary boy, no more sexual than the girls in boys' adventure magazines, although Marian can more than take care of herself and is not helpless in the face of danger. The special effects, astonishing at the time, are still amazing, and Lucas' experience of ""Star Wars"" is visible. The movie is just plain fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My Favorite Movie of All Time,"I have been enthralled with the art of film since I was a little boy. There are plenty of movies that first got me hooked to the art form, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is the film that first conjured my fascination for cinema. For that, how could I not call this my favorite movie of all time? It has drastically changed my life.However, my endless love for this movie is not just due to nostalgia and personal importance (even though personal importance is obviously an important factor when considering your subjective favorite film). At the end of the day, it is truly no mystery why Raiders has sparked the love for cinema in the hearts of so many. It is a perfect film.Everything about Raiders is TIMELESS: William's iconic score, the exciting action, the all-time great characters, the performances, the clever dialogue, the enthralling romance, the creative writing, its originality, its innovation, its wit, Spielberg's masterful direction. I could write a full essay analyzing why each one of these things I've listed is phenomenal. Raiders is such a versatile, overachieving, and genre-bending film. It really has something for everyone. Heck, it even finds a way to throw some unforgettable moments of horror into the mix too.I'll take a moment to talk about the cast. Harrison Ford was born to play this role. Sure, he's great in Star Wars, Witness, Air Force One, The Fugitive, etc etc. However, it is Ford's performance in this film that elevates Indiana Jones from an already great character on paper to the greatest character in cinematic history. If not the greatest, than at least the most memorable and iconic.Other key performances include Karen Allen with one of action cinema's best love interests, Marion Craine, and Paul Freeman who plays the unforgettable antagonist of Rene Belloq. The latter I find to be a very understated performance, as Belloq is one of my all-time favorite antagonists.The masterminds behind the story and script of course deserve countless rounds of applause too. Lawrence Kasdan did an absolutely stunning job writing out the already genius story crafted by George Lucas and Phillip Kaufman.Most importantly, let's talk about Steven Spielberg's directing. It is arguably the best directed movie of all time. Every scene is gushing with Spielberg's distinct directorial style, innovation, and creativity. Most of all, it sticks out to me how organic Spielberg made such an out-there plot feel.In conclusion, I seriously can't find a single flaw within Raiders of the Lost Ark which is perhaps the only movie in which I can give that testament (When I say ""flaws"", I mean real flaws that negatively affect the experience of the movie. Just putting that out there before someone points out something like how the map in the background lists countries by their modern names instead of what their name was in 1937).In conclusion, Raiders of the Lost Ark will likely always be favorite movie. I've rewatched it hundreds of times, and yet, I have an absolute blast every single time I watch it. I expect to have a blast every time I watch it for the rest of my life.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"The plot is old-fashioned, but the action is fascinating, especially the effect of IMAX Experience.

Finally A Hero Without Super-Powers,"*Favourite ""Indiana Jones"" quote* - ""I hate snakes!""For having just a PG-13 rating - I was completely taken by surprise by all of the violence, gore and bloodshed that prevailed in this top-notch Action/Adventure film from 1981.Featuring a first-rate, adrenaline-rush, opening sequence - ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" certainly delivered plenty of awesome, over-the-top stunts, as well as some good touches of cynical humour (thrown in for good measure) that kept all of the action moving along at near break-neck speed, throughout.My 2 favourite characters in this fast-paced action picture were - (1) Dr. Rene Belloq, the utterly ruthless villain, and Nazi-collaborator, played so wickedly nasty by actor Paul Freeman - And, of course - (2) Indiana Jones, our archaeologist-hero (sans super-powers), played very tongue-in-cheek by Harrison Ford.My biggest complaint here has to do with the unwelcome introduction of the Marion Ravenwood character into the story. To me, her presence in the action only served to interfere and undermine Indiana Jones's heroic quest to uncover the legendary ""Ark of the Covenant"" before the evil Nazis did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best action films of all time,"This movie still holds up decades after its release. Lucas and Spielberg are two heavyweights and they may have created an almost perfect action film with Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film has a charismatic lead, an interwoven love story, humor, exotic settings, and of course action and adventure. A few of the special effects do look really bad, like Alfred Molina's character's corpse. But overall for an early 1980s film, they are fine, and the stunts are solid. There is something intriguing about Indy pursuing mythical artifacts that have the power to change the course of history if taken into the wrong hands.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Perfect Film,"In the 80s there were a handful of action movies that were so well put together it makes you wonder if that decade was better than now or is nostalgia influencing my judgment.

The story is so magnetic, you have no other option but to be involved.And can we talk about Karen Allen?! Oh Karen, what a lovely actress!

Classic Spielberg and Lucas at their finest,"I first saw this at my Uncle's house during a party where they put on movies to entertain us kids. I was probably a bit too young to watch the last scene but I still loved it back then.I still love it today, I rewatch this one every couple of years, it is timeless as it is an 80's movie set in the 30s so it looks like it could have been made today outside some of the special effects.I think this is as close to perfect as an adventure movie can get. The acting is balanced between serious, corny and sweet. The pacing is perfect and the plot is fantastical.

They got it right the first time,"OK this review is more an essay about what Raiders is NOT, rather than a review of what it is.It is NOT ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"". That was a clumsy attempt to force this movie into the later series' branding structure - something invented decades after Raiders was created. It is and always will be ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Thankfully the tinkering has been limited to the title, and the film itself avoided the kind of disastrous meddling that Lucas inflicted on the original Star Wars trilogy.Raiders is not the sequels. Those are smudged by the fingerprints of studio execs and money counters. But Raiders feels like a passion project by two baby boomer film buffs with little interference (or interest) from a studio. And like an independent film, Raiders was not a huge hit initially in theaters, much to Paramount's dismay. But after the film found larger success with home viewing, naturally Paramount's corporate owners saw the opportunity to profit from sequels that could draw in the widest audience possible. For studio execs, that meant making subsequent entries ""kid friendly"" or, in reality, a dulling down of Indiana Jones.Raiders is not a ""kids' movie"". Lucas and Spielberg created Raiders as a love letter to the cinematic tough guy antiheroes that adults would remember. But the two couldn't help but be influenced by the gritty realism movement in 1970s cinema. Indy is tough and stoic, rough around the edges, but capable of making mistakes and getting hurt. He's charming and also a jerk. When in real danger, he shoots to kill. To their credit, Lucas and Spielberg didn't under estimate the intelligence or resilience of the audience, including kids.Raiders is not just an action movie. Unlike in countless movies that it inspired, the characters and story come first. In the 21st century, action or adventure movies are built around spectacle. Audiences experience movies as an assault on the senses. The level of spectacle and eye candy in Raiders feels refreshing, even quaint.Raiders is not magic. Indy's world is heightened and stylized, certainly. A supernatural presence appears for a reason and within the logical boundaries established in this world. When its purpose is fulfilled, the other-worldly tone retreats conclusively. Elements of the beyond are not pushed to the point of complete absurdity or insult the intelligence of the audience.Great flick. Ten out of ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The spirit of adventure pervades this film from start to finish.,"The spirit of adventure pervades this film from start to finish. Historically, adventure is almost always intertwined with travel as well as exploration. Therefore, Mr. Jones is an archaeologist. And in order to immediately dot the ""i"", it should be noted that the ""Hunters"" are very far from the reliability. Archaeologists will surely notice many simulated nuances when events take place in ancient buildings, and historians will definitely see objects in the frame that did not actually exist in 1936. But this is a movie about adventure, not historical events.In my opinion, to some extent, this film can literally be called the perfect adventure film. It has all the necessary components: a fascinating story, a bewitching atmosphere, a disturbing horror-mystery with fantasy elements, romance, action and a perfect ending in which the good win and the evil brutally get what they deserve.

Good entertainment,"If you don't nitpick too much, there's lots to like about this rollicking tale of the WWII era quest by an American archaeologist cum adventurer, Indiana Jones, to find a biblical treasure, the Ark of the Covenant, before the Nazis do. It's meant to be cartoonish in style, so just drink in the beautiful settings (Tunisia, Egypt, Nepal, South America), the excellent John Williams score, and the script and direction that, at times, can be witty and inventive. Harrison Ford was born to play the role of Indiana Jones, and he's actually intelligent - well done for casting him ahead of some dumb hunk who would not have been so believable as a brainy archaeologist. Ford is excellent at playing the guy who can get himself out of any hairy situation, although most of the time, e.g. in the Amazon rainforest, it's just not believable that he would not be slaughtered immediately by that indigenous army who know that forest back to front. In addition, the indigenous men are improbably inaccurate archers in running after Ford. Karen Allen, as Ford's old girlfriend Marion, is one of the best things about the movie. The producers are ground-breaking, or maybe it's the first time since those feisty heroines of the 1940s, in depicting a lead woman as clothed, intelligent, physically strong and actually saving Indiana many times. She's fantastic. The scene of her out-drinking a local woman in Nepal is priceless. She deserved her own movie. The bad guys are the most cliched characters in this movie. They may as well have a sign on their head - ""I'm evil."" But as I said, it's meant to be a rollicking adventure, and not a serious drama that you'd criticise too heavily as not being realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Prime Adventure Even If It Goes A Bit Far,"The main intent of Raiders of the Lost Ark is to be a fun adventurous ride and you have to give it that. The film kicks of the action right from the beginning and goes from one to another over the course of the film slowing down only for a moment and keeping exposition to a minimum. However, while the film keeps it all under two hours it does feel a bit much. From the number of set-piece to the size of each. Each one builds from one thing to the next getting more extravagant as it continues into a bit of mumbo-jumbo. This was the start of extensive and wild action scenes in both Spielberg's career and all of cinema. While the movie is undoubtedly a classic, its influence (which is on almost every action movie made after it) has been more negative. Raiders of the Lost Ark tried to make movies funner but it also made them dumber.Pretty much all the other characters in it are cartoonish but Harrison Ford is, of course, great as the movies biggest appeal: Indiana Jones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Such an amazing adventure movie...,"Being a kid back in the day when the 1981 movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was originally released and growing up watching the Indiana Jones movies, I have to say that this movie from director Steven Spielberg is a classic. It is a movie that has as much appeal today as it did back when it was just released.The storyline in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one that embodies adventure and a hero character that you just can't help but like, admire and want to be. Such is the phenomena that is Indiana Jones, a true pop culture phenomena in every aspect. And that is what makes these movies so very enjoyable. Writers Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman put together a script and storyline that not only is amazingly entertaining and enjoyable, but also highly memorable. It is an adventure with a wide appeal to every age group and member in the audience, both young and old alike.The acting in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is good, and they definitely had a great cast ensemble for the movie. Of course Harrison Ford has managed to become an epitome of Indiana Jones and no one can fill the shoes that he has left for this character and the franchise. Harrison Ford simply is Indiana Jones. But also with the likes of Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davies, Ronald Lacey, Denholm Elliott, Alfred Molina and Wolf Kahler on the cast list, then you are in very capable hands throughout the course of the 115 minutes that the movie runs for.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has a great character gallery, with very memorable characters, both good and evil. And that is a great testimony to the writing skills of Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.There is a good amount of action and thrills throughout the course of the 115 minute that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" runs for, and the audience is taken along on a rather enjoyable and entertaining thrill ride with director Steven Spielberg at the helm.Visually then the effects in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" are good. Sure, some of them do come off as a bit antequated when you watch the movie today, but generally it has withstood the passing of time quite admirably.If you enjoy adeventure movies, and not already familiar with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", then it is definitely a movie you have to track down and watch.My rating of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lands on a ten out of ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Haters of the Lost Ark,"I guess you can say I am a hater of this movie, even though I don't think it's that bad. It's just not that good either. Don't get me wrong, the music and Indiana character are both iconic. Everyone knows the theme and recognizes the hero with the hat and whip. I think that's why this movie gets so much hype. It's so iconic and nostalgic that people overlook everything else.The story is pretty mindless. It's a race to see who can find the ark first. Indy always gets outsmarted by the other guys but manages to escape again and again. There's no real dialog that has any depth to it and as great as the soundtrack is, it is also distracting. The ending is kind of lackluster. I mean, the face melting is cool, but afterwards it just ends with no real resolution.In my opinion, it's just an ok action/adventure movie that happens to have a really charismatic and iconic hero. I'm not even a fan and I was Indiana Jones for Halloween one year. But if you want a great adventure movie, there are others that beat this by a mile. In my opinion, the Goonies is a 10x better adventure movie. The characters have emotions and a reason to fight, the bad guys are funny but not in a cheesy way, the soundtrack is incredible but not intruding, and the ending has a true resolution that leaves you smiling. To me, that's a 10/10, which is why this is a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Action, action and more action.","A film that gave us a story packed full of action, amazing stunt work, a really imaginative production design, a fantastic score and lastly one of the greatest heroes in cinema, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist/adventurer. The film released in 1981 took inspiration from the swashbuckling 1940s/1950s era of Hollywood, in that respect the premise is simple, our hero must find the treasure, rescue the girl and save the world. The film was largely shot on location in North Africa and this adds a touch of grit and realism which really benefits the film, you see the little flies landing on the actors faces during a few close ups and see the sweat rolling off their brows. The film largely takes place in one location Egypt, with the very early part set in South and North America.The Blu Ray transfer looks really great, with lots of rich earthy colours, reds, browns, sandy yellows, greys & dark leathery brown, these tend to make up most of the costume design. The supporting cast are also very well written and good fun too, from the heroes to the villains. The tone of the film is adventurous and the pacing certainly gives the whole thing a massive injection of energy. There's a slight theme of magic v rationality, as the initially skeptical Indiana Jones is confronted with the dangerous reality of the power held within the lost ark he is seeking.There is not much in the way of character development, though the relationship between Dr Jones and the feisty and rather attractive Marion Ravenwood changes over the course of the film. The movies hail from the decade that was the 1980s and so we're given a slightly stronger female love interest than audiences were used to in the 1960s and 1970s, Marion's character shares similarities with Princess Leia in the Empire Strikes Back or Charlie Blackwood in Topgun, beautiful and alluring but also a tough-minded woman who takes no nonsense and will stand up for herself. You could certainly get away with more too in the 1980s cinema than you can today, the film features quite a lot of violence, blood and swearing for something that children were allowed to watch, I doubt a PG film today could get away with anything like this.The film's logic is not intended to be taken as 100% realistic, a main character in a realistic action film would probably die after the first 10 minutes. For this reason it's possible to overlook the numerous injuries Jones picks up which would put most people into hospital. The fact the German's had no presence in Egypt is also something you have to overlook in the film, the British in fact were in control of Egypt in 1936, it would have made more sense if the Fascists were working from Libya, but then Libya doesn't feel as Biblical as Egypt does, so I suppose the location was switched. You'd have to be pretty picky though to let things like this stop you from enjoying the film, the whole thing is about a search for a magic chest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Those were the best bits. Because then you have the totally random ending that turns your laughter into a WTF expression.The characters are paper-thin - not to mention Spielberg's obsession with the Germans (or anyone non-American or non-Jewish) who have to be depicted as either superevil or superstupid.Unintentionally funny, totally predictable and a waste of money and film.

Absolute GOLD,"Holy friggin' toss buckets, I haven't seen this since I was...12 maybe, and yet it's still every bit as good as I remember. Like, I was starting to wonder if maybe I was wrong when I said that Spielberg does in fact, deserve his status as one of the greats after I only thought that Jaws was good and not great, but oh my god yes, yes, yes he does.I think this might actually be one of those rare flawless films, and you know I don't say that lightly if you've read my reviews for my 10/10 films, so let me lay it all out...Harrison Ford certainly does not have many roles that many people would claim are better, or even equal to, Han Solo, but goddamn I think Indy might just be better. And he's so funny, so likable, so badass, yet feels so...human. He never feels indestructible, or like he doesn't ever cock up, and more action films need to bloody remember that. And holy god does 1981 Harrison Ford have this bisexual positively reeling...no I refuse to not mention that.Karen Allen as well...why the hell does she not have more of a career? Why is she hardly in anything else that anyone would know her from? She's feisty, she takes no crud from anyone, and yes, maybe she also has me reeling. Leave me alone.Paul Freeman played one of the best and most sickeningly charming villains of all time in Belloq, and even having just rewatched Lord Of The Rings recently, yes, Sallah is a better role from John Rhys-Davies than Gimli. Basically what I'm saying is that every single one of the characters is perfect, their dialogue is perfect, and every single one of the actors playing them is perfect also.The story is kind of simple, yes, but does it need to do anything more than what it does? Hell no, this might be one of the best scripts ever written for how much it is consistently squeezing every last drop of adventure, tension, and excitement out of the narrative, and this is Spielberg at the absolute top of his game. It might well have one of the best scripts ever written, but if Spielberg wasn't in the director's chair on this (or if Douglas Slocombe wasn't DP), then it might not even be remembered nowadays.And while it is a tight, tight, TIGHT competition for the crown, this might just have John Williams' best work in it too. The score is breathtaking, and really, just the sound in general of this film is amazing. No film has ever had a gunshot or punching sound effect quite like this one.And really, if I'm even taking time to praise the gunshot and punching sound effects, that should just tell you everything you need to know about how perfect I consider this film to be.Why the hell haven't I watched this since my early teens, I'm a damn idiot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An Unmatchable Adventure Classic,"Staring Harrison Ford, directed by Steven Spielberg, and produced by George Lucas, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" brought together three legends of 1980s Hollywood for a truly magical piece of cinema. An adventure film in the purest form, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is like ""Star Wars"" in the sense that it took an outmoded, B-movie genre and brought it back with unprecedented scale and dignity.Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones, an archeologist in 1936 tasked with finding the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. The Ark - a hollowed chest from the Bible, claimed to hold the original Stone Tablets of the Ten Commandments - carries an awesome power that, if fallen into the wrong hands, could be catastrophic.Jones' quest sends him on a worldly journey. The film begins in a Peruvian jungle, then after brief stint in the United States, travels to Nepal, Egypt, and the ocean before climaxing on a small island in the Aegean Sea. Not all scenes were filmed on-location, but the settings are convincing enough. Practical effects and miniatures also make ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" a relic of the 1980s American blockbuster.It is also an accessible film for people of all ages and interests. Not a science fiction or fantasy piece, it does not cater to an esoteric fan base. History buffs will enjoy the film for its archeological themes, but it is not made for academics alone. Regular moviegoers seeking action-packed thrills will find it just as satisfying.Furthermore, the story is smart, but simple enough for kids to enjoy just as much as adults. The good guys and the bad guys are clear, as are the simple messages of justice and heroism. This is thanks to Harrison Ford's spot-on embodiment of Jones, as well as that special Spielberg touch. The director evokes something of a John Ford Western in this movie, but cuts out anything archaic while adding in a dash of James Bond excitement. There are chases and shootouts, along with romance and humor, and an iconic John Williams score to tie it all together. Not a single frame passes as dull.The movie is not just easy to enjoy, but it is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying it. Many movies have tried to capture the spirit of Indiana Jones over the years, but barring the sequels to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" few have hit the mark. It's sense of adventure feels familiar and easy to emulate, but somehow, it remains one-of-a-kind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""I'm making this up as I go""","I believe that there is no need to give a summary of the most legendary adventure film ever made. When you think of Harrison Ford, you think of Indiana Jones. And don't lie you think of ""Star Wars"". It may be a bigger and more popular franchise, but I bet Indiana is everyone's first association. A charismatic professor of archaeology who swings his whip in remote places of the third world, overcomes all obstacles with ease of a comic-book hero, a charmer who seduces women and audiences and who has marked childhood for many generations. Technically excellent, visually impressive (except for the quite silly special effects towards the end), atmospheric, with perfectly balanced elements of adventure, action, humor, and romance. It may not be a masterpiece of cinematography, but with its spirit and influence on the genre as well as on generations of viewers, it certainly deserves cult status.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Old fashioned,"When I was a kid,I remember watching Indiana Jones again and again never getting bored... It has everything, great characters, story happens in many places around the world, it has the awful nazies... It was such a wonderful movies, but 25 years later i must admit that adventure movies have changed a lot and in a good way... The actors, the sets are less fake, in Idiana Jones the set looks like plastic, the actress is always screaming and drinking trying to show that she has some part in the story but doing nothing in particular... at least in our days girls have a real role, here in Indiana Jones she is less intelligent, less strong, she's immature... Awful ! No It was a good movie and sure it has a place in the story of cinema but I really doubt that new generation will watch it in the future as a godfather which will definitely still be watched in 50 years... note 6/10 for the nostalgie",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The one that started it all,"Raiders of the Lost Ark stars Harrison Ford and is directed by Steven Spielberg. Raiders of the Lost Ark follows Indiana Jones as he races against the Nazis to obtain the Lost ark of the covenant. Fresh off of completing Star Wars George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came up with this idea as they were on vacation. And instead of forgetting about it the next day or creating a ""movie of the week"" that nobody would care about, they actually decided to let their imaginations run wild. Now I'm sure that before they created Raiders of the Lost Ark they saw a lot of movies involving treasure hunting and decided to give it a makeover. And from their they decided to turn something that sounds like it came out of a B movie and transformed it into an A++ movie after the project was finished. But Raiders of the Lost Ark is The Godfather of treasure hunting movies and all the treasure hunting movies are good, but they don't have that passion and majestic as Raiders of the Lost Ark offers. I should also add that it's also the inspiration for many movies and video games over the years and has been referenced in many pop cultures. You can not turn on the T.V. And having someone reference Indiana Jones or the scenes that gave birth to countless of directors and writers imitating those scenes. This movie and Star Wars were the first movies to open my eyes to many movies to come. And there are many movies out there that brilliantly fantastic, but Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were the first to do that. Besides Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and John Williams, I don't know if the other crew who were in Star Wars also were involved in making this. I would like to think so as they borrow elements from Star Wars such as music, special effects, costumes, to just about anything you can think of and then it into something simple and easy without anything being over dramatic. I also applaud Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for having the ability to create one movie that blew people's minds and creating another movie with an iconic character for many years that people wish they could be. Because in the end who doesn't want to be Indiana Jones? So in the end every thing about this move is pure cinematic perfection that is worth exploring again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Overrated,"Raiders Of The Lost Ark is widely regarded as the quintessence of the adventure-action movie. However, there is so much to say about it is hard to understand how it can be such highly considered.Everything isn't bad. There are, in particular, very good actions scenes such as the opening scene or the one in the temple with the snakes, and some well thought-out touches of humour. But we are under the impression that the plot is secondary, in fact you forget about it after some time, and that it is just a pretext for blowing us away with those action scenes, like blockbusters do nowadays.The flaws are obvious, from the shallow characters to the choppy rhythm or the mediocre editing with a lot of jump cuts or continuity errors. A few extremely far-fetched scenes also discredit the movie.Raiders Of The Lost Ark is therefore far from perfect and certainly cannot pretend to the rank of masterpiece some give it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A classic for all time,"What can I possibly add to what has already been written? This film is a ""masterpiece"". It's placed in quotations because that word is bandied about on here for films that aren't fit to lace this movies' boots. This movie should be preserved for all eternity as a template on how to make an incredibly entertaining and wonderful film, and as I said earlier, there isn't much I can add to what has already been said about Raiders. Let's just say that there are only so many films I plan on introducing to my children when they get old enough and this film is amongst that list.
Harrison Ford was amazing in the titular role, and the supporting cast added immense scale and brevity to the work HF was doing as Indy.

I think that--is a formula to success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
First and still the best (spoilers),"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action masterpiece. There's not one bit of fat on its bones. There's not one wasted moment. It flows exactly like an adventure movie should  it continually moves forward, breathlessly driving you towards the conclusion; it's incredible fun.The reason why the film works so well is because the script is so tight. The exposition is clear and well delivered, meaning that you know precisely what's at stake, small character details are set up early on and paid off later and the dialogue is incredibly pithy. It's a masterclass in film writing.However, this would mean nothing if all the other elements didn't come together. Thankfully they do. Spielberg's direction is superb, Harrison Ford is perfect as the hero, Karen Allen is wonderful as the heroine and the music is out of this world. Plus the action is kick ass.My favourite action scene is the fight with Pat Roach by the plane. Quite unusually for a film hero, Indy doesn't mind fighting dirty. He kicks Roach in the balls, he throws sand in his face and he even bites him. Indy doesn't have to win a fight fairly. And it's also unusual for a film hero to be so vulnerable. We rarely see anyone get a scratch or put in any real jeopardy. But here Indy gets his arse handed to him. The only reason he survives is because he's so wily  after getting beaten and bruised for a while he leads Roach into getting chopped up by the plane's rotor blades.My second favourite action sequence is when Indy chases after the Ark and recovers it by hijacking a Nazi truck. After the CGI mess of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it's great to see old-fashioned stunts. It's a much better way of letting you get absorbed by the action  even though you know it's a film, you know someone actually had to do this, making everything much more impressive to watch. The best stunt is when Indy is thrown through the front window and has to pull himself along the bottom of the truck. He manages to do this and then hooks his whip under the bottom so that he's dragged along the ground. He then manages to get back on the truck and back in the cabin. It's a joy to behold and allows you to immerse yourself in the action.Another great thing about the sequence is that once again we're shown Indy's vulnerability. As he's driving he gets shot in the arm. And then later a guy punches him in his injured arm and throws him out of the truck. Therefore when Indy comes back and beats the crap out of this guy, it's doubly satisfying, because not only is the guy a damn Nazi, but he also had the audacity to try and injure our hero. And the blood and guts reminds me of how gritty the film is. Not only do we have Indy getting shot in the arm and then having the wound beaten, but earlier on a guy gets shot in the face  lots of blood pours down from the hole in his skull. Oh, and he's also on fire. Excellent.But as well as this there's also stuff that is just plain over the top. The melting faces for instance and Belloq's head exploding. This scared the hell out of me as a kid and I'm still amazed that stuff like this was included in a 'kids' film.However, the scene that terrified me the most as a kid was the scene where Marion gets mugged by skeletons and we then see a large snake oozing from a skull's mouth. I was so traumatised I refused to watch the film for years. But now the vague horror element is another reason I adore the movie. It sets it apart from almost every action/adventure film that came before it and nothing else has managed to better it, even subsequent Indiana Jones films.But watching the film now it's quite unusual to note that Indy doesn't kill any of the three main villains. They're all killed by the Ark. Indy instead just closes his eyes and lets 'god' do the rest. It's a strange ending but one that works perfectly. Indy isn't a killing machine. He's someone trying to do the right thing. And at the end he's rewarded by, well, not having his face melted off.Another reason why Raiders stands out is because of its heroine. She's one of the best in modern cinema  a tough woman who constantly shows her toughness without having to resort to ridiculous feats of physicality. We don't see her pummel men who are twice her size, but we do see her out smart them and drink them under the table. As well as this she has great chemistry with Indy. For instance, there's the marvellous scene where she tries to look after our injured hero and he cries like a girl every time she touches him. He then points out a few places where it doesn't hurt, which she kisses. It's a lovely scene. And I also like the bit of slapstick humour earlier where Indy gets a mirror smashed in his face when Marion turns it over.This leads me to another reason why Raiders is brilliant. It's very funny. You have a monkey giving a Nazi salute, Indy nonchalantly shooting a swordsman, Sallah's cowardly reactions at the Well of Souls and the Gestapo man plunging his hand in the snow after he gets it burnt while trying to grab an extremely hot bronze medallion. The humour is great.And on top of all of this cinematic goodness  the humour, the action, the adventure  you have one of the best opening sequences in film. It's a bravura piece of film-making  everything clicks perfectly.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Still good!,"The Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years. In fact, to sum it all up: hundreds of years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied, which means a lot. You don't get the same kind of jolt of adventure. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here.This movie can wear you out, which is almost a negative. The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star. It didn't do much for the rest of the cast but it sure boosted Ford's stock.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Timeless adventure classic,"There are no set qualities for a great film. Some movies like Citizen Kane are towering Cathedrals, crowned with outstanding lead performances, their every shot awash with gravitas and innovation, two hour pieces of high art with relatively simple stories. Other films are great stories, superbly told, like The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Slumdog Milllionaire. And then there are films like this one which are a joyous, fun celebration of all the things we love about movies and film making.Every scene of this is fun and enjoyable. A rollicking chase between two rival archaeologists as they travel all over the world (the film using world maps so we can keep track of the action) in search of the mystical ""ark of the covenant."" Throw in some Nazis, snake phobia, cutting edge (for the time) special effects, a damsel in distress and the Saturday matinée feel and you have an adventure film like no other to that point in time.For star Harrison Ford, this film, on the back of his turn as Han Solo in an expanded role in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back confirmed his status as the pre eminent leading man of his time, and from the start, this is his movie. We follow his adventures for an inordinate number of minutes before the director shows us his face, we see him fearlessly tackle big hairy spiders, leaps of doom, deadly arrows and rolling stone balls before the film is 15 minutes old. We also see him lose his first big battle on screen with his rival Belloq. And in those first 15 minutes we learn everything we need to about his character and the film. Indy is fearless, principled, a bit of a screw up and not a particularly good archaeologist. No wonder he has to work as a teacher to pay the bills. From that point on he becomes all things to all people. The film rarely lets up on the action, with chase after chase, and usually ending in Indy being outwitted by his smarter, better resourced rival.Ford is absolutely superb. While I personally believe that the film still would have been a success had Spielberg's original choice for the role, Tom Selleck, been available, it is now impossible to see anyone else in the role. Spielberg has also surrounded Ford with a great supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, John Rhys Davies, Paul Freeman, Karen Allen and Ronald Lacey, as well as a very young Alfred Molina. Allen in particular is great as the love interest/ damsel in distress.The effects, for the time were breathtaking, bringing the settings alive and nearly making us believe that the Nazis faces are melting at the film's end. Some of the blue screen shots leave a little to be desired, but it was still fairly early in the evolution of that film making technology, and so these are forgivable. The set pieces are expertly realized and the fight scenes well choreographed.In the end Raiders is the finest example of the adventure genre, made the more entertaining for the fact that our protagonist is not a particularly successful adventurer. It has enough silly to be fun, without being stupid and remains, more than 30 years on, as one of the most entertaining films not just of its era, but in all of American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

George Lucas's story is a true gem, while John Williams' iconic score adds another layer of magic to the entire experience. The film has a heightened afternoon-matinee feel, with its ridiculously over-the-top sound effects that make guns sound like cannons and punches like body slams.Steven Spielberg's direction is masterful, and his control over every aspect of the film is evident. Right from the opening scene, he effortlessly establishes the characters and tone, immediately immersing the viewers in this thrilling world. Harrison Ford shines as the iconic Indiana Jones, and it's his portrayal that truly makes the film work. Indy is a complex character who exhibits courage, fear, toughness, tenderness, brutality, and humor, all of which Ford captures flawlessly.The fight and action scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark are nothing short of spectacular. Each one is smartly staged and offers something different, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. It's hard not to get caught up in the excitement and adventure as Indy races against time to uncover the mysteries and protect ancient artifacts.The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is palpable, with Allen serving as the perfect foil for Ford's Indy.

Greatest Adventure Film,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest adventure films ever. It combines prime entertainment with purposeful substance. Clearly, Indiana Jones is a movie character icon, but the plot is equally significant to the film's success. The search for the Ark has mystery, excitement, romance, action, and thematic weight. Furthermore, Jones evolves from a practical cynic into a believer in powers beyond his understanding. The bittersweet ending underscores this by denying Jones' desires but providing an emotional need instead. Plus, Ford is the perfect embodiment of Jones' larger than life persona. Ford is Indiana Jones, and Jones is Harrison Ford.Meanwhile, Raiders is driven by its filmmaking. The cinematography uses dramatic composition, lighting, and movement to intensify adventure and meaning. The editing is energetic during action and efficient during exposition. The exaggerated sound heightens combat and supernatural elements. The legendary music and production design are critical to Indiana's iconic pop culture status. Also, the effects are complex and tangible, making the film a genuine thrill ride. Lastly, the direction unites these ingredients into an irresistible journey that's truly lightning in a bottle. Ultimately, the universal love for Raiders of the Lost Ark is undeniably justified.Writing: 9/10

"A timeless adventure, early Spielberg, set in 1936.","Although my review is dated June 2000, when I originally posted my comments, what I am writing now (January 2023) are entirely new comments, having just watched this movie for the 438th time. Well, I exaggerate a bit!Now I like to look at the movie two ways. First, the core story. We have a mild-mannered 30-something Dr. Jones, professor of Archaeology who as a side job searches for Antiquities. His arch-rival Belloq yet again steals a valuable item that Jones has just discovered, but back home is approached about a new challenge, The Ark of the Covenant which they believe Hitler's men are on the verge of discovering.So the core story is an American ""good vs evil"", of getting the best of the Nazis and preserving a valuable artifact for the civilized world. The mild-mannered professor springs into action and shows he cannot be defeated, whether by fist or by use of his trusty bullwhip.The second way is the style of the movie. Although Spielberg was already in his mid-30s he had only a few years earlier directed ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters."" We didn't have the internet back in 1981, we generally knew very little about actors and directors. Now that we do, and understand how Spielberg started of as a youngster making movies at home, his style in ""Raiders"" now makes more sense.While the subject is serious the movie is shot in a grand Saturday matinee adventure style. Lots of action, lots of humor, and playing fast and loose with customs and morals. When you re-watch it a lot certain things are very obvious, like the remotely activated pole that causes the truck to turn over, or the trench under the low-speed truck when Jones is working his way to the rear. And a few other things.Frankly, re-watching in now (2023) the movie doesn't have the luster that I remember when I saw it in the theater 40 years ago. My memory of ""Raiders"" is better than the movie really is. But I still consider it to be one of the best adventure movies of all time. Harrison Ford has been just perfect as Indiana Jones and I will continue to watch it every 2 or 3 years.I've seen it so many times now I find myself saying certain lines with them, ""They're digging in the wrong place!"" Many reviews focus on how unrealistic some elements are, but that is part of the fantasy, a professor by day fighting off innumerable Nazis. This is more an escape movie than anything else, just a fantasy to watch and enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Tries too hard to become too many things,"Most people giving this movie 9s and 10s are simply nostalgic because they saw the movie as a kid, fell in love with it many years ago and they remember it very fondly and giving it super generous (but unrealistic) ratings. I too watched this as a kid and loved it back then but after watching this as an adult, I am not impressed anymore.The movie tries to become too many things at once. It tries to become an action movie, horror movie, comedy movie, mystery movie, historical movie, war movie, love movie and superhero movie, spy movie all at once and has no direction. Its storytelling is too clumsy and jumps from place to place without proper transition and it's tiring to even try to follow the story let alone enjoying it. The movie tries to become too many things at once and doesn't become anything in the end.Also Indiana Jones literally beats up the entire German army with his bare fists. Yep, he beats up every German soldier one by one without even using any weapons. I guess the entire WW2 was just a fist fight between two armies and no guns were involved at all. Maybe guns weren't even invited back then.Also how is it that Dr. Jones gets captured like 10 times and his enemies let him go every time? What kind of bad guys are these?This is an ok movie to pass the time but NO WAY it's a 8.4 movie. The movie's rating is inflated by at last 2.5 points by nostalgic folks who remember it as a great movie when they first saw it 25-30 years ago when they were kids.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders Has Lots Going For It,"When I first saw Raiders of the Lost Ark back in 1981 I was quite taken by it. I reveled in the excitement of the adventure it took me on.

An Interesting Ride But Ultimately Falls Short,One of the strong points of this film is the detail in the settings and the nature of adventure. However the film falls short in execution.The film opens brilliantly in an enclosed jungle setting and is highly immersive and then paints a picture of Indy's background. Then we move to the colourful Nepal setting and lastly the Egypt setting. At this point of the film I thought it would become an epic picture. However I was quite wrong.The major fallacies of the film are the religious overtones that are ever-present in the film. It becomes suffocating. I know that Hitler actually did send expeditions during the war to uncover certain places/artifacts that would increase the power of the Nazi regime. What doesn't make sense is why Hitler would search for the Ark of the Covenant which is solely Jewish and Hitler despising Jews. It seemed quite illogical.Secondly the score is over the top and actually draws you away from the film. Constantly you will hear the Indiana Jones theme song being pulsated into your ear. It comes to a point where it is incredibly overbearing.Thirdly the action scenes are dull and prolonged. To put it simply the actions scenes are like watching two snails brawling. Being an adventure film of epic proportions this film should have had interesting action scenes however yet again it falls short.The immersion that was seen in the beginning of the film with Indiana searching for the golden artifact completely disappears in the later sections of the film. When Indiana is searching for the Ark the same level of detail and immersion is completely missing and ruins the scene.Overall the movie is enjoyable but the fallacies ultimately cheapen the viewer's experience.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
No brains,"It's good to know I'm not the only person in America who thinks ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is stupid and offensive.  With its villains designed only as punching bags (they are human, none the less...), its heroine intended to be ogled and scream at the right moments, and its pseudo-religious claptrap, all the praise it's gotten says something very disturbing about large numbers of people.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A Link to the Past, a Revival of Style","There are so many ways in which this film is perfect, most notably is the brilliant re-packaging of old-school action and war films; away from the James-Bond style of the late 60s; away from the Cold-War suspense and intrigue. One of the most endearing features of the picture is that the movie opens with the main character,Indiana Jones' at the close of his current adventure. The technique generates an immediate sense of personal history and intimacy with the main character, and in effect, serves the audience dessert twice.The atmosphere of equal parts impending danger and chronic screw ups is set right from the start, with a lit-fuse pace throughout the movie. Every scene is tight. The sound, the lighting, the dialog,the music, the performances. Every character actor is well-chosen. So many ingredients to enjoy: adventure, humor, mysterious locations, romance, explosions. Only a Nazi could not enjoy this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Will Rank Among The All-Time Adventure Stories,"All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one was still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, famous scenes - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years. In fact, to sum it all up: hundreds of years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied, which means a lot. You don't get the same kind of jolt of adventure. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here.This movie can wear you out, which is almost a negative. The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star. It didn't do much for the rest of the cast but it sure boosted Ford's stock.After a long wait, this finally came out on DVD in October of 2003 and it looks great!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Even Spielberg doesn't make 'em like this anymore.,"Inspired by the movies and serials enjoyed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in their youth, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a relentless roller-coaster of a film that sees the bearded movie moguls expertly combining action, romance, horror, adventure, fantasy and comedy; as far as pure entertainment value goes, it doesn't get much better than this.Unlike in their later adventures for Harrison Ford's heroic archaeologist, the pair pitch the level of escapism perfectly, stretching believability to the limits occasionally, but never exceeding them (there's no flying fridges or death defying falls over a cliff in a rubber dinghy in this one). Apart from seriously underestimating the weight of gold (Indy even takes some sand out of the bag he uses to replace a solid gold idol) and expecting the audience to accept that a U-Boat would travel hundreds of miles without submerging, the film is pretty flawless, with classic scene after classic scene brilliantly executed by a Spielberg in his prime.Not yet in his forties, Harrison Ford is still young enough to give the character his all (mind you, being well into his sixties today doesn't seem to have stopped him trying), and he is given able support by a solid cast that includes John Rhys-Davies as brave Egyptian Sallah, Denholm Elliott as fellow history nut Dr. Marcus Brody, Paul Freeman as reprehensible archaeologist Dr. René Belloq, and Karen Allen as Jones's spunky sidekick Marion Ravenwood. As well as terrific performances, the film also boasts superb old-school stunts (ie., pre-CGI), excellent visual effects from Richard Edlund, and even some delightfully gruesome moments that might prove too much for some little ones: a man is impaled on spears, a German soldier is reduced to a red mist by propeller blades, faces are melted, and there is even an exploding head!!! Now that's what I call quality family entertainment!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of my favourite movies!,"Frankly one of the best movies ever made! The plot, the excitement, the acting - it's all brilliant! Definitely the best Lucas film ever made, and definitely one of Spielberg's best. It leaves the viewer feeling quite exhilarated and exhausted - in a good way.

A nice beginning to the hero we love so much,"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones franchise that spawn out 3 sequels, a TV series and numerous video games. It is a classic and stood above many in the box office raking in over $380 million dollars. It also won 4 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Art Direction.The movie pulls surprises after surprises, like what happened when the Ark was opened, that scene alone is not something you will expect as it starts from the time it was opened till when it was shut, you will be stunned.It packages in its 115 minutes run, a bolder chase, arrow flying here and there, submarine, car chase, gun fights, drama, comedy, adventure, Nazis, Gestapo, Arabian men and Spiritual power in high places, all this for your fun and view, in a movie that is shot in numerous locations.There was a scene where Indy is trapped in the well of souls with over 7,000 snakes, now that is a sight you really want to see. The car chase reminded me of the Mad Max movie Road Warrior it was intense, fun and dangerous.The movie plot has our favorite hero, trying to get a solid-gold idol somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936. He gets it then loses the artifact to his rival and the movie antagonist who is French archaeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman).Indy is recruited by the Army Intelligence to stop the Nazi's who seem to be after the Ark of Covenant so as to gain power to topple the world.So Indy saddles up and goes to Nepal to meet with his Mentor Ravenwood only to discover that he had died, so he is left to ride along Marion (Karen Allen) his daughter to Cairo where they meet Indy's sidekick Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) as they team up to stop the Nazis.The movie is one joy ride from place to place the movie had quite an interesting bunch of characters that will keep you both thrilled and entertained, one character that catches my fancy was the Gestapo. Raiders of the Lost Ark is set to be a sequel to the movie that came after it, as Temple of Doom was set in 1935. The movie has received numerous acclaim ranked 66 in the AFI's top 100 movies 10th Anniversary and also ranked 10th in AFI's top ten thrills.Here is Indiana Jones at the very beginning an intro to the character that we all love and admire, I believe there is no reason why you should not have seen this classic.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I didn't like this film.,"I'm not going to spend much time on this as I am obviously in a massive minority by not liking it. It's taken me 20 years to finally see this film through to the end.It just bores me completely. It's a part James Bond film, which I've never had any time for. It doesn't seem any better than the 'Mummy' or 'Tomb Raider' type films (ZZZZZZ) where the dialogue is largely incidental & which you can watch with the volume turned down and still follow. They generally concern some pre-historic torch, urn, key, lump of dog turd, that has special powers, that the hero needs to get his hands on & that just doesn't make for an interesting film.I just cannot get into films like this & never have any interests whether they achieve what they're after. In this there were a lot of scenes which seemed to be filling in time. First the Nazi's had the initiative, then Jones, then back to the Nazi's again and this went on & on & on, to the point that it wasn't dis-similar from a Steven Seagal or Van Damme film. Apart from the obvious superior quality of acting in this, the fighting scenes were sometimes laughable.Karen Allen threw in some incredibly wooden acting in her cliched lines she was given. The ""I'm your partner"" was almost cringe making.There seems an unwritten rule that you are not allowed to comment on Raiders of the Lost Ark without mentioning Star Wars for some reason. So I love Harrison Ford films, I like George Lucas & certainly don't dislike Spielberg. Thus, I have Star Wars as one of only a dozen films in my list at 10/10, it's almost perfect. I myself, wouldn't mention this in the same breath as Star Wars. You immediately feel a part of Star Wars & it's wonderful characters, neither of which apply here.This film has never taken off in England to the extent it has done in the US. I know plenty of adults who've never seen it & many who are not mad over it.But I'll admit I've never found anyone who genuinely dislikes it. Apart from me!3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

VERY GOOD FILM,"I see the film as a metaphor for the pursuit of lost or forbidden knowledge and the dangers of uncovering truths that are meant to remain hidden. The Ark of the Covenant represents an ancient power or wisdom that, can have catastrophic consequences. It reflects the tension between sacred knowledge and its misuse by those in positions of power. The Ark of the Covenant represents ancient, suppressed knowledge and technology that possesses immense power and truth about humanity's origins and true history. The Nazis' pursuit of the Ark reflects a broader conspiracy to harness this hidden power for their own nefarious ends. The film suggests that powerful truths about our past are obscured by those in control, and such knowledge, if revealed, could drastically alter our understanding of history and reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Typical stupid American film,"The ""raiders of the ark"" is probably a genre by itself.It is not an action film. You should not expect more than a couple of gunfires and some whisp tricks. Is it realistic? Not at all, except if you consider that a man can move a pyramid's hone to escape from the pyramid.It is not humoristic, either (is there a single play on words?). Actually, it is rather completely stupid. A typical scene is the guy who sees a skeleton and howls like a fool for five seconds.The scenario is very boring. There is not a single second of suspense.Ironically, what makes the film watchable is the soundtrack.

Many amazing nuances and action highlights,"(1981) Raiders of the Lost Ark
ACTION ADVENTUREThe first of five Indiana Jones action adventure movies that opens with archeologist, Indy (Harrison Ford) along with some guides attempting to grab a golden artifact while exploring inside of a cave from some South American jungle. And by the time, Indy escapes the cave with the amulet, he is then waiting for him is fellow archaeologist, Belloq (Paul Freeman) waiting outside to take the amulet from him surrounded with natives pointing their arrows at him. And just as they are about to kill him, Indy manages to distract them before he escapes through the jungle onto a floater plane. It appears his fellow peer Belloq is working for the Nazis. Indy is back at the US again instructing his students, and is approached by US agents about instructions involving finding and locating the lost ark before the Nazis do. . The first name Indy is supposed to meet happens to live in Nepal, and by the time he goes their, it turns out he is deceased and that he has a daughter named Marion (Karen Allen) who runs a bar. Coincidentally, it also happens to the time the Nazis show up and try to recover the medallion Indy was looking for. A scuffle happens with the bar burned down to the ground with Indy escaping with Marion with the medallion that is supposed to pin point where the lost ark was buried.Although, entertaining some of the influential scenes also include Indy crawling underneath the truck carrying the ark that stunt is reminiscent to the stunt performed by Yakima Canutt from ""Stagecoach""; and the one scene with the guy waving a machete before Indy pulls out his gun was already shown before on a movie called ""Seven"" released in 1979.

10/10,"There is no denying that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre. It's one of the most impressive, most memorable, and most dynamically entertaining films I have ever experienced. George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan delivered lots of unexpected surprises to the whole script, and these surprises just kept on coming. The script is complemented by the slick and elaborate direction by Steven Spielberg. What makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stand out in the action/adventure genre, as well as for a winner for fans of this genre, is how smart it is; the film consistently throws in perilous obstacles to keep the film exciting, and we will never know what is coming, and when something happens, it really pays off. Even on repeat viewings, it is still unpredictable and satisfying in every way. Not to mention that the skillful craftsmanship on display will make it an inspiring film for those who want to be a filmmaker for the action/adventure genre.The production design is arresting and tangible, while the sound effects are gripping. From the audacious stunts, to the hard-hitting impact, and to the astonishing effects, The action sequences deliver a lot of sprightly momentum. The unintentionally comedic moments are clever in structure and quite gut-busting in execution, and I laughed at all of these comedic moments. I must add that no animals were hamred in the making of this film, including the snakes. They all spawned a dynamic adventure yarn that is altogether exhilarating, audacious, intelligent, and hilarious. Driven by high energy and melodic emotion, The dramatically invigorating music score by John Williams enhances the film entirely, as it vividly captures every element, and it strongly supports the film's genre and it's theme of heroism.The all of the characters have both brains and brawn that are equally matched. But each of them are distinct in personality. Also, the performances are first-rate indeed, and the interactions between the characters are intriguing and fun to watch. Both the protagonists and the antagonists are archeologists, but different in nationalities; the heroes (the main characters) are Americans, while the villains are Nazis, as they go head to head for the golden ark of god that invokes religious spirits, and the Nazis thought that the spirits will make the army invincible. Harrison Ford plays the main titular character; he is a heroic and collected archeologist. Marion is a tough and sassy bar tender who became Indy's partner and eventually a tormented damsel-in-distress. John Rhys-Davis is great as Indy's close friend ""Sallah"" with his amusing performance. Paul Freeman plays Rene, an ambitious jerk who is Indy's arch-nemesis, while Ronald Lacey is creepy as Major Arnold the Gestapo agent.In conclusion: With slick sophistication that offers superbly-staged set-pieces in spades throughout it's breezy pace, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a dynamic and rip-roaring non-stop ride of an adventure yarn with rollicking fun, breathtaking audacity, and sheer brilliance. Suitable for teens thirteen and up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"7.9/10 - Creative, Iconic and Consistently Urgent, Raiders is Quite a Fun Watching Experience","Elaborate a bit more on that.Raiders of the Lost Ark follows, as written above, Indiana Jones - the smart, badass and fearless (as long as snakes are not around) archeologist and adventurer, who often goes after buried archeological treasure in order to bring them to the museum he works with. Here the US government contacts him with a special task - finding the lost ark of the covenant, which is pursued by Hitler's soldiers as well (the film takes place in 1936). So, as you can probably imagine, finding the ark before the nazis is not an easy task.I guess that others could dive into George Lucas' deep character building or something (which I don't think is exactly the case), or Spielberg's stunning cinematography (which, again, I don't really find all that mind-blowing here), but I'm gonna be honest with you.Raiders of the Lost Ark is just a simple, creative and fun film to watch.The character building isn't bad, I just think that every character is quite simple and straight forward. Except for, maybe, Jones' relationship with religion, no character here has some psychological mystery that makes you think a little bit. And even that one isn't really developed here. Marion , btw, totally feels like she was written by a man. Not to say that men can't write amazing female characters, but rather to say that you can feel how she's written from a very specific point of view on women. Quite cliche, but not terrible. She's okay, I guess.The cinematography is, again, totally fine, and I have no problem with it whatsoever. It's decent.The real strength of the film is its creativity and the consistent sense of urgency. I don't think that there are many dull moments here, if any. Almost every scene something creative, exciting and awesome is happening. I think that it can spark the childish ""oh no, he's not gonna make it!"" in every viewer, even if deep inside we all know that he's gonna be fine, since he's the protagonist. The plot thrusts the viewer from one exciting, iconic moment to another, and it's quite a fun experience.The score is great too, btw. John Williams is a legendary composer, and the main theme to this movie is one of the most iconic themes of all time. For a good reason, I'd say.So, in conclusion: Raiders of the Lost Ark is not your deep, visually amazing masterpiece, but rather a very fun watching experience with many exciting, iconic moments. The characters are simple but they work well with the plot, and I guess that this is what matters most here. Again, a lot of fun. I'm feeling a 7.9/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Best of the Indiana Jones series and one of the all time greatest!,"This is by far and away the best movie in a trilogy of great movies. After establishing the fact that Indiana is a likable and yet not immortal hero, that the suspense never stops and that the characters still have room to be developed, there are two other things that really make this movie incredible.First, Marion Ravenwood is the best heroine of the series. If there's a possible rip against the next two, it is her absence. She is tough and aware of the events, and yet she is still beautiful and perfectly ladylike. It might seem like somewhat of a contradiction, but to anyone whos seen it, they know what I'm talking about. Elsa Scheider and Willie Scott of the later movies simply don't match up to Marion.Second, the movie is incredibly clever in that Indiana, despite all the trouble he faces, has absolutely no impact on the outcome. He could have told the government to shove it, and it would not have mattered. The Nazis eventually open the Ark, only to find that to be a somewhat gruesome thing. Its a funny irony, that the artifact they are so desperately looking for is better left untouched. Some might see this as bad, but I thought it was an interesting twist, and it does NOT ruin the movie at all. Besides, all the action and humor leading up to that point should more than make up for anyone who disliked that aspect.Either way, this movie is, IMO, the greatest of all time, a real must see!PS, I've just seen some negative reviews, and just like it was with When Harry Met Sally, most of the whiners seem to be coming from foreign countries, like France and Germany (who of course have a long history of popping out excellent movies...lol). None of them seem to have any good reason to rip the movie except that they're disappointed to see their own people getting beat up on. Oh, jealousy...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

It starts off well, and then, it gets really slow.There's some funny parts, but they're spread out, so boredom can ensue.It's supposed to be charming because well, it's Harrison Ford, and it is, but only to an extent, and once again, be wary of slowness.I'm not saying slow movies are bad. I'm saying slow movies that are written like action movies kind of are. I think ""Last Crusade"" is much more polished than this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Masterpiece,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a terrific example of cinema at its absolute finest, and one of the few perfect films ever made. It's no surprise why this movie is so great, it is essentially the same team that made Star Wars. George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan worked together to write the script. Both films are set in the fantasy genre. The stories are vastly different, but the conflict is the same; good versus the ultimate evil, Nazis - who are the obvious inspiration to stormtroopers and the Empire. They have a very similar score, composed by the GOAT John Williams. And of course, Harrison. Freaking. Ford.Han Solo and Indiana Jones are similar characters, both being men who can't help but ooze sarcastic charisma in every scene. Indy is different in the way that he is the main feature in this franchise, and he plays a more prototypical hero type. What makes Indiana Jones such a great character is he is the perfect blend of a superhero and an ordinary man. He has the capability to pull off some incredible, superhuman-like, stunts, especially in the more recent ones, while lucking out of almost every fight he gets in.This was Spielberg's chance to direct a Star Wars film, and he knocked it out of the park! Also, shout out to Spielberg for creating the traveling map edit, a staple in the Indiana Jones franchise. This was one of my favorite films to watch as a kid, and not much has changed. My God, do I love this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good clean fun in these times,"I don't like to watch most films because of the content, but this was good wholesome clean fun.Harrison Ford delivers a fantastic performance as the archaeologist turned adventurer, I'd suggest his performance is the benchmark against which any other adventure film is measured against.Directed by Steven Spielberg this is one of those movies which made him a cinematic master. With writing credits to George Lucas, off the back of Star Wars, and a John Williams musical score you are surely going to be entertained.This is a movie I can watch and re-watch, it never fails to entertain me. The musical score pushes a fantastic pace for the movie and delivers some iconic tunes too - I can still hum the theme tunes without any problems remembering how it went. It's a no holds barred adventure with fun, humour, romance, thrills, spills, horror and suspense.This is slightly darker than other Indiana Jones films but in fairness it was the start of a dynasty so audiences were only just learning about him, character development in later films would make him more family friendly but this film was rightly a PG at the time as there is the occasional tense horrifying moment and occasional bloodshed. By today's standards that is nothing though, and you can still safely watch this with young children without fear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My Favourite Movie Of All Time,"When the guy that made ""Star Wars"" and the guy that made ""Jaws"", said thet they are making a movie, everyone thought it was too good to be true, but here we are with the best action adventure movie of all time.Let's start with the elphant in the room - Steven Spielberg. Every shot of the movie is goregous and he does a terrific job with the movie. Now let's talk abot George Lucas. Legends sat that in the opening weekend of ""Star Wars"", Lucas and Spielberg went on a hoilday together and on the beach, George asked Steven, about the movies he plans to make and he said that he wanted to make a James Bind film, but George said that he had something better in mind. That's when he said his brilliant idea for the archeologist ""Indiana Smith"" (they later changed the name, because Spielberg didn't like it). You can say whatever you want about him as a director, but he makes a hell of a good stories, not scripts, stories.Harrison Ford is brilliant and he is the perfect fit for Indiana Jones. At first, lucas didn't want him, because he was already in most of his movies, but no matter that, they decited (i don't know to spell it) to pick him, which was a great choice. Karen Allen is also really good in her role, as well as Paul Freeman and the other actors.And it would not be a full review, if i don't talk about John Williams and his score for the movie. It's simply on of the best scores ever.However, there is one thing that i didn't like about this movie, but it's not a flaw, just a little nitpick. In the end, when they are opening the Ark, the whole time, Indy is tied and he does nothing, but still a really beautiful sequence. I am not going to give it lower score, just because of that, but i wanted to say it.Simply this is one of the movies ever made. The action, the score, the direction, everything is great and that's why this is my favourite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Quality and personality,"Steven Spielberg is easily one of the best directors in the history of cinema, and among his great projects we have the Indiana Jones franchise, one of the most notable of his career. The first film has an incredible personality, everything here is very striking and matches the tone of the film. The photography is beautiful and very light, making it relaxing to watch. The rhythm is wonderful, it never seems to get lost. The plot is very well constructed with very good characters and incredible production design. Some things here could be rough, like some fight scenes and some sound effects, but it all seems to fit very well with the entire tone of the film. This is one of the best films of Spielberg's entire career and I would say it is almost perfect, if it weren't for the dark makeup in the first hour and some other details.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Before Watching: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981),"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) is undoubtedly an iconic adventure classic. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Raiders of the Lost Ark is a thrill ride, but some aspects leave a few things to be wanted. The editing during the movie's first half can be a bit choppy at times, and a few plot details throughout the film are somewhat illogical. The villains are quite one-dimensional, and a certain sequence has a very clear use of greenscreen as well. The more of a nitpicker one is, the more this will be bothering, but all aspects named can be overlooked with any major effort.A warning should however be issued to those who are sensitive to blood and gruesome effects. The opening feature some stark images in this category, there is a shoot-out scene early on that doesn't shy away from this either, and the infamous ending is surprisingly brutal and gory when compared to the overall lighter mood of the movie. It has currently a PG rating, but a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate as the violence alone pushes the movie into R areas at said times.Finally, the iconic status of Raiders of the Lost Ark derives mostly from its cult position as well as its 80's nostalgia. At the time, this was clearly groundbreaking in most of its areas, but today, its technical features are matched more and more often within the genre. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones' charisma still hits home, and ultimately, the portrayed adventures has maintained their excitements. Don't rush into to the following sequel at the cost of appreciating this one, as Temple of Doom fails drastically to deliver entertainment of the same level.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

Raiders of the Lost Ark - Top-Notch Entertainment from Lucas,"George Lucas was a master filmmaker. He knew how to entertain the audience, and he knew how to sustain a good action scene. In Raiders, Lucas uses Harrison Ford like a Japanese chef uses a knife. We get introduced to this timeless character for this and several other sequels. The formula is the same: Indy becomes intrigued with some type of archeological problem that makes him leave the classroom and go on wild adventures. I should be so lucky; I never got to leave my university students. The formula worked time after time.Add the best bad guys of all time (the Nazis) and you have a can't miss film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Part of Cinematic History!!! Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones first and foremost. Any other role is secondary.,"When I look at Harrison Ford, I think Indiana Jones first and Han Solo second.An Iconic film franchise, that's still going strong today. We kick it off with this classic first entry: Raiders of The Lost Ark.Let me start off by saying, any film in which the Nazis get their butts kicked, is already a great film.The charisma and intelligence of Indiana Jones makes him a very easy character to like. Right from the get go, we see him at the tail end of an adventure. We see what he is capable of, and we find out his biggest fear. He hates snakes.Raiders is an action heavy in the first half of the movie and in my opinion, they find the Ark way too easy. It becomes a ""catch me if you can"" in the second half of the movie. This is essentially what I call the Indiana Jones formula. All the films follow this formula, maybe not in order, but they do the same thing. That isn't a bad thing, but I'll admit, it's very formulaic and kind of predictable.My favorite scene in Raiders has always been the market scene and the final scene. The sword versus gun bit, always puts a smile on my face. The faces melting and explosions in the final scene is part of cinematic history.You can really tell Harrison Ford loves playing the role. He really shines as Indy. His supporting cast in this one does a phenomenal job as well. The chemistry between him and Karen Allen is undeniable. John Rhys-Davies (played Sallah) and Denholm Elliot (played Dr. Marcus Brody), are such good characters as well (albeit very minor).Indiana Jones is part of cinematic history, as such it is required viewing for anyone with a brain.This film gets a Lenny Reviewz Score of: 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of my favorite films of all time,"Perhaps the greatest action movie of all time, Spielberg creates a rollercoaster of a movie that never stops and will have you on the edge of your seat to the very end. An iconic movie with iconic characters that still holds up today. This film (like many films made in this era) has heart and substance and it's easy to tell it was made with passion for film unlike most movies, especially action, that are made today. The action and stunts look real because they are real and they are fantastic. The music (like most music by John Williams) is on another level. The many music themes that play throughout the movie are just so well done and perfectly capture each character, artifact, moment, etc. The movie has the best villain in the whole series in Belloq, an ignorant rival archeologist who manages to get artifacts by stealing them from people who did the hard work and he is easily the most compelling and best match for Indy in the series. The movie also has one of the most powerful endings ever. It gives me the chills. Growing up on the Indiana Jones films, I have so much nostalgia for them and I always have a blast watching them especially Raiders. Sure, the plot might be pretty straightforward and the characters not have a lot of depth to them and sure, Toht's melting head might not hold up as well as it used to, but in a film like this, you aren't paying attention to that. It's entertaining, well made cinema and just plain fun without being dumb, something movies today just can't seem to capture. So watch this fantastic classic and go on the adventure of a lifetime!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Educational Review,"Raiders of the Lost Ark follows the adventures of renowned archaeologist Dr. Indiana Jones, portrayed by Harrison Ford. He is in a race against the Nazis to find an artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant.On his journey, he reunites with his former lover, Marion Ravenwood, portrayed by Karen Allen. Together, they travel from Nepal to Egypt in search of the artifact. The Nazis are working with Indiana Jones' arch nemesis French archaeologist, Dr. Rene Belloq, portrayed by Paul Freeman. The Nazis are also trying to find the Ark of the Covenant to use the power of the Ark for their evil purposes.The movie's theme, and many to follow, revolve around the quest for knowledge and the battle between good and evil. Indiana Jones is a spirited adventurer who risks his life to uncover ancient artifacts. He is also a professor at Marshall College. The film focuses on courage, sacrifice, defining true heroism, and the thirst for knowledge. It also shows the consequences of pursuing power and that good triumphs over evil.Throughout the film, Indiana Jones is deciphering ancient books and relics, exploring dangerous hidden temples, and discovering many artifacts. He shares his quest for knowledge with his students and others in his profession.He sells museums the artifacts to aid his future expeditions and share these priceless artifacts with the world. He repeatedly risks his life to protect others and prevent the Nazis from obtaining the Ark. His bravery and courage are often displayed throughout the movie. He risks his life to rescue Marion several times in the movie, such as at her bar in Nepal, in Egypt when they captured her, and at the Nazi camp. He has high morals and understands self-sacrifice for the greater good.Ultimately, the Nazis open the Ark, unleashing supernatural forces that consume them.This scene shows the consequences of pursuing power for evil. The Nazis did not understand or respect the Ark leading to their demise. Other films have the same premise, such as Indiana Jones movies and The Mummy (1999). In The Mummy, the characters driven by greed and power end up dying, whereas the characters pursuing the artifacts in quest of knowledge survive.In the film, costume design and set design play a significant role in immersing the viewer. The iconic designs by Indiana Jones, such as his fedora, leather jacket, and whip, show practical uses and symbolize his courage, resourcefulness, and heroism. Many scenes depict Indiana using his whip as a weapon and tool. This is displayed in scenes when he brushes the spiders off, using it as a rope to swing across the crevasse and fight off bad guys throughout the film.The sets are intricate and well thought out to include authenticity and realism. This can be seen in bar scenes, the streets of Cairo, and ancient temples Indiana explores.In summary, this film is thrilling and adventurous. It explores timeless themes of courage, integrity, the pursuit of knowledge, and the importance of good overcoming evil. There have been many films before and after it that encompass the same qualities; however, the unique editing and utilization of different sound techniques make it a timeless film that all can enjoy. I watched the film with my four children, ages 16 to 4 years old. They all enjoyed the characters, constant action, and particularly the sounds of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Indiana Jones raiders of the lost ark,Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary.

Non stop action,I watched Raiders for the first time in 2021 and it wasn't as good as I was expecting. This iconic action movie is just non stop and I think that is it's biggest flaw. It doesn't stop to catch a breath and build a storyline and develop characters.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Greatest action film ever?,"What can one say about Raiders that hasn't been said? This is, in my opinion, one of the five best action movies ever made (the others? Die Hard, Terminator 2, The Matrix, and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy). This movie has it all: a smart story (Hitler actually was looking for the Ark in the 1930's), rich characters, memorable villains, scares, amazing sets, iconic music, solid comedy, a likable and unsentimental romance, fascinating mythology, and some of the greatest stunt/action sequences ever filmed (the opening and the truck chase stand out in particular).Raiders also benefits from the best leading lady in the series. As Marion Ravenwood, Karen Allen displays a tomboyish charm, spunk, and an unwillingness to simply be a damsel-in-distress. Case in point: when locked in the cockpit of a grounded bomber, she calls for Indiana's help for a few seconds, then decides to kill some time and some Nazis by manning the machine gun! The scene where she kisses Indy's wounds, which in another movie would be sexualized, is here very tender. Marion is resourceful, smart, and tough, making her the only love interest in the series who is Indy's perfect match.As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford completely inhabits the character, creating a man who is both an academic and an adventurer. He's a bit of a scoundrel but also cares about people. Most importantly, he was an action hero who was self-deprecating and imperfect. Up until that point the James Bonds, the John Waynes, and the Clint Eastwoods were all extremely macho ""men's men,"" more prone to giving beatings than taking them. Even though Indiana Jones is tough and intelligent, he's constantly being outsmarted and out-punched. You know he'll win in the end, but usually he'll have to dig deep and use all of his ingenuity, physicality, and luck to to pull it out at the last second. Though John McClane and other heroes have followed the same template, Dr. Jones is the original and the best. * * * * * (out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the lost time...,"When I watched it for the first time I was blown away, but, watching it for the second time?

The second hour gets really good with all the action set pieces and whatnot.As for the characters, Indy is cool, but he doesn't really go through anything, and Marion is a really good female character.Sallah is very likeable, and Belloq is a good villain.Overall, not as good as I remember it to be, but it's still to some extent a fun time.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Highly Overrated,"I watched this famous film expecting it will so much more but I was disappointed instead.The story is beyond absurd, the plot is weak and there was hardly any logic present. Indiana Jones was doing a lot of things in the film: explaining, exploring, running, fighting but what he was not doing is thinking. Often there was no rational explanations for his actions which made the film uninteresting. Every time he is in trouble, he gets out of it is the most absurd and unrealistic way possible.The performance of the actors and actresses was mediocre. As the story was not that good there was nothing much to be done by them either. On top of that the action scenes were not well crafted, in fact they were pretty clumsy. Also the editing of those scenes was less than good.If you are expecting an amazing movie then I will not recommend it but if you are seeking an average type action film to watch then you can watch this.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Throwback Nazi-punching adventure tale remains a classic,"No story summary is needed for this film since everyone has seen it (if you haven't, go watch it RIGHT NOW!). I saw this in the theater as a kid and it made my mind explode. This viewing was at a pandemic drive-in showing at the fairgrounds with my kids, so it was not the most optimal of setting to watch the film. The sound was broadcast over the radio, which was terrible and we ended up not using, and listening to it over the fairground speakers was only slightly better. The picture quality was so dark you could barely make out what was happening on screen anytime a scene was remotely dark or shadowy, which is fair portion of the film. So although I was highly annoyed this poor presentation poisoned my kids' interest watching further Indiana Jones films, I do still dearly love this film. The script by Lawrence Kasdan (""Empire Strikes Back"" ""The Big Chill"" ""Body Heat"" ""Silverado"" ""The Accidental Tourist"" ""The Bodyguard"") from a story by George Lucas (""Star Wars"") and Phillip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff""), the film is pure H. Rider Haggard with an updated Allan Quatermain in the form of globe trotting archeologist adventure-seeker Indiana Jones searching for treasure, punching Nazis, and saving the world from hidden supernatural forces. As corny as all that sounds, what make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" such a classic is the perfect casting of Harrison Ford, exhilarating direction from Steven Spielberg, and an iconic film score from John Williams. Taking first the casting of Harrison Ford, my favorite measure of a great performance is if you cannot picture any other actor in a role and Ford as Indiana Jones is about the most perfect example of this. Ford pulls off so many great moments, from his expression after the shoot-the-swordsman scene to a later moment in the film where he grudgingly accepts help from Marion (another great bit of casting with Karen Allen) and tells her where it hurts, Ford strikes a unique balance of a character who is both a superman and an everyman. Indiana Jones really is a unique hero for 80s action films, which were primarily populated by invincible Rambos, Conans, or Dirty Harrys. Simply stated, Ford IS Indiana Jones and no one else could have filled that role (but fun fact, Tom Selleck was the original first choice for the role, which wouldn't have been all that bad). As for Spielberg's direction, he captures a pitch perfect tone for the film, balancing its mix of cliffhanger serial films, but treating it like a serious action thriller, nicely updating an old style story with big budget production values, modern stunt work, and contemporary filmmaking techniques and special effects. Whether audiences appreciate throwback touches such as the Peter Lorre analogue Toth or Paul Freeman's Belloq as a stand in for a Claud Raines/James Mason type of suave charming villain, Spielberg litters the film with wonderful small nods to classic Hollywood. He's masterfully crafted a film that's equal parts nostalgic throwback and also something wholly original that had never been done before (treating pulp as serious material). And there are so many great small touches, such as making Indy a little human with an irrational fear of snakes or allowing Indy to be vulnerable allowing Marion to patch his wounds, which is also a testament to Ford's acting skills. A personal favorite little touch is having Indy wear leather gloves when he has his epic fist fight with a musclebound Nazi, which is a badass aesthetic that really needs to come back into fashion in more action flicks. Simply speaking, Spielberg knows film language down to small details in a way few filmmakers can replicate. As for John Williams score, the trumpets for ""Indy's Theme"" are just as iconic as his themes for ""Jaws,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Superman,"" ""Harry Potter"" or innumerable other films he's indelibly left his mark. It's impossible to imaging another composer scoring an Indiana Jones film. Those are the main reasons this is such a great film, but I'd be remiss not to mention the terrific supporting cast that includes Karen Allen as Marion, Paul Freeman as Belloq, Ronald Lacey as Toht, John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, as well as Denholm Elliott and Alfred Molina in a memorable small part at the start of the film before he was famous. Overall, I will admit I have an unhealthy amount of childhood nostalgia for this film, but adolescent bias aside, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is arguably one of the greatest action films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Classic escapist adventure that's stood the test of time,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is as entertaining now as it was back in 1981.

The cast includes a wonderfully feisty Karen Allen, the always dependable Denholm Elliott and a larger-than-life and instantly likable John Rhys-Davies.

Harrison Ford makes history come to life.,"This is the first in a series of fun to watch action-packed movies based on what an archeologist should be. Being a first you will not notice the pattern of the film unless you are used to Saturday matinees.We hit the ground running on this one as we see Indiana Jones making a John Wayne type of entrance. So much that you do not notice the dubious-looking character next to him Statipo (Alfred Molina). Until he says, ""Give me the Idle and I will give you the whip.""Now settled down, after his near-miss with the natives, Harrison Ford is a professor (Indiana Jones) teaching the fact that archeology is a search for facts, not some thrill ride.That very afternoon he is confronted by some government agents. It seems that his old professor Abner Ravenwood has disappeared. They picked up some radio transmissions that contained the name of Abner and a city Tannis. Immediately Indiana Jones knows that the Nazis (natural bad guys) are looking for the Ark of the Covenant (which can be used as a weapon of unspeakable power) and somehow, he must beat them to it for the sake of the world.He is helped by an old love interest Marion (Karen Allen) and rivaled by an old nemesis Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman).Does the Ark exist?How can he beat them to it?Why is he on the outs with Abner?Hold on for a thrill a minute and do not eat any bad dates.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good Film that Lacks a Critical Hook,"Raiders tells the story of Indiana Jones, as he try to get the Lost Ark before the Nazi could.It did just not resonate with me. I guess in the grand scheme of great films, I mean this like a film and popular culture that is referenced to a point that it feels like you know it without really watching it. But unlike say Saturday Night Fever, this really feels so surface level and lacking of subtext.It does not feel like it is trying to say something BUT rather show a spectacle. Like other Spielberg film, I thought this film is well-made but there is something stilted about its storytelling, sexual dynamics and even overall morality. Its just a Hero's Journey story that you kind of wish that it at least tried to be edgy maybe or add some complication.It just feels like something I will forget.Not recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
He's a James Bond without the Hardware!,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first Indiana Jones adventure that we get a taste of and can't get enough of for years to come. Winning 4 oscars out of the 9 nominations it had, just tells you what a great movie this truly is. Packed with action, adventure, comedy , with a little of bit of romance on the side, it ticks off all the good things you would love to see in a movie and that includes a great leading man, no other than Harrison Ford.
Absolutely loved the opening scene. Spiders creeping, big rocks rolling after you, booby traps and seeing a beautiful sunset.
I love the idea of a teacher who actually does, because they always say those who can't do, teach but it doesn't apply here on Indie. He is the hot, handsome professor archeologist with a whip and the coolest hat ever.
There was a chase scene that I thought took too long, it got boring. The Nepal Scene was very intense and may make give you the shivers with an incident you don't want happening to you. The Funniest scene has to be the sword and the gun.
John Ryhs Davies was amazing as always with that great accent of his. Karen Allen is my least favorite in the movie, but I can see that she does give a lot of character around Indiana jones.
Steven Spielberg for me is one of the best directors of all time, you can always tell if it's a Spielberg movie, his direction is outstanding, eye catching and in a class of its own. The elements of adventure and comedy are always strong and it's evident here in The Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indian Jones is an iconic movies from the eighties is a must watch. It's a great piece of film that you shouldn't miss. Indiana Jones is like James bond in away. In the words of Steven Spielberg, it's a James Bond Film without the hardware!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Adventure movie of all time for me and my family!,"When me and my brother and sisters first watched this movie, we were all enjoying all the different things inside it like the first fight scenes, people getting shot and blown up, some skeleton images, how the villain watched a lady change into a former dress in the movie! The bar fight scene was so hilarious and awesome, and how Major Toht was getting beat up as well, I would recommended watching this movie for all Indiana Jones fans and obsessed fans. This movie along with the rest of the Indiana Jones movie series are all extremely good. Even though the first three movies are rated PG and the remainder of the movies are rated PG-13, all of these films should have given an R rating for the blood and gore inside the movies, but nothing scares us, these are awesome movies! How we are not scared of people getting shot, stabbed, blown up or melted like Toht and the rest at the near end of the movie, I would really watch this again over and over, with my family and the clips of this movie and the rest. I would highly recommend the makers have given these movies an R rating for sensitivity of strong violence, frightening images and substance of bare nudity. Not gonna lie, this along with all of the rest of the Indiana Jones movies are really good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Iconic,"Raiders of the Lost Ark never ceases to amaze me. From the first moments in the Peruvian temple, I was immediately invested in Dr. Jones and his quest for precious artifacts. With a great story, an iconic score and one of the best directors of all time, this film is a treasure. Harrison Ford is charming and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting.The action scenes are exceptionally done, especially for a film made in the 1980's. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film that I could watch over and over without losing interest. The film is legendary!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Captures the imagination,"Watching this movie as a child filled me with awe and wonder. I was taken to another place and time filled with mystery, adventure and danger. I'd never seen anything like it.The most thrilling part of the movie was how the scenes unfolded. A scene would start with slow tension; Harrison Ford making his way down a trail. The pace would pick up as he encountered a surprise. The scene would return to calm tension. Suddenly, with no warning, chaos! Ford running for his life. It was a roller-coaster of emotion and adrenaline.Although this movie is much older now, as am I, it will always hold a special place in my heart.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Quintessential adventure movie,"The first Indiana Jones movie I saw was The Last Crusade which gave me wrong expectations for this movie which in turn made my first watch not as good as it could've been. This time I enjoyed it for what it is and it is a hell of an adventure movie. One of the first of its kind that perfected what is there to perfect compared to different forms of it that came before. It's entertaining and action-packed with charming actors and great music. It's curious that Indian Jones is seen as a classic hero now when it was supposed to be an anti-hero they were writing, which is actually pretty evident in this movie as well as Temple of Doom as far as I can remember. We love the character because he is an antihero and not an actual hero. The man is straight up robbing indigenous cultures so he can have his kicks and make the archaeology department of his country great with not much actual regard for the culture he steals from. And even in a lot of other instances, it is shown how he rarely chooses the heroic path.The character's looks and a lot of scenes and turning points in the plot clearly show how inspired this is by The Secret of the Incas.With Close Encounters of the Third Kind and this, Spielberg really fuelled the conspiracy theorists in America, it seems. Even though the films themselves need not be said to be at fault, a lot of conspiracy theories can be boiled down to the narratives of these two movies. I can also see now how Spielberg is considered a conservative film director, where people see his movies aligning with conservative values, even if it doesn't necessarily preach any extreme values.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"(*Indiana Jones quote*) - ""I hate snakes!""","For the most part I quite enjoyed watching ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" (from 1981) which was a Steven Spielberg production.Filmed on a substantial-sized budget of $18 million - This action/adventure story (set in 1936) was produced in the era prior to CGI visuals which I think makes it that much more interesting to watch.What also appealed to me about ""Raiders"" was that its hero, Indiana Jones was quite a likable guy who didn't have to use any superhero powers in order to get himself (and others) out of trouble.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Lame and Overrated,"I tried to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark when i was young, but I was so bored within the first fifteen minutes I shut off the TV and did something worth while. I watched it again now to see what I missed. I didn't miss much.    The acting is bad- horrendously bad. The actors annoyed the hell out of me. That and the action was so ludicrous I had to wonder if all the fanatics of the series ever watched an adventure movie in their lives. Other scenes were badly played out, such as when the professors were discussion the ark, and the really lame bid with the student who had I love you written on her eye lids.     I kind of respect the series for combining an influencial hero and an adventerous plotline. You can see the influence in many more movies, stories, games, etc. But besides that, it's not really very entertaining. I just don't see what all the fans see.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Simply the Best,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, is simple one of the best movies of all time. The direction, writing, cinematography, score, acting, everything hits at the highest level, people will say Spielberg's best is Jaws or Jurassic Park or Schindlers List but Raiders is for me his best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The modern day template for action/adventure movies.,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is directed by Steven Spielberg and collectively written by Lawrence Kasdan (screenplay), George Lucas (story) and Philip Kaufman (story). It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Douglas Slocombe.What can you say about Raiders of the Lost Ark that hasn't been said before? It has been analysed, deconstructed, praised and written about at length by everyone from the highest of film critics to the man of the street film lover and his dog. Truth is, is that nothing new can be added to the millions of tomes written about what Spielberg coyly announced was his B movie homage to adventure serials of the 30s and 40s.In simple factoid terms it was roughly made for $20 million and went on to make nearly $400 million! It quickly pulled Spielberg out of a depressive rut after the critical mauling of his period comedy movie 1941. It announced Harrison Ford as a superstar actor whilst simultaneously introducing pop culture references that still thrive today. It won four Oscars and was nominated for a further four, and as it made archaeology sexy it heralded the opening of a new era for the summer blockbuster. The whole production (apart from Spielberg) were taken ill whilst filming in Tunisia and it was the start of a franchise that still brings great GREAT pleasures to millions of fans.Why is Raiders so adored? That it is a film that still entertains royally today, where once loved in 1981 is still loved by the very same older and wiser people in the new millennium? The answer is it gets everything right, it transcends its basic source to reveal one of the most exhilarating action/adventure movies ever made. It's packed with outstanding action set-pieces (amazing stunt-work), the special effects stunning, the locations are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous and Williams' score stirs the blood and raises the gooseflesh. The narrative is smooth and appealing in its good versus bad race against time simplicity, yet the pace is frenetic. From the establishment of the kinetic pleasures with its iconic opening section, to the gloriously gruesome finale, it's breakneck stuff that is by turns intense but played with considerable wit and playfulness.Casting is also spot on, with Ford leading the way. Ford's performance as Indiana Jones - part time teacher, part time lovable rogue who lurches from one perilous situation to another - is note perfect. It's a performance of style and substance that is often wrongly ignored by the stuffy, purely because of the genre of film it sits in. That Ford oozes comic book heroics without falling into campy cliché is a great achievement, while of course he gave us iconography unbound that still exists today. The supporting performances are also outstanding, with Allen's spunky hard drinking Marion and Freeman's weasel Nazi stooge Belloq particularly hitting the heights. While on the other side of the camera and at the writing table, the trio of Spielberg, Kasdan and Lucas prove to be a meeting of classical adventure loving heart and minds, for the film is crafted with humour, energy and skill.It undoubtedly owes a debt to olde Hollywood fare like Gunga Din, Secret of The Incas and Valley of the Kings (and more), while some stereotyping of natives exists because the film harks back to olde Hollywood adventure movies! And undeniably it's a teeny–tiny bit annoying that as we enter the home straight Allen's character arc has her shift from tough dame to ""save me Indy"" fodder, but small complaints be damned. This is top line genre film making, where true love is proved to always last a lifetime, because, quite simply, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the modern day template for action/adventure movies. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Ark Should Have Come With A Warning Label,"Raiders of the Lost Ark marked the debut of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, two fisted archaeologist with a mean bull whip. The film also reawakened a longing in the American public for some good old fashioned pulp fiction adventure even if it is done tongue slightly in cheek.Archeology certainly is a competitive business, but I think Indiana Jones takes it to an exponential level. He certainly has to when he's dealing with the up and coming German Reich.What they and Jones are after is high stakes indeed. Both have a lead on where the Ark of the Covenant might be buried. It was spirited away after the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem, whereabouts unknown until the 1930s.As the Good Book tells us the Kingdom of Israel was undefeated as long as the Ark was ahead of them in battle. So even with the Nazis rather well known policy about Jews, they'd like to have this thing with whatever powers it has.It's a pretty delicate matter. If you remember a soldier of King David was struck down for just touching the Ark as it was about to fall. You can catch that in the Gregory Peck-Susan Hayward film, David and Bathsheba. It should definitely come with a warning label.Anyway, Ford ably assisted by Karen Allen, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies goes after it and has to battle the Nazis for possession. As for the Nazis, it's like that old adage of being careful what you wish for.Raiders of the Lost Ark was nominated for several Oscars and came away with a few in the 1982 ceremony for 1981's films. After almost thirty years it's still rollicking good entertainment.As for Karen Allen and Harrison Ford. Go see Indiana Jones chasing down that Crystal Skull in theaters now if you want to find out what happened with these two.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Better than Star Wars,"Yes, I said it. Raiders is a better movie than Star Wars. There are no annoying robots or aliens and the acting Harrison displays in this film far exceeds his work in Stars Wars, plus the dialog is much better. It may not be the ""grand epic"" that Star Wars is, but all in all it is a superior flick.This is a remarkable movie. The opening scene is one of the most memorable in all of film. It never slows down from there, and we never have to hear Harrison Ford say ""not me sister, I'm only in it for the money"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Echos of the Lost Cast,"The film that captured the imagination of entire generations aged rather well and is still a decent watch but some parts have rotten away like bad cheese. What still stands are the lush, romanticized depiction of the pre-WWII period, the camera-work and the music. And Karen Allen's brazen quirkiness.More obvious now than before is that Tom Selleck's stand-in, Harrison Ford, proved an unsuitable lead. He brings in a rather difficult chemistry for the film that is supposed to be a goofball, roller-coaster adventure. Ford is clunky, suffering and reluctant, bordering on depression. There is a conspicuous lack of joy about his Indiana Jones that shouldn't be there, because it's at odds with everything else in the film. His comebacks at other characters come off as angry snaps rather than comic relieves. He doesn't possess that devil-may-care attitude that would convince the viewer that his character actually likes all these adventures, nor does he exude that suave, Bondian eroticism that should sell that scene where all of his female students want to eat the good professor alive. The audience must have given him a pass simply because everybody still saw a Han Solo in him.The lack of a lead that is neither too serious to expose the silly nor too hammingly humorous to drag everything into a camp is what the whole film suffers for. It's because the plot itself treads the fine line between awesome and idiotic. It mixes top-class religious artifacts and magical powers with Nazis and harebrained schemes of world domination, cartoon action with sadistic villains and their gruesome deaths, some really terrible lines of dialog with some really good one-liners, and a bungling detective story with a truly awe-inspiring and larger-than- life finale. Without the poster face that could make you forget that this mishmash of ideas, that only George Lucas could churn out, doesn't quite hold water it's easier to be taken out of the film by some of its lowest points.What keeps it together still is the brilliant direction of Steven Spielberg. His visual style was at that fledgling time of his career pretty flamboyant, with daring but perfunctory choice of angles, camera movements and compositions, which lent itself to great pacing - moving quickly through the plot points and keeping the tension in the set-pieces with the idea that no one notices how ridiculous they are. He builds up very well towards the climactic end and the revelation of the real hero of the film: the mythical Ark. Its matter-of-fact act of self-defense is a big pay-off so few films achieve these days. It's doubtful that a conventional director, however competent, would have been able to deliver anything better than a B-schlock with the given material.Harrison Ford made a career playing gloomy characters that got stuck in unpleasant situations and just wanted to leave. He should have been nowhere near this film. Steven Spielberg is a genius for making this work at all, let alone gain a cult-status, of all things.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Steven Spielber's third masterpiece,"The Indiana Jones movies have been part of an immersive cult following that has sparked a new way of viewing adventure movies, led by the popular and acclaimed director Steven Spielberg alongside his bosom friend and mastermind behind the Indiana Jones character George. Lucas, managed to create an action movie that connects with the adult and youth audience.The simple fact of casting Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was one of the best decisions, since at that time they cast one of the most admirable and respectable people of his time, with a throbbing adrenaline rush for adventure is what has made him original. And special to harrison ford as indiana jones.Raiders of the Lost Ark was, is, and will always be the adventure movie par excellence.

"fun, but not","This is one of the films that led me, slowly but surely, to loathe the work of George Lucas.To be sure, it is not a bad film - in fact, it succeeds in generating the same kind of excitement as the B-movie/serial action films of the 1930s, the formula for which it is intended to resurrect. But it is that resurrection itself that annoys me, for two reasons.First, Although the serials of the '30s were certainly a bit of daffy fun, they were just badly made. In order to enjoy them, one has to 'dumb down' quite a bit. In the early '70s revival of these films on the college circuit, this meant taking drugs before or during viewing. Without inebriates, it means adopting a child's perspective - and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is, why insist on an expensive Hollywood production that requires the same 'dumbing down'? And do so in a manner so as to close off other, more mature approaches to the adventure film format? Secondly, the cultural references of the 1930s action B-movie were all outside of film itself - references to the political crises in Europe, to fears generated in the wake of the depression, to ennobling efforts to maintain American values against threats from within and without, to the rise of organized crime, to a developing technology no one fully understood at the time, and to increasing awareness of the strangeness of non-European cultures. A heady mix, and it's clear why Americans found the B-movie useful in sorting out and coping with so many different issues.But the cultural references in ""Raiders"" are all to movies of the 1930s. In other words, there is NO world beyond the movie screen for Mr. Lucas. Even the myth of the 'Ark of the Covenant' has more to do with DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" than it does with the Ark as described in the Bible, since it is clearly intended to work magic, which is about as much of religion as DeMille really understood. And let's not even discuss the hopelessly card-board Nazis here.This 'dumbed down' inversion of cultural reference makes ""Raiders"" feel claustrophobic and regressive more than any other film mining the same ore I can think of. To be sure, Spielberg gives the film a professional gloss and a sense of action Lucas' other films lack. And both Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are truly delightful to watch.So the film is certainly fun to watch - but it doesn't inspire any greater respect for writer-producer Lucas, one of the true con-men of modern cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
a movie that has it all.,"Some say that the last crusade is the best of this saga but I beg to differ. This is a truly memorable piece of cinema and also in my opinion, 1 of the greatest films ever made.Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones who is a part time teacher in archeology and a full time hunter of historical treasures and is presented by his colleagues a search like nothing he has ever gone after. The Ark of the covenant but he must contend with Adolph Hitlers men and a Frenchman who is as ruthless and cold blooded as Hitler himself but the question is. What menacing power does the Ark behold and how dangerous is it to anyone who dares to open it. This was and still is 1 of my all time favouritesThis is a movie to be remembered that has all the elements and originality of a truly great movie. It has it all if you haven't seen it.

A timeless classic - best action adventure ever made,"A warning to those who really enjoy John Wick/Marvel/the Fast-movies, or almost any other modern action blockbuster: 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is made back when they relied on practical effects and stunts. And where story mattered. Like other action movie classics (Die Hard, Terminator 2 etc) the action supports the story, not vice versa. So this 1981 movie doesn't have wall-to-wall action. It's not mostly shot in front of a green screen, the characters do not defy gravity and there is no multiverse to be had here. Just real people doing real things in real locations.If this sounds boring to you, please move on.

All The Right Moves,"A globe-trotting American archaeologist travels to Egypt in search of the ancient Ark of the Covenant, in this adventure epic from director Steven Spielberg. It's a big-budget popcorn flick aimed mostly at kids. There's lots of heavy-duty action as our hero, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), makes all the right moves to escape dreaded Nazis, a bed of snakes, knife-wielding Egyptians, fiery explosions, poison food, human skeletons, bullets, airplane propeller blades, and assorted other dangers. Since there's nothing subtle about the story or the characters, and since the action plot zips along at the speed of light, viewers need not engage in any thinking.With Jones as a surrogate for American virtuousness, ""foreigners"" in this film seem inept and villainous for the most part, a politically correct view for the era in which the film was made. American stereotypes aside, non-Americans are portrayed in the film mostly as clutter, film props for our hero to knock over.It's all a bit much, a bit over-the-top. Not only is the story not believable, the story's theme is rather condescending. I despised the background music, annoyingly loud and manipulative. Acting is largely irrelevant, not surprising, given the film's genre.In its defense, there are some good visual images. For example, I liked the scene of Jones, wearing his trademark hat, in silhouette, on a hill, back-lit by an orange sun. The film's color cinematography probably is its best element.Otherwise, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is just one more in a long series of ""action"" movies for kids to drool over, a two hour cinematic ... cartoon. The script concept is silly; the characters are poorly defined; the plot is ridiculous; the score is annoying; and the American hero theme is very irritating.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

That being said, the relentless pace of the thing gives it this breakneck bonkers energy which feels somehow timeless. What isn't timeless is some of the content and I recognise the context for Marion and the portrayal of the Egyptian characters but you certainly wouldn't do either the same way now. Seeing this functional and fun foundational artefact again in new light made me reflect on the effectiveness of second-third and even fourth-hand nostalgia.

Classic film making at its best.,"The summer of 1981 was not a memorable season save for one thing; this outstanding movie. Following in the footsteps of classic serial's that used to run in movie houses, combined with the finest film making techniques utilized in epics and dramatic classics through out the era of film making, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is more than just an homage to film's of yesteryear viewed by youngsters in movie houses across America. It is the reinvention of the classic adventure.Here we see massive and delicately crafted sets and locations. We see marquis players mixed with solid character actors. We see old fashioned cinematography coupled with effects shots to bring this high adventure film to light. There's action, there's romance, there's intrigue, there's good verse evil, it's a period piece, it's got comedy, it's even got Nazis--classic bad guys from the golden age of Hollywood.The world renowned Stanford based archaeologist Doctor Henry Jones is consulted and contracted by the US Army's Office of Strategic Services to search for a relic that Hitler believes will help him conquer the world. We're there with and his friends as he grapples and races against Axis to obtain a supernatural artifact from the time just before the Roman Empire. The national socialist regime in Germany believes such a find will help win the war.This is my favorite Indiana Jones film simply because nearly everything you see in it is real, and the acting just below over the top, while at the same time being both energetic and detached to bring us a classic adventure film. There are real convincing characters mixed in with caricatures. It's a fine combination of film making styles; a classic adventure style mixed in with a near comic book style, mixed in with classic epic film making techniques. The cost was high, but the payoff was worth it. Appropriate lenses for the right shots, truly giving us the right visual feel for the film. Truly outstanding work here in terms of bringing all technical and creative story elements together. You can rarely find a match for it in the same genre.It is a bit over the top here and there, but overall, when you sum up the scenes and the entire story and visual experience, it is a masterpiece. You can see that a lot of money was put into this project, and it shows on screen; i.e. lots of tender loving care for a classic film that mimics appropriately her ""sister ships"", so to speak.Technical notes; the one thing that's bothered me about this film are the squibs for the gunfights. Particularly the full automatic fire as they were mis-timed. There's a miniature effect's sequence during the chase that's a little ho-hum. I think we the audience were still used to real cars being driven remotely off cliffs, then set ablaze or to explode while in mid flight (classic Hollywood). The backers paid extra for thousands of extras, and that's a major plus, giving the film authenticity and weight. Also, the stunts are real. Whether it's Nazi soldiers on a truck, or Harrison Ford in a pontoon aqua bi-plane, a chase through suburban Cairo or an actual U-boat as it squares off with a merchant on the high seas. Save for two or three effects' sequences, all of it is real.That, verse the last installment where the commies were the villain of the day, and nearly every shot was digitally rigged in some way. The unspoken agreement between film maker and audience member was broken by not showing a heightened reality that is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but a CGI experience that is ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". This is the lesson for the film makers. But, that's another film for another review.The reactions from the actors are real in a story that is far fetched. The places and dressing of everything in the shot, as well as the shot itself, sells us the story and imagery we view on the screen. Marry some first class music to it, scored by the inestimable John Williams, and you have yourself one incredible film.A terrific film with high ideals and themes, set amidst a tumultuous time in European and world history.Definitely one not to miss.Enjoy!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best action movie ever?,"It's very possible. It's definitely the best Indiana Jones movie that's been made. This movie actually runs on a path similar to a heart-rate monitor, where there are sudden blips of action interspersed in periods of relative calm. This is a very effective way of running this genre of film, because the sudden action creates a certain tension. There is the possibility of something big lingering. This style has become more and more common place recently, but was revolutionary at the time. In all the years since this style became popular, maybe even revolutionized by Raiders, the Lost Arc still is one of the most effective users of this pacing. Honestly, is there anyone who doesn't think that scene in the cave or that scene with Harrison Ford under the truck among the best action sequences of all time?The other element that this movie has that so many action movies somehow forgot to include recently is a plot. This genre has recently become a joke, with the extent of the stories going only so far as to allow the maximum amount of explosions and assorted other pieces of eye candy. Raiders of the Lost Arc doesn't include as many explosions (although there are some) as many other films. There is a lot more emphasis on human stunts on feats of inhuman athleticism.As far as the obligatory love interest for Indiana, Marion Ravenwood is easily my favorite. She's very believable emotionally and almost reminds me of a non-Italian Mona Lisa Vito in My Cousin Vinny. At least in the respect that her emotions toward Indiana fluctuate between intense anger and almost swooning. But not quite, because Marion is one tough chick.And Harrison Ford much improves anything he touches (although 8I can't speak for his new Extraordinary Measures, which I have no interest in seeing. Brandon Fraser generally ruins everything he touches. But that's a tangent for another time.) Anyway, Ford is fantastic, perhaps the best action movie hero of all time. Not only is he a wonderfully flawed relateable character, he can also be brutal. I guess that just goes with the profession. Or maybe not. Indy is one glorified archaeologist.

The greatest adventure movie ever made,"There is a certain place and time that the perfect adventure movie could be made, and that is during the 1980s, when the nostalgia for the adventure films of the 1930s and the grandeur of the golden age of Hollywood could be balanced, around a decade before practical effects would be replaced largely by years of what is, in retrospect, a CGI hellscape that has not aged well. I understand the irony in speaking of nostalgia driving this film while ranting about my own nostalgic look back, but I don't mean it as an insult; the movie would not exist without it. And if the perfect pieces had not been set in place for what is, without a doubt, the greatest adventure movie of all time (and probably the greatest blockbuster), perhaps it would not still be watched and remembered with the fondness that it is, the nostalgia by itself claiming both the continued admiration for this movie and an ill-received third sequel decades later (and more to come).While it kicked off the Indiana Jones franchise, it should be noted that this isn't an 'Indiana Jones' movie; the lack of our protagonists namesake in the title being the main giveaway. Much like Star Wars coming out in 1977 lacking ""Episode IV"" as later additions would add, there was no guarantee that a cultural phenomenon would be born from this movie. Indiana Jones differs from the likes of Star Wars however; in many ways it has aged better. Maybe because we have not been suffocated with it in the way that we have with these other franchises. The continuity has to be tied to Dr Jones, which has saved us from 'Indiana Jones 9', and thank god for that. And there is Raiders, the film that would not be topped despite the efforts of subsequent films in its franchise, which could be an argument as to why many others are extended until the beaten horse no longer breathes - that there is hope of topping what is considered the best.I love this movie.

Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting,"I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Classic Film.,"Review:
'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg.
When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime.
It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time.
The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in.
It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience.
Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.

This guy's the HERO???????,"Has anyone noticed what an incompetent bungler dearest Indy is? How EVERY TIME he comes up against Belloq he LOSES whatever he has--statues, girls, the Ark itself? As Belloq puts it at the beginning (approximately), ""Once again we see that there is nothing you can recover that I cannot take from you."" And he's absolutely correct--right up to the Ark TWICE!! It happens EVERY TIME!! The only thing Indy manages to do right is find the Ark itself--and Belloq promptly grabs it away, because gee, guess what? They're digging on a knoll against the setting sun right next to the Nazis' dig, and making no secret of it. Till finally at the end God Himself has to save the day. Good thing for Indy (and the rest of us I guess) He's on the side of the democracies. Which opens all sorts of theological questions and problems I won't touch. Mind you, Indy can work miracles too--he can ride a submarine thousands of miles across the ocean without drowning, or even getting wet. AND keep the Nazis cooped up inside the whole time (a very good thing since there's no place to hide on the sub's hull). To be fair to the movie, Indy is such a lovable lug (and it was so nice to see that Ford was finally learning to act) that only the sub ride bothered me initially. To fully grasp IJ's incompetence I had to see ""Raiders"" several times. Which I did, but that only shows I have a weakness for roller coasters and gratuitously fx-heavy endings, however illogical. Mea culpa.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"All but pillaged over the years as the model blockbuster; here and now, the film neatly withstanding time as a giddy excursion into action/adventure filmmaking.","Steven Spielberg has always been the sort of director whom, when provided with a 'log-line' or one sentence premise, has been able to use his ability to just grab the idea by the scruff of its neck and run with it. A bunch of people on an isolated tropical island populated by dinosaurs eventually running amok is given a radical overhaul and transformed into something more exciting and more substantial than it has any right to be; a man drives a car over a long distance across the barren states of the U.S.A., but is terrorised by a crazed truck driver becomes something quite special; a cynical parent of two young children faces the fight of his and his family's life when blood thirsty creatures invade Earth and he must guide them to some sort of safety. Raiders of the Lost Ark, along with the likes of the above in Jurassic Park and Duel among others, feeds off Spielberg in this mood and on this form; a feature that comes complete with dastardly villains trying to end the world; unadulterated heroes; feisty sidekicks; love interests; rounded, jolly foreign supporting acts of a differing ethnicity to that of the lead's as well as the Nazis as the bad guys.Following the adventures of one of the best loved protagonists in film history, Raiders begins deep in the jungles of South America sometime in the 1930s; the music ominous, a group of men trudging on to what appears to be the laughter of the wildlife as they undertake a march many have previously attempted, but never completed. One of the men, following in a pack behind that of Harrison Ford's lead Indiana Jones, draws a gun; but our man is whip-smart in a literal sense to the revelation, and manages to hear; react; work his skill with the bull-whip he possesses and then defuse the situation without ever having to use grosser means of violence. We can tell Jones knows his stuff, or does his research; he treats a temple ""no one has ever come out from alive"" as if he had been there before and done what he's about to do a dozen times. He ventures in, his accomplice the picture of fear contrasting Jones' own state, and beats the system; swiping the prize and getting back out again – in the process avoiding a boulder who's trigger system has done well to survive all these centuries of people not making it this far.There is something indescribably endearing about a man capable of the above, and yet by day, is a stuttering; glasses-wearing academic whom stammers around wielding arrays of scrolls he struggles to carry properly; in turn, knowing an awful lot about issues and subjects of an archaeological nature most would dismiss as somewhat nerdy. Jones is called upon by the American government to come into contact with a Biblical artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, a mission laid out in no uncertain terms as being highly dangerous and mostly with the threat of the Nazi party spreading their wings into North Africa to try and find it for their own means. As a Macguffin, Spielberg does his utmost to effectively render the thing near enough to a character all by itself; a dangerous, looming character with what appears to be its own mind and priorities as these pesky early-to-mid twentieth century human-beings toy with it; transport it; fight for it but essentially wake it from its rest. An early revealing of the object in sketch form, lying there on a text book page radiating light and power, acts as an unnerving envisaging of what the thing is capable of. Jones initially rejects the proclaimed ""power"" that the Ark has, citing it as something in the region of ""occult mumbo-jumbo"", and therein that statement lies a refreshing little transition for Jones to undergo as he learns of its true power and of certain people's dedication towards it.Working with the Nazis is a French archaeologist named René Belloq (Freeman); an 'Id' to Jones' superego: a well dressed and far more formal man to Jones' grizzled demeanour and whose morals are equally spread eagle on the spectrum. Along for the ride, after an excursion in the snowy barren nothingness of Nepal, Jones enlists Marion Ravenwood (Allen), whom he shares a botched romantic history. Ravenwood is a woman capable of holding her own; the sense of the film's overly guilty disposition rife in its having her in the midst of a drinking contest when we first see her, before placing her at the forefront of a sober; competent conversation with that of another human-being minutes later. Ford and Allen bounce off one another to varying degrees of success, their romance of old constantly hovering in the background as we observe the man's shot at redeeming himself to her as a man and not a runaway – the film maintaining her hard bodied edge throughout proceedings without ever sagging to levels of objectification.There is an awful lot to enjoy in Raiders with nary a lot to necessarily get agitated about; the film is flat out adventure from the point of the Ark's uncovering, culminating in an eerie finale during which the culmination of several things explode at once in a dizzying moment of terror and thrills. The film is mostly an array of set pieces and stunts, but there is a grounded sense about the chase and adventure. We do not entrust Jones to be infallible; when he is shot, we grimace; when he takes a beating and bleeds, we observe him stumble his way back up and sense injury. In spite of its nature, the film never threatens to descend into that of anything below taut and engaging; rather, it is mostly a project filling us with a joyous feeling - lovingly constructed by a man out to do what he enjoys most, in making something exuberant that his audience can get stuck into.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Old-School Bonanza,"In Hollywood, you're only as good as your latest movie. A fact that in the early eighties was crystal clear to Steven Spielberg. His most recent picture was the World War II comedy ""1941"". A fiasco both at the box office and among critics. Suddenly, the major film companies weren't that interested in Spielberg's new projects any longer.Enter George Lucas. The director had just made ""Star Wars"", a phenomenal, worldwide success. That's why the management at Paramount listened when Lucas suggested that his pal Steven Spielberg could direct a new film he had written. A loving homage to the old B-movies that he had grown up with. George Lucas even had a title for the piece. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", was his suggestion.Steven Spielberg understood how important it was to get the right man to play the lead. The Indiana Jones part. He thought he'd found his guy in Tom Selleck, but unfortunately the actor couldn't get time off from his ""Magnum PI"" TV show. So, with only weeks left until production start, a relatively unproven Harrison Ford was hired.In retrospect, Tom Selleck must have been thankful that he didn't get the part. The making of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was highly exhausting, with long takes in inhospitable locations. The desert scenes, for instance, were shot in Tunisia, where the entire film crew suffered from dysentery from the local food. Spielberg described this later as one of the worst filming experiences of his entire career.In the summer of 1981, the American film industry was in a precarious position. As a result of sharply rising production costs and declining cinema audiences' profits were down. But luckily, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" changed all that. Steven Spielberg's cinematic juggernaut became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. The director behind the debacle ""1941"" was on his way to super-stardom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The First BBB Movie,"As in ""Big Budget B"" Movie, the sort of visually spectacular, splendidly orchestrated live-action cartoon that Lucas & Spielberg pioneered separately and, on this occasion, together. In 1936 heartthrob college professor & graverobbing mercenary Indiana Jones (Ford, perhaps by way of Harold Robbins & Steve McQueen) is hired by the US Army to find & loot the original Hebrew Ark of the Covenant from its presumed hiding place in a lost Egyptian city before Hitler's SS/Gestapo/Afrika Korps/Kriegsmarine/Luftwaffe/Abwehr can get it. To do this he must first procure a critical icon from a girlfriend (Allen) that he dumped and who is now running Kathmandu's answer to Rick's Cafe Americain (there's no piano, but the wind whistles most soulfully). A two-minute reverse ""Casablanca"" interlude ends with another plot twist and plenty of enjoyable, stunning mayhem. Characters come & go in no particular order, including nebbish professor Brody (Elliott), Egyptian laborer Sallah (Rhys-Davies, who could give any Tonto or Dr. Watson a run for his money), tramp sea captain Katanga (Harris), rival mercenary Belloq (Freeman, who eventually comes across as French) and cartoonishly evil Nazis (Lacey, Kahler & Higgins, all perfectly cast). Ford holds the film together with a quintessentially American mix of determination, frustration, weariness & wonder. Allen brings a coarse feminism to the role of damsel tied to a set of railroad tracks. The film fails because its convoluted plot can never find even the tiniest ground in common sense, much less reality, with plot holes large enough for whole solar systems to nest comfortably. The largest of many large, of course, is that the hero's job is to rob other peoples of their cultural treasures and sell them for money. In a scene that desperately needed to be cut, Belloq actually points this out to Jones. Other giant leaps include Hitler's obsession with the occult (nonexistent), Germany's dominance in Egypt and the Mediterranean (never happened) and enough Biblical heresies to make Harry Potter look like the Pope. The charm of ""Lost Horizons"" (Jones flies over the same mountains at about the same time, but Shangri-La prefers Ronald Colman) and even ""King Solomon's Mines"" is replaced here by breathtaking action punctuated by Groucho-esq one-liners (""I'm making this up as I go along"") and the obligatory juvenile, Spielberg gross-out scenes (Tarantino slices off body parts, Spielberg likes snakes, bugs & sharks). Still, Lucas & Spielberg are the masters of effective excess and ""Raiders"" is best enjoyed as a series of cartoon or ""Lone Ranger"" or ""Perils of Pauline"" adventures (the opening sequence is supposedly inspired by a Disney Ducks cartoon, anyway). Williams's music is as wonderful as any he's done and perhaps the best ever in an action film. The success of the franchise assured, here are some ideas for sequels: ""Raiders of the Declaration of Independence,"" ""Indiana Jones & George Washington's False Teeth,"" and ""The Hunt for Lenin's Embalmed Remains.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Historically Adventurous,"This movie is beyond well casted. When you just see Harrison Ford in costume, you can already tell this definitive embodiment of the character. The suits are very retro and reminiscent of old noir movies. The sets are well constructed and bring the mythology of Egyptian culture to life.

This would usually not be a great idea for a character, but it works perfectly in here. The difference between Indiana Jones and any self-insertion character, is that, actually, even if i don't look for self-insertion, is a very fun character. He has personality, and even if it doesn't have flaws, at least is entertaining to watch. The film is also great generating suspense, constructing the mystery of the lost ark, and at the end, giving a very satisfying conclusion. Great story, great action, simply great.

One of My All Time Favorites!,"Steven Spielberg is back, better than ever! After the dismal failure that was 1941, the acclaimed director teamed up with George Lucas, coming off his Star Wars fame to create one of the most memorable heroes of all time. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie from 1981 and is in my top 20 films of all time. This movie gives everything you could ask for. Strong, memorable characters, witty dialogue, fantastic set pieces, exotic locations, great action, and a John Williams musical theme you could never forget. Indiana Jones is my favorite fictional hero and this movie is the example why I believe that.This movie has fascinating origins. George Lucas was writing this movie the same time he came up with the idea for Star Wars. He decided to pursue his space adventure instead to great success. In 1978, while on vacation in Hawaii, he ran into Steven Spielberg, who was coming off Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg expressed his idea of creating a James Bond movie. Lucas showed him his character, which was named Indiana Smith at first, thus creating a collaboration which would lead to this movie and two sequels and a prequel. The film also takes influence from the works of Edgar Burroughs Rice, 1930's serials, and a 1950's comic about a globe-trotting duck named Scrooge McDuck.This movie really has it all. With Spielberg and Lucas at the head, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan joined the project to help polish the script. Together they created memorable heroes in Indiana Jones, an archaeology professor who travels the world to protect or find ancient artifacts and his former girlfriend Marion who is strong female character who is able to protect herself. For villains, we have the horrible Nazis, drunken Sherpas, Frenchmen making alliances with the Nazis, and Jones's favorite animal, snakes! He hates snakes! For locations: we have the sands of Egypt, abandoned submarine bases, the jungles of Peru, the mountains of Tibet, and so forth. If you want a travelling experience from your own living room, look no further than this movie.I was impressed with the plot. The plot is simple and really is a framework for all the impressive action scenes and stunts there are. But in the end, everything is coherent and makes plenty sense. It is the year 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) learns from his good friend, Brody (Denholm Elliot) that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, a golden casket that was used to house the Ten Commandments. It has also been known that this arc is able to give power to those who wield it. Jones's mission? To reach the Ark before the Nazis do. He goes to Tibet to pick up Marion (Karen Allen) who has a medallion that has a secret to the location of the Ark. Together, they head to that location where they will try to beat the Nazis-and scheming Frenchmen at their own game.The performances are all excellent. What is funny that when Spielberg/Lucas did the casting, Spielberg wanted Harrison Ford from the get-go, but Lucas was against his casting because he did not want Ford to be is ""Bobby De Niro"" which is in reference to Martin Scorsese always casting Robert De Niro in his films. In retrospect, I do not think anyone could have pulled this role off like Harrison Ford did. Ford was brilliant and created a memorable character with his iconic performance. He is kind and intelligent character, but he can be ruthless at times. However, he is charming. Charm may be the one word that can describe Indiana Jones. I really dug Karen Allen's performance. A strong-willed character with the ability to protect herself. I liked the villainous performances from the slimy Nazis. Paul Freeman as Dr. Rene Belloq as the scheming Frenchman who happens to be Jones's rival, and Ronald Lacey as the incredibly slimy Nazi, Toht.Even in today's cinematic world, the visual effects and the action sequences stand out. I honestly cannot say what I liked the most since everything was so well-done! The opening sequence set forth what to expect in this movie. That boulder chasing Jones is an amazing sequence. That chase scene is great as well, and it makes good use of an old, classic joke! Another sequence that stood out to me is when Jones and Marion are holding on to dear life in the pit of snakes. That was a scene that let you feel real horror. And don't get me started on the face-melting sequences! I am still in awe what the special effects team did with this film.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that spawned a franchise that is still going strong today. Adventure stories with some history mixed in are my kind of stories. I like travelling to these exotic locations through these characters. This film has a unique balance of comedy, action, stunts, and adventure. When Nazis are your villains, this is how they should be used. As slimy creatures that can get their butts handed to them by Indiana Jones.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A great blockbuster,"In 1975, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman came up with the concept of a film that would pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 40's like ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" or ""Dick Tracy"" - you know, the one's were they'd always end in a cliffhanger? However, this idea was put on hold so that Lucas could concentrate on ""Star Wars"" in 1977. After the surprise success of that film, Lucas then embarked on the proposal and enlisted the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay and gave his friend Steven Spielberg the chance to direct and prove the studio bosses wrong after the star-studded, monumental failure of his World War II comedy ""1941"", a couple of years previously. This meeting of minds resulted in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has since became one of cinema's most revered and iconic film's. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a renowned archaeologist who is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant - a chest the Hebrews carried around containing the Ten Commandments. Indy is not the only one after the Ark, though, as he soon crosses paths with Hitler's Nazi's, also intent in getting their hands on the artifact. Classic Adventure film of the very highest caliber. In fact, it's hard to argue that this isn't the one to beat in terms of sheer indulgence and escapist entertainment. I grew up with Indiana Jones and there are very few characters or films who have had such a direct or major influence on my love for the cinematic art-form. It's difficult to find the words for Raiders that haven't already been said. Quite simply, it's a true action spectacle that's unparalleled and stands as one of Steven Spielberg's finest moments. He's a director that's, rightly, regarded as one of Hollywood finest filmmakers and you don't have to look much further than this film to see why. With one hair raising set-piece after another, Spielberg keeps the action relentless and fully realizes a romanticize pastiche of the aforementioned serials' clichÃ©d plot elements and devices. Of course, what aides immeasurably in bringing it all together, is a perfectly committed and physical performance from the leading man. Contrary to popular belief, Harrison Ford was the first choice for Indy. Well... it was in Spielberg's eyes, anyway. It was Lucas who wanted to cast someone else as he wanted to create a little distance from Ford having already worked with him on ""American Graffiti"" and ""Star Wars"" and as common knowledge would have it, Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Unfortunately for him, though, he was already committed to the television series ""Magnum P.I."" which resulted in Ford securing, what would become, his signature role. I think it's fair to say that Ford has never exactly been praised for his acting range. Sure, he's certainly able to deliver some wonderful work; his powerful turn in ""The Mosquito Coast"" and his Oscar nominated performance in ""Witness"" are proof of this but his portrayal of Indiana Jones is absolutely spot on. He captures the requisite charm, wit and smarts to win you over. He exaggerates his facial expressions to the point of parody and completely sweeps the audience up in his heroic adventures. Even though he's the hero of the story, Ford never let's you think for a second that he's infallible or indestructible. Every scrape, punch or altercation still feels like it could be Indy's last and that's a fabulous achievement when you pretty much get the gist of the film's formula or structure. Considered one of the best films ever made and, to this day, remains one of the highest grossing. It went on to win four Academy Awards out of nine nominations and these accolades alone speak for themselves. I, for one, couldn't argue with any of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Brilliant film making from a cinematic genius,"Spielberg has hit some highs in his career but i feel Raiders sums up his film making talents best.Its a rollicking adventure that has been imitated but never equalled.Im sceptical as to whether The Crystal Skull will live up to the hype but one things for sure, Raiders will endure for years to come as a classic of modern American cinema.A work colleague of mine recently put it to me that he felt it was a dated, badly edited film,my jaw dropped,was he looking at the same film as me?Such is my love for Raiders,i had to reconsider our friendship for a brief moment before agreeing to disagree.Raiders just leaps off the screen, Harrison Ford is a legend and delivers a great film performance as Indy.An all time great. 10/10 only because i cant give it 11.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"It might be great for the fans, but not for me!","Not being a great fan of Hollywood Adventure/Action movies I never cared too much about Indiana Jones trilogy. However, with the recent release of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" I thought about give it a chance. I had in my mind to watch the trilogy in a row and then go to the theater watch the new film. But after seeing this ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" I changed my mind! It's not really my type of movie! I think it really is a classic and a top film for the fans of the genre, but not for me! I just don't appreciate this kind of cinema. Period.

Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Originally conceived by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.Raiders of the Lost Ark took shape once Steven Spielberg came on board as director. The visual effects were top notch and the humour level went up by several beats.He revitalised a concept that was meant to be a pastiche of the 1930s adventure serials.Spielberg lucked out by getting Harrison Ford as the lead. Sorry Tom Selleck, but maybe Magnum was your thing.Ford plays the tough no nonsense but snake fearing archaeologist/grave robber (delete as appropriate) Indiana Jones. Mild and meek college professor by day. Adventurer during his holidays.The US government has hired Jones to find the legendary Ark of the Covenant. It is going to be a race against the Nazis who have hired the mercenary Frenchman Dr Belloq (Paul Freeman) to get to it first.It is a globe trotting race as Jones teams up with old flame Marian Ravenswood (Karen Allen) who has vital information.There is a nice scene early on, where Indiana Jones gives a key plot point to the government agents. That is then mirrored in the climax. It is something that has been copied since in other movies.Both Spielberg and Lucas have never managed to top the first Indiana Jones movie. It is a rollicking adventure yarn with scares and thrills. One of the best movies of the 1980s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"No more no less an eighties serial, and the best ever.","It is said that Steven Spielberg was heavily influenced by the serials of the golden era, the thirties and forties, produced for the best of them, by Republic Pictures studios and directed by the likes of Bill Witney and John English or Spencer Gordon Bennett, with the great Yakima Kanutt as the master stunt scenes, more outstanding one than the other. And when I watch this film, the best of Spielberg - concerning the.""leisure"" part of Spielberg's filmography - and among the best features in the movie history, I can't prevent myself to admit that it is a serial from the eighties. Even nearly forty years after discovering it, I am still amazed, which is not the case for many movies from the eighties, films that I discovered in my early adult life and that don't belong to my childhood - another life for me, as many people. When you are a child, movies are not seen the same way as when you find them when you are an adult.

Geeky Randy's summary,"The first installment into the Indiana Jones Series, which follows the archaeologist/adventurer to Nepal and Egypt for the search of biblical artifact The Ark of the Covenant. Groundbreaking picture; a roller coaster ride of a movie, with premium action sequences—but it fails to give the viewer any room to breathe. Ford is absolutely wonderful and irreplaceable as Dr. Jones, but neither Allen or her character Marion Ravenwood can earn the same keep as the main character. While the film succeeds in fun and thrilling entertainment, there's no excuse for the action in your climatic sequence to be far more inferior than the nail-biting close-calls that preceded it. Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies are SO underused.**½ (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Digging In The Dirt,"Well, we all know that this is the greatest of the four so far. What an excellent story and an introduction to archeology that my generation will never forget. Tomb Raider will have had the same effect on the next generation, while Time Team simply passed us all by.There's no way I can review this film without calling it epic. Not in the traditional overly long film about Jesus or a Great War sense, but in the fact that it just gives so much to the audience.I must have seen it twenty times at least, it's generally a tradition to watch them all starting on Boxing Day. I'm a bit late this year, but I still forget elements about this one, because there is just so much squeezed in, without compromising on the story or the characters.Indy is brilliant, the typical hero. Mild mannered and a bit of a clueless teacher during term time whilst a whip cracking archeological genius on his days off. Harrison is superb in this role, we know from 'Star Wars' (1977) that he plays the scoundrel well and his roguish charm isn't lost here either.Marion is certainly the least annoying of his female companions. She is loyal despite their history and there's far less screaming than the blonde in the next one!Marcus Brody is played so very well by Denholm Elliot and I love it later on when we get to see more of his character in the third instalment.Jonathan Rhys-Davies is great as Sallah too. He has a real presence on film and once again his role gets further explored in 'The Last Crusade' (1989).The other members of the cast all do a great job as well. I think it's brilliant that Pat Roach gets to appear in all of the first three films and although only a small part in each, he gives his best every time.The story is excellent, a real journey across the map to chase treasure by plane, car and boat. Which child of the 80's wouldn't find it exciting to watch this film? I know other generations that enjoy it too - older and younger.The action is new and fresh and you really route for Jones as he suffers the odd setback here and there, but wins out in the end.I still can't find the C-3PO and R2-D2 references in the hieroglyphs, I think you'd have to watch it frame by frame to find them and I just don't have that time to spare.It's quality is obvious as it has been parodied everywhere from 'Family Guy' and 'The Simpsons' to a 'Terry's Chocolate Orange' advert.I'm not looking forward to the next film ('Temple Of Doom' (1984)) as much. It is the weakest of the four (Yes, I like 'The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull' (2008)), but temple does hold a certain nostalgia about it.I think I could watch every film ever made in the next 40 years and still include 'Raiders' in my top 100.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"""I don't know...I'm making this up as I go.""","It's a testament to the entertainment value of this adventure classic that its approximate one hour and 56 minute run time just flies by. Whether one is revisiting it or experiencing it for the first time, it flows along extremely well, maintaining a high level of excitement and populating its diverting story with a rich array of memorable characters. Today it remains a career highpoint for its filmmakers and much of its cast.Concocted by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (with official story credit going to Lucas and Philip Kaufman), and scripted by Lawrence Kasdan, it takes its inspiration from the movie serials of decades past, and goes them one better in terms of its thrills and chills. Harrison Ford stars as 1930s archaeologist / professor / adventurer ""Indiana"" Jones, to whom we're introduced in a marvellous opening set piece taking place in the Peruvian jungle. He ends up hired by the American government to locate and obtain the mystical Ark of the Covenant before Adolf Hitler and his minions can get their slimy hands on it.He's accompanied by a wonderfully feisty leading lady, Marion Ravenwood, played to perfection by the appealing Karen Allen. Among Indy's friends are museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Egyptian digger Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), and among the enjoyably devilish bad guys are charming rogue Belloq (Paul Freeman), a ruthless rival archaeologist, a cold blooded Nazi officer, Dietrich (Wolf Kahler), and an incredibly creepy interrogator, Toht (Ronald Lacey). It's also fun to see a young Alfred Molina, in his breakthrough film role, as the Peruvian guide in that opening sequence.Even if the viewer is thoroughly familiar with the film by now, there's still lots of enjoyment to be had in viewing the assorted iconic scenes: Indy pursued by a runaway boulder, the confrontation in the Nepal bar, the chases through the streets of Cairo, the fight near the Nazi plane, one of the best vehicle chases to be seen in cinema, and that final scene where the power of the Ark is unleashed. There are certainly macabre moments to be found throughout, but this merely adds to the sense of danger and the sense of fun constantly being created by Spielberg and associates. The efforts of a first rate crew - production designer Norman Reynolds, art director Leslie Dilley, cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, etc. - are supplemented by eye popping special effects supervised by Richard Edlund, nifty makeup effects by Chris Walas, and of course that hummable rousing theme music by John Williams that can stay in your head long after the film is over.Overall there's plenty of pizazz and humour in the presentation that continues to make this top notch escapism. This was a favourite of this viewer as a child and it's lost none of its appeal over the years.Followed by a prequel, two sequels, and the 'Young Indiana Jones' TV series.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Indiana Jones the greatest adventure hero of all time take that Mr Bond!,Raiders of the Lost Ark the greatest adventure movie of all time nothing tops it nothing! Harrison Ford stars as the bull whip loving archaeologist and Karen Allen is his longtime girlfriend Marion Ravenwood!. They are the greatest on screen couple in the history of film! The story is simple but fun and really entertaining once the adventure gets going but you need the backstory first before the adventure can begin and it is a supernatural force not something to be taken lightly but it is a force of supernatural power that can control everything in your grasp! The direction of this heart stopping movie is phenomenal and something as I said earlier will never be bettered! The Master of film really needed a miracle after the failure of 1941 and boy did he make a adventure classic he really did! I want to talk about John Williams's Theme which is so iconic you can hum it straight away I mean I know every part of the theme every single section of the music I can follow the film along and notice every thrilling trumpet solo and every beat and action the music provides just every section of that unforgettable theme is memorable even the love theme of Marion and Indy's relationship is so perfect! There are some special scenes that are perfect for studying film and it's needs to entertain the fist fight the truck chase are perfect examples of this! John's music scores both of those scenes and all the action scenes the basket game and the Arab swordsman who Indy shoots in the film's best moment of comedy are all scored beautifully and perfectly! Every time the theme is played you know Indy is doing something heroic or heart stopping because you associate the theme with Indy and the adventure and every time the music does not play it means Indy is not on the screen it could be Marion or the Germans that is so important to the film and impossible to replicate in an action film! Just a outstanding action film perfect for kids and adults too it brings out the child in all of us!,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good movie, but not remarkable","I had good time watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I wasn't blown away. The movie had a simple, but great plot. It started off strong with the action-packed opening, and this action sustained throughout the whole movie. This abundence of dramatic scenes was very entertaining to watch. However, I was burnt out with this action by the end, and the movie lost my interest.
I was impressed by the dissonant, but fitting soundtrack. This supported the action scenes, and created a more detailed fictional world. The cinematography was beautiful aswell, which combined with the soundtrack made a very enjoyable audiovisual experience.

Raiders of the Lost Ark- Action At Its Absolute Best ****,"Superbly outstanding film. It has it all.

Harrison Ford, as archeology professor, Dr. Indiana Jones is rather dull as he lectures the class. Go know that even though the first scene is action-packed, there will be plenty of action as Jones as lover played by Karen Allen, attempt to dupe and run from the Nazis all the way.

A talented directo in a mediocre movie,"Technically valuable with a great Spielberg. Really hard to film action/chase scenes, plus localizations instead of modern CGI. And all of that is nice and good, but it doesn't compensate for a really thin story, simplistic characters, and the impossibly bigger amount of really stupid ""Three Stogies"" kind of jokes that irritates me to no end. Cartooney screams appear out of nowhere to force a laugh into the 80's middle class family type. It's annoying and dumb. When they actually write the jokes, they are funny (not more than 5 the entire movie).Anyways. Boring long scenes for a thin plot that is, in the end, just an excuse for the action sequences. Terrible characters (Although Allen is great) and annoying childish crap all around. I expect better for the sequel.""Irritante. Talento puro de Spielberg Pero sencillamente no puedo. Observo la dificultad y calidad de lo logrado técnicamente en las escenas de aventura y acción, que son muchas y muy variadas. Observo el valor de grabar en distintas localizaciones en lugar del moderno actual CGI.Pero tampoco puedo dejar de observar lo inundada que está la película de chistes sacados de """"Los Tres Chiflados"""". Es casi insultante la cantidad de idioteces que suceden con tal de sacar una sonrisa a la familia tipo de los años 80. No puedo. No lo soporto. Cada vez que se oye un grito exagerado y caricaturesco cuando un villano vuela por los aires a punto de morir, me saca absolutamente de la película.La aventura en sí y su trama, es lineal, simple y aceptable. Funcional más que otra cosa. La producción y dirección, excelente. Karen Allen no sólo es hermosa sino que inyecta una energía impresionante en cada una de sus escenas.

Break Through Adventure of all time.,"Like the original Star Wars, Raiders of the lost Ark, knocked everybody for a loop. And justifiably so.It's only one of a handful of movies that surely should receive more than 10 stars, and for a variety of reasons:Other than the mystery of the ark and what transpires with it at the end, The rest of the movie is all 'real world' adventure. This bears mention because this movie achieves such continuously high level of awe-inspiring adventure and excitement WITHOUT the use of any real special effects. That's hard to do! The creativity of the action scenes is remarkable. And it's crazy yet relatable. E.g.; Indy underneath the truck on his back sliding in the sandy earth at high speed, battling Nazis. Heck, in the theatre, I asked my girlfriend to dust off the back of my jacket!Spielberg outdid himself in direction. Lucas & Kasdan were creators, but how Spielberg translates this to the screen is pure genius. Never have I witnessed so much fun in any movie. And if it's pure entertainment we want at the theatre; this movie is the pinnacle.It's maybe the #1 movie that you wish you could see for the 1st time, 100 times.All that said, a lot of the other reviewer's here; truly hit the nail on the head with their great comments and insights.

One of the most iconic heroes of all time in one of the greatest adventures of all time,"Raiders of the Lost Arc stands the test of time almost 30 years after its release as a immensely enjoyable adventure romp and a definitive moment for the genre. The film that introduced the world to one of the greatest movie heroes of all time in Indiana Jones, it goes back to a time when creativity and choreography were essential to pulling off the film's many stunts and action scenes.Harrison Ford brings so many iconic traits to the character of Indy, and he is allowed to do so by the subtleties of the film. He is sly, cool, ingenious, but most of all, human. Boring professor by day, ultimate swash buckling action hero by weekend, this isn't a superhero or a man with gadgets to keep him ahead of the bad guys. In fact, Indiana gets the worst of it in more than one instance in Raiders. This allows the viewer to connect and root for him, especially in amusing scenes such as when he literally brings a gun to a sword fight.Steven Spielberg shows off his ability to tell a great story, and packs the film with great symbolism via visual cues. The use of shadows in his shots in particular are very effective, and the different sets remain convincing. The story itself works so well because although it features a few moments of cheese, basing it on actual historical artifacts makes it very easy to enjoy and also gives Indy many exciting locales to visit.Using the Nazis as the villains was brilliant and gives the audience a clear ""good vs evil"" storyline, allowing the film to focus on the development of the leads without sacrificing investment in the plot. The action pieces work and create a real sense of tension and danger because it's actually a person performing the stunt. From the awesome truck chase (Wilhelm scream alert!) to the well of snakes to the awesomely ambiguous ending, Raiders is full of memorable moments that have understandably permeated pop-culture to this day. And not to mention the immense lot of popular films that are directly in debt to Raiders for making the classic adventure popular again.Outside of Harrison Ford's epic performance, the supporting cast has a ball, with one of the creepiest sociopath villains of all time and a great band of friends for Indy. Karen Allen does struggle to be convincing at times, but she works well in the romantic sections of the film, especially the ""where does it hurt"" scene, equally amusing and endearing. This is a film that hits on all cylinders and set the stage for two more underrated tales to come (let's not talk about the new Indiana Jones film for the purposes of keeping this review positive).Raiders of the Lost Arc is a great introduction to one of the best movie heroes of all time and remains a treat to experience.

As exhilarating as a rollercoaster ride...and twice as much fun!,"When I was a kid, the adventure classic of all time was 'Gunga Din' (and seen today, it's still a fun-filled classic full of suspense and adventure). But not until 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' did another film take its place alongside that gem. This stands as one of the cinema's greatest comic-strip type of adventures. If you really believe any of this could really have happened you've gotta be out of your mind. But it doesn't matter--the story is told with such tongue-in-cheek style and flourish for comic effects (even at the most dangerous moments)--that you know you're just supposed to sit back and enjoy it for the Saturday afternoon treat it is.Biggest asset--aside from the casting of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones--is the magnificent musical score by John Williams. He never ceases to astound me with his talent--probably the finest film composer heavily influenced by the great scores of the '30s and '40s (by Erich Wolfgang Korngold)-- rich in texture and symphonic sound. Truly a master at making a film seem even better than it is.The villains are splendid, the heroine is gutsy, the chases are memorable and the look of the film is extraordinary in its attention to period detail. The Nazi menace makes it all the more riveting. Well worth your time--you won't be disappointed. And watch for that marketplace shooting--it's the film's biggest howl.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.,"This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor takes us on an adventure and lets us know about things that we never knew. I am not sure if they ever existed but as along as I am on fun ride, I am pretty happy with the fiction element of the ride. And this one is a fun ride and good one too. Having said that, I still can't say if it still has the charm of 1981 (rather I saw it first time in 2002) but as I saw it today, it made a fun ride.Thanks to Harrison Ford for carrying the style and flamboyance needed and to Steven Spielberg and George Lucan and team who made this INDY possible. It's an adventure of 1930's and art direction and cinematography are superb. The music which has now became a signature tune even to film awards in India is gonna stay with us for a long time.Some film makers have claimed this film to be changing their mind and pulling them into films, example Nagesh Kukunoor. So the impact of the film is understandable and yet is extensive. The special effects are nowhere when compared to what we have today, but it was made but what was there in 1981 and boy, I must say it will stand better than many special effects films even 100 years later.The best thing probably is the setup, there is a dialogue initially to help us understand what is the purpose of the adventure and then once the adventure rolls in, we are put aback by thrills and stunts and more than anything, the enigma of a charismatic man called Indiana Jones.I would go with 4/5 and recommend it to all those adventure and fun loving guys.

made adventure what it is today,"The adventure genre is born in this unforgettable, over-the-top classic from director Steven Spielberg. Set in 1936 comes this breathlessly action-packed story starring Harrison Ford as a brilliant and brash archaeologist recruited by the U.S. government to retrieve the sacred Ark of the Covenant, a mysterious religious artifact which may or may not be a source of unspeakable power. The result is the adventure of a lifetime as he confronts brutal Nazis, matches wits with an arch rival (Freeman), and tries to make amends with his lost love (Allen), all the while eluding venomous snakes, fierce booby traps, and every other death-defying stunt imaginable! Overflowing with notable fight scenes, memorable characters, spectacular visuals, and one fatal escape after another, this remarkable film single-handedly sets the standard for the adventure genre.

"Ford, Spielberg and Williams take a bow, Lucas not so much.","I can certainly understand why this film has such a cult following. The direction by Spielberg is as good as you'd expect, with some particularly incredible stunt choreography. This is probably one of the cleanest looking films of the eighties, drenched in vivid colour and containing some dazzling special effects. And of course the John Williams score is iconic and perfectly fitted to the film. But it's Harrison Ford's performance that steals the show and is arguably the main reason for the popularity of the Indiana Jones series. He looks perfect for this role and delivers just the right balance of dryness and bravado, working well with a fairly unimpressive support cast.Despite all this, I never found Raiders to be a particularly good story. It's all a bit excessive and farcical, and having a completely invulnerable lead character just devalues the action scenes. I do feel nostalgia is a big contributor to the film's high ratings, similar to the equally overhyped Rocky series. Good fun but a bit too slapstick to really be considered a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Preposterous Fun,"To state the obvious strengths of the movie right off the top: it's a good action-adventure movie, light-hearted even when managing to deal with sinister Nazis, with a fun lead character. Those things in and of themselves score this movie a few points, and one has to give credit for the fact that it really did set the pattern for the modern genre of action-adventure movies. It also established Harrison Ford (who was primarily known for his supporting role as Han Solo from ""Star Wars"" at the time this was made) as an action-adventure leading man (he does these parts well; I find him perhaps a bit dry when he takes on more substantive roles) although it may not establish him as an ""actor"" per se, since the part of Indiana Jones really isn't a dramatic part that would stretch or test an actor's ability. It required ""presence"" rather than ""talent"" and Ford brought that presence to the part very well. So, yes, there's a lot of good material here, and yet I can't say that I really enjoyed this, in spite of the obvious fun contained within it.The action-adventure elements are the key to this movie, and that being the case there's not enough, quite honestly. Between them, there are long stretches in which the story is told in a largely unconvincing and uninteresting manner - appropriate, I suppose, since the story itself is quite unconvincing. It might make for a good yarn, but someone still has to explain to me why Hitler would have been interested in finding the Jewish ""Ark of the Covenant."" I know it was explained at the outset that the Nazis wanted it because it contained great power and would make an army invincible, but one would have to believe the Jewish stories about it to believe that - and Hitler obviously didn't. Then as the movie reaches its climax, the power of the Ark is revealed in ridiculously supernatural terms. That aside, I found the romance between Indi and Marion (Karen Allen) uninteresting and largely unnecessary to the story, and the story itself to be such a wild ride that at times it just didn't seem to make sense to me.Maybe I'm taking this too seriously. It is fun on a regular basis - even if it is somewhat preposterous. But I still just didn't really enjoy it. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
V.Good,"I really love all of the Indiana jones' movies. When i went to Disney world in Florida when i was 4 I saw a stunt out of this movie so the film always reminds me of that lol But anyway..I think Harrison ford is amazing as Indiana and I can't imagine any one else playing the part. He is so fit when hes got his shirt half undone and hes got his whip hehe. There are some great action scenes in this film and it will have you on the edge of your seat on some parts. I always worry that Indiana will end up being killed but it never happens just like Bond never gets killed...Hes too cute to kill.

Blu-ray revisited,"Blu-ray revisited, Amy was right. Even without the role of Indiana Jones, it had no effect on the plot. The Nazis found the Ark of the Covenant, opened it, and finally died.

One of the best trilogy and character in cinema history.,"Indiana Jones is, I think, one of the best characters in cinema history. A whip-cracking adventurer, he searches for missing treasures while fighting evil. In this film, Indy is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant. It is believed that it holds the ten commandments, and he and his ex-flame Marion must also fend off Hitler agents from getting their hands on it. What results is a movie with pure adventure and entertainment; a brilliant cast, great direction, rousing music score (John Williams' Indiana Jones themes is probably one of the most recognizable and memorable in movie history) and beautiful place settings, from the villages of Egypt to the Arc of the Covenant. It's a great film, but I personally enjoyed Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade more. I just think the stories and action to those two films were more spirited and compelling.Just a funny note, as Indiana Jones being of the most memorable fictional characters, I actually parodied him in a college skit. It was fun; our skit was voted the best in the class.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Holy Smoke my friend I'm so pleased you are not dead!,"I re-watched Raiders a couple of months ago and, 30 something years after its release, I can find no real flaws.Rewatching Raiders this time I did notice a lot of Spielberg style similarities from movie to movie. For example, the scene where Indie chases the caravan of military vehicles reminded me of the look of Duel, Spielberg's first movie. And the way the faces melted and the way the ghosts and skeletons were animated, that was similar to Poltergeist, which Spielberg wrote. But just because he re-purposed techniques doesn't make Raiders of the Lost Ark any less grand.Raiders is as American a movie as you can get. With a swarthy hero, a loud mouth dame, and a whole lotta double cross. Remind you of any other movie about an artifact? Maybe with 'Maltese' in the title?Sure it's not 100% original and sure the effects are a bit dated but you could watch it right now and be entertained all the way through.

I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of!,"There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie francaise in the history of cinema. This is my all time favorite film. This is simply the best action film ever made. That will stand the test of time forever. I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times, with no lesser joy. This film has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I just love every bit of it. Harrison Ford is one of my all time favorite actor, he brings THE greatest and most charismatic character on the silver screen in this Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaboration. Indiana Jones is the likable, stubborn, intelligent, and determinedan archaeologist adventurer with his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol he spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasures. He escapes countless dangers, including fighting thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a dusty road, just to name a few. You can't forget John William's classic score which is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows. Steven Spielberg wanted to bring back the classic B-film adventure movies. Instead, he created one of the most revolting and loved films of all time. All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one is still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Indy - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years to come. This will always be considered the greatest adventure film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"A fun movie, but ultimately disappointing","Minor anachronisms in the interest of plot and convenience are fine, but it is annoying when a major plot line is based not only on something that didn't happen, but on something that couldn't have happened. It is laughable that the Nazis could have had a whole army charging around British-controlled Egypt in 1936.However, what really lets this film down is that it moves from one set piece to the next relying on dumb luck. Jones is evidently a smart man, yet he never uses his noggin. He never has a coherent plan. Ultimately, the day is saved by divine intervention (literally), rather than by any ingenuity on the part of Jones.It's like fast-food: enjoyable enough while you're consuming it, but ultimately unsatisfying.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the quintessential adventure movie, with perfect pacing, a fantastic theme and likeable characters there's not much to complain. Seeing this movie fully for the first time since forever I can say I really liked it, and time flew by. But it's action and fighting sequences aged poorly.Directing, first off this is just another solid film from Spielberg in his prime (has he ever not?) it's so tightly woven, well paced and filled with great moments. Notably some comedic segments too, some going into almost slapstick territory but they managed to make me laugh. Visually it does well, but some of the lighting of certain set pieces was weaker here and there. Maybe it's more of a modern filmmaking thing to make things darker, but especially the opening scene in the temple was a little too bright/washed out. Which made it feel more like a stage than it needed to, really nitpicky though. Besides that there was one camera angle, behind Marion at the bar, which felt rough and odd. Besides that though it's so good. So many memorable scenes.Acting/characters. Great, definitely having fun with the characters too as some are really out there, being very committed to their schtick. Which leads to some fun moments. You can't come into this thinking things through all too much, as yeah, Indi has plot armor that extends further than just dodging bullets. But it keeps things light. The characters are good, Indie is the stoic male hero we all know. Imo he felt a little less interesting that I would've expected. Marion is a great counter that gets to do more than just be a screaming maiden, and actually has some smarts which is great.Music, well how can you go wrong with Williams. The only problem I have with it is that you could swap music with star wars and most of it would work. So it's not very unique in that regard, when you hear a small part of this, you might think it's from star wars.VFX were surprisingly still good, love the ark scene, still effective.Just a fantastic adventure film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The greatest adventure on film.,"So much more than just an action film, Raiders of the Lost Ark set the standard for any film that required action sequences of any kind.

The supporting cast is very good as well, and the script is full of suspense as it keeps us guessing until the end. Of course the most important part of this film is the direction, and it is here that Spielberg does one of his very best jobs in this reviewer's opinion. What Spielberg does so well is tell the story and set the tone, then let us decide with our own emotions of how to react. Combined with yet another immortal John Williams' score and wonderful photography, it is universally considered to be the greatest adventure on film. It still is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I was underwhelmed,"Steven Spielberg and George Lucas had the idea to recreate the Saturday morning serials of the 1940s with Raiders. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, a globe trotting adventurer looking for the Ark of the Covenant which would give Hitler the power to conquer world. Mr Ford always appears to be sleepwalking through his roles; somebody please wake him up. Robert Mitchum had a similar style, except Bob had charisma which is missing in Harrison.Indiana battles Nazis, fights off snakes, makes several great escapes and moves around enough to be awarded frequent flyer miles. Back and forth we go with the Ark, to the point where I did not care at all.One chapter was quite enough for me; I have no desire to suffer through the many sequels that followed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Still to be beaten.,"In the action/ adventure genre I believe Raiders of the Lost Ark is the yardstick by which all other films should be measured.There simply was not an action/ adventure film made before this which is as good, and there has not been one since (although the sequels came close).Everything here works, there is nothing wasted. Nothing to bloat the film and make it boring, nothing to slow down the pace and nothing unnecessary. RotLA cracks along at a good pace, but occasionally gives the viewer time to breathe before we are off again on another leg of the adventure.This is action movie making at it's very best, the cast, direction, cinematography, score, locations, story, everything is just perfect. Everyone involved in making RotLA brought their ""A-game"" to the table, and it shows.RotLA is such an evocative film, from the opening jungle scene, to the Cairo markets, to the outline of Indy against the sunset as they dig for the Well of Souls, to the final ""storage room"" scene. The images Spielberg created here are masterful, the score by John williams complementing them perfectly. The action is pure edge-of-your-seat stuff, and there are a good few laughs thrown in too.I was around 6 or so when I first ever saw it and I was blown away. I am still blown away every time when I watch it now (I am now 41).A modern classic in every sense of the word, one that is far superior to the mindless cookie-cutter tripe that is churned out pretty much every week in cinemas 37 years later.It really fascinates me how people can say that Raiders is for ""kids with no brain"" and give it a poor rating. These are probably the same people who turn up at the multiplex each month to see the next Marvel film, which is just the same as the last Marvel film, but with a slightly different character.Nothing else to say really, if you haven't seen Raiders then see it.You can thank me later!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Pretty much perfect.,"'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)' is pretty much a perfect movie, entertaining and iconic. It's so severely burnt into pop-culture that it's easy to forget just how amazing it really is. Spielberg's direction is phenomenal and shockingly efficient. The flick's several superb, subtle long-takes prove he's the absolute master of blocking, transitioning from shot-type to shot-type in a ballet of underplayed choreography. There isn't a single frame in the film that doesn't need to be there. The action sequences are exciting, pacy and palpable; they're some of the most enjoyable of their kind. The experience as a whole is just pure fun from beginning to end. It has aged in some areas (Indy and Marion's previous tryst is supposed to have taken place when she was either fifteen or seventeen, depending on whether you believe the initial script and novelisation or the 2008 character guide) but it's effortlessly entertaining and wonderfully constructed nevertheless. It deserves all the praise it gets. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the Best Action Movies of All Time,"A true classic of the adventure genre, Raiders of the Lost Ark has everything you'd want from this type of film, and still holds up 40 years later. The action is definitely the best aspect - the stunts are obviously iconic, but the direction of the action is so smooth, and it makes it very easy to follow and as a result more enjoyable. Too many action movies nowadays rely on shaky cam, and whilst shaky cam can be used effectively (see Saving Private Ryan) I ultimately do prefer smoothly shot action as done here. Of course we have the brilliant Harrison Ford as Indy, but I also really like Marion in this film. She has an actual character here, which is so much better than Kate Capshaw's character in Temple of Doom who just screams constantly. The villains aren't well developed as such, but they're not meant to be - they're just meant to be intimidating, and they do that really well. The story is simple, yet also really effective. It's a plain macguffin story, but it allows for the action to drive the story, and that stops the film from being too bogged down by exposition. The score is one of the best of all time - John Williams really is a master composer - and the film is just really entertaining. Overall, it's a fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Holy jewish spirits coming down from the heavens annihilate Nazis and take the revenge of the holocaust.Otherwise, the film has a beautiful score and numerous memorable scenes, like the drinking contest of Marion, Indy's encounter with the swordsman and the room with snakes. It is still watchable but didn't age very well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Harrison Ford's Greatest Role,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is pretty much my personal gold standard for an action movie. Great locations, great action set pieces and sequences, romance and comedy, a cool and charismatic main actor, funny side characters, and an annoying villain that you can't wait to see get his. Harrison Ford is in his most iconic role here as Indiana Jones. Everything in this film is iconic, from the rolling ball opening to the bar shootout in Nepal to the truck chase scene through Egypt and the epic finale. John William's score is electrifying. Paul Freeman does a great job as the evil French archeologist Belloq.One of the must watch movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Spielberg at his best!!!,"In my opinion, there are only a handful movies which are perfect. This is one of them.
Harrison Ford plays the coolest archeologist in cinematic history, who is searching for the lost ark of the covenant, and he has to get it before the Nazis.
This movie is great for a lot of reasons. The action is one of the best ever filmed. There is no shaky cam, and the stunts in this movie are some of the best stunts performed on screen. Especially, a stunt towards the end of the film where Indy is dragged behind a truck. Kudos to Harrison Ford and Vic Armstrong for risking their lives for our entertainment.
Secondly, the acting, even from secondary characters is great. All the characters, be it Marion or Sallah are memorable. Also, this is a movie where all the jokes land.
Lastly, the music. The music composed by John Williams in this movie is one of the best music of all time.
This movie is one of the best movies ever made. It is right up there with Die Hard and The Dark Knight and T2 - judgement day.
Definitely check this one out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Here it is, the most entertaining movie of all time!","Never has there been- and most likely there will never be again, such an entertaining movie as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Even though I still regard ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" a better movie, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" remains the most entertaining one of the Indy movies.The movie is a wonderfully constructed old fashioned adventure movie, with lots of action and comedy elements. Lots of traveling, exciting chase sequences, an imaginative story, fun fights, a good main character, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has got all the elements in it to make a movie entertaining.But really what makes this movie such a good one, is thanks to all the talent involved. Spielberg is a great entertainment director, George Lucas is a great imaginatively storyteller and Harrison Ford is a great perfect 'hero'. The three form a golden trio. You can tell by looking at this movie that the three by working together excel themselves and puss and motivate each other to a level of greatness. But it of course were not just those three that made those movie. Also kudos has to go to of course the musical score by John Williams, who created one of the most recognizable themes out of motion picture history. But it's not just the main theme that is great about the musical score, it's the entire piece of work. Other persons who deserves credit are production designer Norman Reynolds and director of photography Douglas Slocombe. All the talent involves makes this movie the ultimate entertaining movie. The movie also has some good and convincing 'early' special effects.The movie is also very well cast. Who would had ever known that after Han Solo Harrison Ford would ever portray a memorable and good on his own character that everybody around the globe knows. Paul Freeman is great as Indiana Jones darker shadow. He's a good villain but one with class. Karen Allen is a good leading lady and she and Harrison Ford have some good chemistry together. Also memorable are John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott and Ronald Lacey as the ultimate Gestapo officer Major Toht. Nazi's always make such great movie villain in movies like this. Why? Because these guys need no introduction. When you see a Nazi you know he's a bad guy and you know he is very bad because everyone knows what those guys did in WW II. Plus of course the fact that they always wear this great looking costumes. Also now well known actor Alfred Molina shows up in a small role at the beginning of the movie.The great adventurous imaginative story provides the movie with some unforgettable moments. Especially the big action sequences are memorable. We have the market fight, which is mainly fun to watch, we have the fight in the bar, we have the airplane fight with the great indestructible Pat Roach and than we have the wonderful truck chase sequence that is very well filmed. The movie is truly action packed, which keeps the pace high, even though there also are some slower moments in the story.It's pointless to recommend this movie or not, since this is one of those movies that everybody already has seen at least once. If you're one of those rare cases that hasn't seen this movie yet; What are you doing here reading users comments? Go and watch this movie and be entertained by it. This is a movie that remains good, powerful and entertaining, no matter how often you watch it. It's absolutely perfect!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Wooo! A Great Adventure Movie!,"Anybody and everybody should see this movie. Period. End of story.I'm 18 years old, I was born in the 90's, and so I watched films like Aladdin, The Lion King, and Toy Story. However, I am not oblivious to the awesomeness of the movies of the 80's and this is just one of those movies.First off, let me say that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, both having directed a few not-so-good movies, are both masterminds when they put their hearts and souls into movies; this is one of those movies. Spielberg proves once again why some of his movies, like ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" to name a few, are among the most famous movies in history. As for George... well, let me just say that he has shown here that he can do more than just outer space battles in a galaxy far far away...Now, to the cast: I think that we all agree that they are all pitch perfect here. Paul Freeman is great as the antagonist Belloq. Karen Allen is stunningly beautiful as the damsel in distress Marion, although she clearly shows that she can hold her own in battle. And, of course, the man Indiana himself. No one can play the role better than Harrison Ford. He brings life to the character, the movies, and so if I had to choose his signature character in any of his movies, it would be Indiana. I think I speak for a lot of people here.All in all; it's worth it. Rent it, buy it, do whatever you can, just make sure you go and see this movie. It's 100% worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
one of my favorite movies of all time,"I was 13 at the time Raiders came out (1981) and I will never forget seeing this movie. My father took me on a vacation that summer to Yellowstone National Park and Jackson Hole WY. One of the best weeks of my life. We went on a rafting trip on the Snake River, saw the geysers in Yellowstone and other fun interesting things.One night we went out to dinner then went to an old movie theater in Jackson Hole to see Raiders. What a great movie for a 13 year old boy, full of action, great storytelling, and at the time state of the art special effects. I wanted to be INDY.Now i am middle aged, my father has passed away. If I would see this movie today for the first time I probably give it an 8. Still a great score. But for me every time I watch it, I can become that 13 year old boy in Jackson Hole WY.Great movies bring out emotion. It is what makes them great. For me Raiders brings me back to a better time when life was pure and simple and my father was still alive. Pure emotion.Why this movie will always be a 10of10 for me. A great fun movie if you haven't seen it do so. There is a lot worse ways to spend 2 hours of your life",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
liked,"Really loved this film. Harrison Ford amazing ""We went on an adventure to make an adventure,"" Spielberg said in 2013 and part of the enduring appeal of the film – which was followed by 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – is the appeal of the charismatic hero figure. Jones is a brave and humorous hero but is allowed to show weakness and be afraid, making the character real. Who can forget the line: ""Snakes. Why'd it have to be snakes?"", as he drops a torch into the Well of Souls, revealing a floor crawling with thousands of the poisonous creatures.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Barely holds my interest any more...,"I used to love this movie not too many years ago. Now it all seems so cliched and cartoonish and downright boring. What's come over me? How come I can't be like all the other happy happy people who worship this movie without fail, without question, as if this movie is the (ahem..) Holy Grail of all Adventure Movies?It probably has to do with either one of two facts: either, one, I'm just turning into a sour old fart (not entirely unthinkable); or, two, and perhaps more germane, I've simply seen way more compelling and awesome fantasy-adventure-escapist movies in my time that beat the pants off of ROTLA.As much as I know that fact number one may (sadly enough) be the truth, I'll just stick with number two. Let's face it, there are much better action-adventure movies out there. I won't bother posting a list of my favorites. Instead I would actually invite you to think about it, and look for your own favorites. Yes, they ARE out there...Well, so hate me if you must for not jumping on the band wagon and shouting the praises of this movie to the heavens. But I'm just a little sick and tired of all the hoakey Hollywoodized characters, the unbelievably impossible escapes (yeah, that submarine ride that Indy takes is a hoot!), the cliched characters (yeah, Nazis act like Nazis, and Arabs act like Arabs, etc. etc.), the stupid fight scenes, that cringeworthy drinking competition that Marion pulls off in Nepal, and on and on. Booorring!It WAS a good movie for its time though, and I will always have high praise for ROTLA for the way it added some real spice to the genre and helped launch better such movie projects in the years after it was released. But for now, I think it is best to store this relic in a long wooden box in a huge dark warehouse - right next to that box containing the Covenant of the Lost Ark.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Worst movie of the top 50 movies on IMDb,"Just watched it and I must say I'm not impressed. I totally respect the fact that it is made in 1981. and some graphic parts are stunning for that age, but it just has to much flaws, nonsense in the plot and lame character development. I mean, Germans are presented like stupid robots. They don't even have the ability to move when they are in danger or something, they just wait to die. Most of the scenes and character decisions are really unlikely to happen in real life, that's something i can't forgive even in the fantasy/adventure movie. I really like the car chase scene, though.7/10. I expected far more intelligent movie, because of the love it got over the years, not some nonsense action with really poor character development.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
G.O.A.T,"The first movie in the Indiana Jones series and definitely the best. Movies in the present usually have higher quality in storyline, editing, and images but this movie is still one of the best movies regardless of the present movies.

It's not the years; it's the mileage,"You could pretty much say the same thing about this movie. Although over 30 years old, this movie holds up incredibly well to today's standards: fun, action packed, exciting, with a bit of religiosity in it (you'll see what I mean when I tell you the plot summary). This is everything that you could possibly want in an Indiana Jones flick.I know that pretty much everybody here has seen the film, but for those of you who are living under a rock, here is what it's all about: Indiana Jones (played to perfection by the legendary Harrison Ford, a man who's made his career in playing grizzled action heroes), an archaeology professor, sets off to find the lost ark of the covenant - the ark which was supposed to hold the broken pieces of the tablets which had the ten commandments on them (like I said, religiosity). He travels with his love interest Marion (the best female sidekick of the series, played immensely well by Karen Allen) to Egypt to dig it up, but his old nemesis Rene Belloq and a whole bunch of Nazis are also searching for the ark in their pursuit of power.Okay, do I really need to say how amazing this movie is? It's a classic! Harrison Ford is known for playing heroes such as Han Solo from the Star Wars franchise and Rick Deckard from the Blade Runner franchise; here he plays possibly the world's greatest adventurer and he seems to really love the part. While I have also mentioned Karen Allen's performance, I must also give a nod to Paul Freeman for convincingly playing an evil archaeologist whose lust for power is not healthy to say the least. All of the other supporting players do superb jobs as well.But you can't review this movie and not give credit to the two men who are responsible for getting it made: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. What's to say about Spielberg? This is the guy who made Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, etc. When it comes to directors...heck, when it comes to movies...he is the guy who changed the game forever. And as for George Lucas, say what you want about his Star Wars prequels, but he was the one who introduced us to a galaxy far far away. Simply put, these are two of the greatest storytellers of all time.I think I've said enough. Now go and watch Raiders of the Lost Ark.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"It's not the years honey, it's the mileage!","""It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.""So I'm continuing to write these short reviews for some of my favorite films which I've never had a chance to comment on. It's about time I give Steven Spielberg some love for one of the earliest films I have the memory of seeing. I don't know how old I was when I first watched Raiders of the Lost Ark, but if my memory isn't playing a trick on me I have to say this is the first movie I actually fell in love with (perhaps it has to do with the fact that it was released on my birth year). Raiders, First Blood, The Goonies, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future, the Star Wars trilogy, and ET (I'm not including animated films) are the films that made an impact on me during my childhood; and either I watched them on repeat or the images have simply stuck in my memory. The opening scene where we are introduced to Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as he is trying to steal a golden idol from a cave deep in the Peruvian jungle has always fascinated me. He's forced to escape when he's crossed by Belloq (Paul Freeman) and the traps go off as we are introduced to the adventurous tone of the film accompanied with the fascinating score by John Williams that has changed the fast-paced blockbuster genre forever. That is all we needed to be introduced to such a fascinating character. As a young boy I imagine I'd easily get distracted by a feature film, but all it took were those opening minutes for me to be hooked to the TV screen for its entire runtime. What followed was one action-packed adventure after another like the scene where Indy faces off a swordsman with his gun, the snake pit scene, the chase sequence involving a truck and some jeeps, and several others that continue to excite me today. It helps that Harrison Ford was playing the titular role and he absolutely owned the part. This is one of the best collaborations between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and everything about this film was a thrilling experience. Harrison Ford turned Indiana Jones into an iconic figure, and several sequels have followed the success of Raiders without ever being able to match it. Even the romance between Ford and Karen Allen works in this film along with the comedic moments that make this adventure such an exciting and thrilling ride.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The ultimate adventure protagonist,"Okay, so there's a ton of remarks already on how this movie is one of the greats, how it's the perfect action/adventure movie, etc. While I don't necessarily disagree, my particular affinity for Raiders (and, to a lesser degree, its sequels) stems from the character himself.Indy's basically an un-super superhero. He has the traditional superhero accouterments: distinctive costume, unique weapon, mild-mannered secret identity - and yet he's far from superhuman. He wounds, falls, and fails just as much as any of us.Here we have a guy who's basically just as weak and fallible as any real-life human, who is constantly thrust into larger-than-life situations that are consequently a little too much for him. Unlike most action heroes, Indy always manages to prevail not because he's super-strong, prescient or invincible, but because he's canny, stubborn, and just plain lucky enough to make it through.This, in my opinion, may be one of the reasons that Indy is so likable and memorable a hero. He's as iconic and mythical as any superhero, yet in the end he's just one of us. He doesn't have the the superpowers of Superman, the endless resources and training of Batman, or the infallible intuition and instincts of James Bond; he's just a real-life guy thrust into a larger-than-life scenario, winging it the best he can. And furthermore, the movie wisely treats him as such. Through all the action scenes of the movie, there's nary a moment where the audience groans and thinks 'that could never happen' or 'there's no way he could survive that.' The movie pushes Indy's limits and the bounds of reality without ever outright breaking them.And so while the movie may be remembered and acclaimed for its legendary stunts and set-pieces, and not improperly so, I would say credit should also be given to Indy himself for being a character who captured the imagination of viewers everywhere, myself included, by being a perfect mix of comic book hyperbole and real-life humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best opening sequence ever...,"I remember the opening 10 minutes of this film to be one of the best moments in cinema, where everything just clicked. But as a whole, the movie works on every level and can be enjoyed by everyone. Plain and simply this movie oozes sheer class, including one of the coolest moments in cinema, you know, the part where Jones comes face to face with the Arab wielding swordman...then bang!I'm suprised this movie didn't win many awards, because for sheer adventure and suspense it is top of the class, and holds up extremely well after repeated viewings.

"Raiders of the Lost Ark: A tribute to the film serials of the 1940s, and one of the all-time greatest movies","In writing this review, I'll say at the very beginning, I love this movie. It reigns supreme as my all-time favorite. Conceived by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this movie, released in June of 1981(a month before I was born) was an instant box-office smash, giving birth to Indiana Jones, played to perfection by Harrison Ford, coming off his success from Star Wars(1977) and Empire Strikes Back(1980). The film captures the spirit of the Saturday Matinee with an absolute brilliance. It action-packed, it's funny, it has fantastic visuals, great acting all around, it is a winner in every regard. Released 3 years prior to the PG-13 rating, the film does contain some scenes of fairly intense gore and blood (which would probably warrant a PG-13 today), but I think that a mature 11 year old can probably handle it. I also must mention the score, done by John Williams, the ""Raiders March"" is quite possibly the most exciting and invigorating score I've ever heard, instantly establishing the film's adventurous tone, and the theme for the ark of the covenant is mysterious and wrought with intrigue. Its interesting also to note that the submarine from 1981's DAS BOOT(directed by Wolfgang Peterson of The Never-ending Story) was rented for one scene. Indiana Jones became of the most recognizable characters of the 1980s, and the original fedora was donated to the Smithsonian. Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, and a great American classic that no video collection should be without. 3 sequels followed: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom(1984); Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989); and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008); but none truly captured the spirit of the Saturday Matinee more than this essential classic.

When Tintin meets Han Solo ...,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is like these showers that work on cold or hot water, where both fans and detractors can be right. Ironically, the elements that are lauded by some and that contributed to cement the film's legendary status are used by others to justify their dislike. Still, no one can deny its significance in film-making history.The first opus of Indiana Jones' adventures was the highest-grossing film of 1981 and when adjusted to inflation, still one of the most successful ever. George Lucas was the executive producer, working with his lifelong friend Steven Spielberg, and there's no doubt that Spielberg wanted to direct his ""Star Wars"", a family adventure film with the kind of enthralling and innocent escapism that only the magic of cinema can convey. Indeed, ""Raiders"" is a kaleidoscope of all the archetypes that built the popularity of the adventure genre whether it's from movies, or comic books. And as a fan of Tintin, there's no doubt that Spielberg made the closest film ever to the Belgian reporter's adventures (although it was more obvious in ""Temple of Doom"" with the Chinese boy) and it's funny how most American critics failed to notice that.South America, Africa, Nepal and Egypt, whips, guns and swords, temples and military camps, planes, trucks, horses and submarines, Spielberg gratifies us with so many spectacular sequences, whether it's on the visuals or action departments, that it would be impossible to list them all. Starting with the immortal opening in the tropical forest, where Jones steals the idol, escapes from poisoned sticks, a rolling giant boulder, a bottomless pit, surprising booby traps, we're embarked in a series of thrilling episodes, each one standing alone as a classic, driven by one of John William's most iconic score (which is saying a lot). And to its own credit, the film succeeds in creating cohesion between all these heart-pounding vignettes through an interesting plot. We're in 1936, at the rise of the Nazi party, and as a passionate of the occult, Hitler sent men to find the Ark where Moses received the Ten Commandments. Any army that would possess it would become invincible.Beyond the inspiration for a catchy title, the Ark epitomizes the mysticism that always surrounded the archaeologist's adventures, and allow to pick the Nazis as convenient villains, since their sophisticated manners contrasting with their extreme barbarity, is the perfect counterpart for a character like Indiana Jones, a tough and rough no-nonsense guy, civilized but condemned to visit the wildest places to fulfill his dreams. Jones is the kind of unintentional hero driven by his own passion, he never seems to enjoy the action, but rather its pay-off, and maybe that's what makes him so endearing, he's like a clever mix between Tintin and Han Solo (to stay on the ""Star Wars"" connection). And with the archaeologist again the Nazis, science and civilization against barbarity and evilness, in between you have the obligatory helpers, traitors and sidekicks.Counting the clichés is pointless, naturally Arabs are either jovial or cunning, the Frenchman is sneaky and charming, Nazis all deserve to die, Marion, Karen Allen as the heroine, granted, she's a tough woman, we can see coming from a mile that she'd be dressed in a very feminine way, that there's more between her and Jones. The whole film works on archetypes, the power is that it also plays with them. Whether it's Jones being afraid of snakes, it provides an interesting Achilles' heel for the hero, but it inspires the great punch line for the opening sequence when he finds one in the plane. The racism of the scene where he casually shoots the swordsman is only redeemed by its hilarious cleverness. The film has a way not to take itself seriously yet doing it at the same time, and I guess that's why it's either praised or despised. I value Spielberg's intelligence enough to have expected the criticism.Indeed, he would easily be accused of designing a movie precisely to attract people, that all the great things of ""Raiders"" were 'marketed'. I'm sure it's right, but what's wrong with that? Maybe it's because Spielberg is one hell of a storyteller. I'm sure he is, although I wouldn't tag the film as a story, but I did follow it with interest. Is the film too naive, too childish? Maybe it was designed by the mind of a director young enough to remember all the representations of his childhood, I'm not surprised that a young Jewish kid would have dreamed of stories where Nazis could be demised the way they are in ""Indiana Jones"", before depicting them in a more adult way in ""Schindler's List"". The film relies on a representation of a world, from comic books to B-movies, belonging to childhood, and maybe the film worked because it awakened our inner child.I guess the haters tend to approach the film from their perspective rather than adapting their approach to the film. I can share Pauline Kael's view when she foresees that the deliberate corniness of ""Raiders"" would put the deathblow on films like ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Raging Bull"". I agree even more because even though ""Jaws"" is the film that paved the way for blockbusters, I've always seen it as an adult masterpiece while ""Raiders"" IS a popcorn film, reinventing an aesthetic of old-school fun and entertainment tailor-made for theaters. It's interesting that Ebert closed his review by advising to see the film with someone we like, to grab his or her arm (was he thinking of the terrifying howling mummies?). Indirectly, he pointed out the film's minor weakness, being designed for cinemas, with half the charm lost on TV, videos and now DVD's. Even ""Star Wars"" can be enjoyable for the whole Shakespearian and Family saga undertones.Maybe ""Raiders"" killed the very kind of movies that could be enjoyed even outside theaters. Still, I can't imagine the world of movies without ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Overrated.,"This movie was just about what I expected in some ways but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype in others. First with the good stuff, it was exactly what I thought in terms of actions sequences, whip cracks, and archaeological hunts. Those things were the strong elements of the film in my opinion. There were also plenty of funny scenes and the effects, while terrible in today's standards, were pretty darn good for a 30+ year-old film. The reason this movie rated so low, however, is for the few negative parts. Things like the fact that the Indiana Jones character might be the dumbest protagonist in action film history for example. Or the corny scenes that mar so many films of that era. I honestly don't know what people were thinking back then to enjoy such tomfoolery. The other things that hurt the film weren't as major. The mystical/supernatural element was unfortunate but that's more of a personal thing. I tend to zone out when ridiculous stuff comes on the screen in supposedly realistic settings. The acting also wasn't great but it wasn't all that bad either. I was disappointing though in the lack of charisma from Harrison Ford during the movie. The same guy who managed to turn a douche bag smuggler in the Star Wars saga into a fan favorite didn't have much opportunity to do the same here. I mainly blame the writing and directing. Still, the movie was enjoyable and I look forward to seeing the next two being that I've heard the series gets substantially better after the first one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
American arrogance as entertainment product,"An American archeologist goes to Egypt to steal a priceless artefact from a tomb, creating havoc for the local population amidst which he is impervious.Why is Indiana Jones the hero of this movie? He murders hundreds of people in order to steal valuable artefacts from poor countries. He's not even charming. He's just American. His intelligence is entirely unconvincing. His only apparent ability is determination, and of course miraculous amounts of luck. Harrison Ford's performance is only grimace, brawn and hat.The film assumes you are stupid. It not only signposts everything without any subtlety, it assumes you have only the most superficial and passing interest in anything that happens, and so it only aspires to that level of engagement. It assumes you will forget everything instantly and be satisfied with that.The film is utterly racist. The Americans are the good guys for no discernible reason. It is simply unquestioned. The Nazis and South Americans suffer familiar racial stereotypes, but the Arabs are simply set dressing. Jones smashes through their city and their bodies as if it was a field of corn. He trashes their cartoon city as if he was knocking over a pile of empty boxes and they flail their arms meaninglessly and helplessly. And the film assumes you feel the same way, and that it's all fun and games. The rest of the world is just a toy for the real people, the Americans, to play with. It is offensive and there is nothing remotely charming, inventive or clever to justify it.The extreme lack of sophistication or cinematic flair and the huge commercial success can only suggest that Spielberg is a coldly-calculating commercial, good-natured psychopath firmly embedded at the centre of the American psyche. The idea that genius, intelligence or artistic skill could topple him is to misunderstand the nature of the industry. The fact that art gets exhibited alongside this type of product is merely a technical issue. They utilise the same technology but have nothing further in common. If this is art then a carpark is an installation.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great popcorn flick,"Harrison Ford is iconic as Indiana Jones, Karen Allen is great as his tough sidekick/love interest, and the film literally gets Biblical on us to melt Nazis. Along the way there is suspense, great stunt work, good fight scenes, lots of one-liners, and many gruesome ways the bad guys die. It's all a very Hollywood production and to be honest, I could have used a little more cool archaeology stuff and less of the action which seemed to go on a bit long, but this is a classic blockbuster for a reason. My understanding is one of the original inspirations was a James Bond like character, and you can certainly see that. Unfortunately that inspiration brings along some baggage, and you'll have to ignore the white hero leading frightened natives to plunder treasures and suspend disbelief over his ability to take on entire armies on his own.

One of Spielberg's best,"Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite movie directors of all time, having directed some of my favorite movies such as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and making other classics such as this movie and close encounters of the third kind, and the fact he teamed up with the creator of Star Wars just to make a passion project like this is astounding, raiders of the lost ark is one of the high points of Spielberg's career, right up there with Jurassic Park and Jaws.Raiders has one of the best and most iconic opening scenes of all time, and it basically revolutionized the film industry, so many movies since this came out have subtly ripped it off in one way or another, from the boulder to the temple with the traps to the dead comrade, you see it everywhere.Steven Spielberg's direction in this film is absolutely wonderful, he was a master of crafting suspense and non-stop thrills, in lieu of his earlier film, Jaws, this movie has some of the best action sequences I've seen since, you've heard it, Jurassic Park.Harrison Ford gives an iconic performance in this movie, one of the best of his career, along with his performances in Star Wars and the Blade Runner movies.I wish I watched this movie sooner, it goes in the catalog of at least my top 11 pre-2000's action films, and I'm gonna give Raiders of the Lost Ark an A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Harrison Ford is also perfect for the role of Archaeologist and school teacher Indiana Jones. Along with the Star Wars trilogy, the Indy series has made Ford my favorite actor.

Asps...very dangerous...you go first.,"Some films you can theorize about and speak in solemn tones about the nature of their artistry. Some films, on the other hand, just make you grin from ear to ear as you remember the sheer thrill of experiencing them for the first time. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is happily one of those second types of films, a movie you do not passively watch so much as you careen through with equal measures of fear and glee. It's the two-hour equivalent of the best amusement park ride you've ever been on, and I mean that as a sincere compliment. The opening scene alone is worth the price of a rental, as Harrison Ford's immortal Indiana Jones escapes an evilly booby-trapped treasure chamber only to run right into, and then past, an ambush. It contains one of the best fight scenes ever filmed, and possibly the best chase scene ever filmed.

"A blockbuster worth watching for historical significance, yet lacking contemporary appeal","Indiana Jones, a classic of its era, presents a unique viewing experience that may not entirely align with modern cinematic tastes. The film, celebrated for its relentless action and adventure, might seem jarring to audiences accustomed to today's slower-paced, more intricately plotted narratives. While the movie was groundbreaking in the 1980s for its dynamic storytelling and exotic locales, contemporary viewers might find these aspects less remarkable given the advancements in film technology and storytelling.One of the key challenges in appreciating Indiana Jones today lies in its approach to plot development. The film's narrative is driven by a series of rapid-fire events, which can leave little room for in-depth explanations. This storytelling style, while contributing to the film's fast pace, also results in numerous plot holes that might be more noticeable to a modern audience. These gaps in the plot can lead to moments of confusion and may prompt more questions about the film's production choices than its narrative substance.However, it's important to recognize the film's historical context and its influence on the adventure genre. Indiana Jones was a pioneer in many ways, setting a template for action-adventure films that followed. Despite its perceived flaws when viewed through a contemporary lens, the film remains an important piece of cinematic history. Its impact on the genre and its enduring popularity suggest that while it may not meet every modern standard for storytelling and visual spectacle, it still holds a significant place in film history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Happy 35th Anniversary To One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Of All Time!,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is my second favorite movie next to ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,"" and it is also, in my opinion, my absolute favorite movie by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg teams up with George Lucas after his success with ""Star Wars"" as both of the greatest filmmakers had set out to pay homage to the old serials of the 1930s. The movie is about an archaeologist and professor name, Indiana Jones as he goes on an adventure to search for the Ark of the Covenant with the help of the love of his life Marion Ravenwood. However, Indy's rival Rene Belloq has been working with the Nazis as they both go after the Ark, and it is up to Indy to retrieve the Ark before its too late. It has been 35 years, since this movie came out back in 1981 and it still is my favorite of the series. The series itself may have pay respect to the ""James Bond"" movies, but they also pay tributes to the old serials of the 1930s until the fourth one pays tribute of the 1950s sci-fi B movies. With that said, whenever I watch this movie, it never feels dated nor is it cheesy. Like the ""Star Wars"" series, you will always feel the experience as you go on for the ride as the ""Indiana Jones"" series explore exotic locations and search for artifacts. By getting to the point, Harrison Ford is definitely Indiana Jones as he is as Han Solo. He does a brilliant job with the role as his character is someone that you don't want to mess with because he is rough, cool and is always amazed when he is discovering artifacts. Of course, he is always into as I quote from the second movie ""Fortune and Glory."" Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is my favorite of all the girls that Indy has met in his life. Not only is she beautiful, but she can be also feisty too. Sometimes she be a damsel in distress, but she never whines and complain like Willie Scott did in the second movie. Her character is pretty complex as you learn about her as she and Indy did had some history together as she had romantic affair with him. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a really good villain, and quite a rivalry to Indy as they are always after the same artifact as they're trying to retrieve. The rest of the cast all did well. Steven Spielberg does an amazing job on directing the movie with George Lucas coming up with this brilliant concept that he had created. Lawrence Kasdan has wrote a brilliant script, and the story itself always kept me investing as well as the characters. The special effects by Industrial Light & Magic are absolutely fantastic for its used of practical effects, matte paintings and miniature work. John Williams' music is completely unforgettable, and there is no denying that the theme he created would be as iconic as the ""Star Wars"" theme. The action scenes are very well done as well as the physical work that were put on camera. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is also wonderful as I do get a sense of the 1930s, which it does put me in the right atmosphere. The humor is done well, for example, Indy has an Arab Swordsman in his way as you think there is going to be fight between them, instead Indy just shoots him because he has no time for that. The movie is also very well putted together, and it does go by at a very good pace. I never see any flaws with this movie, because this movie is definitely flawless, and it will always be either one of the greatest or the greatest adventure films of all time. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a classic adventure film, and I am giving it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"The adventures of Indiana, which have now become classics","The first film in the series about the great archaeologist ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an exciting film released in 1981, and it still remains one of the favorite fan creations about travel and adventure. Behind the success of the film is a talented director Steven Spielberg, who embodies his vision of the story in stunning shots and exciting scenes.Spielberg is a master of his craft, and in ""Indiana Jones"" he demonstrated his art of creating a unique atmosphere. His ability not only to maintain tension throughout the film, but also to focus on details makes him one of the leading directors of his time. Spielberg recreates a unique world of adventures and opens up to the viewer an exciting path to the lost ark.However, it is impossible to talk about the film without mentioning the charisma of the main actor Harrison Ford. His great acting gives Indiana Jones brightness and energy, making the character unforgettable. Ford brilliantly embodies the strength, determination and humor of his hero, which allows the viewer to look at him not only as a brave researcher, but also as a beloved hero. Ford was known by many at the time of the film's release as the braggart and screwball Han Solo from the Star Wars saga. Indiana turned out to be a slightly different hero, successfully drawing some character notes from the already beloved Solo hero. However, the actor successfully adds his unique charisma to the hero Indiana, demonstrating how much he can transform from one hero into another, although they are similar to each other.The film has received five prestigious Oscars, which is an indisputable evidence of its unsurpassed quality. This is a recognition of the talent and work of the entire team, including Steven Spielberg, the actors and other participants in the process of making the film. These awards include the Oscars for Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Scenery, Best Visual Effects, and the Special Achievement Award.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" attracts attention with its fascinating story filled with riddles, dangers and unexpected twists. The script of the film is masterfully written, the viewer is immersed in the world of Indiana Jones from the very beginning and it is impossible to tear himself away from the screen until the very end. Exciting adventures, the spirit of adventurism and dramatic moments make us watch with interest what is happening on the screen, and the intrigue keeps us in suspense until the last moment.In addition, the great merit of the film is its visual component. Magnificent special effects, high-quality costumes and skillfully executed scenic stunts create an atmosphere that immerses the viewer in all the delights of this adventure world. Every detail of the film is thought out, and it immediately catches the eye.In general, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an unforgettable film with an amazing direction by Steven Spielberg and a charismatic performance by Harrison Ford.

Exciting adventure trip with a great legend,After many years I watched this movie again on cable. I saw it the first time at the theater with my friends. It was a great blockbuster and everybody talked about the new Indiana Jones. This one is no doubt on of the best of the series. I mean especially the chase scenes in Egypt were well executed with charm and humor. Therefore some dialog sequences were unnecessary too long and stopped the dynamic pace. The story with the Nazi and the chase of the treasure was well mixed. Some special effects looked cartooning but didn't disturb at all. The technology was not on nowadays standard. Harrison Ford gave an original character to Indy Jones. Ford's performance will never be replaced by another actor.

Clearly George Lucas and Spielberg's love affair with the old serials and old comic books paid off big. This movie is a homage to a age we will never see again the real golden age of movie making. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones forget the casting of Tom Selleck Selleck could not have pulled it off as well as Ford. Spielberg remarked that they needed a actor of the level of Bogart who both said would've been perfect for the role of Indy. I could see Bogart playing Indiana Jones and Grace Kelly or Lauren Bacall playing Marion Ravenwood while Errol Flynn could've chewed the scenery as Belloq or maybe Rathbone being Belloq.

A fun and thrilling adventure film that is one of the best of its genre,"I cannot believe i waited so long to see this absolute masterpiece of a film. This film was so much fun to watch from start to finish and that was mainly as a result of a very interesting and engaging plot and an awesome performance by Harrison Ford as Dr Indiana Jones. The overall plot of this film right from the opening sequence got you really invested in the film. It had some interesting twists and turns that managed to take us to many new locations but none of it seemed silly. Harrison Ford is just a master at creating fantastic heroic characters as is seen in Star Wars and he doesn't disappoint in this. Indiana was such a badass, funny and intelligent character that was so entertaining to watch you are cheering for this guy in every scene. What i loved most about this film is how it managed to catch aspects of so many different genres so perfectly. It had awesome action/adventure sequences, some romance, a few scary horror like scenes and bits of comedy to lighten the mood a little. This film had everything and did it so right. Not only did it have everything it was also very well paced, it didn't feel like it slowed down or went too fast at any point.Also, the score in this film by John Williams was so damn incredible that it helped make almost every scene so much better. He has created a score that you can listen to at any time it would still be amazing, something he is so good at.

"""Why did it have to be snakes?"" - Indiana Jones","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, deals with the Nazi's trying to find the lost Ark of the Covenant. Indiana Jones is also on the trail of the Ark and finds himself in all sorts of action packed, and often times, comedic situations.The story is well told, I'm a fan of the supernatural historical backstory to the Ark and there's not too many slow patches. Most of the action scenes still hold up and the stunts look just as incredible today as they would have in 1981 (I'm assuming). Theres a couple fight scenes which are slow and unrealistic by today's standards (the fist fight under the plane comes to mind) but nothing that ruined the film and it was still enjoyable. Make up and practical effects were scary and impactful but the CGI, not so much... It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't exactly clear, especially in 4K it was quite noticeable the drop in visual quality when CGI was present. One thing this film nails completely though is the musical score - it is unbelievably fitting. Right up there with Superman and Star Wars, timeless. The character of Indiana Jones is also one of those cinema creations where everybody knows who he is or aware of the name even if they have never seen the film, he transcends the barriers of the screen and for good reason, he's a lovable reluctant hero that is both intelligent, brave and has a weakness for woman. He has aspects of an everyman that people can relate to but also heroic qualities to aspire to... minus the woman issues of course.Final Verdict: It's part comedy, part science fiction but all adventure! It's still a great film even if the CGI and certain fights are looking dated now. There are so many memorable scenes and dialouge though, and Harrison Ford portraying Indiana Jones was a perfect match - his most iconic character.

The 1981 classic captures your cravings for adventure that you haven't had since you were a young boy or girl. It plays into imagination in a way that no movies succeed in today. Harrison Ford plays a timeless character, which is even more scruffy looking and bad-ass than his previous iconic role as Han solo. Beyond the dusty surface of Raiders, lays a deeply genius film.

Raiders of lost cinema,"The Greatest adventure movie of all time?Its very possible. This folks is how its all done. Humor, drama, action. Its all here.I think Raiders of the Lost arc is not only a wonderful piece of entertainment, the movie is also a showcase for what is wrong with many modern movies. Including those from both Spielberg and George Lucas.Raiders is a movie that takes off running and never stops. The hocus-pocus story is high- cheese, yet we never question it for a second. The action set pieces are all good without coming off as overly deliberate or choreographed. It is not until the end are there really any effects to speak of, and this is where Raiders shines. The movie is driven almost completely by the great story and Harrison Ford's immortal portrayal of Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr.Later Spielberg and Lucas efforts, most notably the Star Wars Prequels and even Minority Report, are boondoggled with all sorts of visual computer wizardry, but the people and the story are both thinner than paper. Though for a half hour or so it proved to be an amazing theatrical ride, even Saving Private Ryan was plagued by a generic story, generic characters and a director all too obsessed with tanks and Thompson machine guns than the thoughts of the men carrying them.Raiders of the Lost Arc is old fashioned film-making full of dirt and grit. The sequels all were entertaining but none so convincing as the first. The acting, directing, editing, writing and of course, the amazing John Williams score meld to perfection. Indeed, this is how movies should be made. In the action genre, I don't think any other movie of its era, or even since, came come close other than Die Hard. More than 25 years later, Raiders of the Lost Arc has lost none of its shine. This is a movie filmmakers should study carefully, even the ones who made it.

Great film,"Thrilling adventure movie. Harrison Ford was perfect for the role. The music was bombastic and grating. People die like flies. The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies. There is no psychology or character. The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable. The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny. We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. Etc.

We all (well, most of us) know and love it to some degree. It's set precedents in film, is easily one of Spielberg's most notable and referenced movies, all for good reason. The character alone (Indiana Jones in case the title threw you), original in name and background, is entertaining on all fronts but not your typical hero. Nor is the female character necessarily a run of the mill damsel in distress, although the second half of the movie submits her to that cliche. It's the plot, side characters, action scenes, casual humor, and grisly effects - despite its 1980s PG rating, which would easily be an R today - that really stick with you.

"Heartbeat, excitement, exhilaration, and determination","If there was ever an action movie that loves other action movies while succeeds at trying out new things for a change it's definitely Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is a classic, unforgettable, and a truly fantastic adventure film that completely blows others out of the water. Just in the opening scene we are treated to delightful cinematography, impressive effects for the time, and a nail-biting setup combined with extraordinary music to foreshadow the string of events that will soon follow.Indiana Jones is a compelling character, from the way he looks and talks, but just the way he fights. Every move he makes seems well thought out and genuine rather than just constant instincts and ""think-fast"" scenarios. He is produced by Lucas, directed by Spielberg, and played extremely well by Harrison Ford.Action films nowadays have no real story. It's usually about a sentence in length. The same can sort of be said about Raiders. It centers around Indiana Jones , an archaeologist who usually goes on risky, death-defying adventures to try and recover ancient artifacts. The US Government hires him, one day, to go in search of the Ark of the Covenant. His mission, that he chooses to accept, is to find the ark and return it to the government before the Nazis uncover it.Right off the bat, this story transforms into a globetrotting adventure. Indy teams up with his old flame Marion (Allen) and it becomes clear that he is more concerned with finding the ark than drumming up another relationship. A beautiful dodge to a cliché so commonly used. The main villain is a man in a black cloak named Belloq (Freeman). He is involved with some of the most gripping action scenes in the film, most notably the one in the bar.The special effects, at least now, appear to be a bit cheesy. We currently live in an age where we can build anything our heat desires from the ground up on CGI. Still, in Saturday morning serials, clearly the feel Spielberg wanted to capture, special effects are supposed to appear a little hammy. I'd take Raiders's action sequences over incomprehensible, score-driven scenes of peril with monotonous digitized backdrops we are so used to today. I'd also take its music, suspense, cinematography, buildup, and characters over anything today as well.Raiders of the Lost Ark is an ecstatically giddy adventure film with one jaw-dropping scene after another. It captures the age of films we'll probably never see again. The age where everything was done for a purpose, and adventure scenes actually played like an adventure. This has the right amount of developed story and the right amount of exhilarating action scenes to be considered the perfect and most satisfying adventure film ever made.Starring: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and Paul Freeman.

Well, when I was a kid and I watched it for the first time, I thought this was the best movie in the world. Years and decades later when I watch it again, it really does not touch me in the same way. I mean I had to literally dump my logic while watching it. There were thousand of rounds of bullets going past Dr. Jones and none touching him. From land to air to underground to water, Dr,Jones is doing whatever he likes. He kills nearly a hundred Nazi soldiers. I mean its too hard to accept as an adult. In the end, the only takeaway is the theme music. Show it to your teenager kid. He will definitely like it. But in no way it deserves to be in the top 250. There are many better adventure films in the world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
No Ordinary Archaeologist,"Hired to stop the Nazis getting hold of a priceless biblical artifact, a 1930s archaeologist has to combat swordsmen, sadistic Germans... and a pathological fear of snakes in this popular adventure film that brought the character of Indiana Jones to screens. The film begins strongly with a thrilling sequence in which Indy has to make his way through booby traps galore in a tomb, and while nothing later on quite matches this tension, there are several exciting moments to be had with a multi-tonal John Williams score perfectly complementing the action. This is hardly a deep or meaningful film, the antagonists range from one-note to one-dimensional and as a character, Indy lacks the charisma of an action hero like James Bond. The attempts to paint Indy as an ordinary university professor who just enjoys adventures never quite gels either since he is more agile and better at close combat than the very best of MI6. All that said and done, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a film full of memorable small moments and there are several excellent artistic shots throughout, most notably some diggers against an orange sunset and Harrison Ford viewed as only a shadow against a wall when first meeting Karen Allen. A supernatural twist near the end also takes the film in some unexpected directions and the iconic final shot of the film makes for a fantastic final note to end on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Very entertaining movie dispite the glaring story problem,"Prepare to have your jaw drop. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. He doesn't stop the Nazis from finding the arc, even though he gets the medallion from Marion before them, and they decide to open it without any influence, which leads to their ultimate destruction. If Jones weren't in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.Let me close that for you. 😁Now you might be thinking. The Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first. But actually they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without Jones they would have had the medallion and dig in the right place.You might also be thinking. If it wasn't for Indiana Jones, the ark would have never ended up at the wear house! Indy, collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing. Like a hero! Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to the museum to be studied. He couldn't even get that done. So he really played no part in the outcome of the story. 😉",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"What follows is one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one surpassing the next in thrills.","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime. It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time. The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in. It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience. Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The Quintessential Action-Adventure Movie!!,"This is one of the most influential and exciting movies that has ever been made. There are a number of classic scenes in this thrilling, including the boulder that chases Indiana, the fight on top of a bus and another classic scene that I will not reveal in this review as it will reduce the impact of that scene.Raiders of The Lost Ark focuses on Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist professor in a college and is also an avid explorer of historical artifacts. The Lost Ark is of great significance and its discovery is something that the Nazis are after as a gift to the Fuhrer. Indiana Jones and his team embark upon a mission to locate this ark and return it to America where its hidden secrets might be uncovered.As the movie focuses on the plot, the acting is not something that is given much focus. Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones who is a cool, charismatic guy who has a way of overcoming any obstacle that comes in his way.The movie is one that must not be missed due to the brilliant direction, tight editing and spectacularly filmed action sequences.

Enjoyable but starting to date,"I watched Raiders recently after a gap of probably ten years and was surprised that it wasn't as good as my memory thought.It must be said that Raiders is still a hugely enjoyable and entertaining film with Ford perfectly cast as Indiana Jones (did they really want Tom Selleck?). But, when push comes to shove, the effects and stunt work are starting to date, Karen Allen is mis-cast and the film drags in parts.However, any film with a roll-call which includes George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford and John Williams is bound to do well and Raiders is still considerably better than most of it's competition.

It's fun, it's an edge-of-the-seat experience, al's very much to the point yet a little rough around the edges in terms of the writing. The narrative primarily focused on the aspects of the treasure hunt and the treasure hunt only, keeping all the character developments at bay. Albeit, quite fortunately, the humor works fine, the jokes had me giggling at several moments, not gonna lie!From a production standpoint, the artistries are quite evident. It's a Spielberg directorial after all, he needs no introduction, people know what to expect and he always seems to deliver. On the acting front, we get to see better than expected results (especially bearing in mind the very fact that this film is over three decades old) and that is largely due to none other than Harrison Ford's immaculate portrayal of Indiana Jones and the impeccable elegance and undeniable magnetism he brings to the table.

Western Version of Chinese Web of Death,"So much hype about how Spielberg learned his craft of suspense from RKO's matinée movies and series. Not a word about him being influenced by Chinese kungfu movies.I was surprised to discover that so much of this 1981 Raiders of the Lost Ark movie is almost a copy of a 1976 Chinese kungfu movie from Hong Kong. The English title of the Chinese movie is ""Web of Death"". It's about a spider with deadly supernatural power which was hidden by the spider clan to keep its power contained, just like the ark. Bad guys of course tried to find it and did, just like the Nazis in the Spielberg movie. The traps in this and later Spielberg movies are so similar to the traps in this Chinese movie. And the special effects in the final fight between good and evil are almost identical.Except the hero in the Chinese movie is an awesome girl. Unlike the Spielberg movie which had to keep Indiana Jones alive for sequels, the Chinese girl sacrificed herself and died to save the good guys even though everyone tried to kill her just a few moments ago.Indiana Jones movies are hits because it's easy to like the sassy professor and the Nazis are the perfect foil.

Classic,"Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)*** (out of 4)The world famous archaeologist Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is hired by the U.S. Government to locate the Ark of the Covenant but unfortunately the search will be a tad bit harder since Hitler also wants the Ark. This was my first time watching this in God knows how many years and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I remembered I still had a good time with it, although I still think Spielberg has made much better films. What I loved most (and this might be cliché) is the amazing throwback to the early serials of the 30's and 40's. It's clear that the screenplay is going for that type of adventure and Spielberg's direction really hits all the right marks as we go on an adventurous ride that takes us from various countries and throws the hero into all sorts of obstacles. There are countless classic scenes here from the running from the huge rock to the gun/sword scene and the wonderful pit of snakes. The screenplay certainly throws just about everything into the mix and having Hitler be the bad guy just adds a lot of pulp fun. I'm really not sure why I didn't love this movie like many others do but I'm going to take a guess and say that the over the top adventure was just a little too much to me. Outside the classic scenes in the film, whenever the movie pauses to do something not involving a stunt, I just found it somewhat boring. I certainly don't mean boring in a bad way but I just kept waiting for the next big stunt. Ford certainly has this character down pat and Karen Allen does a terrific job as his sidekick.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A ride on the roller coaster,"Raiders of the lost ark (1981) is a certified roller coaster of entertainment! If you start watching it you will not be able to get your eyes of the screen or keep in your seat. Even the current generation, used to cgi effects won't be deterred from the old time effects present in the movie (matté shots, physical stunts, etc...). I mean, for some reason Lucas and Spielberg decided to maintain the same style of filmmaking in the latest installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, despite the time gap elapsed since Raiders (27 years) and the technology developed since.This is an adventure-fantasy movie, period. No greater aspirations or elevating themes suggested. We have a hero, Professor Henry Jones Junior (AKA the gung ho archaeologist Indiana Jones), who is running against the stereotypical bad guys to get a land mark archaeological gem, the lost ark of the covenant, overcoming all the traps they lay for him, fighting of every scrimmage possible-and imaginable:- there's a fight in a moving airplane, a pursuit in the streets of Cairo, an escape from a large moving boulder, etc . In this Indiana Jones movie, the first installment in the series, the bad guy is a suave french archaeologist, aided by a group of nazi soldiers and gestapo officers (yes, the movie is set in a pre- second world war scenario), who always out wit Indy, but never seem to get rid of him!George Lucas has long stated that Indiana Jones is an homage to the old republic serial adventures. Well I haven't seen any of them (they never ran in my country, Portugal), but every one of the Indy movies seem like a very large and entertaining episode that when it's over leaves in me an overwhelming hunger for the next movie, so I supposed that was the general idea perceived by Lucas.The next thing is to try and explain to you why am I reviewing on this particular Indy movie. Because it's the best in the series? No, at least not for me. That accolade falls to the third movie, ""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"". Never the less, after seeing it recently I felt I was looking at a rough diamond. Not quite polished and there for not yet presented in all its magnificence, but awakening the nostalgic feelings in you, because you know your in for a fast and bumpy ride, keeping your blood running. Your in for the various lushing sets; the many adventures to come; the different exotic places around the world, everything well scored by John Williams (he actually has a different tune for each character and situation, a device that he followed through the entire series)!And in the end who (or what) do we have to think to: George Lucas' witty imagination? Harrison Ford's superb rendition of the Humphrey Bogart type of hero? Steven Spielberg's ability to film a fantastic adventure movie_ I've seen the recent Tintin movie he made and trust me, he still knows how to do it!Only one thing plagues my mind: when these guys are gone, who will we turn to for a good adventure movie on the Sunday afternoon?!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The stuff of legends,"At this point, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has so many imitators, but none of them come close to matching this thing's level of craft. Hell, even its entertainment value.

The set pieces - orchestrated like amusement park rides - are just piled on one after another.But the guy that makes this all work is the character himself. Indiana Jones is Ford's best-suited role, hands down. And between the script, direction and Ford's little touches, he's just such a memorable character.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Getting dated with time,"The euphoria that Raiders of the Lost Ark created at the time it was released is well known. A lot of people claim that it has influenced many film-makers over the years who made action-adventure films. But I think that Raiders of the Lost Ark is not placed in context most of the times. The truth is, this film did not invent the action-adventure genre. Now, with special effects tools becoming more advanced by the day, the action-adventure films are more spectacular than ever before. So where does all this leave Raiders? The answer to this question may differ with people.To the many who saw Raiders when they were young, I guess it is to them what Jurassic Park (I saw it when I was 14) is to me. It is probably the most fun they ever had watching a film. But that's it. Raiders of the Lost Ark is nothing more than that - a fun film, which now looks dated. It is one of those 'American Classics' that I fail to understand the hype about.Spielberg can mold a film like clay. He can and has created edge-of-the-seat films. But sometimes I wonder that when all those people, who saw his films when they first came out, go away and are not there to talk about it, will the next generations still find his films so thrilling? The action-adventure genre is like alcohol, you want it more potent with time. There lies the biggest threat for all action-adventure films; even if it is from Spielberg.I liked Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than Raiders of the Lost Ark.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The first step on the way to a really good Idiana Jones movie!,"Why do I think the third Indiana Jones is far more better and thus deserves to be voted better than the first one does: 1.) It has the right humor. Indy is not so dogged like in the first one. 2.) It features a beautiful woman, not a strange and manlike wannabe beauty like ""Raiders"" does. 3.) It features a sophisticated screenplay with character development and supporting subplots. 4.) It shows us more of the great location where it is staged on. 5.) It features better actors like Sean Connery is. So, to make my point as clear as possible: ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lacks exactly these five points. - In spite of this, it is a good movie and, after all, the one in which the basic idea of Indiana Jones is introduced. But if you can only see one Indiana Jones, than please do yourself a favor and choose the ""Last Crusade""",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
#1,"Everybody knows that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest films ever made.  I almost feel like I'm wasting my time commenting further on it. However, since I rank it at #1, I feel the need to justify it.The amount of talent on board the filmmaking staff is staggering, and the film benefits most from their inspiring of each other.  Steven Spielberg's direction is impeccable.  He has an unparalleled ability to visually tell a story.  Clearly this man was put on Earth to make films.  Together with the creative mind of George Lucas, the great scripting of Lawrence Kasdan, and the masterful musical score from the master himself, John Williams, Spielberg makes us a part of the experience to the point where we forget we are watching a movie.  And let's not forget Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Can you imagine how much the picture would have lost had Tom Selleck, the original star of the film, had stayed on instead of Ford?  Ford's expressions, deliveries, and general mannerisms make the character his own. No matter the incredible and often superhuman tasks he pulls off, he's still just a regular Joe that with whom we can empathize.""Raiders"" can be viewed again and again while the viewer's interest never fades.  It stops channel surfing in a heartbeat, despite editing and commercials.  When it's on, I'm just plain glad that I'm watching it.  It is perfect right down to the famous final shot (which tips its hat to the Godfather of American film: ""Citizen Kane"").  What more can I say that hasn't already been said?

Let's get started.The film starts With Indy and a thief Satipo finding the Golden Idol in South America, when Indy finds the Golden Idol, a massive Boulder appears, Satipo betrays Indy, then one shot later he dies. The Boulder chases Indy out of the Cave, then he meets with his Arch-rival Rene Belloq, that he tells Jones to give him the Idol, he does then he orders the Group of half-naked people to chase down Indy, Indy luckily Escapes and comes to Jock's plane. In the plane, he finds a snake, and says to Jock ""Snakes, i hate snakes"". A few days later, he's back as a teacher talking about history to the students, after that, Marcus Brody tells Indy to find the Ark of the Covenant. He starts his quest by finding Marion Ravenwood, Indy comes in to the cabin and Marion is not happy to see him, because she didn't see Indy in a while. She slaps him and she tells him to come back tomorrow. Three Seconds later, she comes across the evil Gestapo Nazi Agent Arnold Ernst Toht, his first line is ""Good Evening Fräulein"". He tries to torture Marion by burning her with the Medallion she has, Toht fails and Indy comes to save Marion. Then a fight scene comes and Toht tries to take the Medallion, but since it is burned, his hand gets burned and Marion and Indy escapes to Cairo.When arriving at Cairo, Indy meets his companion Sallah and tells him about the Ark and that Belloq and the Nazi's are after it. Later, when Indy and Marion walks across town, they meet a Nazi, then the Nazi steals Marion and Indy tries to find her. After like 3 minutes of finding, he comes across a Swordsman, luckily Indy shoots the guy and the crowd is happy. Indy finds a basket case where Marion is captured. The Nazi puts Marion inside a truck, then Indy spots a truck and the truck explodes, Indy thought that was the truck Marion was in. Later Indy meets Belloq...again and Belloq tells Indy that he's the one that's opening the Ark not Indy, Indy tries to kill Belloq but fails but he luckily got helped by Sallah's kids. Indy and Sallah talks about them two searching for the Ark of the Covenant together. Later they come to where the Nazi's work, Indy and Sallah works together, Indy goes Down to a hidden Place to solve a puzzle where he has to find where the Ark is located. He knows where it is. Belloq and a person finds Company, which is Toht, he shows his burned hand and says ""Heil Hitler"".Indy, Sallah and many others are digging in the spot where the Ark of the Covenant is. They find the area where the Ark is, but it's surrounded by snakes so Indy and Sallah must be careful, they manage to get past the snakes and takes the Ark of the Covenant. This time, Belloq comes and gives Marion something to eat. They drink vodka and gets drunk. Marion tries to Escape with her new dress, but she gets caught by Toht. Toht says his final English Words ""So, what shall we talk about"". Later, Belloq and the Nazi's discovers the People digging for the Ark. When Indy tries to get the Ark up from the area, they get caught by the Nazi's, the Nazi's take the Ark and Marion comes with Indy down the Area. When stuck down the area, Indy finds a way out by smashing a wall with a statue and they escape the area. Indy Chases the Nazi's in this 7-minute scene. Indy rides a horse, drives a truck and defeats a bunch of bad guys. After a long Chase, the Nazi's won't get away. Indy is on a boat to come away from the Nazi's. A day later, the Nazi's have located a boat with Indy on it. Indy tries to Escape and fight the Nazi's one more time to save a captured Marion. Later the boat comes to a small island. There Indy finds the Nazi's and Marion. Indy dresses up as a Nazi so he doesn't get caught. The Nazi's are seen walking with the Ark to the Place to open the ark, but shortly after, Indy is seen holding a bazooka trying to shoot the Nazi's. Belloq says to Indy that he can shoot the Ark, but he declines and gets captured and stuck on a pole.The Nazi's are prepared to open the Ark, Belloq dressed as a priest opens the Ark along with Toht and a German Nazi Dietrich. When they open the Ark of the Covenant. Spirits come flying by, and the final Words said by Belloq is ""It's beautiful"" A ghost comes to Toht, where the ghost has a pretty face then the Next split-second turns to death. The others Nazi's dies by Lightning, Dietrich's face shrivels up, Toht's face melts and Belloq's face explodes on-screen. The ghosts go back in the Ark and Marion and Indy are free. One moral: Don't mess with God. Indy returns the Ark to Brody, they said that the Ark is not going to the museum, but in a Warehouse owned by top men.Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best films i've ever seen. The film's humour, action sequences, acting, practical effects, villains, characters, script, fight scenes, cinematography, directing, Opening sequence and the Whole film is outstanding. No cons at all. This film is recommended for anyone, please note that this film has a few scary scenes, so if children can handle the melting scene, kids can watch it too",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Traders of A Lost Art,"The Art of making a good movie, This film is why Steven Spielberg is a celebrated director, he knows haw to make a film,with action a bit of Drama and good acting.Harrison Ford is great as Indiana Jones, with Karen Allen doing well. The rest are good to, the fight around the airplane scene is good, and the power of god ending is good.Photography and scenery are excellent, good music, and it is well paced.
You can see why they made sequels to this, Great Movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Just an unconvincing horror film,"I thought it would be a fascinating action thriller, yet it turns out to be a nasty horror film that turns to supernatural power. There is simply no logic or reason behind the screenplay. The overall music score and the action sequences in the third act are good, which prevents me from giving this film a one star.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Fun ride with some quirks,"I can see why people would rate this a 10 in 1981 and I can't even fault those people who rate it a 10 today. It's a 7.5 for me. While this movie still holds up in some regards, its story is what lowered the score for me. It was its weakest element. It just felt a bit dull by today's standards. And I'm still not entirely sure what the hell came out of the Ark at the end.More of my other small issues came from some of the editing and sound. There were weird editing moments throughout where I felt as though I had whiplash. And some of the verbal dialogue was out of sync, echoey, or just plain inaudible. Luckily we're here for Indy's cave running antics and not for the sharp dialogue so it didn't ruin too much of the movie for me.Overall, a really good not great movie that I'll probably watch again if it's on tv but won't add to my all time faves list or anything like that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Excellent,"This film really is excellent. Definitely the best adventure film out there. It is heart warming, classic hero vs villain action, where morals don't get mixed up. Because that's the beauty of this film. Don't get me wrong, I love a good thought provoking complex plot, but the simplicity of this film is just magical. You make good and bad decisions in life. Those who choose to act for good keep their lives and the baddies get served their justice.Personally, among his many incredible and touching films, this truly does shine as Steven Spielberg's greatest movie. It will stay in my heart and many other's forever more as a highlight of cinema experiences in our childhoods. Who could help but cheer as a young child when Indie runs along the submarine's top!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The classic action flick.,"Indiana Jones. One of the most famous and timeless action film series of all time. I love them! Okay I love 2 of them. But either way Indiana Jones is still a timeless classic. And Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite of them. In 1936 Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones (Harrison Ford) is an archaeologist who is recruited by the US Government to find and protect the ark of the covenant before Nazis do. The Nazis are led by Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Along the way Indiana is helped by his old girlfriend Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and his buddy Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). With a great story, fun action scenes, and great characters this is one of my all time favorite movies. Number 14 to be exact. If you haven't seen it, go do that right now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Easy to see why it's a classic,"I'm only what? 42 years late to the party?Finally watched this film and it didn't disappoint. There truly were some amazing movies made in the 80s! Raiders of the Lose Ark is one of them. A good plot, fun action, moments of suspense, and especially considering the time period, some great methods of stunt acting and make up/effects work.I was engrossed in the movie from start to finish. The acting was a bit cheesy at times, and some of the elements of production didn't necessarily age in the smoothest of ways, but it has aged far better than some movies that are even newer.It is no wonder this role cemented Harrison Ford in Hollywood history!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Simply the greatest action /adventure film of all time.,"What can you say about this film that's not already been said? Raiders of the lost Ark is an absolute masterpiece, Harrison Ford was great as han solo but he was just perfect here. Compared to it's sequels, this film just feels more gritty and grounded in the main (though last crusade tried to emulate it) the violence in it is visceral and more brutal than it's supposed family-appeal status, in short, in a lot of respects this was 'die hard' years before Bruce pulled on the vest, it's an absolute blast of a film that never fails to entertain through any of it's runtime and for me, has taken on timeless classic status, in no small part to the stunning cinematography and outstanding John Williams score. Everything about this film is just brilliant, the villains are excellent and the humour is placed well. There is literally nothing to complain about, it's pretty much the perfect movie.This film is a stone cold classic and can hold it's head up high against any film in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
30 years later,Just re watched this movie recently and was I ever impressed. Its film one of the 80s trilogy with a forth a film that followed that came out a few years ago. If you're looking for a fun action packed movie then this is a film you can count on. The special effects were great and still hold up surprisingly well compared to todays era of CGI. These older films forced everyone making them to use their imagination more and its awesome to see. The music is amazing too and each scene really captivates you and keeps you waiting to see what happens next. Great film along with the two sequels that followed in the 80s. If you haven't seen any of the Indiana Jones movies I suggest you start now.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the Best Movies i ever Watched!,I don't know what I can say about this Movie that hasn't been said a thousand times. It is clearly one of the best adventure Movies EVER!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders Of The Film Vault : RiffTrax,"It's a film I hadn't seen for years, until just now when the little one and I watched the RiffTrax version. We used to avidly follow MST3K's erratic adventures on Sci-Fi Channel UK until axed in the early Noughties, now it's reborn we've found a whole old new world out there to see again anew!Story has hunky archaeologist trying to discover and then rescue the Ark of the Covenant through a sea of sweaty action adventures with Nazis, Arabs and snakes but this time with the bonus of 3 disembodied voices constantly taking the mickey out of everyone and everything on screen. As with all of the MST3K past classics it can be hit and miss  the misses are cues for the tumbleweed but when they hit it can be side-splitting stuff. I agree with my daughter in that I think they were better tearing into terrible old and/or dubbed movies (who can forget the unclassic Prince Of Space?), but they obviously would like to reach a broader audience with shorter memories  and as they say, some movies ask for it! This is the only way to see modern films, the only trouble being the process is irreversible - to watch the original in the original frame of mind ever again is impossible. I have no idea how they've got round copyright issues, just glad they did  or if they didn't, keep on running boys!The film itself? There can't be really much left to say about a film that has sunk into movie-fans collective consciousness like this one has - it was OK then, but it's much better now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One Of The All-Time Greats,"It was released over 40 years ago and set a standard for action/adventure movies that's yet to be equalled. By now some of the effects appear dated, but otherwise this movie is superlative in every aspect: plot, dialogue, characters, performances, stunts, score, humor, pace and direction. It deftly balances a light tone with some fairly dark implications to provide characters that seem both relatable and unpredictable. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have disreputable charisma to burn in the lead roles. The villains, too, are sophisticated in their amalgamation of menance and banality. They're not supervillians with grandiose plans for personal domination but rather functionaries ruthlessly pursuing their objectives. The movie is engaging from start to finish and showcases Steven Spielberg at the top of his game.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A perfect example that defines the classic style of Hollywood!,"After seeing the original Star Wars trilogy and the prequels, I watched another movie that had Harrison Ford (Han Solo from the original trilogy) in another film series (I was a 90s kid watching some stuff from my childhood days until a few years later, I stumbled upon this at my teenager years and I'm still 18). I guess some of you know the premise of this film: A hat-wearing treasure hunter guy with a kick-a** whip trying to find a treasure while getting the girl of his dreams and gets into lots of booby traps along the way. I thought to myself, ""Wow. That is what I call an epic premise"" and this movie is a perfect example of great cinema that defines the classic Hollywood style.It takes place in the year 1936 where Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles in South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap doing so, miraculously, he escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to humanly existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Renee Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it. With the story now said, no wonder this is a fabulously well-done feature from Steven Spielberg and it's one of his greatest ones next to ET and Jaws.The story in this movie is a much more compelling one with a great mixture of action, adventure, humor, and romance. It also has some great visual style, some brilliant costumes and make-ups, and some of the most gripping action sequences only to be outmatched by it's excellent cast of characters like Harrison Ford as the swashbuckling Indy, Karen Allen as the beautiful and bada** Marion and Paul Freeman as a great villain and John Rhys-Davies as a Cairo digger and John Williams' memorable and light-hearted musical score that fits very well throughout the film.Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is, and always will be, one of the greatest films ever made to cinema and is always worth watching. This deserves a solid thumbs up from me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great for 12 year old boys,"I was twelve when I first watched this and it wowed me. It helped that I knew nothing about it going in, and had no expectations(I'd been going to see 'Clash of the Titans' but there were no seats so opted for this instead. Adored it then, entertained though mildly irritated by it now. It is not an adult film and should not be seen by adults who remember it fondly. The joins in the plot show far more, the setting up of 'memorable' moments calculated to make an audience respond like children in a sideshow - i.e use of spiders and snakes, a jeckyll and hyde hero (teacher turned adventurer) bumbling Nazis. It is a super hero film pure and simple, with mild humor - it needed more of this, which the second film remedied - and not very original shocks. Of course it is made with the full force of the Hollywood film industry behind it (imagine a Goliath holding up an ant)and Spielberg stages the action scenes very well. But the whole mumbo jumbo story coupled with the embarrassing music, starts to grate. There are some fringe benefits for the oldies: John Rhys Davies' booming voice, Karen Allen's scene with the French baddie - she obviously prefers him to Indy who forgets her in seconds when he's 'digging' or whatever. The gleaming photography of desert landscapes and middle eastern towns is evocative, though in some ways too good for the material - it evokes more emotion than the plot or the actors, whose only real emotions are made of of grunts and shrieks. This is partly why the comedy doesn't totally work - the photography undermines it. Still the whole thing is fine if you're about to sprout your first pimple, but you wish they spent this much effort and talent on something that resonated more and not comic books. This is one of the films that kicked off the whole superhero mania that still crowds out anything more 'thoughtful' these days.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The beginning of a classic, they say","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsThe film opens with our hero, Indy Jones (Harrison Ford) on one of his expeditions in the caves, which nearly goes disasterously wrong. But he survives and is back to his day job as a lecturer at a high school. But it is there that he is approached by a group of men to hunt down a mystical ark that will point in many directions when shone under the sun. But along the way, old flames, murderous Nazis and treacherous foreigners all conspire to stand in his way.25 years ago, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas teamed up with leading man Harrison Ford to bring us Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film that 25 years on, is still hailed as a classic of it's sort.Ford's a good choice of lead for this sort of thing. As an actor he's not particularly expressive, but as an action hero with presence he does just nicely. But he's one of the main commendable things I could find with this film.As a big grand spectacle it may be something, but it doesn't develop the most engaging characters or story to go along with it as we just sort of 'open up in the action', with Ford and some cohorts on their first big grand adventure. When the action scenes do arrive, they are fairly spectacular, but they're strangely unplentiful and one or two of them are a little bloody and violent for a PG film.I know this is a film with legions of fans and there are some 'classic' movies I've been able to get into and accept as brilliant. But maybe Indiana Jones will be one of those ones that just doesn't rub with me. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"One of the Best Films Ever Made, Inspired the Action Genre","Raiders of the Lost Ark is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, a brave adventurer who just so happens to be in a race against the Nazis to uncover the Ark of the Covenant, an item that comes straight from the Bible. Indy must gather friends in order to beat enemies, and overcome his foes against all odds, to prevent them from parading the Ark around as a weapon.Raiders is one of Spielberg's first big films, behind Jaws (1975), and he nailed it. This film is loved by children and adults alike, and will never be forgotten. He brought terror like never seen before to the big screen with Jaws, and with Raiders he created, as well as popularized, a new genre of film: action. This movie has inspired many action films, such as Die Hard (1988), The Matrix (1999), or even T2: Judgement Day (1991). Thanks to this movie, we get to see action movies regularly, whether they're good or bad.The best thing about this movie is of course one of the most iconic film characters of all time, Indiana Jones. It's crazy that this movie came out 35 years ago, and one can still pick up an Indiana Jones figure at your nearby Walmart. Harrison Ford does amazing as Indy, showing that audience that he can play more that just one awesome character. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is also a good casting choice, and Marion is still my favorite Indy love interest today.The direction Spielberg handled this movie in is amazing. All of the action is filmed so nicely, with not too many cuts, and clean transition when there are some. The best part of this film, the truck scene, is filmed absolutely perfectly, with no disturbances whatsoever, thanks to the fantastic camera work. This nicely shot action is also due to Harrison Ford doing his own stunts. Unlike most actor working today, save for Tom Cruise, Ford did all of his own stunts, assuring that Spielberg could get close ups of his face during the action scenes. These two elements combined make for some white knuckled action, very abundant throughout Raiders of the Lost Ark.The last thing I'll say about Raiders is the villain. There's an old saying that goes, ""a movie's only as good as its villain."" Although the viewer doesn't receive much backstory about the villain, he's still very intimidating, thanks to his army of Germans doing his dirty work for him. Paul Freeman's Belloq is a great character, that supposedly goes a long way back with Indy, however this is all we really know about him. Even though the audience doesn't know much about his background, he's still fleshed out as a character, and his tension with Indy is phenomenal.Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is easily one of the best films ever made, thanks to its acting, villain, and incredible action. I'm going to give Raiders of the Lost Ark an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Fantastic!,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest action films of all-time. At its core, the movie's a popcorn extravaganza but there is so much more to it. For instance, the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is perfect, which brings the romantic element of this film to a degree far above any other action film I can think of. In so many cases, love interests in any action film seem tacked on at best, but ""Raiders"" is the exact opposite of that.Of course, what would an action film be without some exciting chase sequences? This movie certainly has its share of them, and they are all spectacular. It certainly doesn't hurt that Ford does many of his own stunts, which helps a lot when one is looking for realism in an action movie. Also, John Williams' musical score moves along the action at an exciting pace. It might just be my favorite film score! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" comes with my highest recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best action and adventure movies ever made.,"This movie is a masterwork in so many different ways, from the acting to directing and writing to the entertainment value. Harrison Ford is perfectas Indiana Jones to the point where I can't see anyone else in the role. All the other acting is great, especially Karen Allen as Marion and Paul Freeman as Belloq. The snappy and clever writing by Lawrence Kasdan and the all-around amazing directing by Steven Spielberg are amazing and are perfect for this movie. The action is exciting and very frightening in some places. The movie has an incredible flow and also does a great job at introducing Indiana Jones as a character and at the same time also is a masterwork as a fun movie you can watch on a Friday night.Everything in this movie is the definition of what a great movie is, everything in this movie is simply incredible. John Williams, as always gives one of the best scores ever made for the screen, the directing, writing, acting and everything in this movie is simply masterful. The ending is amazing and Raiders of the Lost Ark is still a movie I can watch anytime and still be entertained and awe-inspired by. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of movies, and that's really all I have to say. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Great adventure, great story line, great special effects, great visuals, so genre specific it might not be for everyone.","Occasinaly, there comes a movie, that you know is extraordinary in many ways and yet, because it is very specific in it's appeal, you can appreciate it while not being very deeply involved in it personally. That was the case, for me, with Raiders.A great movie to be sure and jam packed with more action and adventure them almost any other movie I've seen. Yet because, I am not a fan of this type of movie I saw it once and, while appreciating it, really had no strong desire to see it again. It is, as many of it's most ardent fans write, completely unique and I will admit certain moments got me. It's an extravaganza of adventure not often seen and one thought I had with this movie is how real it looked and felt (and how incredibly difficult to film it must have been.) But I still would would not rank it as one of my favorites. It remains a movie who's fierce beauty and power I can appreciate and have a healthy respect for while not having any strong desire to see it again-though I am glad I saw it at least once. I can appreciate this film's high rank on IMDb and understand it, if I was to cite 1 reason why I did not fall in love with Raiders, it's simply because it's just not my genre. I would estimate if I had to pick a movie that was known to be one of the best that did not appeal to me and that I did not really get into all that much, while still admiring many of it's aspects Raiders would be that movie. Although,all these years later I can still feel the film's power.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A very good start to a very good series of movies,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, a start to a massive franchise of movies and one of the most consistently liked movies ever. With big action, sly humour and of course top acting from Harrison Ford, it is hard not to dislike this movie and it's many qualities. That all said I do still feel this is slightly overrated, not in a way where I think it is bad and others good, only that I feel it is not the most perfect film ever.As said Harrison Ford is our star man playing well Indiana Jones, he makes the archaeologist look like an action man and also can have a few laughs too, just don't involve snakes. As for the rest of the cast well it kind of splits, Karen Allen I wasn't so sure on, she isn't bad but I just couldn't believe her well enough. Actors such as Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davis and Ronald Lacey make it even more fun and also sinister, the film knows how to get the right balance of good and evil.As for the man directing the whole thing, Steven Spielberg, well for me he does a good job but not a great job, he is consistent but I didn't think it was overly awesome. And now for what I consider this movies biggest flaw, the script. It is just not that good and although fans of the movies will say that it is what makes this so good, I can only disagree as I feel the whole story from George Lucas is the best thing, not the screenplay from Lawrence Kasdan. And on that, the story, and what a gem of a plot we have here, unravels nicely but never gets too slow, the action is well timed and the comedy in-between is unique.With the script maybe being my only problem, then the score is just a little chip in the whole work, a kind of slight inconvenience(at times). I have never heard a score that is so good but then suddenly so annoying, when the action comes around I dislike it, but when the others scenes that have John Williams score in come, they are good, it is quite strange. I must also add here in terms of technical things, the locations and sets are stunning, well designed but not too corny either, a big well done to the team on that one and also to the cinematography from Douglas Slocombe who's skill this movie owes a lot to as well.Listen this film may be flawless and I might be missing something, or maybe my review just seems a little too mean. The movie is very entertaining don't get me wrong and I would re-watch this many times but I just feel I am among the minority who don't think this is that that great, even though I think it is great even. Nevertheless this is the kind of film anyone can enjoy, any age, any film genre fan, all can have fun watching this legendary piece of cinema. On that previous point, some viewers may get scared by the numerous fake dead bodies, so always remember that before you have nightmares.One thing I often see about this film is people saying it is the first of it's kind, and I agree it is but another point to make on that is that, when you set a benchmark for film like this, your movie although the first of it's kind, must also try to be the best of all that follow it. Basically what I'm trying to say is, don't watch this like your still whatever age you were when it first came out, I mean for newer fans they have many adventure film for this to compare to, and I find that it is Spielberg, Lucas and Phil Kaufman's(who helped with the whole story and script) job to make this one of the best even in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

One of the Best Ever,"This is right up at the top of my list for one of the best movies ever. Okay, so maybe I'm shallow compared to some of you but for me this movie has it all! It is one of those films that comes along rarely it is flawless! The casting for each and every character is perfect! Harrison Ford was born to play this character; seldom have I seem such an amazing performance by an actor Alec Guinness and Peter O'Toole included. His every expression and reaction is a joy to watch. He embodies Indiana Jones so well that this character will be what he is remembered for most - even over Han Solo.Steven Spielberg was at his height when he directed this movie. If this movie wasn't so much fun it would have been showered with the awards that it deserved.Though this movie looked back to the films of the past it will be one of the films that embodies the 1980s.For years I just had a VHS fullscreen copy and when I got a widescreen laserdisc copy it was like watching a whole different film! It's so much fun and so well made that if you have never watched this movie - do. the excitement and adventure doesn't let up until the end. It never bogs down and it is really hard not to enjoy this movie... even if you don't think it is your cup of tea.I could go on and on about this movie!

Grand Silliness,"I loved this movie. Harrison Ford is great as Indiana Jones. It is basically a comic book movie that doesn't take itself seriously. There are no shades of gray in this movie, either. The bad guys are bad, and the good guys are good. George Lucas understands what a movie like this needs to be. It is a thrill ride. There are surprises with the special effects, and surprises with the dialog through the whole movie, but the story line is very predictable.But that's OK...it's like going on your favorite roller coaster over and over again.

A Cinematic Masterpiece For The Ages,"What do you get with Steven Spielberg behind the camera, George Lucas serving as the creator and executive producer, Harrison Ford as the lead along with great score, story, humor,romance,supporting actors and a iconic opening scene? You get Raiders of the Lost Ark.With Harrison Ford riding on his success after starring in the hit space opera Star Wars, he was Lucas' first choice for the titular role.Little did the public know something big was coming.After the release, people were dazzled by the film's uniqueness and the unforgettable visual effects. Harrison Ford became every girl's crush just like the ones in the film.Spielberg had just made one of the greatest action films of all time.The film opens in 1936 with Indy after a golden idol worshiped by the tribal people in Peru.He's accompanied by a young Spanish man named Satipo, portrayed by a young Alfred Molina. What follows is a iconic opening to remember.Back in America after returning, Indy is approached by government officials to stop the Nazis from obtaining the Ark of the Covenant and thus do the former before them.Indy then travels from Tibet after approaching love interest Marion portrayed by Karen Allen in humorous fashion to Cairo where the film's best moments occur.From memorable and hilarious Sallah to the iconic fight with the Arabs, Cairo remains the film's best location.After encounters with nemesis Belloq and the Nazis and a high octane car chase,the film enters its iconic and nail-biting climax.The climax is a really good one and avoids being disappointing.Also,the negative characters are really good, with Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq in a quite a funky performance and Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, who was perhaps the most hated character in the movie.He was someone I loved to hate.Overall, Indiana Jones and The Raiders if The Lost Ark is a marvelous film with iconic action, stellar performances, visual effects, memorable action scenes,humor and not to forget the iconic score.It has a certain charm which isn't present in the later installments,even in the almost-superior The Last Crusade.It is one of those rare movies you wish you could watch for the first time again.It's just that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The adventure of a lifetime!,"When it comes to picking my favorite Steven Spielberg film, I never quite know which one to choose. To make things easier, I divided the movies in two categories: serious and ""popcorn"" (in the good sense of the word, naturally). As far as the first group is concerned, there is no doubt: the best of the serious films is Schindler's List, tightly followed by Saving Private Ryan. But in the blockbuster group, the dilemma emerges again: Jaws? E.T.? Close Encounters? They're all so good it's damn near impossible to select an absolute favorite. And then a series of images and sounds come to mind: boulders, Nazis, snakes, the legendary theme by John Williams, and many others, all related to the best trilogy of the '80s (yes, even better than Star Wars), and most of all to the unsurpassed first installment: Raiders of the Lost Ark.Explicitly conceived by George Lucas as a revival of the adventure serials he enjoyed as a kid, Raiders has one word written all over it: fun. That's its reason to exist, and it never fails to deliver on those terms. From the moment archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is introduced, surviving death traps in South America, you know you're in for two hours of flawless entertainment: starting in the jungle, continuing in the desert and climaxing on a mountain top, Raiders takes Indiana, and the viewer, around the world on a never-ending ride disguised as the quest for the Ark of the Covenant.The magic of the film, as pointed out by Total Film, is all in Spielberg's approach to the story: the sillier the concept, the less seriously you have to take it. Several lesser directors (Michael Bay first and foremost) have done exactly the opposite, sucking all the fun out of the picture. Raiders, on the other hand, rises above all its imitators because it knows how far from realistic Lawrence Kasdan's terrific screenplay is and turns that into an asset: Hitler's passion for the occult might even be based on fact, but the chances of Nazis cooperating with a French scumbag (Paul Freeman, excellent) to retrieve a source of unlimited mystic power are slim to say the least. Yeah, so what? The dialogue is consistently quotable, the music instantly hummable and the action scenes justly deemed some of the best ever filmed.And then there's Ford: humane, sardonic, occasionally rude, occasionally a bad-ass, constantly lovable. Having already worked with Lucas on American Graffiti and Star Wars, he knows the right way to play the part and does so with utmost perfection. His charisma is ideally matched by Indiana's fundamental quality: he is no superhero, just a regular person who gets dragged in extraordinary situations. Also, for a genre defined by the charms of James Bond, he is all but invincible with the ladies, his love-hate relationship with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the first and best of the ""Indy girls"", going in the most unexpected directions for the whole duration of the feature. He's a unique character, aided by equally unique sidekicks (Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies) in a most outstanding genre picture.To be brief: there is no reason why Raiders of the Lost Ark, alongside the other Indy movies, shouldn't be on every must-see list in the world. The Indiana Jones trilogy is a faultless combination of B-movie spirit and A-list talent that can't be described as a simple series of adventure or action films: it practically constitutes a genre of its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Snakes: Indy Jones Don't Play That Game,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" took me years to appreciate. It's still not one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it's still a great film. Why? Not because of its unbeatable star power (Steven Spielberg directs; George Lucas co-writes the story; Harrison Ford stars), but because of its fantastic action sequences, its wonderfully edge-of-your-seat story, and that amazing music by John Williams.""Raiders"" is the first film in a series about Indiana Jones (Ford), a snake-fearing adventurer who faces off against villains to defend treasures and history. In this film, he must find the sacred Ark of the Covenant-- rumored to hold the fragments of the Ten Commandment tablets-- before the wicked Nazis get their hands on it. And along the way, you'd better believe it's a road fraught with peril and-- you guessed it-- snakes!Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies add a lot of color to the cast (as does Denholm Elliott in a brief but memorable role), but it wouldn't have meant anything without a dynamite script, brilliant direction, the music, and beautiful cinematography that goes pitch-perfect with the film's appropriate editorial pace. Moments of the film are a bit on the rough side in terms of styling and visualization, but they don't detract as much as they could from the general feel of the movie.Which is ""fun.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
How to ensure that relics will become history,"If you first time hearing the name Indiana Jones, you must be either a toddler or a time traveler. The symbol of adventures and a daredevil that will do everything to get his hands on priceless artifacts has become the common reference that keeps haunting all whip owners.We all know that mostly the work of a history teacher or even a real archeologist often excludes the adrenaline rush that was floating in the minds of eager students enrolling to a history 101. Here Harrison Ford who rocks the hell out of the leather jacket and the hat or just an ordinary everyday suit opens a secret door to the hidden desires of any class inhabitant.From hot to cold, from dry to wet he goes, sneaking as a mouse or running like a mad elephant. Resting comes only in the routine hours of passing the knowledge to book-dwelling student. Steven Spielberg's love to the details is omnipresent: in the auditorium, in the tomb, even in the plain desert. The immense job of building the decorations makes you feel like a real-life raider searching for remnants of the past.Unexpected threats pop up as soon as the thrill from a previous one stops ringing in your head. The chemistry of the characters stirred with the danger is a perfect cocktail to finish the movie in one gulp and then immediately stretch your shaking hand for another round. Epic score follows every step that you do, charging any moment until it starts bursting with sparks.Putting the hat over a rolled whip and closing a suitcase I would note that the movie started its own history that is rolling like a boulder from a hill: it will stop some time but I believe that it won't be soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

This is such a classic, and has such a nostalgic feel to it. Indiana Jones is one of the greatest characters of all time, and I love how he's so balanced. He often fumbles through his situations, but is also charming. He's so layered, and always has a one-liner and some sort of escape plan. Marion is such a good love interest, as she's incredibly spunky, but she also has her flaws. Belloq is such a slimy villain, and I love how he's a dark reflection of Indy. This film actually has a great ensemble of villains and heroes. Toht is such a creepy antagonist. Sallah is a fun ally, and I think this film has such perfect casting. The settings here are also gorgeous, and the shot compositions in this film are spectacular. The way the shadows are incorporated, as well as the time of day are some of my favorite cinematic shots.

Harrison Ford has made the most watched and loved movie trilogy of all time.,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a thrilling movie filled with imagination and speed, capturing the essence of adolescence through pulp adventure magazines, Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, comics, and movies. The film celebrates the stories we found in pulp adventure magazines, and every shot in the film resembles a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories. The hero faces daring exploits and death-defying threats in the next ten seconds, leaving viewers breathless and dizzy. The film is an adventure catalog, featuring locations such as South America's jungles, Tibet's hinterlands, Egypt's deserts, a hidden submarine base, an isolated island, a forgotten tomb, and an American archaeology classroom. The villains include Nazis, slimy gravediggers, drunken Sherpas, and scheming Frenchmen. The film climaxes with the wrath of God and follows a series of events, including tarantulas, boulders, hidden spears, falling rock slabs, burning airplanes, runaway trucks, sealed tombs, and snakes. The transportation mode is a mix of horse carts, biplanes, motorcycles, submarines, ships, horses, trains, and trucks, with no bicycles. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his girlfriend, Marion (Karen Allen), are heroes in the 1936 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Marion, a woman who moved to Tibet to escape Indiana's defecation, is mad at men and moves to the mountains to open a bar. Indy, an American archaeologist, discovers that the Nazis believe they have discovered the Ark of the Covenant, the golden casket used by the ancient Hebrews to hold the Ten Commandments. Indy's mission is to beat the Nazis to the prize, and he flies to Tibet to collect Marion and a priceless medallion. The film's plot holds together and makes sense, despite its use as a framework for incredible action and stunt set pieces. The film features Indiana and Marion spending the entire film hanging by their fingernails, even over a pit of poisonous snakes.

The film features Indiana and Marion spending the entire film hanging by their fingernails, even over poisonous snake pits. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a technological triumph due to its sense of humor and droll style of characters. While the movie lacks many laughs through dialogue and only a few obvious gags, it is filled with surprise, relief, and incredulity due to its inexhaustible series of inventions. The central characters are incredibly winning, with Harrison Ford as Indy Jones creating a taciturn, understated, stubborn character who survives fires, crushings, shootings, and burnings. Karen Allen plays the female lead with a resilient toughness that develops its own charm, able to handle herself in any situation and hates snakes. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a thrilling adventure epic, reminiscent of Star Wars, Superman, and James Bond films. It's a multimillion-dollar special-effects extravaganza that succeeds in entertaining audiences. Recommended with familiar companions. Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark quickly became the standard for adventure films, surpassing the crude matinee serials that inspired it. Building on previous models like The Adventures of Robin Hood and John Huston/Humphrey Bogart's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The African Queen, it had a significant impact on culture, influencing both skilled and non-skilled knock-offs, and influencing commercial mediums. The Atari 2600 game Pitfall! Was a personal favorite. Raiders, a box-office phenomenon since 1981, has inspired numerous sequels, but none have replicated the same level of excitement and magic. The first lesson is to be Steven Spielberg, a director with a deft, intuitive feel for image-making and storytelling on a large scale. The second lesson is challenging, as replicating the bigness of Raiders, including its globetrotting locales, historical backdrop, and wall-to-wall action sequences, misses nearly everything that makes it great. As with all Spielberg films, the least expensive touches are the most significant. While some of the more lasting images from Raiders cost a lot of money, Spielberg's gift for lighting, framing, reaction shots, and visual sleights-of-hand often make the deepest impression. The opening dissolve from the Paramount logo to a South American mountaintop, soft golden light emanating from a coveted idol, Indy's unmistakable shadow darkening the doorway of his ex-lover's bar in Nepal, the sunset silhouette of an archaeological dig in Cairo, and the sly comedy of the villain's medallion-scarred hand revealing itself with the ""Sieg Heil"" salute make Raiders a timeless classic. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic Spielberg film, featuring action set pieces, old-fashioned romance, and historical hokum. The story is written by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman, and the dialogue is sparkling. The film feels like a childhood adventure, drawn from forgotten serials, comics, and sword-and-sandal epics. It's a sophisticated rendering of unsophisticated material, done with peerless craft, showcasing Spielberg's mastery of storytelling and storytelling. The film's boyish spirit and quotation marks allow the audience to accept a cartoonish vision of the world and history. Jones is a dashing intellect on a mission to unearth precious antiquities for public study. The indigenous masses and sword-wielding goons chase him in South America and Cairo are abstracted from sources other than reality. The Nazis and French rival Belloq (Paul Freeman) have their own strategies, with Indy's hard work being rewarded before taking his treasures away. Raiders is a more streamlined effort to wring the second world war for bawdy entertainment, as clean and satisfying as a punch square in a henchman's jaw. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film directed by Ralph Fiennes, who replaces the stereotype of a Gestapo agent with a Nazi camp lieutenant. The film feels connected by the spiritual desecration of Nazism, represented by the Ark of the Covenant, which Hitler wants to deploy as a weapon of unimaginable occult power. The film allows itself to consider the war in the simplest possible terms, framing Nazism as a crime against God, as profane, hubristic, and evil. The film is devoted to delighting its audience without the complications of deeper themes and subtexts, much less psychological complexity. The film features good guys and bad guys, locked in a mighty struggle to save or destroy the world. The romance between Indy and his ex, Marion, is copied from the frisky chemistry shared by Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in The African Queen. The score by John Williams is unforgettable, with its unforgettable main theme held back until the moment Indy swings on his first vine. Spielberg, perhaps the greatest pure film-maker of his generation, orchestrates sequences with excitement and wit. The film offers a clinic on suspense techniques, from the simple scene of Indy toying around with a poisoned date to the multi-planed action on the tarmac where he and Marion fend off Nazis while a gas leak inches closer to flame. On repeat viewings, smaller details to savor, like the way dirt billows from Indy's shirt as he crests a hill in the opening or the ground-level framing of him from behind a roused cobra after he drops into the Well of Souls. Film history seems to be speaking through Spielberg in Raiders of the Lost Ark, harnessing all he's learned about westerns, swashbucklers, sword-and-sandal epics, and war adventures. Forty years later, it's still an education.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
groundbreaking yet average,"Hmm. I guess that was a good movie. I mean, it had good parts, and they lasted for longer than average. And they had a good cast. Really the best thing about this movie is the music. Don't get me wrong, I love me some harrison ford, but dang it, the man cannot act. I guess that's what makes him so enjoyable. In all, a good movie, I think. Not Ford's best, and certainly not a great movie. Great music though. And the setting was cool. And I guess the cinematography/transitions were not bad, especially for 1981. An iconic, trendsetting, kinda lackluster but nevertheless enjoyable movie in its own above-average-but-still-kinda-disappointing way. Last Crusade was so much better.

Kiss Me Deadly Around the World in 80 Days,"This cultural legacy is still a movie of splendid imagination and swift pace that clutches you with its very first playful image, dashes you through a progression of remarkable escapades, and drops you back in reality two hours later with a juvenile smirk. This movie commemorates the stories we exhausted our youth plowing through in comics and movies, where the hero gets out of bed wondering what intrepid feats and shocking terror he'll be surviving in the next couple minutes. And indeed, it marks off the rainforests of South America, the surroundings of Tibet, the barrenness of Egypt, a clandestine submarine base, a remote island, an ancient cryptand an American archaeology classroom. Our hero tangles with vicious Nazis, slippery gravediggers, inebriated Sherpas and devious Frenchmen. It all culminates in the literal wrath of God, building to that dazzling meltdown with tarantulas, boulders, spears, falling rock, flaming airplanes, runaway trucks, preserved tombs and of course, snakes, all the while riding horse carts, biplanes, motorcycles, submarines, ships, trains and trucks.Indy and Marion outlive a chain of ghastly snares, tricks, surprise attacks and doom worse than mortality of which Lucas, Gordon and Kaufman propose numerous, Karen Allen equaling Ford bit by bit through the film's romantic, comic and action-tilting requirements: A drinker and fighter, Marion is promptly established as no measly damsel in distress. And one chase features a truck, three jeeps, a horse, a motorcycle and a tremendously arduous stunt in which a character must achieve a 360-degree rotation of the racing truck. All is realized with the touch of a master entertainer at the helm, merging stunts, visual effects, painstaking technique and pure sweat. The crucial bounty sought by Jones, Belloq (Moriarty to Indy's Holmes), the U.S. government and the Nazis alike is the Ark of the Covenant.Two elements make this defining film more than merely a triumph of spectacle: Its sense of humor and the quaint stylishness of its characters. This is time and again a hilarious film, the biggest laugh coming from the ancient and obvious gag involving a sword and a gun. And to the standard of the 1940s' Lone Ranger, Dick Tracy and Flash Gordon serials, the personalities of the crucial characters are extremely charming. In this first outing, Ford creates an aloof, modest, persistent character.Raiders of the Lost Ark is like the dieselpunk successor to The 39 Steps, Saboteur and North By Northwest, relentlessly putting the action in adventure. Lucas' idea was to imbue with fresh energy an old dramatic style, with its thrill-seeking, sharply winding composition always building to exciting release. It takes us back to our youth. Virtually all summer movies today attempt that, but it's easy to become immersed in today's dime-a-dozen blockbuster dreck and forget the true profundity of difference between saying that about a mediocre film and about a Spielberg film, the Indiana Jones phenomenon in a very distinct way. Today's Armageddons, Snakes on a Planes, REDs, Fast and Furiouses, Wild Wild Wests, Sucker Punches, Die Hard 4's, and yes even Indiana Jones 4's try to achieve their errand by being childish instead of childlike. The original Indiana Jones trilogy, beginning here, is the quintessential template.Ford brings every scrap of his terse appeal and physicality to his Indiana Jones, a reserved professor who releases his inner gallant in vigorous quest for fortune and glory in precious artifacts that belong in a museum. One of the moments that connect us to Indy is when he's slipping off of the side of a bottomless pit, having hardly caught hold of a root protruding from the earth. Spielberg cuts to a close-up of Indy, smiling in respite, but when we go back to wide, the root yanks out of the earth and he's about to fall into the void. That close-up unites us with Indy, that momentary ""Whew!"" amidst all the chaos.Spielberg gives dutifully focused meticulousness to clever and resourceful action sequences, scored with exactness by John Williams. The stunts, photography and editing so conscientiously applied to the myriad chases and scuffles are the gauge for action-adventure films since in their lucidity and vigor. The quest is the whole, with Jones showing his nerve, but ultimately meeting consuming powers with wonder and humility. The religious tinges and sweeps against mortality are crafty pickings on the part of Spielberg and Lucas. They know moviegoers want to lose control and get excited, to devote themselves to a story not just to defer disbelief, but to believe. Reality can hold its horses for now.Raiders endures for numerous reasons, not least of which is due to Spielberg's supreme dexterity as a visual storyteller and his knack for finding electric performances in his actors that nevertheless slip right into the whole cacophony. His style is masterful, and yet invisible. Every individual set piece is breathtaking in its tempo, joke delivery and emotional upshot. The scene in Marion's Nepalese bar begins with a beefy drinking game. This is promptly trailed by some romantic friction as Indy returns to her life and they parley over a supposedly missing relic she might still possess. Eventually, Nazis arrive led by a dark, goggled, panting sadist. The action that ensues has everybody giving the mortal skirmish their all, but it's all the punctuating details that make it unforgettable, bullets puncturing a barrel of whiskey and Marion leaning over to guzzle some before it spills, Indy wrestling with a brute whose arm is aflame, and the Nazi ringleader ordering his machine gun-wielding henchman to just shoot them both. Unlike most present-day action films, Spielberg crafts dynamic pictures with diverse on screen action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The film is extremely well-made, successfully combining adventure, mystery, comedy, and some romance. Its runtime felt breezy and was easy to get through while being entertained the entire time. The only critique I have is that the ending felt a bit too abrupt and not properly explained, but other than that this movie is perfect in my eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

For example, digging through the sand while getting chased by the bad guys is rather fun to see. And I certainly enjoyed most of it.However, the ending seemed a little trite. That being the cheesy effects when the Ark is opened. I know its an 80s movie, but it seemed a little too unreal for me.Overall, its well done. Harrison Ford can go home now.

Looks beautiful,"I wanted to rewatch this because people are saying it's the best or one of the best of the Indy movies but I don't remember much about it, apart from the chamber with the snakes and what happens after they open the Ark so I wasn't even sure that I had watched it, although I think I did when I was very young.So I love the way this movie looks, the colours, the filters, the natural sets, the architecture, the exotic locations and everything. As for the plot and the action, it's very much as per the formula, fights, prolonged chases and all that, even if this is the first one. So I know young me absolutely must have loved this, unfortunately I have no recollection of doing so. Same as with Relic Hunter, I absolutely loved that show, now I feel some nostalgia, but I'm not nearly as excited as I used to be, apart from seeing the two main leads and some of the sets and old buildings and structures. I guess I have lost that sense of wonder and it would take a much more subtle and curated production and a smarter and consistent storyline to impress me now.I love Harrison Ford and the visuals but I had to deduct points because watching it didn't give me enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Some of the famous shots and some types of settings are certainly worth writing into history, and the action parts and comedy details perfectly guarantee the narrative's getting better and better. However, the use of paranormal endings actually undermines the shaping of heroic images and legends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Spiritual Implications?,"I loved this movie when it came out as most did. Rewatched it again for the first time in a long time. I am with the reviewer who marveled at the PG rating. But what gets me is that no reviewer is reflecting on the spiritual implications the plot of the movie suggests. At the front of the movie, the Indy character goes for historical biblical authenticity but discounts its spiritual reality. By the end he is surely a believer. The plot most definitely suggests that the Hebrew God not only exists, but jealously guards the ark he commissioned Moses to create as the seat of His Presence. But all Indy or his museum ally suggest is that ark is really powerful and needs to be researched (right). Beloq, in the movie had more spiritual sense than they did. At least he donned the high priestly garb before opening the ark. Unfortunately for him, he was not a real Levite, nor were any of the German soldiers. Consequently they all received an Old Testament style judgment. Here's the reality: At Jesus' death, the veil that kept out the average Joe from the Most Holy Place in the Jewish temple was torn in two. The Person and Presence of God has since moved out and into the heart of every believer who accepts Jesus (God's sacrifice for sin) in their place. God is not content to be a movie convention or literary device! As someone said once, ""If there is no God, nothing matters; if there is a God, then nothing else matters!""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Despite many flaws, this is truly entertaining.","There's so much here to love and so much to loathe. Much of what happens can only happen in a comedy and not a serious action adventure. Too much is unbelievable and for effect and the convenience of the story only.Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones and makes a likable hero. The only problem I have with this character, is how easily (and seemingly mercilessly) he randomly kills people. Interesting, considering he is a professor. Marion (Karen Young) just as easily kills people left, right and centre without blinking an eye. But then again, we don't really know her background, so she might be a cold-blooded killer for all I know.The slapstick humor at times ruins the suspense and excitement of the film, but I suppose Spielberg didn't want to make the film too serious (interesting then where all the killings fit in if not to be taken seriously...).The action and adventure is non-stop and it truly is entertaining. I love archeological action adventure films. I thoroughly enjoyed the locations as well, and the fact that the film was shot on location - a term that might be a phenomenon in the near future no thanks to CGI. I also enjoyed all the practical effects and the loads of stunts the film has to offer. They also used 7,000 real snakes for the film, instead of CGI. That's what I love about films from the 80's. This was still real film making, instead of doing (almost) everything from behind a desk!If you don't take the film too seriously and overlook the many plot flaws (and that very weird ending) then this is a film to enjoy again and again purely for the adrenaline rush. They simply don't make them like this anymore...",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A perfect action/adventure film,"The last time I saw this film was about twenty years ago when my Dad and I went to see it about four times in the theater.  When it came to the local classic movie theater it was a must-see for a friend and I, and I was completely delighted with how it translated into my relatively `adult' life.I use the term `adult' loosely for many reasons, but primarily because while sitting in that dark theater watching this movie, I was suddenly 10 years old again.  The outrageous action sequences, the wry comments by Indiana Jones that were probably lost on me when I was a child and the interesting comparisons between what I thought was terrifying as a child and the reality of its present impact on me was very fun to experience.  (I remember almost losing control of my bowels at the end of the film when I was a kid.)Another thing I realized after watching this movie was that Spielberg cannot write or direct proper roles for women in his films.  Karen Allen was almost (but not quite) as irritating as Kate Capshaw was in the second (and vastly inferior) installment.  The only allowance I can give is that the film in itself is so over the top that perhaps the whiny damsel in distress is appropriate, but that's about the most positive spin I can put on that element.I'm definitely looking forward to the Indiana Jones trilogy being released on DVD so that I can hopefully gain a little more insight into the production of the films, although perhaps the reality is that it's best to leave the films alone and let them stand on their own merit as fun, action packed films.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
good,"The beginning of indiana jones.although he actually looks like a hero and is very well liked, in general, when we look at him, he is a character who will be very close or who has excellent characteristics. Ne i know, letting down the people he loves is one of these reasons, for example.but I think we admire his adventurousness as an audience, and that's what Spielberg wants.but I'd be lying if I said raiders of the lost ark didn't disappoint me a little.it's called great or something according to the period when it was shot, but when you look at it, the movie wasn't shot in the 50s or 60s, when we think about the 80s, it will be groundbreaking or very, very different there are no future effects or anything like that,even towards the end there are effects and scenes that current teenagers find funny.if we're going to talk about the action according to the period, for example, he can't even get close to a star wars,even though it's newer.of course, the topic and everything is interesting, but I think there are also strange irrationalities.better not to tell for those who don't watch.anyway, I don't think spielberg or lucas really care about all this anyway,they just tried to make an action adventure movie after all, and they were successful at it.it is obvious that they are not after a solid script,deep characters and interesting striking fictions.head,even though its course and end are completely obvious, it still makes itself watched.there are also one or two legendary scenes that have gone down in history, of course.but as I said, it's pretty low on my list of the best, I should even say that I liked kingdom of the crystal skull more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The way all movies should be!,"When I first saw Raiders I knew nothing about it - I went purely on sighting the movie poster, not expecting too much.  From that very first scene, where the Paramount 'mountain' cleverly changes into a real mountain, I realised this was going to be something special.The almost relentless action is beautifully balanced with just enough quiet moments, and there's plenty of humour so you know not to take things too seriously.  Best of all the story line is great.There are a few plot holes - like how did Indy get inside the submarine without being noticed?  But these minor infringements can easily be overlooked in what is on the whole a cinematic masterpiece.I guess I've seen Raiders upwards of 20 times now, and could easily watch it that many more.  I have introduced my daughters to it, & they love it almost as much as I do.

What the standard for adventure films should be,"""I Hate snakes""
I think I have seen this movie maybe 200 times...It's that good. The movie follows Indiana Jones, a fearless archaeologist, as he tries to find the mysterious and powerful Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. The story is packed with thrilling moments, clever twists, and heart-pounding action scenes. From the very beginning, when Indy escapes a booby-trapped temple, you're hooked. The pacing is perfect-there's never a dull moment.What makes Raiders of the Lost Ark so good is how well it mixes action, adventure, and humor. The action scenes are unforgettable, like when Indy is chased by a giant boulder or when he's fighting on top of a moving truck. The stunts are done with practical effects, meaning they look real, and you can feel the danger. Even though it's from the 1980s, the action still holds up today.Harrison Ford is perfect as Indiana Jones. He's a french kisses delight. He's tough, smart, and cool under pressure, but also makes mistakes, which makes him feel more human. You can't help but root for him as he gets out of one dangerous situation after another. He also has great chemistry with Marion, played by Karen Allen, which adds humor and emotion to the story.The movie also has an amazing score by John Williams, with its iconic theme music that instantly makes you feel like you're on an adventure.Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a flawless action-adventure movie. It has everything: an engaging story, incredible action, a likable hero, and unforgettable moments. Even after all these years, it's still one of the best movies ever made, and it's impossible not to enjoy. If you haven't seen it yet, WHAT ARE YOU DOING. This movie is what every movie should be, 10/10 in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Brilliant Adventure With 1-Dimensional Characters,"Film critic Roger Ebert says Indiana Jones is ""an out-of-body experience, a movie of glorious imagination and breakneck speed..."". And it is, it is exactly that, a movie of glorious imagination which doesn't make you wait, you're into the action from the get go, but I must argue that it is not much more than that.Controversially, I don't think this is a brilliant film but it is a classic nonetheless. Steven Spielberg wanted to make a Bond movie originally but producer/writer George Lucas convinced him that this archaeological adventure would be better. Spielberg described it to be like a serial show which it very much feels like. It is just one famous scene, or set piece, after the other to create this adventurous story that greatly entertains but definitely does not test the emotions of the viewer. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe, the editing by Michael Kahn, and the famous music by John Williams all form to make a fun journey through Spielberg's vision. It is entertaining, yet, I still regret to say that it is not technically a brilliant movie.This may simply be down to the fact that the characters are rather flat. Whether this is your favourite movie or not this is an undeniable truth. Who are these people? I can list few facts about Indy Jones, his whole character is his love for archaeology and his fear of snakes. He is very basic though he contains some originality due to the sort of story that he has been thrown into. I could say even less about Marion played by Karen Allen. I think because of this it leaves me feeling like I have no reason to be invested in the story. Indy is a cool character but I have no dying want for him to succeed, due to this I feel slightly out of the narrative.Let me confirm, I am far from someone who dislikes this movie, it is a movie that I'd happily watch again. I'm a big Spielberg fan, and he was obviously looking to hit back after the disappointment of his previous film '1941', which many say almost ended his career. Of course, if this film was fairly unknown then I'd be only praising it right now but because it is so highly rated I thought it best to look at its bad side.Overall, this is an escapist movie with a magnificent adventure, anyone would struggle to not have fun. It is a tight film, it doesn't get boring, and that keeps our interest, which is enough for some audiences, making the lack of character depth unnoticeable. I can understand why it is a classic and I wouldn't want it any other way. I look forward to seeing the rest of the quadrilogy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

You call this archeology?,"When two powerful cinematic phenomenons come together, you know that the storm that will result won't be a light drizzle.So when Steven Spielberg and George Lucas work on the same project, prepare yourself for a thrill ride. And that's exactly what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is.While the ultimate goal is to find the Lost Ark, the steps include a plenty whole lot of dangers, stunts, spectacular tricks and freaky other things. This leads to a re-definition of the archeology term...During all the movie, I never asked myself what made it good or bad. I was simply absorbed by it. I couldn't put off my eyes from the screen. There's always something fairly exciting that happens at every moment or so.Spielberg once said that he would like to direct a Bond film. Well, if he's not chosen, it's not because he can't do the job. The action scenes and the special effects are simply great and entertaining. And the variety of stunts is highly imaginative. I particularly liked the fight near the airplane and the car and truck chase during the Ark transport.But the best part of the movie is certainly the Ark's opening at the end. What follows is a masterful pyrotechnic, explosive and visually dazzling special effects extravaganza. Even if you try to look elsewhere, you simply couldn't. These wonderful scenes catch your eyes and never let them go. It's wonderful, period.Although I prefer the third movie, I must admit that the first is the best of the three (like in a lot of cases). And the best thing about ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is that it became a cultural icon for years to come. It's now a synonym of adventure and Indiana Jones is a symbol too.But if you want to become an archaeologist, do not expect to live things that way...Rankings: Best: RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK 2nd best: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Worst: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A Fun, Family Adventure","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fantastic classic movie! All of the credit for its success and fun goes to George Lucas (Star Wars) and Steven Spielberg (A.I. Artificial Intellegence). The cast is what kicked some ass. That included Harrison Ford, Karen Allen (Starman), Paul Freeman (Power Rangers:The Movie), John Rhys-Davies (The Lord of the Rings).If you look hard enough, you will find out that Raiders is really sort of a sequel. I say this because if you notice, The Temple of Doom took place in 1935, and Raiders took place in 1936. So the Temple of Doom is actually a prequel.There is so much to say, but I have so little room to explain. Basically, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is going after the Ark of the Covenet before the Nazis get to it. At the same time, he has competition, which is Belleq (Paul Freeman). A rich, sleazy archeologist who steals from Jones whenever he gets the chance.

But in turn, this may hamper the pacing of the film, feeling less of a unified, far-off adventure then a series of wonderful and imaginative set-pieces set to aid the acquisition of the Ark.Obviously, being the first installment in this legendary series has not lost it's significance, as fans clearly cherish this one above the others.

Adventure has a name...,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", to me, is as great a movie as anyone can find. Name an element and ""RotLA"" probably has it. Drama? Yep. Love story? Check. Comedy? You got it. Action? Without a doubt. Adventure? You couldn't miss it if you tried.Some movies are carried by the story, by the acting, by the setting, by the star power, etc. ""RotLA"" is not carried by one of these, but all of them, making it more than just a good movie. Start with the search for the Ark of the Covenant and the history between Indy and Marion, combine it with the unbelievable performances of this talented cast, add Harrison Ford's box office appeal, throw in a dash of Spielberg/Lucas, and serve it up in places like Cairo and South America. That's the recipe for one of the greatest movies in history.The beginning of this brilliant film (Indy in South America looking for the idol and ultimately being chased by a boulder) provides one of the greatest images in movie history...and it all happens in the first 20 minutes!! The fact that the movie gets better from there says it all.To be honest, I think this movie being rated #17 overall (as of 1/11/05) is somewhat of an injustice.

One of the best Action/Adventure movies of all-time.,"If adventure has a name...it must be Indiana Jones. That line says it right there. The contrast between this movie and all of the heros before it was that Indy was human. He gets hurt, unlike his predecessor James Bond. With whip and revolver in hand, Indiana was an exotic hero. Indy was sofisticated (a college professor), he was handsome and adventurous. Harrison Ford was liked by all audiences, women found him attractive, men found him daring. Qualities found in Brittish spy, James Bond. Most people know now that Steven Spielberg was denied the directors position for a 007 film. He teamed up with George Lucas to make an American hero- Indiana Jones. There are many parallels between the two characters, but I'm not going to get into that. Another thing that made Raiders great was the plot itself. An archeologist travels around the world to find the Ark of the Covenant- the ark that contained the 10 Commandments and was said to have special powers. Indy gets entangled with a rival French archeologist who is working with the Nazis. An amazing story which keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire time. What keeps you there is not just the plot or action sequences, it is also the score by John Williams. Some of the best soundtracks are from John Williams (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman). This adrenaline-pumping score of the Raiders March makes you wish you had a theme song everytime you walked into a room. This is a great movie, it should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good adventure.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A classic, and most deservingly so","This film deserves every form of recognition it has received. A perfect mixture of breath-taking action, memorable heroes, delightfully evil villains, well-timed humor, and historical accuracy. Not that all the events in this film are true or that much of it is based on truth, but it is at least based both on real expeditions which Hitler sent Nazis on, and real biblical references to the ark of the covenant.The highlight of the film is action sequences choreographed so beautifully by Spielberg. There is nothing action films have seen to top some of the sequences in this film. The action is not insanely gory or painful like in Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan. There is blood, but it is not that painful to watch. But the sequence from when Indy is stealing the ark from the plane to when he finally steals it from the truck; that sequence is an all time classic. It starts with a plane the Nazis intend to use to ship the ark to Cairo. Indy fights a plane mechanic first before an intense fist fight with a really bulky Nazi. In the middle, his girlfriend, Marion snags another plane and is shooting off attacking Nazis, and Indy is gradually beating the Nazi, before colliding him into the propeller of the plane right by them. Indy brakes out of the plane which is about to explode. You then see a huge explosion before the Nazi load the ark then onto a truck. You are given a few moments to catch your breath before Indy chase the truck down. The battle when he jumps onto that trunk as intense as anything film can offer you. He fights off Nazi after Nazi. He dangles from the side of the truck, and keeps knocking Nazis out left and right. He finally escapes with the truck and that is that. I know it needs to be seen to be appreciated, but it is the most excitement you could ask for if action is what you seek.This film however, is more than just a strong action flick. It deals with extremely strong parallels of good versus evil. It really portrays the Nazis as these negligent villains, who seek the ark for nothing but access to a weapon. Indy meanwhile, truly seeks it to see it opened and look at what has been buried for thousands of years. And you see this massive army of trained soldiers with armed artillery who can not fend off one man and his whip and gun.This is a must-see for all action lovers. And do not think that the film is outdated after 20 years. On technical level, it is. But first of all, the Oscar winning visuals are not outdated by that much; and secondly, what it lacks it lacks in that department it makes up for with timeless ingenious film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Sina's review on Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Steven Spielberg is known for his stressful films and shocking scenes. It's no surprise he pictures The Americans better, higher and more powerful with no good support. They are always smarter and they always win. They are awesome horse riders and drivers. People of Cairo beg to them and they call themselves ""Americans "" who should not be treated in certain ways. Should the people of other nations be treated that way?The film is entertaining (if you handle the loud heroic song tracks).

A modern day adventure classic!,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure movie of such rousing fun, action,thrills,chills, and style - it's a modern classic! The film was conceived as a modern throwback to the 'serial' short films of the 40's and 50's, and delivers the impossible cliffhanger moments with panache. Again, Steven Spielberg's brilliant direction keeps things moving along, and the film never fails to deliver.Harrison Ford is perfect as Indiana Jones, and it's hard to believe that the role was originally offered to Tom Selleck. This film really made Ford a leading man that can carry a film all by himself. He's so identifiable as Indiana Jones, without being typecast as the adventurer, as his fine and varied film career can attest.

The Greatest Movie of them all,"Films, movies, motion pictures...whatever you want to call them, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the best.Indiana Jones is the iconic hero of every generation; rough, tough and always on the good side.

When you look up the term movie in the Oxford English Dictionary it should read;Movie: See Steven Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'...RIGHT NOW!Who wants emotional schmaltz fests, dizzy romantic comedies, complex sci-fi gobbledygook, kiddy pleasing animation features and laborious 4 hour epics when you can have a 2 hour gun slinging, boulder avoiding, horse riding, snake dodging, Ark retrieving, Nazi fleeing, death defying cliffhanging Hollywood EXTRAVANGANZA!!!!!!!To say Raiders is 'basic' seems abit flippant. But that's what it is. Back to basics in the most powerful way possible.How could it go wrong anyway? You have the two genius filmmakers of the 70's and 80's in Spielberg and Lucas carefully crafting an audacious adventure flick. It was a nailed on success. In their 90's and 00's moods though, it is highly doubtful they would have made the picture as good as this. But that debate is for another time.Oh and yeah, it has a score by John Williams, the most gifted movie composer of them all. As he did with Superman and Star Wars, he elevates 'Raiders' to more than just a movie. It's a truly awe-inspiring experience that grabs hold of you and stays with you long after the end credits have rolled.Spielberg, Lucas and Williams. The dream makers of the late 20th Century really do make your wildest fantasies come true in Raiders of the Lost Ark.See it now, then again and again.

"Indiana Jones, an Origin Point of Action Films, is an Alright Film","I find Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark an alright start to an action series. At times, I felt like it should have a shorter runtime, likely by 10-20 minutes. It does have a lot of action. It does revolve mainly around the action, so I feel it might not be the best movie to recommend anyone who likes anything that's pretty story driven. I can like stuff that's story driven but I also like something with good action as well. I find it good if something has a bit of both. I find the action is enough to push it to a PG-13 rating, yet this movie is just a straight PG. I don't know how much the rating system has changed since then but I like to say if it released today with the same content (obviously with a younger cast), it would get the PG-13 rating.I feel that this movie is an important film in the action genre with it diving quite a bit into the action and releasing before much of the modern day action movies.Overall, I find this movie is alright. It does have good action, but I feel it needs a little more in the story department.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Great Adventure,"What can be said that hasn't already been said about Raiders of the lost ark. The film is classic Spielberg and Lucas in tandem, based on 1930's television serials Raiders of the lost ark ups the scale and budget and cemented the superstar status of Harrison Ford as a leading man. The action and overall tone of the movie is fast paced and creates a great sense of charm and adventure throughout. I am not sure how this film got a PG certificate upon release as some of the scenes are too graphic for children. Great work from Douglas Slocombe for the look/feel of Raiders, and Vic Armstrong for the stunt work in this film, which contains an amazing truck chase sequence. John Williams creates another legendary score after Star Wars and Jaws. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

And of course, Americans who bring peace and tranquility to the world are also against Hitler.

We just wanted to watch a mysterious, exciting, adventurous movie. It's not American propaganda.What is this Hitler like? There was no issue that Hitler was not interested in. Hitler even explored the Jewish covenant, dating back to years ago, to use it in battle. So this Hitler horizon is very wide.I also saw this in this movie.

good,"Indiana Jones is a fantastic adventure-action game whose story and characters belong to the creator of Star Wars, George Lucas, and screenwriter Phillip Kaufman. The film written by Lawrence Kasdan,Steven Spielberg, one of the young talents of those times, who admired even Hitchook, known for his films such as Duel(Bela), The Sugarland Express,Jaws, Third Kind of Intimacy, 1941, before that, will have attracted Lucas's attention, who put him in the direction of Indiana Jones.the 1981 film stars Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. Successful special effects of the era and well-shot well Indiana Jones, who made her name with directed action scenes,is undoubtedly one of the best examples of entertainment cinema. The film, which combines historical legends and fantasy,has been one of the films that director Steven Spielberg has added to his fame, even though it has led to the false and exaggerated promotion of some countries, some geographies. Of course, the villains of the film are again the nazis of Germany, as in almost every movie. As a matter of fact, it was inspired by the 10 commandments in the Torah.

good,"The beginning of indiana jones.although he actually looks like a hero and is very well liked, in general, when we look at him, he is a character who will be very close or who has excellent characteristics degil.ne i know, letting down the people he loves is one of these reasons, for example.but I think we admire his adventurousness as an audience, and that's what Spielberg wants.but I'd be lying if I said raiders of the lost ark didn't disappoint me a little.it's called great or something according to the period when it was shot, but when you look at it, the movie wasn't shot in the 50s or 60s, when we think about the 80s, it will be groundbreaking or very, very different there are no future effects or anything like that,even towards the end there are effects and scenes that current teenagers find funny.if we're going to talk about the action according to the period, for example, he can't even get close to a star wars,even though it's newer.of course, the topic and everything is interesting, but I think there are also strange irrationalities.better not to tell for those who don't watch.anyway, I don't think spielberg or lucas really care about all this anyway,they just tried to make an action adventure movie after all, and they were successful at it.it is obvious that they are not after a solid script,deep characters and interesting striking fictions.head,even though its course and end are completely obvious, it still makes itself watched.there are also one or two legendary scenes that have gone down in history, of course.but as I said, it's pretty low on my list of the best, I should even say that I liked kingdom of the crystal skull more.the fact that he is 18th in the imdb also makes me a separate surprise.if it was the 100th or something, I understood.interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
possibly the best film ever made,"In My humble opinion, Raiders of the Lost Ark ties Star Wars as the best movie of all time. If that doesn't give you a hint as to the contents of this review, nothing will.It's 1935, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a professor of archaeology. Only, that's his day job. Jones is a globe hopper who has a unique talent for acquiring rare antiquities. Jones' talents come to the attention of U.S. Army intelligence, who just happen to require a little assistance. It seems that Adolf Hitler and his Nazis have set out to recover the long lost Ark of the Covenant. The Ark, according to the bible, was the container in which the Ten Commandments were housed. According to legend the Ark will bring incredible power to those who possess it. Jones, always up for a challenge, agrees to try to find the Ark before the Nazis do.I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the rest of the movie, because 99% of the people reading this review will already have seen the movie. As to the other 1%, trust me when I say that nothing I could write here would ever do this movie justice. Raiders is the classic action adventure, there has never been anything like it before, and nothing since has ever measured up to it. Including it's two sequels.Harrison Ford is perfect as the adventurer who completes his goals no matter what it takes. The rest on the supporting cast do a fantastic job, including John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's Egyptian connection Sallah and Paul Freeman as Beloq, the French archaeologist who heads up the Nazi team searching for the Ark. The only weakness in this movie comes from the casting of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Jones' former flame and current partner in his quest for the Ark. Not that there is anything wrong with Allen's acting, I've just never felt that she was right for the part. Oh well, if that is my biggest complaint about a movie I'm doing OK.I could rave on and on about this movie for hours, but in the end I would probably be just preaching to the choir.

The cinematography, musical score, the characters all breathe life into the movie so well. The action sequences are really exciting and Harrison Ford is at his best in bringing archeologist Indiana Jones to life. I enjoy the character so much because he does not come off as a superhero. He seems human, not invincible as some screen heroes are often portrayed coming through huge trials without a scratch. Sure Indiana Jones does some things that seem over the top or impossible, but his character isn't without flaws. He is human and gets beaten up pretty badly as he goes through numerous trials and tribulations.The movie never fails in keeping the viewer's interest as one great action scene occurs after another. This particular movie is my favoite of all the Indiana Jones movies. I feel the movie holds up very well even after all these years. The film does not feel dated at all.

Such as the scene where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is confronted by a thug with a big sword.  The thug shows off his swordsmanship as to intimidate Indy, but Indy just draws his weapon as casual as you possibly could and shoots the thug with his pistol.  That's incredible.  Done very well!Oh, or how about the famous scene where they open up the seal to the Well of the Souls and Indy just comments, ""Snakes, why'd it have to be snakes?""""Movie magic"" is a term described when talking about the special effects in a film, but for this movie, I'd use it to describe how Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford all came together to make an adventure movie that will surely stand the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Grab your fedora, uncoil that bull whip, and sit back to watch one of the best films ever!","""If adventure has a name, it must be ________________"". Who can't finish this sentence without saying 'Indiana Jones'? Raiders of the Lost Ark must be, without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made in movie history. Right up there with Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Casablanca, and Suparman, this film marked a milestone in film history. Creater George Lucas came up with the idea of a ""globe-trotting archaeologist"" long before he came up with the Star Wars story. However, when coming up with the story of the space adventure, Lucas shelved the idea of this adventurer for a later time. During the opening weekend of Star Wars, Lucas and fellow friend and movie director Steven Spielberg were sitting on a beach in Hawaii, talking about what each of them will do in their future. Spielberg commented ""I've always wanted to direct a James Bond film,"" and Lucas quickly commented - ""Nah, forget him, I have something better. It's called Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Then and there, Lucas told Spielberg all about the idea of an adventurer who was more like a grave-robber than scientist, who went all over the world embarking on adventures while finding wonderous treasures. Spielberg was in love with this idea for a film, and said on the spot 'Let's do it."" Spielberg agreed to direct it, while Lucas would produce and overlook the project. George got the name Indiana from his dog (who also gave inspiration for Chewbacca in Star Wars). Originally, the main hero was going to be named 'Indiana Smith,' but Spielberg said he didn't like it that much. Lucas than said, ""Okay, how about Indiana Jones?"" Spielberg simply said "".....okay"".After getting Paramount to fund the project, and hiring screenplay writer Lawrence Kasdan, it was time to find the one to fill the boots of Indiana Jones. Many actors were tested, but the one who had been chosen to play Dr. Jones, was Tom Selleck. Howeverm due to a contract with him and CBS (to make Magnum P.I) Selleck was forced to leave the project, and now Lucas and Spielberg had to find another person who would fit the part. ""How about Harisson Ford?"" Spielberg suggested. Lucas objected, because Ford was already in his Star Wars film(s). However, after having an audition, Lucas finally agreed to use Ford.After finding the actor, now it was time to make the character's apparel. The main things that people will remember from Indiana Jones are the fedora, whip, and jacket. Those are truly the icons of Indiana Jones. Deborah Nadoolman put together an outfit which most suited Indiana Jones, including Harisson Ford. She set out to make a costume that would be remembered. If Indy were in silhouette, you'd know who it was instantly. Alright, so we got actors (including Karen Allen as the feisty Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freenan as rival Rene Belloq; Denholm Elliot as the good-hearted Marcus Brody; John Rhys-Davies as Indy's Arabic friend Sallah; and Ronald Lacy as the slimy Nazi-Major Toht.), script, costume, director, and money, so that leaves actuall making the film. Shooting was done like the old adventure serials seen on TV every Saturday morning (which Lucas got inspiration from): quick and dirty. Even though Ford did many of his own stunts (like running from the enormous rolling boulder in the famous scene), stunt men were required to do stunts such as going under a truck, and hanging onto a falling statue. The most grueling shooting was during the shooting of the Cairo Market Place scenes. Ford, who had a bad case of diarrhea, was frantic to get off the set, and move on. You know the famous scene when Indy shoots the Cairo Swordsmen? Well, originally, there was a long fight scene involved, and the actor playing the swordsman had practiced a very long time twirling the sword right just for shooting. However, Ford couldn't stand the heat, so he just said ""How about we just shoot the bastard?"" Spielberg chuckled and said ""Okay!"". The score of the film was made by John Williams, who had worked on Jaws and Star Wars previously. John Williams is well known for making themes that people can hum to, and he did not fall short with Indy's theme, the ""Raiders March,"" which has become an American icon in itself.Will Indiana Jones IV happen? Who knows. What we do know, is that even if the Indiana Jones franchise doesn't continue in film, it will continue to live on in fans, and people who enjoy great films. See Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and Last Crusade, to experience true movie magic. Afterall these are the films that created the legend of the man, and the man, who became a legend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Indy's First Adventure Sets the Gold Standard - As Does Harrison Ford's Starring Performance,"Lucas and Spielberg's first ode to the serial adventure is still a densely atmospheric, loaded thrill ride. Indy is such a fascinating, larger-than-life personality that he outright demands our attention when he's on the screen (which is something like 95% of the time) and, even when we think we've got him figured out, still manages to surprise us. Casting Harrison Ford was absolutely crucial, though, because without his off-the-chart levels of confidence and charisma, the character wouldn't have been able to get away with half the things he does or says. Although it trots the globe, seemingly without rest, the plot is actually very well-paced and wisely gives the cold shoulder to any hint of overwrought back-story or origin. We're having enough fun in the present, so why get caught up in anything more complicated than ""He's a professor who moonlights as a tomb raider""? Quick-witted and funny when appropriate, exciting and unpredictable the rest of the time, it manages a near-perfect blend of realism and fantasy. The dark, dated cinematography is probably the only aspect of the film that hasn't aged gracefully.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Instant Hollywood Legend,"This was the most popular film in the summer of 1981, and played to packed audiences. It must have resonated with people's emotions as an action film unlike many others. It starts with an adventure - an explorer travels to a savage society in order to steal their wealth (for scientific knowledge of course). He fails when another adventurer expropriates his winnings, but survives to return to his teaching job at a university. The film shows him traveling in a flying Clipper from the 1930s, but not on a railroad. It is a good action film, as long as you don't question some of the scenes. Could Nazi Germany have military forces in 1936 Egypt? Could German Schmeisser sub-machine guns be found in 1936 Nepal? I don't believe so. I suspect these scenes were copied from the 1940 serials that entertained moviegoers. ""Indiana Jones"" will entertain you as an action adventure story with a multitude of clichés from long-forgotten films. Sliding under the truck recalls Yakima Canute's famous stunt. Some scenes seem far-fetched to me (when you think about it). Could Indiana Jones on a horse overtake a convoy of trucks? The theme music came from the 1948 film ""Don Juan"" starring Errol Flynn (rarely seen on TV). The chase through the maze of streets reminds me of 1940 cartoons. Other scenes may be derived from other old movies (the truck knocking down scaffolding from ""Abbot & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops""). A few sequels were made, but it failed to be translated into a television series. Just like ""Jaws"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The villains are gumptious and the ending is out of the Daliesqe imagery.

"An absolute classic, a simple and brilliant film","Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest classics in cinema, incredibly iconic, and well-known for having a perfect script.As an adventure and action film, it manages to be incredible, it is full of very well-made action scenes, and very iconic scenes like the opening scene with the stone. I found the film to be very simple, and that is very good, in addition to being a film with very good humor.It shows Indiana Jones, who is a professor, archaeologist and explorer, who is sent to get the Ark of the Covenant, which the Nazis want to use as a weapon in the war. The film focuses completely on this plot and does not waste time with scenes that do not add to the story. Indiana's personality is already shown right from the start.The script of the film, as I said before, is considered perfect, because the film is focused on the plot, it is considerably simple, and does not waste time. Everything that happens in the film will be used throughout the plot, it is something simple and brilliant, in addition to being a very good film to watch.Another very positive point of the film are the action scenes that are apparently all in practical effects, and are very well recorded, the aesthetics and photography of the film are also very good, the main actors are also very good, with obvious emphasis on Harryson Ford as the protagonist, and another incredible and iconic thing about the film is the perfect soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
May never be topped,"There may never be another movie as good as this one.  People are crying for Indy 4, but I don't really understand why, we all know that no matter who is attached to the project they'll never top this movie.  20 year old, with countless action/adventure movies made since, it is still the greatest of all time.  A few thoughts on the beloved Raiders:-Great, dark villans.  Great rivalry between Belloq and Indy.-Allen and Ford are great together, and the score is wonderful.-Wisely holds back on the supernatural until the very end.-Indy seems like a semi-real person.  He's not a kung-fu master or anything stupid like that.  He gets hurt and shows fear, although he sure gets punched in the head a lot without getting knocked out.-Great locations, Cairo is really mysterious place and is a perfect setting for this sort of thing.-Stunts and battles are great, without any CGI assistance.-Comedy is present, but it's not ""in your face"".  Funny things happen, but they aren't ""jokes"" like one liners.  Plus all of the comedic events still stick to reality.  Toht gets two great laughs and he is by far the darkest character in the film.So how can a movie have comedy, romance, horror, adventure, action and suspense, and not be stupid in some way?  Well, it CAN'T- this movie is a miracle, it shouldn't have turned out this well.  The sequels, although entertaining and better than most sequels are, don't even approach this movie.  Basically, the odds of anything even close to this coming out in our lifetimes is one in a million.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"A Modern-Day Treasure-Hunt of Epic Proportions Stylistically Like the Old Action-Serials of the 1930's, 40's and 50's","In the early 20th century, the fantasy-adventure genre was in vogue in the pulp magazines such as ""Amazing Stories"" and ""Weird Tales"" where western-society adventurers, typically British and American, replete with safari hat and khaki pants traveled to a far-away locale encountering ancient relics and ancient peoples. There would be a few obligatory scenes where an ancient people with spears would be chasing after the hero. Alan Quartermain was one of the first of these adventure-heroes traveling to distant lands seeking adventure. A few of these adventure-genre stories were produced into films, such as ""King Kong"", ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (by the same producers as ""King King""), ""Four Frightened People"", and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". Even the ""Flash Gordon"" serials had much in common with these adventure-to-other-lands series. ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a late 20th-century updated version of these old adventure films and takes place during the 1930's when Hitler and the Nazis ruled Germany.Oddly, the adventure films of the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood, circa 1930 to 1960, were relegated to B-film status and the serials. With the possible exception of ""King Kong"", most adventure films were low budget B-films with lesser-known actors, lower budgets, and relatively mediocre scripts. Many of these offerings were shot on sound-stages in Hollywood. When ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" premiered in the early 1980's, the adventure film had received some serious face-lifts. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" set the standard with better scripts, better actors, location-shooting, and larger budgets, incorporating fun, adventure, antiquities, and even some humor into a satisfying cinematic experience.When he's not engaging in mediocre lectures as a nerdy professor at his university, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in one of his defining roles) is an archaeological adventurer, seeking antiquities throughout the world for museums in the western world, predominantly for the United States and Britain. His arch-rival is Belloq (Paul Freeman), a French archaeologist who has sold his soul to the Nazis in return for financing archaeological exploits. Jones studied under Dr. Abner Ravenwood, an archaeologist who has gone missing somewhere in Asia. Jones briefly dated his daughter, Marion, before the beginning of the events of the story.After an altercation with his rival Belloq, losing a gold religious icon-head in Peru, Indiana Jones is approached by the US government to engage in a treasure hunt which has a nearly 2500-year history. The Nazis are after the so-called Ark of the Covenant (not to be confused with Noah's Ark, Joan of Arc, or Archie Bunker), an ornate gold chest which supposedly housed the Ten Commandments brought down from on High by Moses to the Israelites, a.k.a. the Jews/Hebrews of Pre-Christianity. According to Old Testament biblical tradition, the Ark of the Covenant resided in the ""Holy of Holies"" in the Great Temple in Jerusalem and would only have been seen by the highest priests of the temple. The Ark went missing after the Babylonians conquered the Israelites circa 500 BCE. (Whether the Ark actually existed has been debated for nearly 2000 years. Although some antiquities-hunters and Christian-Evangelicals want to believe the Ark may still exist, more than likely, if it had existed, it was destroyed by the Babylonians who probably melted down the Ark for its gold to create their own treasures and artifacts.)The Allies believe the Nazis desiring the Ark of the Covenant has to do with their quest for ultimate domination, the Ark associated with divine power. So if the Nazis think they can attain the Ark, the Allies better confiscate it before they do. So US government officials offer Indiana Jones an offer he can't refuse: finance him to find the Ark before the Nazis. He travels first to Nepal where he meets his old flame, Marion Ravenwood, who has in her possession an amulet which turns out to be a crucial piece of the puzzle to find the Ark. The Nazis are also hot on Jones' trail. Marion and Indiana then travel to Cairo, Egypt, where the Nazis are already engaging in a large-scale dig for the Ark. Jones solicits the help of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) to hire a crew of excavators to find the Ark before Belloq and the Nazis. Unfortunately, Belloq has often been able to take artifact-treasures literally right out of Jones' hands.One of the all-time great action-adventure films with a humorous script, top-notch acting, and wonderful scenic shots. A few scenes use some of the Old Hollywood devices, like a map with an animated line showing their journey across the globe. Some of the chase scenes go on a little bit long, but there's plenty of other ingredients which keeps the story fresh and moving. Even the love-story which is rekindled between Marion and Indiana is a nice relief from the action. One of the best scenes is how they discover the actual location of the Ark, supposedly hidden in the lost city of Tanis in Egypt not far from Cairo. While Tanis was a real ancient city now in ruins, the idea the Ark would have been placed there seems quite fantastical, considering the Ark was lost when they were conquered by Babylon, not Egypt. The Egyptians probably could have cared less about a Jewish artifact. However, we tend to run with the story all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"35 Years Later: It's Not The Years, Honey; It's The Mileage","Where to begin? Writing this review, it has now been thirty-five years since this crazy Steven Spielberg/George Lucas homage to B-movie adventure serials of the 1930s was unleashed on an unsuspecting world in the late spring/early summer of 1981; and even with the three sequels that it has spawned (thus far) and the myriad imitations it has spawned, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK still has to rank as one of the high points of the action film genre's entire history. There's no question that there are elements of the film that are very dated nowadays, not to mention ethnic stereotypes that were wrong then and are even more wrong today. But for sheer artistic and cinematic verve, this still ranks as a Hollywood popcorn extravaganza par excellence.There's no need any longer to go into plot, as we all know it involves Harrison Ford as the intrepid archaeologist Indiana Jones battling the Nazis in a race to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant and the unspeakable power locked inside it. But it is instructive to remember how big a deal this film was to all involved. Lucas had already struck a colossal gold mine with the first two STAR WARS films that had Ford as Han Solo; and Spielberg could boast having made two huge hits of his own in JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. Spielberg, however, had also gone well over schedule and budget on both of those two; and he did it again on his 1979 World War II comedy ""1941"", so much so that that film's poor critical and commercial finish almost finished him as a director. It was important for him that he deliver a film that could stick to both schedule and budget, yet still be good enough to be a hit. Fortunately, Lucas gave him that chance here; and with careful execution, all of the intended goals were achieved, and then some.The two big action sequences, Ford's outrunning a rolling boulder in the famous opening prologue, and the truck chase across the Sinai Desert (eight minutes of hair-raising tension created in no small part by Ford doing his own stunt work) still must rank as some of the best of their kind ever pulled off. It also helps that Ford shows the kind of honest human vulnerability you don't find in most other action heroes (Stallone; Schwarzenneger, etc.); as he tells his girlfriend (Karen Allen): ""It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage"", which is more than a little true. There are moments where the violence, tame though it is by 21st century standards, did make some audiences back in 1981 a little squeamish (the face-melting that takes place in the opening of the Ark at the film's climax is still a tad bit sick); one must remember that this was rated 'PG', and the controversy surrounding the violence here and in its immediate sequel INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM led to the creation of the 'PG-13' rating. But there is also a certain amount of comedy relief as well, involving Ford's squeamish behavior around all forms of snakes, and the famous split-second shooting of an Arab swordsman, improvised downward from a big sword fight because Ford had eaten some bad local food on the day the scene was shot. The Nazi villains are, of course, cardboard villains (since the film was set in 1936, before anyone knew what Hitler and his minions were really up to, it was easier to do it that way); but Ford's nemesis Belloq (Paul Freeman) and the devious Toht (Ronald Lacey) are a couple of really nefarious heavies that give Ford's Indiana Jones something to chew on. And it wouldn't be right not to acknowledge Allen's slightly sardonic contribution to the film as well, especially when she knocks one knife-wielding goon cold with a skillet in the basket chase scene, an hysterically funny moment.And finally, no review of this film would be complete without giving a nod to John Williams, whose score here, like many of his other contributions to the art of film scoring, gives the film its voice, from the famous Raiders March to the brass-choired Nazi theme during the truck chase. The end result is a masterpiece of the entire action genre that holds up even to this day, both real in other ways and fanciful in others, but with a balance that most of today's $200 million-plus sound-and-fury ""blockbusters"" may never be able to match.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A great classic that you don't have to watch.,"When I first heard about this movie, I was a kid and thought it was another Star Wars-like movie. But when I finally decided to watch it, already in the opening sequence I feel that it is something more. I'm a history buff myself and it was a pleasure to watch the film in which they investigate things related to the Ark of the Covenant. The parts with the Nazis and the fight to prevent Hitler from getting his hands on the chest were also excellent. I don't think the PG rating is right for the film, I would increase it to PG-13 because of the occasional fights, swearing, the final scene when all the main villains bleed to death, the fight against a big and strong German who is destroyed by a propeller... The film is a classic and I like to watch it sometimes. I recommend it especially to families and fans of adventure and fantasy. Here's the story in a nutshell:Set in the early half of the 20th century, the film is the story of an archaeologist named Indiana Jones, who is hired by the US government and finds himself in a race against time to find the mysterious and supernatural Ark of the Covenant before it falls into the hands of Adolf Hitler and his regime Nazi followers who want to use the power of the Bible artifact as a means of world domination.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

It is the first film in the Indiana Jones series and is by far the most creative and original.  Harrison Ford is legendary as Dr. Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting acheologist professor who must attain the lost ark of the covenant before the evil Nazi empire does.  Ford's performance as rugged, brainy and comical Jones is his defining role.  He is the perfect Indiana.  It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role and he is a joy to watch.  The supporting characters are brilliant as Jones must travel far and wide to battle a rival French archeologist and his allegance to the 3rd riech.  The film works because Spielberg develops his characters well and the audience truely cares about them.  It is an archipal good versus evil film where desperate action scenes leave us cheering for Jones and his allies.  The script and plot is quick and clever.  John Williams scores an inspirational soundtrack that tells the story inconjunction with Spielberg.  The best action film of all time.  Final Rating = 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A fantastic adventure!,"""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is one of a kind. There has never been a movie like it and there never will be. The movie closest to it is ""Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade"". It is an absolute masterpiece. It has everything: love, action, excitement, adventure and so on. This movie can be seen a thousand times - it NEVER gets boring. Every time you start watching you just get sucked into the world of Indiana Jones for two hours. You feel the adrenaline pumping when he fights against nazis, big men with swords, indians, snakes and a thousand other things. It is a true adventure, Indy is the perfect example of a masculine hero. Director Steven Spielberg is an absolute genius - he has managed to make a movie where every second is thrilling! I can only give it my warmest recommendations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Escapism at its best,"Even though it's way over twenty years old, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is still one of the best action adventures ever created. This movie has all the things that make an action movie great: - A wonderful story about lost cities, ancient artifacts, and great mysteries. Even though everybody knows that most of these stories are nonsense, it's great to fantasize about them. - Main characters that are actually still human, instead of the superheroes Hollywood throws at you these days (both in ""real"" superhero movies like X-Men and Hulk, and in movies where the main characters are normal humans but somehow completely invulnerable (""Tomb Raider"", ""Mission Impossible 2"")). Of course everybody knows that the good guys are going to win, but in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the heroes have weaknesses, are vulnerable, don't do completely idiotic things, and abide by the normal laws of physics.The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Sure, it mostly plays it straight, but it isn't afraid to be a bit tongue-in-cheek from time to time. I take this kind of approach over the super-serious approach any time.All of the above things make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" excellent. It's a fun mix of story, action, and humour, without any kind of pretenses, that does exactly what it's supposed to do: entertain you for a couple of hours. Escapism at its best.***1/2 out of **** stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best adventure movie ever,"This has to be the coolest, most relaxing suspense-action movie ever. Harrison Ford is excellent as Indiana Jones, the school-teacher who acts like an adventurer. The scene where Harrison Ford calmly shoots the man threatening him with a saber 20 feet away ranks way up there in my top 5 all-time sequences. However, I believe that the whole screenplay and actors make this greatly directed movie great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Classic film with a little cheese on the side,"One of the great films of the 20th century, yeah it gets a bit cheesy at times, but that's the point. This entire collection of Indiana Jones flicks is so entertaining and never seems to get old.My favorite scene is near the end when Indy threatens to blow up the Ark with a rocket launcher, and during Belloq's speech a fly actually lands on his cheek, crawls onto his lip and either goes into his mouth or is sucked in deliberately by the actor. It just shows great focus on the craft and probably a need to get the scene finished under the hot Tunisian sun.I cannot wait for IJ4 and am curious to know what the plot will be as well as who Indy's new flame is...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
It's Not The Years It's The Mileage And This One Goes The Distance.,"This is one of the best Indiana Jones Films ever, I remember seeing it for the first time when I was like 9 and loved it. The snakes were an added touch, and the story was excellent. I have seen them all and I would have to say this is probably the best one of them all. The story is about Professor Henry Indiana Jones, an Acchelogist who has just come back from South America on an expedition. He is asked to go on a special assignment in search for The Lost Ark of The Covenant. Once in Cairo he meets Belloq a competitor who all seems to get there first or ends of getting what Indy finds. They are both after the same thing and it's a rat race to see what is in store for Indy and CO.. Near the ending it is spectacular, and to some views might be a little tense, but it's not that bad. I loved the last of the movie the warehouse scene, it seemed like the perfect ending to an excellent movie. I would recommend this movie to any1, especially to Harrison Ford fans you won't be disappointed. Kris L. CocKayne",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The pinnacle of adventure,"One of the greatest adventures of all time. Swashbuckling, thrilling, etc... this film has it all. From a heart-pounding, classic opening this film pours on the excitement all the way through.Indiana Jones must recover the lost ark, a sacred biblical artifact before the Nazis get to it and use it for their own nefarious schemes. He encounters many obstacles along the way that hinder his progress - snakes, Hitler's troops, etc. Each scene is packed with action and excitement, with John William's invigorating score to pick up the drama along the ride.What Spielberg does best is big plots, big action, and sweeping scores. Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly epic in all these regards and carries you along for a wild and fun ride. It does everything it sets out to do perfectly, and the result is one of the greatest adventure stories ever told on celluloid.See it. You can come back to it endlessly.

BEST MOVIE EVER,this is ...well... the best movie ever... I have loved this (and had a crush on Indy) since I was a kid.

A fun adventure,This is my first Indiana Jones movie and it was a fun ride. It holds up better to me in quality than the first Star Wars movie.

Paramount - gets into a mountain,"Great!! IHAA! Steven Spielberg's perfect actionadventure with Harrison Ford in the leading character as the fearless Indiana Jones. The two next are really worthy sequels, but they aren't far as good as this one. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a fantastic adventuremovie that takes you into the unbelivable and shows you scary things with inhuman powers. This and the third takes the plot out from The Holy Bible, and that makes a exciting and fascinating story that wants you to see how it goes with Indy and his unpleasent travellers.And the opening sequence - man, taht's a good one! We see the logo to Paramount Pictures - you know, the mountain, and suddenly we fade into a real mountain and then Indy steps in front of the camera, man, that makes this, just like excellent mode and reallt gets you going.So is the ending scene, you see this regular man in a regular factory wheeling the box holding the arc, don't knowing himself. Harrison Ford does his best performance ever, even better then Han Solo and his family - rescuing Jack Ryan. It's funny, entertaining, exciting, scary and stylish - Indiana Jones is great!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A globe-trotting rip-roaring adventure.,"This movie deserves its status as an modern classic, and its many iconic scenes deserve all of their homages and parodies. Harrison Ford does a tremendous job as the suave archaeologist Indiana Jones, and the special effects are both real and well-done. As of course, are the ever-present glorious gore. The comic relief relieves tension and is hilarious. The creeping shadows in the wall, whether Nazi or Indie, are a particularly well-used cinematographic device as well.This movie may be at the root of many of America's misconceptions about the Third Reich and its relationship with the occult, but it is a fun ride. It is difficult to make treasure-hunting through ancient temples seem more romantic than it already is, but Indiana sure manages it.(I saw this on July 10, 2017.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My number 22 movie,"Raiders of the lost ark is my number 22 movie. I love Harrison Ford (my favorite actor ), I love Steven Spielberg ( my favorite director by FAR ), and I love action-adventure movies. And this movie is one reason for loving them. I think part 1 is the best of the Indy trilogy, but part 3 is pretty close. This is maybe the best adventure movie I have ever seen.My favorite scene has to be ( you know... ) when the guy wants to fight with Indiana Jones, but he just shoots him. That is hilarious. There has never been a scene in an action movie that is that unexpected I think. Every other character would have started fighting with him.Good points about Raiders of the Lost Ark : acting, directing, Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, action, score, market scene ( see above ), style, story, beginning, Indy 3Bad points : the woman, Indy 2,Can't wait to see Indy 4. Maybe a feature with Indy 1,2,3.All in all, I rate this movie 9.5/10. GREAT ADVENTURE MOVIE!!! SEE IT, IF YOU HAVEN´T ( but, who hasn't?!?)If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

One of my top ten...,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.  I was six years old and playing behind the couch in my living room.  I couldn't see the television from where I was at but I could hear it.  Well, my parents were watching Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I was sitting back there playing and I heard the music swell as Indy swung from the vine into the river in the amazon.  So I looked over the back of the couch and was hooked.  I slowly made my way around the couch, never letting my eyes leave the screen and sat and watched the rest of the film. I tell you...it's the music.  The story is great but its accompanied by the absolute best ""hero"" theme song ever, bar none. That music makes this movie for me.  I dread the day when Lucas and ILM decide to make a ""special edition"" version of this film with top notch digital effects.  Its perfect as it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Total Classic,"My local multiplex showed this recently in a ""classic season"". I have seen this many times on TV and video, but never on the big screen and I can honestly say that everyone should try and see it at a cinema.Watching an original print, which is 19 years old at this point and just one year younger than me!, was stunning. I noticed stuff that I had somehow never seen before, like german writing graffiting part of the map room, and the strange plane in the background when Sala is lowering Indy into the map room.These little things made seeing such an all time classic film for the umpteenth time amazing. The packed laughed at Indy shooting the swordsman, even though we all must have seen it thousands of times between us. This shows the sheer brillance of the film. You can watch it again and again, but it STILL entertains you.As a friend said when we left the cinema to the strains of John Williams, ""They just don't make films like that""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

First the blades, then the word of god, and finally the test of faith, which only indy can do. All I can say is watch this movie, cause if you have not , your missing out.

A classic. A nonstop action adventure thrill ride!,"After many years I just once again viewed the start of the ""Indiana Jones"" saga that being the first film made in the series 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" watching it as a kid was more enjoyable, but still the film is a joy ride to watch due to it's nonstop action and thrills it provides. In a way this is a classic B type movie that pays tribute to something you would see just for outright fun with it's action and thrills. And hand it to the master of adventure and escape that being Steven Spielberg who with his direction just sweeps a viewer up off their feet. Plus combined with his teamwork of George Lucas who produced and helped add facts into the story the two maybe made the best adventure series of memory.Set in 1936 Harrison Ford as archaeologist and part time adventurer Indiana Jones decides to part out from his college to meet up with his feisty ex Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen)and they plan a search for the powerful and mystical Ark of the Covenant. Along the way their biggest challenge will be fighting the religious crazed Nazis plus add in dodging booby-traps, and staring down deadly snakes. This film scene after scene is a thrill ride a true cliffhanger of adventure and joyful excitement. This would clearly be the icon role that Harrison Ford is most remembered for as his ""Indy"" role is more respected than his ""Han Solo"" role in the ""Star Wars"" films. Overall great action adventure film one of the best made of all-time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A good old school blockbuster 👌,"This was my first time watching the film in over 20 years and I was very happy to see it again. Old school 80's action with practical effects and real sets, what an utter joy. Harrison Ford was excellent as Indy and the rest of the cast were fine if not a little clunky at times. The humour was excellent and very slapstick in places which I enjoyed immensely. The ending was a bit meh for me and I felt it dragged a little in the later part of the movie. Nonetheless I'd highly recommend to this everyone it's a great fun watch that has aged very well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
First class entertainment,"This movie can be recommended on the strength of Spielberg's gift for narrative film, the exhilarating stunt sequences and the fact that Harrison Ford in his prime was the quintessential action-hero.

I believe there is a fourth installment in development).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
a landmark in the genre,"Harrison Ford (Star Wars) stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist who is sent on a mission to find the Ark of the Covenant.Coming off the epic Star wars trilogy, Harrison Ford and George Lucas teamed up with Steven Spielberg to create an adventure masterpiece in this Oscar winning action adventure.Ford leads the way as Jones, a cocky and intelligent man who uses rough, dangerous and intriguing techniques to get what he wants and through Ford's acting, do we see a great character and a strong male icon. Now, 27 years on, the icon with hat and whip are famous, as is many scenes, including probably one of the most exciting beginnings ever filmed when Indy goes into a temple and is chased by that boulder, possibly the best action sequence and memorable part of the series.The writing by Lucas and direction by Spielberg also make the character and the entire film enjoyable and exciting all the way through in a consistent and tense plot. Lucas' attention to detail about the Ark is good and Spielberg's close and fast direction conforms brilliantly to the genre.I wasn't around when the film was released but can understand by research that it was a landmark at the time of release, a completely knew idea when effects and action were really coming into full effect, like Star Wars brought the Sci-Fi genre out, and this film was a real niche in the adventure genre, and still remains to be today with Indy 4 currently being released and hundreds of thousands seeing it in its opening week.The plot is consistent with great action scenes, suspense and mystery around every corner and intriguing characters and relationships being built. There perhaps could have been a bit more depth to some of the characters but otherwise it is a truly brilliant action adventure and a landmark in the adventure genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Pretty damn close to perfection,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those films that has earned every bit of success and critical praise it has been given over the years. It's the perfect adventure film, it raised the bar for the genre to such a high point, that I personally haven't been able to view any other movies of this type without making comparisons. But really, I can't think of any movies that have even tried to attempt to capture the excitement of Raiders. There have been other adventure films in the last twenty years, but none have really been on the scale of this, or any of the Jones films. The movie is a laugh riot on top of everything else. I was watching it not too long ago with my father, during the famous scene between Indy and the swordsman who takes a knife to a gunfight he remembered how the audience was in hysterics, how it was one of the biggest laughs he had ever had at a movie (I was too young to remember). This film inspires these types of memories in a lot of people, which pretty much guarantees its status as one of the greatest films ever made. But there had to have been high expectations at the time, from the director of Jaws and the creator of Star Wars, two of the highest grossing films of all time.Yep, not much to be said about this one that hasn't already been said. So let me ask something. Why do so many people spend time summarizing the plot of this film in the ""User Comments"" section of IMDB anyway? Aren't there many places you could go to for the plot of a film? That's not really commenting on the movie if all you're doing is giving a greatly detailed description of the story with a quick, ""I liked it!"" at the end, is it? This really brings out the anal retentive in me. Oh well, looks like it's time for me to get a life. 10/10 stars, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a hum-dinger of a movie. Don't ask me what that means. I heard someone say it once and thought it was funny. G'night!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Raiders of the Lost Ark may be one of the most perfect films in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The adventure film all others will forever be compared to...,"Every year there are films that try to replicate the Indiana Jones formula, the most recent failed example being Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It seems easy - create a likable everyman hero, put him in perilous situations that require quick thinking and quick getaways, give him a good foe to prevail over, sprinkle liberally with bugs and snakes and serve for 2 hours.The opening sequence of Raiders neatly encapsulates the appeal of the entire franchise. There is a little humour, tremendous inventive action sequences, booby traps, treachery, treasure and of course creepy crawlies.We also get to follow the expedition for a good three minutes and try to gather exactly what is happening before we even see Indy himself.It is pre WW2, and Indiana Jones is hunting, as always (although we don't know that yet) for lost artifacts and relics that he wants to donate to museums and keep out of the clutches of evil-doers who only want the items to finance nefarious doings.This initial sequence has him tip-toeing through the various traps and pitfalls in order to claim a golden figurine from the centre of a room. It seems that if you have an extremely valuable golden figurine and feel that you must go to the trouble of rigging booby traps and indeed a massive self destruct trigger you might be better served spending the same amount of time hiding the figure instead. Saves you time, money and having to rebuild the whole cave system in the event of a failed treasure hunt.Imagine how p*ssed the natives would be if the figure was simply knocked over by a rat or a bird? Whether Indy gets the item he seeks or not is seldom important, it is the ride that matters, in this case though he fails.Back on US soil we meet the Monday – Friday Indiana Jones, a very popular college professor of archaeology who is admired by his students, and consulted for his expertise by various parties.In this case it is the army that comes calling, asking for advice regarding an intercepted German communiqué. Apparently Hitler himself has commissioned a hunt for the ""Ark of the Covenant"", and has found the area where it is thought to be located.Of course, Indy agrees to check things out for himself, and with his close friend Marcus, played by Denholm Elliott along for the rise he almost immediately sets off.Here we meet another oft-copied Indy signature, the overlay of a map showing exactly where on the globe Indiana is headed, this helps give a better impression of the vastness of some of his travels and the extent that he goes to to achieve his aims. Initially he heads to Nepal, as a vital piece of equipment that will aid him in his hunt is conveniently located there, even more convenient is the fact that it is held by an ex-girlfriend of his in a seedy bar that she runs herself, her name is Marion (Karen Allen).Marion herself is another strength of the movie, she is spirited and spunky without ever being sexy, and is often in need of help without ever simply being helpless herself.After an uncomfortable hello and the obligatory action sequence Marion decides to tag along, and when I say decides she doesn't have too much alternative as her bar has been razed to the ground. If there is a lesson to be learned from this it is that hanging around Indiana Jones does tend to put you and the things you own in peril.Once the action moves to Cairo the pace of the action steps up another notch as Indiana comes into closer proximity to the naughty Nazis, who being the bad guys will stop at no lengths to get what they want. They have been making slow progress in their search but the arrival of Indiana inadvertently helps them along.We have now met all the key characters in the film, and the final hour or so is simply masterful. In set piece after set piece the audience can hardly pause for breath, each new drama finds Indiana in more and more peril, and brings him closer to his goal but equally finds him also closer to losing everything.The pacing of this film is just great, the action barely relents and important plot events aren't simply introduced in between in expositional conversation, but they unfold as part of the action in a logical manner. You can watch the film with your brain shut off and simply go wow at all the pretty colours and explosions, but Raiders is a little deeper than just mindless action and rewards are had for paying attention.The film is a little scary and violent enough in a PG 13 way that action fans won't be yawning, each death causes consequences that either bring more characters into play, or trigger other events that must be dealt with.Being that it is an 80s film there are some terrific stunts that happen throughout the film, Indy's trademark hat is especially handy in this case as it camouflages the stuntman's face from the screen in the more dangerous bits.Running your eyes down the page should show just why this is almost the perfect action film: stunts, humour, action, danger, Nazis, a hat! What more could you ask for? Two sequels is my only answer.Unfortunately we got three.Too many directors now aim to make ""epic"" films, in the 80s it was enough to have a movie with a beginning, middle and end, and not bother with red herrings, unnecessary twists or gratuitous violence.Sometimes fun is enough.Final Rating – 9.0 / 10. Still awesome. This is just classic stuff.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Entertainment as it was meant to be,"Film exists to provide entertainment. Raiders of the Lost Ark does just that, in its purest form. Very few other films can claim to such a beloved status as this, adventure's masterpiece.I feel like this is a film that anyone who ventures onto the IMDb has seen. As such, it's redundant to tell you to see this one. No, there's no deep message, or allegory, but 2 hours of unrivalled fun. Action, explosions, suspense, wit, romance, comedy... the ultimate blockbuster.Cinephiles may look down on Indy for not having thematic value, but that was never the intent. Armed with the most lethally sharp script in Hollywood, Spielberg and Lucas created an extraordinarily likable character put into a unique, original situation. Religious mystery? Shooting lots of people? Yes, but it's OK because they're Nazis. Or Belloq. Everything about this film is top notch, from its acting, to music, cinematography, set design... pure joy.I'd always seen this film as timeless: the version I saw was of fantastic quality and the film looks fantastic, explosions are convincing, the violence is surprisingly graphic but not extreme, but the little thing that bugs me is the CG. It's the only part of the film firmly rooted in the 80's, and it bugs me to see such primitive effects next to the most pristine presentation otherwise.But this little thing can't hold back Raiders. If there was ever a film with style and substance, this is it. One of the warmest, most entertaining films of all time, telling one of entertainments greatest stories with one of film's iconic characters. 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"""Passing through history""","Copying isn't always a bad thing. Copying is what 80s cinema did in a big way – from remakes and spoofs to homage and reference, cinema thrived on recycling the past. Raiders of the Lost Ark borrows the adventuresome plots and exciting action of 1930s serials, classic swashbucklers and the James Bond franchise, while hinting at influences as disparate as Lawrence of Arabia and the Cecil B. DeMille religious extravaganzas. And like all of the great blockbusters of this era, its success comes not only from its derivative nature or its non-stop action, but from the fact that it is simply brilliantly conceived.Raiders of the Lost Ark also works by being somewhat tongue-in-cheek, pre-empting any sneers at the genre's clichés by spoofing them itself. The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan features such self-satirizing lines as ""You can't do this to me, I'm an American!"" But this isn't quite like the brilliantly daft 1980 Flash Gordon, for which your sense of irony must be switched to max. Kasdan's script is fully-functioning and wholly professional. Every moment and every line counts. Exposition scenes often dovetail into action ones, so we never have a chance to get bored. The scene where the army intelligence people come to ask Indy about Ravenwood and the staff of Ra serves two purposes. Firstly, it gives the audience the necessary background for the quest ahead without being too presentational. Secondly, the officials' lack of knowledge and sympathy endears us further to Indy, and lets us know that we won't be calling in the cops or the army for this one.Director Steven Spielberg has elaborated on Kasdan's work by fashioning action scenes that are both fun and inventive. Spielberg injects sequences with so many neat little ideas to continually amuse us and stop this from being a no-brainer. Take for example the local man falling onto the front of the truck during the road scene. Spielberg makes the moment both funny and exhilarating by showing us for a split-second the man's surprised face in the windshield. By-and-large the director keeps a rather detached eye, his camera often peeping through a bit of scenery or overlooking the action with a god-shot. It is this approach that gives so much of the picture its distinct, memorable look. Intense moments like Sallah's realisation that the dates are poisoned are composed of a series of attention-grabbing shots with no camera movement, creating a series of iconic images like the frames of a comic book. And this is really what Spielberg is at this stage of his career; a comic book director. But he happens to be a very good one.What really makes Raiders of the Lost Ark such a treasure is its fabulous characters and the way they are presented. The hero Indiana Jones is introduced as an enigma, a mysterious figure in hat. The opening shots reveal him to be a leader at the head of a band, an expert in the field and eventually, a handy man with a whip – and only then do we see his face. Karen Allen's Marion is easily the best of the Indiana Jones heroines, tough and resourceful in her own right, able to be his partner in adventure. And Paul Freeman's Belloq is the ultimate Indiana Jones villain. Smart and sophisticated, his enmity fuelled by rivalry rather than a simple conflict of interests, he's probably the most believable foe Indy has ever come up against. At the other end of the scale there's the sinister thug Toht, played with relish by English TV actor Ronald Lacey. Lacey makes his entrance as the campy and comical Gestapo stereotype, but when he coldly whispers ""Let me show you what I am used to"" his tone is utterly menacing and the character becomes genuinely scary. There are so many more perfectly written and played supporting roles – John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Brody – and it's not clear whether the actors were cast to suit the characters or whether the characters were developed around the actors. Most likely a mix of both.Raiders of the Lost Arc is really what all these early blockbusters were – a distillation of all the techniques for making high-quality entertainment. Yes, its ideas are cobbled together from the last five decades of action cinema, not to mention adventure literature and comic books, but it gets away with it. It gets away with it not just because of its knowing and light-hearted take approach, but because of how its makers have learned from the past, completely refining every aspect of the genre to make a modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Archaeologist and adventurer,"What can I say about Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) that has not been said before, except that this was a great 80's movie, and that it is an adventure movie that is a must watch. Also, this is one Steven Spielberg's best movie along with the two other sequels.Harrison Ford is fantastic as Indiana Jones; he is such a likable character that loves what he does, and he likes the thrill of adventure. He goes on his adventure for fun in his free time when he is not teaching as a professor of archaeology at a college. I like Karen Allen as Marion; she is tough when she needs to be, and I like her relationship with Indiana Jones throughout the movie, and that they had an interesting past.Indiana Jones's friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies who was a nice character to help Indiana Jones find the Ark of the Covenant. The villain Belloq played by Paul Freeman was a good villain for Indy to go up against; he is also after the Ark of the Covenant, but let Indy do all the challenging work in finding certain artifacts and then steals them from Indy.The action scenes are fantastic to watch; physically demanding stunts, and fight scenes, along with great chase sequences. Harrison Ford does an incredible job in these action sequences; I honestly do not know how he was able to do them, especially one truck chase scene that is one of the best sequences in the whole movie. There are uses of visual effects at one point in the third act that do look good for the year it came out in.Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a great movie to start with if you are watching an adventure movie for the first time. There might be one scene that might feel slow, but other than that, this movie is great and does not have many problems.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The action/adventure film that all others should be measured by...,"I just had a chance to see `Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the Cinerama format that serves it so well  It is too bad that the prints were not up to the screening.This is the time to see `Raiders..' on the big screen if you possibly can: the prints are already deteriorating and it will not be long before you will not be able to see it on anything but an edited version on the small screen or on video tape  neither one of which serves full justice to this magnificent film.The un-edited, full-screen version had a few surprises; not just language but a couple of scenes that are routinely cut from broadcast television; and, even with the best home theater system, you will not be able to get the full effect of the magnificent score by John Williams.This is one of those all-too-rare films that are as close to perfect as is possible.The attention to detail is more than just amazing  it is breath taking  As an example  when the Ark of the Covenant is finally exposed it would have been so much easier to just have it be'  but instead it is slowly lifted out of the case that holds it; allowing there to be a certain amount of suspense and a few good special effects to be used  the darn thing glows!  just as the word of god would glow.There is action, suspense, drama, comedy, horrible villains, incredible heroes and so much more.This is a film for the ages  and should be seen on the BIG screen if at all possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The greatest pure adventure film ever made.,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in my opinion, not only the finest film in the Indiana Jones trilogy but also the greatest pure adventure film ever made. Better than The Adventures of Robin Hood (with Errol Flynn), Where Eagles Dare, The Mask of Zorro, Romancing the Stone, The Mummy or any James Bond film.  This unadulterated thrill ride first exploded onto the big screen in 1981 and remains unsurpassed, despite many good and not-so-good imitators.Combining the immense talents of George Lucas as writer and producer, and Steven Spielberg as director, this film echoes the great cliffhanger serials of Hollywood yesteryear but also outshines them by a long way.  Set in the 1930s, Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones.  Jones is essentially a grave robber, a mercenary archaeologist who has hair-raising adventures uncovering rare artefacts.  He gets hired by the US government to uncover the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis, and is propelled into a thrilling globetrotting adventure.  Along the way he is helped by old flame Marion (the superb Karen Allen) and friend Sallah (the equally superb John Rhys Davis).There are really too many great scenes to mention.  From its riveting opening (that boulder scene), to the Nepal bar fight, the Arab swordsman, the map room, the snake pit, the truck chase and the supernatural finale as God's wrath is unleashed, this is as exciting as films get.  Spielberg is firing on all cylinders here and having great fun.  There are also many laugh-out-loud moments.  Where else will you see a monkey perform a Hitler salute?Ultimately, what really makes this film so interesting, is how Indy is just as obsessed with finding the Ark as the villain Belloq (the wonderfully slimy Paul Freeman).  Twice he chooses to abandon Marion because of his obsession.  As Belloq observes `you are a shadowy reflection of me', the cliché for once rings true.  In subsequent Indiana Jones films, he is far a more straightforward hero, here he is a much darker and more interesting character.Needless to say, the special effects, sound, music (the peerless John Williams), production design, editing, cinematography etc are well up to scratch.  It's impossible to find a more rattling good yarn than this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I like Indiana Jones,"Very nice, the best movie I ever seen. I like this kind of adventure film, Steven Spielberg is really a good director. The first one of Indiana Jones was great, the second one was so so, I don't no why they change the location to India, the third one was excellent, funny, and fascinate. I like the actor Harrison Ford too, he was a handsome guy, but the best movie I've seen from him was Indiana Jones, the another movies(like Air Force One) was so so. Was Indiana Jones born in Indiana or something, why do they call him Indiana Jones? By the way, let's talk about Steven Spielberg, the director. His movies are all very good, like Saving Private Ryan, Schdeler's list, Jurassic Park and E.T. There are all very good, he is a talented director, I hope he could keep directing movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A timeless adventure!,"Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is one of the greatest movies in cinematic history and it was given to us by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of my favorite filmmakers of all time.Positives for Raiders of the Lost Arks (1981):
For me, it is the story that makes this first movie such a timeless classic where you have this professor searching for this ancient artifact and he has to get it before the Nazis have the chance to use the extraordinary powers for their own needs. This is the movie that basically set the standard for all action-adventure movies in the future and yet none of them have even come close to reaching the level of greatness of this movie. One of the big reasons for that is the iconic musical score by the legendary John Williams. This is one of those scores that goes perfectly with the movie and that's saying that can't say for a lot of musical scores. The opening scene of this movie really sets the tone of what to expect for the rest of the runtime and it absolutely delivers on that. Then, you have to talk about the characters of this movie and they are all awesome. First, you have Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, who has this natural charm and charisma to him while also having a bit of a d*ck side to himself and yet you still love him for that. Then, you have his friend and allies with Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody who are among some of the best side characters in any action-adventure movie. Of course, you have the main villains of the Nazis led by Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq and Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht and they are among some of the most despicable and evil villains I've seen in any movie. The action-adventure side of this movie is phenomenal to where you have our characters trying to find the treasure before the enemy does and they beat up these fools. You get some great chase sequences, shootouts and even hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. I also love that there are a lot practical effects and real eyplosions being used and this movie's budget was $20 million. It's also worth noting that this was a PG Rated movie and it is very shocking with a lot of the imagery that is being shown to us and this was during that time when PG actually meant something. And finally, I loved that the movie tells us that the treasure is the things that matter, but it's the adventure that you go on that truly matters by the end of the movie.Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a cinematic classic that has stood the test of time with its timeless adventure and iconic characters. If you are one of these people who haven't watched this movie, then you need to watch it as soon as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Movie Makers in 1981 make a Movie together!,"What happens when you get the best director, the best producers, the best writers, the best composer, and the best actors all together to make a movie? You get Raiders of the Lost Ark! This movie is one of the best movies ever made because it employed some of the best people in the industry to make it.Many have tried to replicate the Indian Jones formula, but where they tend to fail is the undeniable chemistry between all the characters. With Harrison Ford's charisma, and Karen Allen's charm, mixed up with all of the many menacing villains, Raiders of the Lost Ark tells an intense, thrilling adventure story with high stakes that is enjoyable from start to finish.What really grabs me in any archeological story, is when the story elements are based on actual, real legends. Granted, I'm not really sure how much of the plot is actually based on real truth here (like the map room and the staff of rod), but the main plot point of finding the arc of the covenant is real. I suppose it's the hope / belief that the story is possible, makes me enjoy it more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

I feel that this is the shining light for young directors wanting to see how to make an action movie. Nothing needs to changed.

"5/5 There is no denying that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre.","It's one of the most impressive, most memorable, and most dynamically entertaining films I have ever experienced. George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan delivered lots of unexpected surprises to the whole script, and these surprises just kept on coming. The script is complemented by the slick and elaborate direction by Steven Spielberg. What makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stand out in the action/adventure genre, as well as for a winner for fans of this genre, is how smart it is; the film consistently throws in perilous obstacles to keep the film exciting, and we will never know what is coming, and when something happens, it really pays off. Even on repeat viewings, it is still unpredictable and satisfying in every way. Not to mention that the skillful craftsmanship on display will make it an inspiring film for those who want to be a filmmaker for the action/adventure genre.The production design is arresting and tangible, while the sound effects are gripping. From the audacious stunts, to the hard-hitting impact, and to the astonishing effects, The action sequences deliver a lot of sprightly momentum. The unintentionally comedic moments are clever in structure and quite gut-busting in execution, and I laughed at all of these comedic moments. I must add that no animals were hamred in the making of this film, including the snakes. They all spawned a dynamic adventure yarn that is altogether exhilarating, audacious, intelligent, and hilarious. Driven by high energy and melodic emotion, The dramatically invigorating music score by John Williams enhances the film entirely, as it vividly captures every element, and it strongly supports the film's genre and it's theme of heroism.The all of the characters have both brains and brawn that are equally matched. But each of them are distinct in personality. Also, the performances are first-rate indeed, and the interactions between the characters are intriguing and fun to watch. Both the protagonists and the antagonists are archeologists, but different in nationalities; the heroes (the main characters) are Americans, while the villains are Nazis, as they go head to head for the golden ark of god that invokes religious spirits, and the Nazis thought that the spirits will make the army invincible. Harrison Ford plays the main titular character; he is a heroic and collected archeologist. Marion is a tough and sassy bar tender who became Indy's partner and eventually a tormented damsel-in-distress. John Rhys-Davis is great as Indy's close friend ""Sallah"" with his amusing performance. Paul Freeman plays Rene, an ambitious jerk who is Indy's arch-nemesis, while Ronald Lacey is creepy as Major Arnold the Gestapo agent.In conclusion: With slick sophistication that offers superbly-staged set-pieces in spades throughout it's breezy pace, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a dynamic and rip-roaring non-stop ride of an adventure yarn with rollicking fun, breathtaking audacity, and sheer brilliance. Suitable for teens thirteen and up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the classic adventure-action movies Hollywood has made in a long time,"The movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has everything a viewer could ask for. From the opening scene, where Indy establishes himself as a go-for-broke adventurer doubling as a mild-mannered university professor, to the climatic scene where the lost Ark's contents are opened for inspection by ""unworthies"", the movie goes from one big adventure to another.  It plays like one of the 15-chapter serials that used to be made, as there are so many cliff-hanging escapes by Indiana Jones and his friends.  This film gave birth to two sequels that featured their own escapades, but this should rate as the best.  ""Raiders"" gives a new and exciting meaning to the term ""CLASSIC"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I love this movie... but I hate snakes.,"George Lucas and Steven Spielberg made a great duo. The movie is great, but the thing that sold this movie was the main theme. The Indiana Jones theme is among the most recognized themes in Hollywood today. It is also possibly my favorite movie theme of all time.Harrison Ford and Karen Allen both did very well. What else can I say? There's really no other way to describe it.The movie itself did very well at blending the action scenes that would threaten the Scorpion King with a solid story that doesn't look like it was put together simply to link the action scenes.I like the entire adventure-in-a-temple-to-find-a-cursed-relic theme. This was probably the best movie to this date that has done that.If you have not yet seen this movie, congratulations. You are more deprived of movies than me.

The birth of a cinema symbol,"This film marks the start of the Indiana Jones franchise. This film shows the adventures of an archaeologist/explorer, seeking valuable artifacts throughout the world. Directed by Steven Spielberg, has a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan on an original concept by George Lucas, and with the participation of Harrison Ford in the title role.This film is based on reports on how the German Nazis sought ancient relics, considered magical, and pillaged works of art. The script proved to be functional and able to tell a story quite logically, vivid and interesting, but of course it has flaws, beginning with the complete absence of historical truth. Although the plot is situated temporally in the period immediately before the Second World War, this film had no major concerns with historical accuracy. The film also marked the collective imagination about how it may have been the Ark of the Covenant, a Judeo-Christian relic about which abound the legends and myths. Harrison Ford was fully up to the challenge and honored the audience with a strong and impressive interpretation. The sets and shooting locations make our imagination go beyond the film itself, the action scenes were good and the soundtrack, written by John Williams, quickly became one of the most famous in the movies.This film gave rise to a true cinematic and cultural icon that now everyone knows, even those who are not regular lovers of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The greatest action/adventure movie every made.,"The exciting saga of an archaeologist who is sought upon by the United States Government to find The Ark of the Covenant before the Germans do. The future of the free world depends on Jones finding the relic, because ""he who marches with the ark before him is believed to be invincible"". The film mixes fantasy with an actual circumstance that could develop, which keeps the viewer on the edge of his. Jones is faced against his arch enemy Renee Belloq, a French archieologist, who heads the expedition that takes place in random abstract locations around the globe. Jones is joined with Marion Ravenwood, his former teacher's daughter, on this great quest to save mankind. Ronald Lacey is excellent as Toht, Belloq's allie and a sinister villain who will kill anyone who stands in his way. Some great scenes include the infamous ""boulder chasing Indy scene"" and the ""pit full of snakes"". The film also contains the greatest action sequence in the history of filmaking-The Desert Chase. To tell any more would ruin the movie. A film everyone should see, and a film one can watch over and over again. My favorite movie of all time, it is #60 on the AFI's top 100 list.

From the opening scene until the end credits i was glued to the screen, and enjoyed every second of it.It was also my introduction to actors that i would come to love over the years, such as Karen Allen, John Rhys-Davies and Alfred Molina. This is a film that when ever it crosses my mind, it is with the deepest and greatest adulation.As far as i am concerned Raiders of the lost ark is the greatest adventure film ever made. It is a film that set a new standard, to which all films of action and adventure there after, could only strive to compare.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A comic strip allegory,"This is a comic strip movie for viewers who are kids at heart--- those who recognize it for what it is, and are willing to suspend disbelief without a second thought.The sequences for the Map Room and the Well of Souls are Super!! And, the sets are MAGNIFICENT!!The sequence when Belloq opens the Ark, and fire consumes him and the other servants of evil and burns the bonds from Indy and Marion---I consider to be an allegoryI was massively p****d when Karen Allen wasn't cast in the 2nd ""Indy"" movie (Temple of Doom), which, by the way I thought was a ""pukey"" film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

One of the greatest films ever,"'Raiders of the Lost Ark' kicks off what is a truly special trilogy. Recent trilogies like Spider-Man, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Star Wars prequel trilogy may come close, but can't quite match Indiana Jones- especially 'Raiders' and 'The Last Crusade.' Truly Harrison Ford brings so much charisma and relatability to the character. Kudos to George Lucas for writing yet another compelling story, and to Steven Spielberg's direction, one of several classics that he has directed.Bringing in an artifact like the Ark of the Covenant from the Bible surely is a risky move, but with the message that is sent to those who are evil and seek it for power, the storyline is acceptable. Besides, you can't dislike a guy who is completely human, without any added benefits, yet is willing to take on the challenge of keeping such a sacred artifact from the Nazis. Plus, the character of Indiana Jones is relatable because he's not perfect. Yes, he will think ""what the heck"" and shoot a master sword-wielder. Then, as a human, he does things that are partly beyond conceivable, but still perhaps possible- stunts like single-handedly taking over a Mercedes truck, including the feat of sliding under the truck. Just amazing stuff that can only be executed through proper direction.Overall, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one of my favorite movies, and for good reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A Cultural Treasure,"I love this movie. It is exactly as magical and fun as when I saw it as a kid: a deeply cheesy adventure movie, but one that hits all the right notes.

Classic Action & Adventure,"This film is an action-adventure classic that entertains any audience of any age. Harrison Ford embodies the franchise character stretching over a forty-year period. The role of Indiana Jones was initially offered to Tom Selleck, but he declined due to his commitment to Magnum, P. I. It is a testament to Ford's stardom that he can continue to attract audiences to the franchise regardless of whether or not the script is any good. A couple of the subsequent Indy films have suffered from bad storylines and poorly written scripts. Credit Lawrence Kasdan for writing a great script to start the franchise. It's a fun and entertaining movie best enjoyed with a bowl of popcorn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Dynamic 2 hours of cinematic magic.,"I've heard various comments in recent years of how Schindler's List is Spielberg maturing as a director. But in reality he matured in 1975 with Jaws, which along with Close Encounters, Raiders, and ET are the director at the very peak of his powers. Schindler, although superb, appears to be the director trying a little too hard to be serious and adult. Raiders is as 'adult' as any film you're likely to see in its remarkably sophisticated technique and mastery of audience manipulation, which along with Jaws even tops Hitch in this area. Spielbergs visual flair is astounding at times in this film, the natural fluidity of camera work and the perfect use of light, particularly in facial lighting is brilliant. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a genuine cinematic masterpiece and will gain this status over time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Meet Indiana Jones in one of the finest action adventure movies that is still an exciting experience.,"Raiders of the Lost Ark (also known as Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark) which was released in 1981 is still highly regarded as one of the finest action adventure movies that is still exciting over 40 years later. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this movie would be the first time audiences would be introduced to the iconic action hero Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford which would also kickstart an amazing franchise. It would also introduce audiences to the iconic theme song known as the ""Raiders March"" by John Williams. I still regard Raiders of the Lost Ark as one of the most exciting and fun filled action adventure movies.Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones (Harrison Ford) is a globe-trotting archaeology professor who teaches at Marshall College but also searches for treasure and artifacts. Indiana Jones is hired by US Intelligence officers to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a biblical relic said to make an army invincible. His loyal friend and museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) makes a deal to have the Ark displayed in a museum after it has been captured. Indiana Jones joins forces with his tough and spirited former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and his fellow ally and friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) to race against time to prevent rival archaeologist Dr. René Belloq (Paul Freeman) and Gestapo Major Arnold Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) from obtaining the Ark to give to Adolf Hitler's Nazis to make them more powerful.Harrison Ford is a perfect fit as Indiana Jones with his trademark fedora and whip. Harrison Ford would show us that Indiana Jones is tough, intelligent, vulnerable and a hero the audiences can and always will cheer for. Indiana Jones would make the list as one of the most memorable action heroes of all time.Steven Spielberg has done an amazing job recreating the excitement and thrills of the classic adventure serials of yesteryear.Raiders of the Lost Ark would become the number 1 box office hit of 1981 and leave a lasting impact on popular culture. It also won 5 Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Score.Not content with a quadrilogy, Harrison Ford has decided to don the fedora again for an untitled fifth movie is set for release in 2023.Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Indiana Jones franchise is still popular amongst many fans and audiences. 40 years on, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still a classic action adventure.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The beginning of a special relationship between Lucas and Spielberg...,"When George Lucas, the director of Star Wars and American graffiti, teamed up with Steven Spielberg, who created Jaws and Close Encounters, to make the most popular movie of the first year of the Reagan era, the result is classic. Sure, younger people might be bored by the slow moving pace, but be fascinated by the special effects and action scenes which were ahead of its time when it first came out 36 years ago. The success of this film spawned a prequel, Temple of Doom, and two sequels, The Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A fifth one is in development and will come out by the end of the decade.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Classic in the Truest Sense of the Word,"I have nostalgic memories of watching this film with my dad, on TV, ad breaks and all, and probably heavily edited for a prime time TV audience. Raiders of the Lost Ark is great adventure film, with all the necessary ingredients to be not only a classic, but a firm favourite for those who viewed it upon release.It's sees our eponymous hero, adventurer, lecturer, and archaeologist Indianna Jones (Harrison Ford), as he attempts to track down the legendary Ark of the Covenant before the evil nazis get their paws on it. A globetrotting, esoteric adventure, 'Indie' goes from Nepal to Egypt, and many places in between. On his journey he encounters many enemies, a few friends, and even an ex-lover, Marion (Karen Allen). The film culminates in Indie and co being captured by evil French man René Belloq, who bats for the Nazis. An exciting and intense battle scene feeds us to and horrifying and somewhat scary end scene, marrying elements of the supernatural to a film that already ticks boxes for me. This really is a good old fashioned classic globe-trotters tale, with an iconic character. I mean, whose idea was the whip? Iconic!The plotline of the film is well established and, though I haven't watched this film in about eight months, I can't really recall any glaring plotholes within. Lucas, Kaufman, and Kasdan have admittedly written a great script, with exciting and awe-inspiring elements. Dialogue seems natural and fresh, and isn't awkward or jankey. The story progresses at an excitable pace but still leaves time for conversations to take place that reveal important information, either relating directly to the main plotline, or around various subplots, which helps world build. I can't really fault the writing at all, overall it's incredible.The direction from Spielberg is to be lauded. I have a confession of sorts to make, I'm not the biggest Spielberg fan, primarily because I haven't seen a lot of his movies. I think Indianna Jones and Jaws is about it at this point, other than films I saw long, long ago. For the time period, 1981, it's a great film with some truly groundbreaking moments. It's hard to argue that Spielberg clearly had a vision, and though we may never know for a certainty how he envisioned this work, I think it's fair to say it's an absolute gem. Shots are exciting, cinematic, pure. That alongside a score that conjures up the same feelings and matches the energy the film is giving, creates an engaging, no, engrossing movie that had me hooked from start to finish, even as a small child. The edit and special effects are great too. The edit is seamless. I also think a good edit comes truly comes down to being able to compliment the style and vision of the director, and to not be too noticeable. I think an edit that compliments the shots and the story, to be a success. This film has an edit that is genuinely interesting, yet does in fact compliment the direction, the shots and the way the plot unravels. The effects are amazing for 1981. I truly freaked out the first time I saw the climatic scene and I think, although they haven't aged fantastically today, that the special effects still hold up.Let's not ignore physical effects and set design either. A globe-trotting tale like this needs the sets to back it up, and even now as an older child (I'm 28), I still think the costume, set design and physical effects are something else. The keen eye for detail, to create sets and scenery of this calibre is, dare I say, something modern cinema, especially Hollywood, seemingly lacks. The Egyptian town looks and feels authentic, the scene in Nepal is isolating, cold even. A lot of time and effort, money too, has been put into this aspect of the film, and it pays dividends.I can't really fault the acting either. Harrison Ford in the lead role with Laren Allen supporting is great casting. Realistically, Ford IS Indie, that's a retrospective take, I appreciate that, but the chemistry between Ford and Allen is undeniable. On screen they are great, and Paul Freeman and Ronald Lacey deserve to take a bow too. Really capturing the villainous side of Nazis, in which Spielberg doesn't hold back in depicting them as truly evil, psychotic people, who are obsessed with occultism and the paranormal.This is a must watch for fans of adventure films, Spielberg, classics and well, fans of cinema. You can see where it has gained its inspiration (the likes of Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia), and you can see what it's inspired. There's a lot here for everyone. History, adventure, exciting battle scenes, romance, betrayal. It's got it all. A good watch, especially this time of year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best adventure films ever made,"One of the most well-known films in history and certainly one of the crown jewels of Steven Spielberg's career. Which is saying something. The character of Indiana Jones has become a pop culture icon and probably the bane of every archaeology professor who has had to explain to his students that no, the movies have almost nothing to do with real archaeology.Still, whether it's grave robbing, tomb raiding or whatever else, this film is a total blast of pulp adventure goodness. From the first iconic scene of the dirty and grumbled Harrison Ford turning to stare at the camera in an age when most cinema heroes were squeaky clean and flawless to the main story about the lost Ark of the Covenant and the desperate race against the Nazis, who want to claim its powers for their own war effort.This movie has numerous upsides, but what I personally like the most about it is its sense of adventure. The film takes us all over the globe, from the temples of Peru to the Himalayas and finally to Cairo. Each location is a great place for an adventure and given a weight of history, fun and excitement. The characters are also a big part of the film. Indiana Jones of course being the main event, but all the side characters are also memorable and fun. From Indiana's feisty ex Marion (Karen Allen) to the steadfast and boastful Sallah (John Rhys- Davies). The villains are also entertaining and memorable as only Nazis can be. It's a joy to watch them lose.And do I even need to say any more? You've all seen this film. If you haven't, congratulations on finally being old enough to be allowed to see it. Enjoy.

Raiders of the lost ark review,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a unique film like no other. This film like the other three films gives you the adventure feels that our main character Indy does. The thing that works very well is the companionship between the director Spielberg and Lucas they created a wonderful adventurous world. The story is so well structured, from the setup to the confrontation, it keeps us at the edge of our seats without a single yawn. Let's talk about Harrison Ford and Karen Allen, their companionship in the movie is amazing Marion (Karen Allen) is not that girl that always needs to be saved by Indy (Harrison Ford), in some occasions she saves Indy's life. Our hero Indy (Harrison Ford) has the word iconic written on his forehead, he is the perfect hero he is charming, bad ass, smart everything a hero needs. The movie has an exceptional movie score by Academy award winning John Williams, his score is tense and brilliant. The movie has incredible shots the cinematography is quite amazing, as well as those visual effects, and nails a perfect editing. The direction from Steven Spielberg is fantastic we can see he really did put effort into the movie. Overall this is one of the best films of all time (My favorite movie) it has action, romance, suspense, and it is for the whole family, the kids will love this film. Seek this film out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the most original films ever made!,"I don't think there was a decade where more original movies were made than the 1980s. This was the one that sparked classics like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Dick Tracy"", ""The Neverending Story"" and , of course, the other ""Indiana Jones"" movies. It is both a satire and a tribute to the old adventure serials shown on TV that Steven Spielberg hated and George Lucas loved. It is a very politically incorrect film with cartoony visuals (that I hope never get changed!) and a brilliant musical score.I have seen this movie a million times and find it just as entertaining as when I first watched it on a Saturday afternoon in place of a matinee film. It truly is unlike any film I had seen before. Who on earth would have dreamed up an archaeologist as an adventurer? That is the basis for many things to come.It is a strange sensation trying to put this film into words. It is dry, silly, nutty, constantly loaded with action and yet it remains one of the greatest films of all time. I'll see what I can do in describing it:""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is set in Pre-World War II times when the Nazis, apparantly, were obbsessed with religious artefacts and tried to take possession of the fabled Ark of the Covenant which contains some vast power. It really exists in a universe of its own (think ""Being John Malkovich"") and not ours which is what makes it such great escapism. The man who has been assigned by the U.S. government to track the Nazis down is an archaeologist named Indiana Jones. What follows is an epic set in several locales of weird beauty and surprisingly good places for chase scenes and fight scenes.This movie is set in South America, North America, Nepal, Egypt, Tunisia (I think), the Atlantic Ocean and some unknown deserted island. It has fight scenes and ""temple scenes"" involving Nazis, drunken Nepalese men, swordsmen, marksmen, traitorous jungle men and one big, bad Nazi soldier. It also has the best chase scene ever in a movie involving numerous vehicles, weapons and endlessly creative opportunities. What I have just described is what is on the surface level.The subtext in this movie comes from the universe it creates - and rips off. The sets look as though they have been built for destroying, the costumes look like they have been taken out of the circus, the make-up is deliberately bad, the acting is over-the-top and sentimental and the special effects are cheesy, tacky and meant to be that way. I hope they never update this film!What makes this film convincing is the brilliant camera work, editing, direction, sound effects and music. They make the cartoony universe all the more convincing and it provides a balance for the sometimes biting subtext. The other side of the balancing act is done on the entertainment scale. I believe this film to be the best pure entertainment ever!(One other thing. The character of Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones. The most original anti-hero ever made. That ""shooting-of-the-swordsman"" scene shows just what kind of a character he is!)I said before that Steven Spielberg hated adventure serials and George Lucas loved them. I found this out from a book on Lucasfilm's CV. This is what I think made the film such a spectacular success. This is one of my favourite films. a genuine original in the tradition of ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Truman Show"". Never change it, Mr. Spielberg. You have done an amazing job! 10/10!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Thrill A Minute!,"Watching this movie again on DVD's is fascinating, and it really brought back great memories of going to the theater with dad and having one hell of a ride. While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed. Most action movies don't necessarily have to have strong plot points, but I think that Raiders did an excellent job at mixing together the right elements with the story and sustaining great flow for the physical scenes.What do you mean you haven't seen the movie? It's a classic! Here's a brief: Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist who is hired by the US Govt to search for the Ark of the Covenant. He's not the only one who's looking for it, though, as Nazi Germans are also trying to track it down. Eventually, Indy will have to come face to face with the Nazi's to uncover the secret of the Ark. In between, there's chasing, flying, jumping, fights, and even a little love.Taking off old cliffhanger movies from the 1940's serials, it's difficult to pick a favorite scene! Was it the sword-wielding man in Cairo? (and Indy just 'shoots him'!) The boulder scene with all the traps? The chase scene with the Nazi's at the end? There were many rip-off's and copy cats after this movie came out, and most of them were rubbish (a few were good, but i can't think of any!). It established Ford as an action/thriller actor, Spielberg was a household name, and the following sequels weren't bad either! The movie remains watchable, and re-watchable, years and years later.

The Greatest Adventure Movie of All Time,"From beginning to end, this rip-roaring action movie is perfect.  It was my favorite movie for years until it was topped by another Spielberg film, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (and only because that movie's subject matter is more important)It hits perfection on everything associated with adventure films, and nothing in its genre has come close to topping it since, save maybe its first sequel, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""It has a great plot, characters, music, exotic locales, villains, stunts, cinematography, and special effects.  Thrilling and expertly choreographed and photographed action sequences--the gunfight in the Nepalese bar and the hijacking of the Nazi plane are excellent examples.  It deserves its spot on the AFI list of the top 100 greatest movies of all time.  It was inspired by the serials of the 1930's, but represents them better than those films do themselves.  The stunt work is incredible, with hero Indiana Jones (introduced here for the first time) running from giant boulders, dragged underneath trucks, and punching and whipping his way through dozens of fights with nasty bad guys.  Harrison Ford is excellent, and so are all the supporting roles, especially Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, and Ronald Lacey as Toht, who is possibly movie history's most menacing henchman. ""Raiders"" is also scary and suspensful--many of us who grew up in the eighties remember being frightened by the beautiful spectre released by the Ark, who then morphs into a screaming death's head.  Its also quite amazing that the many snakes and spiders in this film were all real.Whenever you feel down, this is the movie to watch.  Pure escapism.  It is so uplifting and exciting, what more could you ask for?  Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the Lost Ark...An Adventure Incomparable To Any Other,"Truly the greatest way to start off an adventurous trilogy! Raiders of the Lost Ark proudly introduced Indiana Jones to the world. He fights as both an archaeologist and an adventurer to get ahold of the treasures he is looking for. He will stop at nothing to get the Germans out of his way, but the action sequences are extraordinary and it's great to see Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood team up and find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford make a great trio together and all come up with Indiana Jones' greatest adventures. Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark made me want to rush off and watch the next installment of the famous trilogy. I recommend Raiders of the Lost Ark for anyone interested in the adventures of archaeology and a of course the World War II subject. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford have outdone themselves in the production and a brilliant classic adventure film was born!

RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (DIDIER BECU),"Why are we watching movies? You can come up with thousands of reasons but the main reason Spielberg is exploring must be rediscovering the child in us...he did it with so many movies (from ET to Hook) but Indiana Jones must be the ultimate superhero. All is based on the great adventuremovies of the fifties, you know Burt Lancaster and other Rod Taylors, but perhaps it's the budget, perhaps it's the humour (Harrison Ford is funny), perhaps it's the B-movieacting...je ne sais pas but Raiders Of The Lost Ark is adventure at its best. The original of the trilogy (well, you all know Indy 4 is in the make) brings us back to the thirties at where Indiana Jones is set to Cairo to stop the nazis finding the lost ark (a tomb in where the ten commandments are hidden) and along with Marion (a great acting Karen Allen, just shame about the red trousers) they are having adventure after adventure.

It is a perfect family film for all ages to watch. It also features my favourite scene where Indy shoots the swordsman with a tired sigh.

This defines adventure,This movie is awesome and they will never come out with another one like it. The beginning of this movie is the best of the trilogy. The whole movie is excellent. Even though i think this one isnt as good as the other two i still rate this one very high. I choose Last Crusade over this one because the storyline was better and more creative and Temple of Doom was creepy yet somewhat realistic.

"Introducing Indiana Jones, archaeologist-adventurer extraordinaire","Steven Spielberg's classic adventure film ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" hardly requires introduction. Harrison Ford stars in what is perhaps his signature role, that of rugged archaeologist Indiana Jones. Here the U.S. government recruits him to track down the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can get their hands on it. Thus begins the first of (to date) four films based on the adventures of Indiana Jones.The script, written by Lawrence Kasdan from a story by George Lucas & Philip Kaufman, is jam-packed with action & adventure. There are numerous classic scenes, though I think that the characterization & humour is not quite as sharp here as it would become later on. All in all, the story is a rousing, old-fashioned adventure yarn recapturing the spirit of a bygone era.The cast, while not exactly stocked with A-list names, proves to be well-assembled. Harrison Ford is ideal as Indiana Jones; one can hardly imagine anyone else playing the character. Karen Allen fares well as Jones's love interest but I think that the most memorable supporting performances come from the likes of John Rhys-Davies, Paul Freeman & Ronald Lacey.Spielberg's direction is well handled as always but I'm not completely sold on Douglas Slocombe's sometimes overly dark cinematography. The score, on the other hand, ranks as one of John Williams's best, which means that it is very good indeed. ""The Raider's March"" is one of the most instantly recognizable themes in all of film and ""Marion's Theme"" is quite memorable as well.In conclusion, the Indiana Jones films (especially this one) are essential viewing for any film fan. Start here and continue on to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and (my favourite) ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
George Lucas + Harrison Ford = Greatness!,"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is yet another example of what a great screenwriter George Lucas is, what a great director Spielburg is, and what a great actor Harrison Ford is. Lucas and Ford are a recipe for greatness, as we have seen in the Indiana Jones movies and in the Star Wars trilogy.Review: The movie takes place around WWII when the Nazis are gathering up all the worlds treasure and artifacts. This time, it's the Ark of the Covenant from the Bible. Indy's job is to recover that from them...and stay alive in the process.Objectionable content: Amounts to gore. In the beginning of the movie, Indy's greedy helper tries to take an idol that has been booby trapped, and ends up suffering a gruesome and gory death. Other scenes include skulls inside a cave filled with snakes (Indy hates snakes) and, probably the nastiest part in the whole movie, at the end when the main bad guys open up the Ark, a white light comes out and their flesh melts away. It looks pretty fake and kinda looks like wax melting, but it's still pretty nasty. Other OC is the main bad guy (who dies a grisly death in the end) is a really bad guy who sends chills down your spine. There is a little suggestive content when Indy's girl friend (not girlfriend) is changing and one of the main bad guys looks at her back when she is in a bra (not anything much). There are lots of scary moments, and some really nasty parts, but it's still a great movie.Conclusion: I would recommend this to a fan of thrillers, Harrison Ford, or anyone who is interested in ancient artifacts. A great movie starring a great actor and a great storyline written by a great screenwriter and directed by a great director. Not recommended for children under the age of 13.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bad Dates. Great Film.,"I have rewatched this countless times and each time I decide to rewatch this movie it just gets better each and every single time. It's one of those films that ages like fine wine. It clearly still is for me and like many others out there the be all end all adventure opus and best Indiana Jones movie to date. Without this film too there would likely not have been many other franchises like National Treasure and especially in the video game community such as Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia and the Uncharted series. But alas, I have minimal things bad to say about this timeless classic so I'll just go on record for saying from the acting to the pacing to the downright sheer and utter memorable John Fudging Williams score and well executed directing, Raiders of the Lost Ark is pretty much the complete package. There were a ton of memorable moments, scenes and quotes all around to boot that were parodied and often replicated and imitated in the years to come. Lastly, Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones like he was born into the role and becomes an instant classic character immortalized into cinematic history just like his Han Solo Star Wars character before him. Overall if you've never seen this movie I envy you if you plan on watching it for the first time. I would kill to have that feeling and experience for witnessing this damn near masterpiece for the very first time again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The classic action film,"This is one of the best movies I have seen.  It is the first of 3 in a great series, a series that knew when to quick too.

One of the greats,"After my family had seen this movie in 1981, my mother tried to break it down like the serials that had inspired it.  She had a cliffhanger almost every two minutes!  I had to disagree with her there but that example shows just how jam packed the movie is with excitement.  Almost the perfect adventure movie (marred by the grotesque finish), the movie features today's PC villains (nazis), great scenery and hair-raising stunts (the battle aboard the truck carrying the ark, is one the best ever).  One of the few movies that everyone should see in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The first and best of the Indy films,"'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the first and, in my opinion, the best of the Indiana Jones films. This film is almost 40 years old but remains today one of the best and most iconic action/adventure movies of all time. For sheer entertainment value, there aren't many films that have come close to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' since its 1981 release.What makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' stand out from the rest of the Indy films is the story. It's fast-paced, exciting, tense and hugely enjoyable. There are some memorable individual action scenes that put any modern day CGI dominated action sequences to shame. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an iconic action movie that has stood the test of time. Definitely a classic of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Indiana Wants Me,"I'm not the biggest fan of either Steven Spielberg, George Lucas or Harrison Ford come to that. ""E. T."", ""Close Encounters"", or even the whole ""Star Wars"" thing, I hate them all. But this is different. I do love a swashbuckling adventure movie and here Spielberg gives us the ultimate old-fashioned actioner. Spielberg has described his Indiana Jones as his take on James Bond, only with less intrigue and less sex but with more excitement and levity. Like Bond, Indy has his own signature theme tune, gets a spine tingling big-budget opening prologue, can fight like the blazes and of course, gets the girl. Setting the movie during the Second World War provides easily identifiable baddies in the form of the pursuing Nazis and also means it has much less reliance on modern gimmicks and gadgets. If anything though the set-piece action sequences are better here than anything surely done to date even whilst some of the stunts recall Golden Age Hollywood, for example Indy's crawl under a speeding truck is only a variation of the same under an out-of-control wagon in many a Western of yore.Richly shot, the set constructions are excellent, the outside locations are radiantly captured, the special effects and stunts are great, I especially liked Spielberg's imaginative use of silhouettes in some of the scenes. The script is tight and witty and is clever enough to preface later actions with earlier clues, like Alice's drinking ability and Indy's fear of snakes. There are also some nice throwaway comedic lines with not a raised eyebrow in sight.The destructive effects of the Ark fully live up to dread expectation in the Germans' submarine bay but other highlights include the afore-mentioned car-chase and Jones' short and sweet encounter with a surprise whip-waving adversary.As a great lover of old Hollywood, plot-thin, action-packed blockbusters, this could hardly be bettered with Harrison Ford echoing the spirit of Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Stewart Grainger. This is one of those rare movies which looks as much fun to make as it is to watch and thoroughly deserved its huge box-office success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Can action/adventure films get any better?,"No. This is THE action/adventure film. If entertainment can get better when it comes to action, this film would run a close second. The action is non-stop, the beginning is classic, and the plot is great.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Excellent adventure film but not the best ever,"This movie consists of 110 minutes of pure escapist fun. That's the shortest accurate description of it: Its a flawless adventure film, vastly superior to its mediocre sequels (specially the Crystal Skull one a film mediocre par-excellence).The film takes place in the late 1930′s and opens with Indiana Jones, a professor of archaeology which also does ""freelance work"" by robing ancient sites of its most valuable possessions, captures an invaluable Inca gold statuette. Later the film progresses to the main plot: the Nazis appear to have discovered the general location of the Lost Ark, which is said to house the actual 10 commandments. The film then progresses around the conflict of finding and possessing the Ark.So, if the film is flawless why not give a perfect score? Because, although it is excellent, the film does not reach greatness to the point of really making me say: ""what a f*cking great film"", after seeing it. Its perfect entertainment, but it is not the greatest adventure film ever made (to me, Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is the greatest adventure film ever made, superior to this one in nearly every respect).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Adventure movies at their finest,"**Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark** (1981) - 9/10""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas, is a quintessential adventure film that has captivated audiences since its release. Harrison Ford delivers a charismatic performance as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist with a knack for finding trouble and treasure alike. The film excels in its blend of action, adventure, and humor, featuring memorable set pieces like the iconic boulder chase and the thrilling escape from the Well of Souls.The screenplay, written by Lawrence Kasdan, skillfully balances fast-paced action with clever dialogue and a compelling narrative. The film's pacing is tight, ensuring that viewers remain engaged throughout its runtime. John Williams' score is another standout element, with its adventurous themes perfectly complementing the on-screen action.Visually, the film makes effective use of practical effects and set pieces, which lend a tangible quality to the action sequences that CGI often lacks. The film's attention to detail and adherence to classic adventure serials give it a timeless appeal.Overall, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a masterclass in adventure filmmaking. It successfully combines thrilling escapades with rich character development, making it a classic that continues to entertain new generations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best of them all...,"Out of the entire trilogy, this one is probably the best of the bunch, but then again the first one usually is. Our hero, affable archeologist adventurer and Nazi slayer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in the role that will no doubt be what he's best remembered for when he's gone) joins forces with old flame Marion (Karen Allen) and Cairo based digger pal Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) in a race to get the Lost Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis get it. Chaos and mayhem ensues.After a slightly boring 20 minute gap from the opening to the first shoot out in the snow bound bar, this is a fairly well paced adventure that pits you against spiders, ghosts, the Atlantic ocean, and Pat Roach. Parents be advised though: some of this is not for kids.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Harrison Ford's most memorable role.,"Indiana Jones is a different kind of action movie. Taken place in 1936 when the Nazi party was still running Germany. And WW2 was yet to occur.Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. is an archaeologist who is likes to travel the world to find adventure and priceless artifacts. Course not all the time does he succeed in getting what he wants.One day when he's attending his archeology class at an university in Washington D.C. he's given a job in finding something that's said to be impossible to uncover. The Lost Ark that the Hebrews carried back in the days of Moses. Which is said to be a connection with communicating with God. The price of the Ark is unimaginable.Finding this ark will be risky and a challenge when the Nazis are already in progress in locating it in the Deserts of Africa. Once Indy finds the Ark he'll learn it's more than a price less artifact for a display in a museum.Raiders of the Lost Ark is done by the same people who did Star Wars. Directed by Spielberg and written by George Lucas. It has action, humor, fights, and plenty of good stuff for a perfect action filled movie.

"""Raiders"" - a classic film in every way.","Raiders of the Lost Ark, starring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. The story of Raiders is, in my opinion, one of the best in film history and the acting is excellent as well. The story deals with Indy being assigned to an important mission- to obtain the Lost Ark of the Covenant from the evil Nazis. Indy moves from continent to continent, running into old friends (and thousands of poisonous snakes!) along the way. The film's best part is a fantastic chase in which the Nazis try to steal the ark away from Indy who has driven away in a truck which is carrying the ark. The film's conclusion, Nazis being wiped out by the power of the ark, is classic, as Indy and Marion escape disaster narrowly.

awesome,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is as silly as a Saturday morning cartoon and as corny and historically inaccurate as a children's history book. But is one the greatest action/adventure movies ever made.The reasons because of that is because of the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama. Also because the character of Indiana Jones is likable and believable. Don't dismiss this film as a silly children's romp. For someone who is more into art house films and serious films, Raiders is an edge of your seat thrill ride that won't fail to entertain. The story of the Nazi's wanting to get the lost ark is silly but it works anyway, because it gives a reason to root for Jones, for him to succeed, and to give us breathtaking, flawless entertainment.If you love movies, don't miss Raiders of the Lost Ark. It exciting, funny, and brilliant. It deserves to be in the AFI's top 100 American films of all time. Don't miss this great ride.P.S. Don't forget the popcorn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Not the grand-daddy, but maybe the grandchild of all things adventure?","I kid you not: the first 10 minutes of the movie actually made me HATE the movie. I mean, Raiders of the Lost Ark was an Arachnophobe's nightmare - 3 tarantulas clinging at the back of Indiana Jones was enough, but a hundred on Alfred Molina's character? Jesus Christ, bless his soul. So, being an arachnophobe, that ticked me off already and I had to put off the movie for a good night, or two. However, that wasn't really going to stop me from watching one of the greatest movies ever (as said by Empire in its '301 Greatest Movies Of All Time'). And so, I found my courage once again, skipped the part with the tarantulas, and continued on with the movie.All I can say is: Wow. There's no wonder this movie is one of those movies you just have to watch. It is a complete masterpiece of an 80s classical flick - vintage, kinda'-sorta' cheesy story-wise, a bit of flawed logic here and there, and the protagonist with a beautiful girl at the end. Yes, In the year 2015, we've probably seen it all already and critiquing the themes of this movie in this day and age would not be fair, for sure. But had I been given the chance to watch this movie when it was first released in 1981, I'm pretty sure I would've said to myself: ""Boy, this movie will set the bar for many more adventure movies to come... hopefully"".In terms of the cinematography, the acting, the casting, and the story, I could all give those a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5. Nothing spectacular, but still pretty awesome, nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Indiana Jones is the best film in the world!,"I can not think of any film that has captivated me as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark. This film is perfect. First of all i want to sat that Harrison Ford deserved an oscar nomination for his performance in this film. He is just great. He is much more than just a standard action hero, we see both the good and bad aspects of the character. I also love the way he portrays humour, like when he shots the swords man. I can not imagine anyone else in this role and think that had Tom Selleck got the role the film would not have been as successful. Denholm Elliot is great as Indiana's most trusted friend, as is Karen Allen as his love interest. The bad guys are also good. I like it that the main the main bad guy (played by Paul Freeman) is in many ways similar to Indiana Jones. This gives the film something more than most action films where there is a clear distinction between the bad and good guys, in Raiders there is not. I can't think of the words to sum up Spielberg's direction, he is simply perfect. This is by far his best movie. I like almost all of his films, but this is his shinning moment. In closing this is the best film ever watch it when your young and it will change your life, i don't know anyone who isn't an Indiana Jones fan.

Will always be Indy's best expedition,"After more than 40 years of the 'Indiana Jones' franchise, the original still remains the high point. 1981's 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' has the perfect mix of action, drama, suspense and of course, comedy, that sets it apart from other films in the genre.Yes, it feels dated to watch it in 2023, but the quality of the script and screenplay hold up amid the countless cookie-cutter movies that studios churn out these days. Of course, the lion's share of credit goes to Harrison Ford, who is unquestionably able to bring the fedora and whip-donning tomb raider to life unlike anyone else out there (sorry, Angelina Jolie). The chemistry with fellow archeological-phile Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) also still hits, as do the sinister-yet-imbecile Nazi antagonists that are on a quest to find the long lost ark of the covenant.Yes, the special effects are rough to watch (face melts, anyone?), but they should be viewed through the lens of a time capsule of sorts - similar to another famous George Lucas franchise. It's more important to judge the film for its overall excitement factor, which remains high, thanks in part to plenty of dead-pan comedic moments (refer to ""never bring a sword to a gun fight"").Even with the highly-anticipated upcoming release of the fifth and final installment of the Indy series, 'Raiders' will always be the most unique expedition from Dr. Jones.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A thrill-a-minute ride of a movie!,"Watching this movie again on DVD's is fascinating, and it really brought back great memories of going to the theater with dad and having one hell of a ride. While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed. Most action movies don't necessarily have to have strong plot points, but I think that Raiders did an excellent job at mixing together the right elements with the story and sustaining great flow for the physical scenes.What do you mean you haven't seen the movie? It's a classic! Here's a brief: Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist who is hired by the US Govt to search for the Ark of the Covenant. He's not the only one who's looking for it, though, as Nazi Germans are also trying to track it down. Eventually, Indy will have to come face to face with the Nazi's to uncover the secret of the Ark. In between, there's chasing, flying, jumping, fights, and even a little love.Taking off old cliffhanger movies from the 1940's serials, it's difficult to pick a favorite scene! Was it the sword-wielding man in Cairo? (and Indy just 'shoots him'!) The boulder scene with all the traps? The chase scene with the Nazi's at the end? There were many rip-off's and copy cats after this movie came out, and most of them were rubbish (a few were good, but i can't think of any!). It established Ford as an action/thriller actor, Spielberg was a household name, and the following sequels weren't bad either! The movie remains watchable, and re-watchable, years and years later.

It's an old fashioned serial adventure that has never been duplicated,"When I was 11 years old I saw the front cover of a magazine my Mother was reading and there was Han Solo tied to a stake with some girl. I immediately knew I had to see the movie. When I finally convinced someone to take me it was one of the most magical experiences of my movie going life. Up until then only two movies had made me feel that way in the theater: Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Little did I know that the two great directors had come together to product this masterpiece. It borrows the best of movie serials of the past, the adventure stories and travel pieces of the time, fantasy, history and features the best villains ever in the world: Nazis!!! Yes. These guys stink. I had learned about them in regular school, Hebrew school and TV. I hated them for what they had done to my ancestors and here was Indiana Jones going around kicking Nazi but at every turn. OK so for a little while it looked like they had the upper hand but in the end G-d gave it to them good. Just like they deserved. If all the adventure and excitement wasn't enough the last scene was a perfect blend irony. All that for nothing. I guess in a way the U.S. Government did one thing right. They packed it away in some unassuming box in a cavernous warehouse so that no one would ever find it again. Harder to find than the Well of Souls that place. I loved this movie front to back, beginning to end and it inspired my own writing and creativity. The period and the sets still resonate in my mind. And a soundtrack that just won't quit. Don't get me started on the sheer genius of John Williams' soundtracks. These three men are singlehandedly responsible for my dreams, my fantasies and my adventurous spirit.

Perfect Entertainment,"I'll admit from the start of this review that I am bias. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is in my top 10 movies of all time. The opening is in my Top 5 movie openings of all time (only Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Cliffhanger are above it) and the score is one of my favourite soundtracks. I love it.Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the first installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise to be released, though it is the second in internal chronological order. The story is filled with the standard elements, (good v's evil, old lovers reunite etc) but the movie is anything but standard.It pits Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against a group of Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make his army invincible.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones. Karen Allen, Paul Freeman as Indy's nemesis, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott all deserve special credit.The action set pieces are superb, the humour hits the mark and the score is another valuable asset to the movie.Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment. To put it bluntly, it is quite simply one of the best movies ever made.Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the highest grossing movie of 1981, considering 'Superman 2' and the insanely popular Burt Reynolds led 'Cannonball Run' was released that year it's an even greater achievement.Perfect entertainment",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A thrilling adventure,"Raiders of the Lost Ark was the start of one of the most iconic movie franchises in film history. Steven Spielberg created what is considered one of the best adventure movies of all time, and years later, this classic still lives up to its immense reputation.One of the biggest highlights for me in this film was the introduction of Indiana Jones and the entire first 15 minutes. As viewers, we get to know everything about our hero and get a taste of what's to come later on. Plus, the action segments were extremely entertaining and exciting, which were superbly enriched by John Williams' stellar composition and Douglas Slocombe's slick cinematography.Of course, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was fantastic! He is literally perfectly fit for the role of the famous archaeologist. If I had to nitpick something about this film, it would be about the climax. Although solid, it did not age very well compared to the rest of the film in my opinion and, to avoid any spoilers, I will simply leave it at that.All in all, Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly a film to remember when it comes to action adventures.

do some digging,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" truly is a masterpiece. Even after watching it over and over again, you can still find something that you haven't recognized before. In addition to finding something new every time you watch it, the things you have already seen never get old. Who didn't want to have a bull-whip when they first saw the movie? Who didn't dream of exploring ancient ruins, dodging vicious traps, and fighting the ""bad guys"" when they were young. Who didn't want to become an archaeologist after seeing Professor Jones in action? Watching Indiana Jones, takes you back to the good old days (1981), when archaeology professors were still real men, when cute petite brunettes could still take any man in a drinking game, and when special effects were still handmade. I have to say it really hasn't lost its appeal; it rather grows on me every time I see it.So what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and experience the thrill. Grab your fedora hat and bull-whip, go outside, find something buried in your backyard, and escape all kinds of tricky situations. Or just watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and see a pro do it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Old-Time serial brought to excellence by Spielberg...,"RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy, is a throw-back to the old cliff-hanger serials of the 30's and 40's as we all know. It's just how well it is done that is absolutely awe-inspiring.Spielberg is a master technician, filming some of the most difficult stunt sequences ever put onto celluloid. His themes of Naziism and his obsession of WWII appear blatantly for the first time (not including 1941). There are great images of the swastika being denounced. Blood is sprayed on it from a boneheaded brawler and the ark burns it from the box it is enclosed in. Indy even escapes from the map room with a rope tied together with a Nazi flag.The small touches of humor add to the incredible sense of excitement: a mischievous monkey solutes the Nazis, Marion's drinking game, ""It's not the years, it's the mileage"" - What a perfect action/adventure film. John William's score helps a lot as well. The break-neck pace and non-stop scenes of pursuit make these 'raiders' something to remember.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The pinnacle of adventure films,"I must say that I cannot find anything to carp about with this thoroughly entertaining and rousing adventure flick which pays loving homage to the cliffhanger serial of yesteryear, while elevating the entire genre to a whole new level of sophistication.The plot sets daring archaeologist Indiana Jones (the superb, indispensable Harrison Ford) off on a rip-roaring adventure to locate the fabled Ark of the Covenant. The villains are no less than the Nazis, led by smarmy rival archaeologist Paul Freeman and slimy Peter Lorre look-a-like Gestapo agent Ronald Lacey. Assisting the hero are past and current love Marion Ravenwood (a terrific Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).The film boasts stellar special effects that are used in the service of a literate, intelligently written storyline. The dialog is believable and the relationships amongst the characters are fascinating. The film has terrific atmosphere and flawless direction from Steven Spielberg, who really hit all the right notes in showing the kind of expertise that could be brought to popcorn films. The action set pieces are all splendid and suspenseful. Ford and Allen share a terrific chemistry. In fact, so strong is the relationship between their characters that the follow-ups have suffered a bit from the absence of the Allen character - a flaw that Spielberg and company seem unwilling to correct even in the newly announced forthcoming venture. The film has terrific villains and builds to a breathtaking climax with a healthy dose of cynicism thrown in at the end.A truly superb film that is usually to be found on the lists of the greatest films of all time and at the top of the greatest adventure films ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Adventure Films!,"The Raiders of the Ark is a fantastic adventure film. This is one of the better films of the 1980's. Harrison Ford plays the mighty, whip-lashing Indiana Jones. Jones must uncover and save the mysterious ark from the Nazis. The acting in this film is top-rate. Harrison Ford is just amazing as he usually is. I also liked Karen Allen as Marion. She was just utterly great. As usual, Spielberg did a good job with his directing. The score by John Williams is catchy and memorable. The theme song is still stuck in my head. My only complaint about this film is that the film is a bit too dark. I wish that the film would lighten up a bit. Other than that, this is a fun movie. I rate this film a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Iconic as it gets,"This film is epic! The film is so entertaining and it created my favourite movie hero of all time. This movie is so iconic in so many ways. Harrison Ford was amazing in this and it is my favourite performance of his. The entertainment of this film is infinite, especially at the beginning and end were there is two of my favourite scenes of all- time. Spielberg directed this extremely well and this is his best work. Spielberg is known for his films to be iconic and a box office success. This is iconic as it gets and is in the 20 highest grossing films adjusted for inflation. If Spielberg were to be only remembered for one film (which is impossible) I'd like it to be this.The one thing that didn't blow me away was dialogue. It was bad but it didn't blow me away. It had s few memorable lines but not many. I like to quote my favourite films and I always struggle with this one. A common complaint is that Indiana plays no roll in the outcome of the film but there are instances were he has saved lives. If he was not there they would be dead. Indiana is a hero and I hate it when they say he was pointless. To summarise: Iconic and extremely entertaining. This film is a classic I can watch over and over again.

The greatest adventure movie of all times.,"Raiders of the lost Ark is, to me, where the minds and hands of Spielberg, Lucas and Kasdan peaked, and never quite succeeded to get even close to this high ever again. The movie simply hits every point, the characters are fully developed (for an adventure movie of course, it's no cinéma vérité), the plot is interesting and the visual effects are just the best you could get back then. Not to speak about the actors, Ford is just perfect as Indiana Jones (and that's why he will always be Indy for the rest of his career), Karen Allen was a strong actress and the supporting roles really work as friends or baddies. Comparisions with the two sequels are hard, this one is way too much better filmed, written and acted. The latest, useless installment is not even a challenge to me, being the lowest point of the Lucas-Spielberg franchise, and the gravestone of the great late Indy character. In the end, even if you don't like the genre this film is good entertainment for two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Probably The Best Action/Adventure Movie Ever Made.,"Indiana Jones is a college professor who the government hires to find priceless relics. After hearing that Hitler and the S.S. are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, the government hires Jones to beat the Nazis to it.Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most exciting and action packed movies ever made, along with being the best Steven Spielberg has ever done. George Lucas' imagination combines with Spielberg's direction to create a film that is truly epic and amazingly gutsy. The fact that anyone would even try to cram this many action set pieces into one movie is almost as amazing as how well they executed it. Every action scene is more complex and exciting than the one before it.Raiders is like a movie made by the child inside Spielberg; unbridled creativity and enthusiasm brought to life on screen. He combines elements of almost every genre as well as many of the movies he probably loved growing up (North by Northwest, The Maltese Falcon) into a truly glorious concoction.Yes, you have to throw logic out the window in certain scenes and the acting/writing could be better, but it doesn't matter. Raiders has basically every movie beat on the amount of sheer fun you have watching it as well as one of the greatest endings ever. Raiders of the Lost Ark is not only Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, but one of the best movies ever made and essential viewing for any film buff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Arguably the best Jones film yet....,"Indiana Jones the Raiders of the Lost Ark is arguably the best Jones film ever made. The story is set in the late 1930's and involves a archaeologist/ college professor/ adventurer undertaking many great feats and revolutionizing the world as we know it. Indian is played by Harrison Ford and is in my opinion one of his best roles, his acting is not fake or over exaggerated as some movies are which were made during this period. Also the director Steven Speilburg makes this title one not to miss. The Ford/Speilburg team is not the only reason this movie is so attracting, it contains realistic and contains character the audience can relate to, it is constantly surprising and the storyline is addictive, unlike somemovies, the story pulls you away fromreality,off your sofas and into the movie screen, (a trait all good movies should have). The special effects are top class for its day and are realistic. It incorporates a mixture of action and adventure to create a truly enthralling film. I am a passionate Jones fan and I am awaiting eagerly for its forth installment. The Jones trilogy is a set of films that all true fans of the adventure genre should own, it is a movie for the whole family and can be watched over and over again, it thrills and captivates the audience and has an explosive story line.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Cinema's Greatest Hero!,"AFI (The American Film Institute) ranked Indiana Jones the second best hero in film history after Atticus Finch. Why!? Atticus is a lawyer that loses his case! If there was a group of terrorists or evil Nazis, Atticus would last ten seconds at the most, whereas Indiana Jones could, and has, taken them. I know that Atticus is a realistic hero, but he is still a fake creation by author, Harper Lee. Indiana Jones is also a fake creation, but he is more of a hero than anybody else. To Kill A Mockingbird is a great movie, but its got nothing on Raiders.Laid back archaeology Professor Jones, is summoned to seek The Ark of the Covenant with special powers from the biblical day before the Nazis can find it. He then clads up his leather jacket, satchel, whip and cowboy hat, turning into his alter ego--Indiana Jones--an unbeatable adventurer that defies certain death.Two things set this apart from the other movies. Number one: everything is iconic. From the ball chasing him to the very end is a series of non-stop memorable moments and dialogue. Number two: the best story. Nothing against the other movies (even though the last one made no sense), but this one has the most complex storyline and subplots. Temple of Doom had the weakest (I like to say ""simplest"") story, but fantastic action and thrills. Last Crusade had a stronger story, but had slightly inferior action and thrills. Raiders does the best in keeping the action, filming, thrills and story in an even proportion. A very, very high proportion. From a story aspect, this is held in high regard. From a technical aspect, this is held in an even higher regard.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - Snakes! Why Did It Have to be Snakes?,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the many cinematic Spielberg masterpieces in the modern age of movie making. This movie is beyond expectations, beyond thrilling, and it's beyond amazing. Harrison Ford brings the performance of a lifetime as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist with a taste of adventure, thrills, and love. That's probably the whole plot of the entire series. Director Steven Spielberg brings another incredible movie to the world since ""Jaws"", and teams up with George Lucas, the mastermind behind the incredible ""Star Wars"" franchise, to bring yet another screen hero. So, this movie brought the incredible works of Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford, to bring a movie that will span from generation to generation. One of my favorite movies of all time, with everything you would expect in a movie. The incredible visual effects blew me away, and it turned to be an amazing accomplishment. The cinematography is gorgeous, the editing is crystal, the characters are priceless, the story is superb, the sound is exceptional, the action is incredible, and my two favorite moments in the film were the beginning sequence involving a giant death ball, and a death-defying pit filled with snakes. But my all-time favorite thing about this movie, is John Williams' incredible music, including the classic Raiders March.

An example of a perfect movie.,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of a perfect movie.Quite a bold statement I hear you cry, but I'll do my best to quantify it!Put very simply, this film delivers on everything it promises. The poster and artwork for the movie tell you that it is a 1940s adventure with Nazi villains and a dashing male hero who uses a whip! Not to mention the pursuit of an artifact of ""actual"" biblical proportions. There's a girl in there too so a bit of romance as well.It is a perfect realisation of character and story. Every component fits together like a well made suit, from the sweeping soundtrack that elevates your emotions and fills you with awe, to the perfect casting choices. All of the people involved in this film clearly loved both every moment making and working together on it.This film is compelling to watch and carries you from the very first opening scene right through to the end with a rewarding, fitting conclusion to the story.Quite honestly I am really struggling to think of a single criticism.Oh some might say the effects look dated in places, but it simply doesn't matter because you are enjoying the ride too much. Furthermore, It can be watched many times without losing any value. I believe that this is because every component of the film is being steered by people in their prime and at the top of their game. If you're not appreciating the music, then it's the cinematography. If you're not rooting for the very likable characters, then you're noticing the amazing sound design. Every department; stunts, makeup, wardrobe, writing... all of them, they all gave everything and achieved what they set out to create. Thus a perfect film.If for some reason you haven't seen it... then make sure you close the curtains, dim the lights, turn the volume right up... and enjoy every moment of this cinematic delight in its fullest capacity!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Classic, stands the test of time","Remember when movies were fun and lasted under two hours? You get it all with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the adroit and adept movie that introduced us to the iconic, whip-happy archaeology professor who would rather eat dirt than be stuck in a classroom teaching.We get tarantulas, traps in tombs, golden-monkey idols, snakes, a mix of religion with the occult, all while we fight Nazis with the specter of WWII looming large. The primary villain is Paul Freeman as Belloq, one of the smarmiest and sleaziest tools ever seen on film, who seems to have the upper hand only because he has more money and manpower behind his efforts.There are several unforgettable scenes, starting from the opening tomb raid, to the fist fight near the running airplane, to the very end when the Ark of the Covenant is perfunctorily boxed up for storage in a nameless, faceless warehouse (cue Raiders March). There is never a dull moment, never a wrong beat. We get well-timed wry humor to counteract the seriousness of finding the Ark, which promises to hold such power that it would make any army possessing it invincible.The melting faces look trite and corny now, and maybe they did then, too. But it's all in good fun, and if you don't want your face to melt, just close your eyes. Close your eyes and think of a time when movies dealt raw entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Delivers Everything it Promises,"Looking for a provocative romance or gripping drama? WRONG FILM! This movie is about action, excitement and fun! It set the bar for this genre when it first came out, and still to this day is a benchmark to what other action films are judged. No CGI here - just great sets and innovative stunts. No sex, cussing, or gore either - no time for it. The film is too full of thrilling scenes of adventure, humor, and cliff-hanging danger. Sure its out-done now days by a quarter century of newer technology, but the spirit of the film will live on in anyone who saw it in the theaters, and anyone how rents the DVD and puts themselves back in an early-80's film mode.

One of the top five action/adventure films ever made,"The biggest blockbuster of 1981, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" introduced the now-iconic Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford. The film is a series of globetrotting adventures as Jones and other characters seek the lost Ark of the Covenant and (gulp) dare to open it.""Raiders"" ranks with my top five films of all time. Not only is the action/adventure exhilarating from beginning to end, the story's compelling and the characters are interesting. Ford is excellent, of course, but you also get Karen Allen (Miriam), Paul Freeman (Belloq), Ronald Lacey (Major Arnold Toht), Wolf Kahler (Colonel Dietrich), John Rhys-Davies (Sallah) and several more (e.g. Denholm Elliott). Rhys-Davies and Lacey are standout examples of the excellent supporting cast.Everything about ""Raiders"" magically works and you can tell the incredible effort that was put into making it. While Steven Spielberg directed it, George Lucas & Phillip Kaufman came up with the story and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay. Needless to say, it's significantly better than the three sequels/prequels, as well as the direct-to-video/TV ones. Don't get me wrong, most of the other Indy adventures are worthwhile, but none capture the beginning-to-end magic of the original.The film was so successful that a hoard of movies clearly borrowed from it in the ensuing decades. Some quite successfully, like 1999's ""The Mummy,"" and others not-so-successfully, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Speaking of the latter film, it has a lot going for it, including the Indiana Jones appeal: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc., but it's all for naught as the plot and characters are merely a clothesline to string together continuous action and F/X sequences. It's all style and ""excitement"" without substance. ""Raiders,"" by contrast – fun as it is – includes an interesting story, character depth and even some fascinating insights. On top of this is the string of action sequences second-to-none: The jungle treasure opening, the Nepal bar brouhaha, the streets of Cairo chase, the Well of Souls in Tanis sequence, the plane episode, the truck sequence, and, of course, the thrilling and horrifying opening of the sacred Ark.The jungle scenes were shot in Kaua'i; the Cairo/desert scenes in Tunisia; the Nazi submarine base in France; the college scenes in Hertfordshire, England; the D.C. scenes in San Francisco; and other scenes in Stockton, CA, and England.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This is what excitement is all about!,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is what excitement is all about. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a great adventure tale made in the tradition of those old Saturday matinee serials. Harrison Ford put on the fedora for the first of three appearances as Indiana Jones, the archaeologist who has taken us on three great adventures. Here, Dr. Jones goes after the mystical Ark of the Covenant. The action scenes and special effects are spectacular. The film plays like a rollercoaster ride and there's plenty of on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement. Karen Allen, who plays Dr. Jones' love interest Marion, is a great heroine (easily the best of the series). The villains include a French archaelogist (Paul Freeman), who's kind of Dr. Jones' counterpart; and some really nasty Nazis. This movie is as good as it gets. Great direction by Spielberg, who collaborated with ""Star Wars"" creator (and good friend) George Lucas to create a brilliant movie series. The second movie ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" followed in 1984, and that was followed by the third movie ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" in 1989. All three movies are excellent, but ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the best.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A timeless action & adventure flick with a fantastic story,  directing and cinematography (for that time)","Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a memorable action/adventure that is still a hit, almost 25-years later than when it came to our lives. The plot is a competitive quest for the Ark of the Covenant, a real, religious artifact that Indiana Jones endeavors to find. While in competition with Nazi Germany, at that time (late 1930's), Jones goal is to find it, and place it with his friend, a keeper of the local museum. The Nazi's, under rule of Adolf Hitler have their own plans for the Ark – one's that could put the whole world at risk. Yet, with the Nazi's against him, and in pursuit, with many more resources than he has, Indiana Jones has to improvise a lot. A reluctant partnership with his former love, Marion, takes the character development to a new level, as Indy, who is used to watching his own back is forced back into a protector of another – Marion. As Indy later realizes, it's not just his fate that he is protecting/preserving, or even that of Marion, but in fact the whole world.Indiana Jones, the main character in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) engages the audience in both action and adventure, with tempered violence (in comparison to what's seen today). While serving as a Professor of Archaeology at a university, with many admirers, and in demand, he takes time to explore his passion in searching for truth, evidence, and ancient artifacts that he donates to museum. His journey is often perilous, as evidenced by the opening scene in this movie, and throughout. Indy (Indiana) doesn't back away from a challenge, despite the dangerous obstacles he will likely face.The theme for this movie (as personally interpreted) is to seek truth, while preserving the past and shaping the future. As Indy (Indiana) is considered a hero in this movie, relating this film to a character such as Superman, may sound extreme, but also appropriate. While both movies have a primary protagonist that is perceived as a hero, but under guise, they also have vulnerabilities which they work hard to hide from those that seek to harm them.Through a linear series of events enhanced through music, this film follows a suspenseful, surprising, and rhythmic pattern, with twists and turns that keeps people in their seats. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a timeless film that engages in both action and adventure, without all the blood and gore that are commonly found in more current films. Instead, less advanced techniques were used.Lighting and angles used in this film were used especially well, considering the limited technology of that time. The deliberate use of lighting techniques are most important and noticeable in indoor scenes, including the cave (at the beginning), the well of souls, and at the make-shift arena on a desolate island, at the end. Camera angles were also well used, putting the audience in both the position of close observer of events, and then into the action. Even with less modern techniques, one is sure to experience the effect of their usage. These and other varieties of techniques used in the film served to connect the audience to the story, as well as the characters. This reinforced the theme, both directly and indirectly.Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) came to life, based on a serial (sort of a comic book), in the 1930's and 40's. Through collaboration of E.T. – the Extraterrestrial director, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (Star Wars), along with some others, it was made into a movie. This began the adventure series, with the primary character as Indiana Jones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Harrison Ford creates a truly iconic character named Indiana Jones. Conceived by George Lucas and molded by Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly a sight to be seen. Inspired by many of the 1930's serial films like its cousin Star Wars, Raiders keeps you on the edge of your toes. The whip, the leather jacket and of course the hat have become iconic with film lore. Indiana Jones is the all American hero, the American James Bond.

John Williams, a long time collaborator with George Lucas and the composer of the first Star Wars trilogy compose the score and theme of Indiana Jones.

Maybe My Favorite Film Of All Time!,"A true modern classic. It's all been said before me -- Ford is perfect, Karen Allen (his best leading lady, hands down) is ideal, and the whole movie couldn't be changed one frame and still be as great as it is. For the nitpickers: Look for a tiny Indy hanging on to the periscope of the U-boat (U-boats couldn't entirely submerge, they had to keep at least an airpipe above water at all times for ventilation).This lovingly crafted tribute to the great Saturday afternoon serials of the 1930s-1950s is full of fun, gritty action (Indiana Jones fights dirtier than any of his opponents -- he uses *every trick in the book!*), Americana, deathtraps and cliffhangers, and real Hollywood magic. Add to that the awe-inspiring musical score (better, ahem, than STAR WARS'), the eminently quotable dialogue (""You Americans, you are always the same -- always overdressing for the wrong occasions""), and that this is Ford's best role ever, and you have a must-see movie.

Why I Love Raiders,"I think out of any film ever to be released Raiders of the Lost Ark has had the biggest impact on my life. I was born years after it was released but I have seen this film more times than years I've been alive.I love Raiders because ticks every single box. Firstly, because it has to be dealt with, Harrison Ford is one sexy man. I do not know any woman who would disagree with that statement and I do not know any man who wouldn't want to be him. Harrison Ford just has IT. The thought that Richard from Friends (Tom Selleck) could have been known as Indy is horrifying and well to be honest thank god for Magnum PI.Now, I am a sucker for a romance story in a film. I don't really like soppy sort of love films but I love a good old romance embedded in a decent story. Oh and Raiders does this beautifully! Marion Ravenwood, firstly, is the BEST Indy girl and personally the best female character from a film. This is because I want to be her I suppose. She's been heartbroken; she's ended up opening a seedy bar in Nepal and then finally gets her man. What I love about Marion is that she's a strong woman, she holds her own against Indy but you know she's a woman, she wants to be loved and Karen Allen is a fabulous and beautiful actress who makes Indy's and Marion's relationship real and well pretty lovely to be honest.OK, so Raiders has Harrison and it has the great relationship between Indy and Marion but let's not forget Raiders in an adventure film. I think all my ambitions to want to do history and all that rubbish is down to this film. OK, I know its not real life and I know the whole ark thing is rubbish but all I can ever think for weeks after it is how brilliant it would be if I could go on that adventure. But it's not only an adventure film, I've already said about the lovely romance, but you know it has so much more than just an adventure to it.Finally of course it's a Spielberg and Lucas film and really that says it all.I love Raiders, it's a shame Temple of Doom didn't live up to it, although I must say Temple of Doom does have the best opening to any film ever. Luckily, though The Last Crusade did and all in all I cannot wait for Kingdom.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Classic action movie from childhood,I had to rate this 10 out of 10. This is an iconoclastic movie from my childhood. From beginning to end this film keeps a solid pace. I remember seeing this in the theaters as a child. When movies gave you that sense of being there. We left wanting to be Indiana Jones. They don't write them like this anymore. Rather they don't film them like this anymore. This is the epic movie that began the adventure. I don't know if I like Harrison Ford more for Indiana.

A Film of Three You Will Never Tire of.,"I love this film along with many others, and I've lost count of how many times I have seen it, but I've never gotten bored of it. No matter how many times you do see Raiders, it will always seem new to you: the idea, the plot line and the thrill of it all. Upon watching the AFI George Lucas Tribute, I found out the story behind Indiana Jones: Lucas and Spielberg had combined ideas to create a fantastic hero. I think the thing I like about Indiana Jones is that he's human, he doesn't have any superpowers, he does fear things but he still manages to save the day. He's a brilliant creation, complete with whip and lucky hat. This is one of those films that has everything put in it; but is one of the few films that manages to pull it off well. This is probably one of the reasons many programmes put in less-than-subtle parodies of this movie (especially the famous 'rolling boulder' scene). Raiders is a film that I believe whoever who has not seen yet should go and see. Or at least buy a hat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"After a Quarter of a Century's Past, 'Raiders' is Still American Cinema's Best Action Film","Seeing ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" for its first release on the big screen was one of my greatest movie theater experiences as a small child.The first of the three Indiana Jones movies was one of the best action films ever made, and certainly the best of the Indiana Jones sci-fi genre.This film has everything. For villains there are knife wheeling Arabs, scheming Frenchmen, and of course Nazis. For dangers there were tarantulas, booby traps, imploding caves, runaway boulders, and poisonous snakes.The setting is 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), an archaeologist/college professor has just returned from a failed mission in the South American jungles. The head of the archeology department, has given Indy a new project. Find the sacred Ark of the Covenant, containing the original Ten Commandments carried by Moses, and beat the Nazis to it.In order to find the ark's location, Indy must first travel to Nepal to recover a crystallized medallion once owned by Abner Ravenwood. Abner's daughter, Marion, (Karen Allen) now owns the piece and will give it to him for a price. The price may be greater than the reward. Nazis are everywhere and so are Asps! Snakes! Hundreds of them are a major roadblock in securing the lost Ark of the Covenant.Truly amazing action sequences are joined together with spectacular special effects and a great soundtrack as Indy tries, desperately, to keep the Ark from falling into the hands of the Nazis. Don't forget this movie was made in 1981, the Pre- CGI era in American cinema.In one action sequence a stunt double for Harrison Ford climbs under a moving truck transporting the Ark on a major Cairo highway headed for a large vessel in the Red Sea. But it is actor Harrison Ford's job to climb into the vehicle while on his belly, and holding onto nothing but a short rope.When the Ark is finally opened late in the movie, real drama enfolds. Special effects are used as we finally see the wrath of God.Of course this movie is science fiction and pure fantasy. The Nazis are depicted as evil in a satirical cartoon like way, not pure evil like the Third Reich that devastated most of Europe in the 1930's and early 1940's. But that is what movies are supposed to be all about. ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" was Steven Spielberg's best fantasy action movie, and his best film ever until ""Schindler's List"" came along in 1993, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1998.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was filled with drama, adventure, and satirical humor.

My Favorite Movie Of All Time,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie of all time. It is a classic Steven Spielberg adventure movie. Packed with pretty much every genre, it is something for all movie lovers and almost everyone. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore. Motion pictures were invented to entertain, and this one entertains a great deal. Some of it may seem a bit campy, but that is why it is so great. It is just a plain fun and enjoyable movie. I wish, like I hinted at earlier, that a movie like this would come out nowadays. It will leave you and your sense of fun very satisfied. You'll have a great time watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My favorite movie experience ever!,"With respect to the mission of IMDb, sometimes being informed (in any way) about a movie lessens the experience. I say this because of my experience with Raiders Of The Lost Ark.This was one of the few movies I watched without having any expectations. I was 19 years old at the time. The movie had just come out, and I knew nothing about the plot beforehand ... I didn't even know others opinions about whether it was good or not. This total ignorance allows me to say this as a certainty ... when it comes to seeing a great movie, sometimes ignorance is indeed bliss! This was (by far) my favorite movie experience of all time.This is one film I don't want to ruin by talking about it ... so let me just say this: if you ever happen to encounter a young man (say 18 or 19 years old) who has never heard of Indiana Jones, do him a favor. Don't tell him anything about the movie, invite him to a nice home theater, be sure to give him a soft-drink and some popcorn before the movie starts, turn up the volume and sit back & watch ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"". I'm sure he'll long remember that great day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Should have been re-released in cinemas last year!,"Raiders Of The Lost Ark is an extraordinary action adventure film. It will probably never be bettered. The opening sequence is gripping and the introduction of Doctor Henry 'Indiana' Jones is the best since James Bond's character in Doctor No. Harrison Ford is sensational in this film, this is quite simply the best action hero he has ever played. I love his Fedora hat, leather jacket and cracking bull whip.Raiders from start to finish produces a ton of classic scenes, no one will forget the classic switch of the bag of sand for the Hovito Idol, or the Bar room brawl/gunfight in Nepal...and what about the locations and the set pieces! No CGI desert backgrounds here, just the glorious enjoyment of huge Nazi excavation sites to unearth the enchanting but mysterious power that is The Ark Of The Covenant. The fight scene between Indy and the huge German soldier underneath a rotating Nazi plane is one of the best fight sequences I've ever seen, plus the Truck chase in the desert with Indy on horseback is a joy to behold.The script is excellent. Lawerence Kasdan deserves a special mention for producing good memorable dialogue. The supporting cast are superb, Karen Allen is extremely attractive as the feisty Marion Ravenwood, even though she has a tough exterior (demonstrated by that classic punch to Indy's face) She somehow hinted in the following scene that she had been vulnerable when she was first involved with Jones and wasn't as tough. Paul Freeman is terrific as Belloq, i think that he plays him with a sinister charm and has some wonderful dialogue 'Your going to give mercenaries a bad name!' Steven Spielberg's direction is the same magic he weaved with both Jaws and Close Encounters, this was a man who wanted to make a great memorable picture during production in 1980 and he has stated himself that it is the one film that he can look back on and watch with an audience or his own children and truthfully admit to enjoying it as much as anyone else. All power and credit to Mr George Lucas as well, his ideas and scenarios at the time were about how to create special effects that lifted a scene and blew an audience away (like the Ark's power unleashed at the climax) and not about how to make an empty green screen into a CGI cartoon.Special honorary mention to the great John Williams. Sir, your film score for this movie is absolutely stunning and glorious. Indy's theme is instantly recognised whenever it plays. It is one of the most famous soundtracks for a film character in Movie history...i salute you Mr Williams, you are a genius!Raiders Of The Lost Ark is one of the greatest Action Adventure films ever made...to be honest it really is the best adventure film.

Not your average (history/archeology) teacher,"No pun intended - the first Indiana Jones movie ... and not even originally having the title character in the ... well title! Which changed of course - and the title now also is known as Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the lost ark. That being said, the movie set so many tones - set the bar high ... and watching the behind the scenes stuff makes it even more amazing, because you can see they made some stuff up on the fly ... but the fundamental stuff was there ... and not even taken from a source/book, but from the minds of the filmmakers themselves.Putting so much talent on the screen is quite mesmerizing ... even small parts being cast with people like Alfred Molina ... mind blowing I tell you. And while the second Indy movie went the route of prequel, we did get a lot of sequels and another one is upon us ... can't wait for it. Technically it is the fifth ... some may feel that the fourth one is not counting. Well that is up to you.So a tight script with room for improvisation and changes on the fly ... and great actors to carry that (out) ... seems like a jackpot .. and it gets better ... because John Williams adds another score and especially theme to his portfolio ... that everyone will recognize. Sometimes one exaggerates when saying things like that ... but the Indiana Jones theme is so well known ... it'd be a surprise if you've never heard it.The beginning of the movie alone is awesome. As a saying in Germany goes: the stone is being rolled (not literal translation, but close enough - and no pun intended). While he has his ""normal"" job to attend to ... well he does not seem too happy with that. Although, in a different reality/dimension he might be ... there are some hints that he may be quite popular with some of his students ... the female ones that is. Not saying this is a good or a bad thing - morally you have to make that judgement for you .. also the movie never follows up on that. Which is better and does not bring it in hot water ... Indy has enough to deal with as it is ... and talking of hot ... well let's just say that the ending is quite horrific ... it will burn itself in your mind ... and with this pun I say goodbye ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A perfect start to a legendary trilogy,"You've all heard the name Indina Jones and we all have hummed the theme tune at some point (I know I have). This movie (As well as the rest of the trilogy) is just unmissable. Sure, if you're looking for something that will tax your brain to the limits, like a crime drama for example, don't look here. But that does not mean to say that this film is stupid. It's an action/adventure movie with great lines, unforgettable scenes and an all-round fantastic atmosphere.The plot for this one and 'The Last Crusade' are alike as they share the same common villain in both: The Nazi's! I have to say, that Nazi's always make the best villain for any film because: - 1. They are recognised (and despised) as being an evil organisation of people that tried to conquer the world, as well as a number of other atrocities.2. They aren't un-PC. There is no fear of making the Nazi's the villain in films as no one would be offended (well, apart from the modern Nazi's, but who cares).Harrison Ford leading the role as Indiana couldn't have been far better (I don't fancy Tom Selleck strutting round with a bull whip, do you?), he's calm, rugged and naturally lets go of his calm behaviour and panics whenever a normal person would. He is only a College Proffesor remember.The film is never too dull throughout. between action scenes, there will always be a good bit of dialogue and nothing to pointless that you'll be egging the character to hurry up. It's near perfection.Unlike a lot of films I've seen today, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (as well as the rest of the Indiana Jones Trilogy, has that fantastic feeling of viewer satisfaction of suspense followed by relieve. Yes, you KNOW for a fact that Indy will ""whip"" (sory about the bad pun) his way out of any obstacle placed before him, but you're never too sure. it seems that whoever planned out the action scenes (Whether is was Spielberg, Lucas or some other guy), knew exactly how to make us slide further and further to the edge of our seats just because we were almost certain that our be-hatted hero was going to fall to a sticky demise. But no. ALWAYS, and I repeat, ALWAYS, AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE, The theme will blare up, Indy will turn around and completely turn things to his advantage. This has never grown old on me and even when i watch it again I still feel that he won't make it.Anyway, I'd better stop otherwise I'd be going on for a few pages.

Do you think Illinois Nazis wanted the Ark as well?,"As a child of the 80s, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the epitome of movie making. Two big directors, a huge star, Nazis, the unknown, a spooky finale, action, adventure, humor, far away lands – this movie, this one singular film had it all. This film had something for everyone; man, woman, and child could all sit around and be amazed by Indy's adventure. Everything about this film is addicting. Watching it then, and even today – Indiana Jones' theme music stuck with me for hours afterwards. This film is more than just a casual view; it is a part of history in the making. The cult icon that Spielberg and Lucas created breathed a celebrity life into the world of archaeology, but also has handed the world a character that felt real and exciting. With that said, re-watching this staple of my youth today, in 2009, it became a far different cinematic experience. ""Raiders"" is an important film, it is still an amazing film to watch, it is still two hours of entertaining adventure, but does the DVD do it justice? Is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" only really meant to be enjoyed on VHS? These questions arise from crisper images shouting through my player at night, the lack of detail around the edges (don't be ashamed of the VHS fuzz), and how bright this dusty hero should have looked. I am not judging quality here, but Indy will always remain a VHS protagonist in my book.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as a stand-alone film works better than anything that could be released today. It takes the adventurous introduction of a man in search of a gold statue and juxtaposes it with an image of Indy as a teacher. It is a film that even after numerous viewings, the deadpan humor of Harrison Ford remains funny and repeatable in a group of friends. This, unlike ""Crystal Skull"" relies on Indiana's skills, it takes us to places that actually could exist, and builds a mythology that is real. We were not overwhelmed with CGI or great effects, these were the days of stuntmen and real explosions – this was made during a time where realism took precedence over computer. Yet, isn't that the mantra of Indiana? Isn't the idea of this film to inspire youthful minds to become archaeologists, to make them aware that modern technology could take a backseat to a fedora and/or whip any day? There is this classic nature of both this character, but of the way Ford portrays him. Ford gives us this hero that is literally an everyman – he bleeds, he has fears, he punches when he should run – these are all great relatable features that still makes Ford's Indiana Jones so iconic. The costume works, but it is the level of strength that Ford brings that makes me replay my VHS over and over.What else makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" perfect? The Nazi element, the idea that Hitler was searching for more than just total world domination was brilliant. Lucas and Spielberg took a trusted villain, a villain from the classic radio era, and made him search all over the world for this Ark of the Covenant. The spiritual element within this film is not overbearing, mostly explained, and it again gives us a task that may not be too out of reach for the average viewer. Watching it today, older, wiser, and somewhat more film skilled, I loved learning that Karen Allen could drink like it was her job. I never did catch the romantic twist forming between Belloq and Allen, but it seemed more relevant as I am older. Our man Dietrich was both hysterical and utterly evil; one of my favorite scenes was when he tricks us into hanging his coat. Brilliant. Proving again that ""Raiders"" takes you on this journey, a journey that could have been stale and caper-ish, and delivers a story that seems bold, refreshing, and new each time that you watch it – no matter what age you are.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a timeless film. I cannot wait to watch it again – every element from the design, to the characters, to the finale is perfect. Despite the passion that I have for the VHS version, the DVD does thankfully make this film more accessible to the modern masses. This was created during the time where Ford was making skilled movies, a trait that he seems to have forgotten today. Do not watch this series backward, do not begin with ""Crystal Skull"" and expect ""Raiders"" to be the same. It is a retro film, a film about using skills sans computers. It is near perfection from everyone filming, writing, and acting within it. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for creativity, excitement, and/or a time where cinema was fun.I miss these days.Grade: ***** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A series of magnificent ""hopeless"" situations.  Nazis.  A mystical object from the Bible.  Pacing that is exquisite.  One narrow scrape after another. Broken ribs.  Carrying on with broken ribs.

"Some good fun, but highly overrated.","This movie is like the 1930s Saturday matinee serials, and it has some fun moments, but it isn't a brilliant masterpiece, or anything close. It falls into the same category as George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" trilogy: fun, but not really intelligent. It's bizarre how people can confuse the two. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has a very intriguing, though slight, plot and it is fun to see Indiana Jones search for the Ark of the Covenant while fending off the bad guys in some great action scenes. But the slight plot starts to wear very thin after the ark is discovered, and the movie dives into a constant battle of Indiana getting possession of the ark and Belloq taking it away, and it becomes very tedious. After the ark is discovered, the movie becomes plagued with filler scenes, beginning with the scene in which Indiana and Marion try to steal the plane, and continuing with the truck chase and the boat ride until the gruesome end, which is very lazily written. Sure, there are some fun moments, and those less interested in plot development will get a kick out of it, but a masterpiece, or even a very good movie, it isn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

But it is just such a satisfying movie to watch, that I could watch it dozens of times and still never be bored.Unlike a lot of male 'leads' today, Indiana Jones is a real man, not some pouty, insecure guy that is really needy and requires a superhuman girl to help him out of situations; in fact his counterpart Marion is a smart woman who can be tough if the situation is needed, and indeed does help him without it looking ridiculous or unrealistic.Overall, if you have seen this movie already you probably agree that it is a good, if not great action movie.

It delivers the goods in more than one way...""","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is just the kind of movie that serves its purpose: it is entertaining, thoroughly enjoyable with great actors; and most of all, just plain fun.Harrison Ford plays Dr. ""Indiana"" Jones, a knowledgeable professor by day, famed archeologist by night (sorta). After he loses the glasses and suit at night (or when his darker, more adventurous side is needed), and equips himself with a whip and a hat, he becomes the most adventurous history-powered character in.well.history.This time around (well, the first time for the audience), Jones is hired by the American government to find a mysterious, Biblical artifact named ""The Ark of the Covenant,"" which, anyone who has gone to Bible school should know, is a very powerful weapon that only priests could touch without dying as history tells. Well, guess what? Some Nazis are hoping to find it before Jones and they want to - wait for it - use it as a weapon.  This cannot happen. So Indy gears up and ships out to get them thar' Nazis (I love talking in hick language during plot summaries!) along with an old flare, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who has in her possession a very important medallion.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" achieves its goal of being not only a great popcorn flick, but also a great flick in all sense of the word. It delivers the goods in more than one way.Harrison Ford is completely believable as Indy, a guy who is not as gung-ho as the stereotypical heroes of the average adventure-dramas. We feel that he is at many times stressed with his missions but carries them out with a smug smirk anyway, just because he is Indy, and that's what he does.Karen Allen provides just enough umph and sassiness to the film to keep the plot and character progression moving, as well as to add a few gray hairs to Indy's head.Steven Spielberg directs this film excellently with help from writer/co-producer George ""Star Wars"" Lucas and Philip ""The Right Stuff"" Kaufman. The cinematography is beautiful, and the camerawork brings out the emotions in the characters in both visual and symbolic ways.Essentially, ""Raiders..."" has established itself as a film franchise in of itself over the years, spawning two (no, wait, an upcoming three) sequels since its release in 1981. When it came out it was a huge hit, and now it is marked in history books, as well as having been branded in the culture of not only America, but also the whole world.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is without a doubt one of the best adventure movies ever, that set the path for many films we see today.

Another genius of Lucas' mind,"I'm seeing this movie for the first time (with a crazy delay after 41 years) to make up for childhood gaps.

A thrilling adventure movie,"A Thrilling Adventure: Raiders of the Lost ArkRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981), directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas, is a timeless masterpiece that redefined the adventure genre. With its pulse-pounding action, witty dialogue, and charismatic hero, the film delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience that has captivated audiences for over four decades.At the heart of the story is Indiana Jones, a rugged, whip-wielding archaeologist portrayed by Harrison Ford. Ford's performance is iconic, bringing to life a character who is equal parts brilliant scholar, daring adventurer, and reluctant hero. Indiana's blend of intelligence, bravery, and vulnerability makes him relatable and endlessly engaging, setting the gold standard for action heroes.The plot follows Indiana's quest to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred relic said to hold immense power. Pitted against Nazi adversaries and treacherous terrain, Indiana faces danger at every turn. From the thrilling opening sequence in a booby-trapped jungle temple to the climactic showdown at the Ark's excavation site, the film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Each set piece is a masterclass in tension, pacing, and choreography, showcasing Spielberg's unparalleled skill as a filmmaker.One of the most memorable aspects of Raiders of the Lost Ark is its perfect balance of action and humor. The film's high-stakes adventure is punctuated by moments of levity, often delivered through Indiana's quick wit or the unexpected mishaps he encounters. Whether it's his nonchalant shooting of a sword-wielding opponent or his disdain for snakes, Indiana's reactions provide a humorous counterpoint to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The Ultimate Action Film, Spielberg's Best","When Jaws was released in 1975, it became a global phenomenon, gaining universal praise, (Hey look, praise for a movie released by Universal) grossing over $400,000,000, keeping many out of the water, and made a star out of its director, Steven Spielberg. His 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released to similar success, and is now one of the classic of the science-fiction genre. His next film, however, 1941, was a colossal bomb, showing that as good as he was, he wasn't invincible. So for his next project, he turned to his friend George Lucas (Director of Star Wars), and told him of his plans to direct a James Bond movie. Lucas then presented a similar character he had come up with, Indiana Smith, a homage to adventure serials from the forties and fifties. The two then collaborated on the project, with Spielberg directing and Lucas producing, and created what is now known as Raiders of the Lost Ark. (With the protagonist changed from Smith to Jones)For the two people on the planet who have not seen this movie, here is the basic premise: In 1936, Indiana Jones is an archaeologist who is recruited to find and retrieve the lost Ark of the Covenant, which is essentially ""a radio to God"", which could make whoever carries it invincible. The problem is that Hitler is also interested, and evil Nazis are trying to recover it for their army. What ensues is the greatest adventure film ever made. (I'm not exaggerating at all)The movie has so many strong points I don't know where to start, but I'll begin with the obvious: Harrison Ford is the best possible pick for Indiana Jones imaginable. He doesn't just play Indy, he IS Indy. He is both awesome and yet barely able to make it through the movie's many fight scenes. (Well, except the one fight that is played for laughs) You like him so much that you want to see him win. It's because of how he barely does this that you realize, ""This could be me in this scene!"" He brings the right amount of relatablility and awesomeness to the role. Maybe the movie could work with someone else in the role, but it wouldn't be anywhere nearly as awesome.Everyone else is good too; Karen Allen is excellent in here, (She seems a little stubborn and like a damsel in distress at times, but Willie in Temple of Doom is a hundred times worse) Paul Freeman as Belloq is a fantastic villain (He's almost like Indy; he's an archaeologist looking for the Ark but is just more evil), John Rhys-Davies is pretty entertaining to watch as Sallah, and Denholm Elliot's Marcus Brody (Possibly related to Martin in Jaws) is a good father figure in here (But don't worry, we'll get Sean Connery later).This movie just looks incredible. The set design is very engrossing, the cinematography is tremendously well shot, and the stunts and other effects are so well integrated you can't tell which is which (Just like Jurassic Park).The movie also sounds good too. The soundtrack by John Williams is amazing. He really knows how to make iconic themes almost effortlessly (No wonder he's my favorite film composer). And the sound effects are pretty good too.But finally, we get to the best parts of this movie: The script and action sequences. It is very well written, taking place in a period where the Nazis (The only villain more evil is the devil; wait, I've found a villain for Indy 5!) are going to be part of the story no matter what, and it completely embraces its simple adventurous tone by going all-out in order to make this as entertaining as possible. And boy does it deliver! We get one great action scene, another great one, some exposition that manages to not be boring, more action, more action, some more action, some humor here, a little setup here, action, action, action, humor and action (You know what scene I'm talking about), action, action, action, awesome John Williams theme here, action, a little more action, and a breathtaking climax. (Complete with a shot that takes a page from Citizen Kane's book) So yeah, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the essential action movie, and definitely Steven Spielberg's best film. If for some odd reason you haven't yet seen this, (gasp!) watch it immediately, and if you have, watch it anyway! This is a perfect 10/10, and easily in my top 10 favorite films.And if you want to know my order of preference for the Indiana Jones movies, here it is: Raiders, Last Crusade, Temple, Kingdom.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Greatest Action Movie...Ever!,"As a lecturer in a Film and Media program at a major university, I can tell you all the young students want to make the same movie, over and over and over.... They lack the fundamental creative spark that initiated the American New Cinema, of which Spielberg carried the torch as arguably its most gifted talent. Kids now see the latest trending streaming series and want to make the same thing. The only know the technical aspects of film production, but quite literally have no grasp of motivation, theory and meaning. This is indicative of the industry as a whole which seems bereft of those paradigm shifting films that cane quickly in succession in the 70s and 80s.

A timeless classic.,"I never really watched Indiana Jones as a kid. I always saw bits and pieces when it was on TV and my Grandmother or mother watched it (big fans by the way). When I watched Rugrats as a small child, they re-enacted the whole beginning nearly. I always saw people impressioning the nervous switching of two objects, one valuable one not. I knew the music, I knew the title, I had an idea of who he was. But what was the big fuss? I mean as far as I knew it was just some treasure hunter.But it wasn't until later that I started to like the idea. Then I heard they were making a fourth, and decided I needed to see them for myself. So my mom, bought every one for me. ""You'll love them!"" she said. I sat down and watched the Raiders of the Lost Ark, right after school ended, and was at the edge of my seat the whole way. I realized ""this is what all the fuss is about!"". I was hooked from then on. He wasn't just some treasure hunter, he was more dynamic than that. He seemed like the average person, who happened to be in WAY over his head, and still found a way to get out.I always told myself that the movies I want my kids to see were Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, and now Indiana Jones. I have not met a person yet, who does not like Indiana Jones, he is either very much liked, or Loved to death. And the one person who said he didn;t like Indiana Jones, suddenly realized, he had been watching an Indiana Jones movie his whole life, but it was recorded on an unlabeled tape, so he never knew what it was called. (He later said ""I NEED TO BY THE WHOLE TRILOGY!!) Even my one friend who I was sure would be one of those who didn't like the movie, jumped up and down in excitement with the mere mention of the fourth.I wish to not explain the movie, the whole excitement is being surprised by this movie. But one thing I would like to say is that I encourage anyone who grew up with this movie to sit down their kids (or grandkids) and have them watch it. If you have one of those kids who does not like older movies because of the lack of fancy computerized special effects, then simply let them know they have no idea what they are missing. I miss the days where they used real actors, with real explosions, and real danger, just more realism. I look at movies today and see great special effects, great editing, wonderful music, but barely a heart. It is movies like Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark that make me wish I was teenager when my mom was, because her times have seen more great movies then I will ever dream of. I can only pray that my kids, and my grandkids will look back at this and love it as much if not more than my mom, and I do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A great example of how action movies should be made!,"I'm sure you're aware of the immense popularity of this first installment in the Indiana Jones series, created and co-written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, two very accomplished filmmakers. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was released five years before I was born, and even though it made movie history (like so many other classics I've yet to see), it took me 23 years to finally get around to watching it. Previously, I had seen the parody of it at the beginning of ""UHF"", but it's been a few years since I first saw that, and I've finally seen the source. I was fully aware of this 1981 blockbuster's reputation before watching it, which gave me high expectations, and in the end, I certainly wasn't left puzzled by its popularity!In 1936, an archaeologist named Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr. braves through South American jungle in search of an artifact called the Golden Idol. He finds it in an ancient temple, where he narrowly avoids death on his way out! As soon as he makes it back outside, he finds himself surrounded, and is forced to give the Idol to his old foe, René Belloq. Indiana Jones then runs as the native tribe, commanded by Belloq, chase after him, and the archaeologist manages to escape in a seaplane. Back in the United States, Indiana is soon approached by U.S. Army Intelligence officers, who tell him of Nazi archaeological activity near Cairo, Egypt! Jones believes this is the location of the Ark of the Covenant, a chest carrying the Ten Commandments. This Ark is believed to be very powerful, and Indy must go and find it before it falls into the hands of the Nazis! His mission takes him to Nepal to recruit Marion Ravenwood. Together, they go to Cairo and face many deadly enemies as they attempt to make it to the Ark before the Nazis do!The first part of the film, taking place in South America, is delightfully haunting and suspenseful, especially while our hero is in the temple (this is the part that was parodied in ""UHF""). That is the first of many great action sequences in the movie! It is followed by more, in Nepal and then in Egypt, as Indiana Jones fights his enemies on his great adventure! In addition to the action and adventure, there's some humour, in such scenes as Indy finding a snake on the seaplane while leaving South America. Harrison Ford is charismatic in the starring role, playing a tough, cool guy, and the acting and dialogue in general are impressive. There's really not much to complain about with this film, except maybe that it's a little overlong. However, this doesn't start to show until the last half hour or so, and there are more film highlights towards the end. I'm sure it still would have been hard for me to stop watching by this point.With classic movies like this, there's probably not really anything I could say that hasn't already been said before. Nonetheless, I've given my opinion on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the first and most popular Indiana Jones flick, and it seems to basically go along with the film's general reception in the past 28 years. As so many others have probably pointed out, don't expect a lot of depth in this classic George Lucas/Steven Spielberg collaboration, but I guess it doesn't have to have that in order to be tremendously entertaining. It was a great accomplishment without a lot to dislike, and its popularity could continue for generations to come! As with any film, no matter how widely praised, this one obviously can't appeal to all viewers and is considered by some to be vastly overrated, but if you really like action and suspense, I highly doubt you will be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Fantastically fine fun!,"I remember seeing a preview for this in the theatre. And when the big ball rolled down, two middle-aged men began laughing. But at it, not with it. Bet they are not laughing now, considering how famous it's become. I like this movie. In fact, I'm watching it as I type. I certainly think that it is the best out of the four. It has a rawness about it, and a lovely lack of CGI of course, it being 1981. In reading the, 'reviews', I noticed a lot of comments about CGI. But here's the thing. That department is so well established in film studios now, that it would almost be disrespectful not to include them in the 'family of film-makers'. This is on the same principle as writing in scenes that involve snow and rain. It passes the money around and keeps people employed. That's why many films have CGI. I think they have their place, but come on guys. Put creativity first, not finance. The trouble is, it's all getting cheaper to do and solves big production problems. Back to the film. Yes, never a dull moment, plenty of humour, great music and high adventure. It's a film, guys. Get over yourselves, you critics. There are no black holes here. Dr Jones obeys the rules of the universe. No deus ex machina here! Anybody notice how perfect the scene in Nepal was? So well planned and choreographed. As was the plane blowing up sequence.

The epitome of action/adventure and the birth of one of film's greatest heroes,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is simply the classic adventure film. You have your charming, smart, brave, witty and unforgiving hero in Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. There's history, mystery, traps, explosions, fighting, damsels in distress and...snakes. ""Raiders"" has it all and it shows the collaborative genius of two of the greatest modern day cinematic storytellers: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.The film begins on an artifact hunt in South America in 1936 as we follow Indiana into a hidden temple with a treasure hidden inside. Normally, this scene in a film would just detract from getting toward the actual plot, but this scene not only introduces us to our hero and his fearless ways, it also happens to be incredibly memorable in how clever the actions is and the traps are. You watch it and you feel like you've seen it a million times before, but that's because you have (since 1981). ""Raiders"" has influenced Hollywood that much. Granted it does borrow on previous concepts, but that's always what making a hit entails.Eventually we see Professor Jones and learn about the Nazi's pursuit of the Ark of the Covenant, the ark that held the Ten Commandments and disappeared thousands of years ago from the first Hebrew temple. Jones gets paid to stop them. After a pit stop in Nepal to pick up an essential artifact for uncovering the Ark, he ends up picking up an old flame (Karen Allen) who immediately becomes the stereotypical leading lady. When they arrive in Cairo, the search begins, which action and mayhem along the way.Ford simply makes these movies. Why else would Indiana Jones have been attached to the beginning of the names of the following films? He simply is one of the best one-liner deliverers in Hollywood history. Jones is a complicated character and Ford fuels that while also making him the cunning hero everyone wants to see.While the ending of the film is okay, it's all the cool action along the way that makes it a 1 hr. and 55 minute thrill ride that you can't help but love. It was simply was the Daniel Boone of adventure films and in how much it has inspired other adventure films, it has accumulated its own timeless value and gotten better because of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Harrison Ford in another adventure hit,"Ah, the Raiders of the Lost Ark. What a film. The first of the Indiana Jones trilogy, and in my mind the weakest.

Best of the Best,I'm a big fan of Lucas' and Spielberg's works and this is without a doubt their best work to date. From the banter between Indy & Marrion to the action sequences to the whole history behind the Ark make this a truly incredible film.The chase scene that starts when Indy steals the horse then chases down the Nazi envoy and eventually steals back the Ark is in my opinion THE BEST ACTION SEQUENCE EVER!!! (And I've seen quite a few action movies)This is a film that I can watch time and time again and never get tired of. From the acting to the action to the special effects I really can't find a flaw with this movie. On a scale of 10 I'd give it 11.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
'Do you call this archaeology??',"This movie is what we all waited for - an update on adventure-movies like 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', 'The Crimson Pirate' and so on.We have a great hero, played flawlessly by mr. Ford, the utter villains (obviously the nazis) and the quest for the most holy object - the Ark of the Covenant. Who can ask for more??When I started reading SF, Fantasy and adventure-books a lot of years ago, I didn't think that movies could create the same pictures in my mind as the books, but in this instance I was clearly wrong. Though movie-technology has moved ahead drastically, there are not so many heavy special-effects here (apart from the Island-scene), It's all in the script! Wonderful.He's not too convincing as an archaeologist, though (I am one).10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A one-timer,"I'll qualify my old old review (below) with a few new comments. This is probably 20 minutes too long, the magic starts to wane before the finale. Freeman was Ford's best enemy in the Indiana series, he really adds to the fun.Spielberg's homage to mid-century serial actioners comes off flawlessly, marred only by the characteristic excessive Spielberg gore. Ford is a whip-toting archaeology professor not afraid to leave the classroom in search of artifacts. The Feds talk him into going for the Ark of the Covenant just when the Nazis are headed in the same direction. When the twain meet Ford is short on firepower but long on chutzpah and guile. A spunky Allen comes along for the ride as a once and possibly future romantic interest. Loads of action, top-notch production values, a fair share of comic relief, and very good supporting cast including Freeman as unscrupulous rival and Rhys-Davies as helpful Arab. At the time this seemed like the first of a new breed of movie, looking back this one stands alone as the only one that really worked. Followed by the unwatchable Temple of Doom and the cult classic Lost Crusade (a cult I haven't joined).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Sublime, Exuberant, Old Fashioned Entertainment!","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK has been one of my personal favorites for as long as I can remember.  I have probably seen it over 100 times, and it never seems to get old.  This wonderfully comical, old fashioned adventure film is still (20 years later) one of the most exciting, adrenalizing, thrill rides ever crafted for the screen.  Easily watchable any time any day, I frequently return to it if I am in need of a surefire smile.  For some reason I have always found myself fonder of The Indiana Jones trilogy than I have Star Wars.  Both films feature eye popping stunts and special effects, entertaining sympathetic characters and old fashioned acts of courage.  But the Indy trilogy has always hit a nerve with me. Directed by the grand master entertainer Steven Spielberg, RAIDERS manages to take every man's most potent childhood fantasies and put them magically on the screen.  The opening with the giant boulder, the room full of snakes, the remarkable chase sequence on the truck.  If I had to make a list of films that most entertain me every time I see them, Raiders would be at the top.  Phenomenal filmmaking that introduced to the world the now legendary character of Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford is the perfect everyman, and he leaves an indelible impression in the role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
the best film made in the history of motion pictures!,"2001 marks this legendary, innovative adventure yarn's 20th birthday, and since it is also my #1 favorite movie of all time, I decided it was time for me to write a review of it. This is Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford at their absolute best. Practically every action set piece in this film has gone down in movie history, just like the rousing, incredible score by the great John Williams (JAWS, STAR WARS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND... he's done 'em all!). By the way, I'm not getting paid to write this review, since no one really needs another. I'm writing it simply to express my immense affection and love for it.This is the true, great roller coaster ride that STAR WARS simply wasn't for me at the time. Harrison Ford, already a star after playing Han Solo, fares considerably better in this role. In fact, this could be the best-cast part that any actor has ever been in, in any movie. If you could say 'born-to-play-this role' about just one role, it would be Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Thank God for Magnum P.I., otherwise Tom Selleck would have taken the role in all the movies (honestly, I think he would've been okay, but it would now be unthinkable to picture anyone but Ford as Indy). The story of the film doesn't have a lot of developments or twists, it's just a roller coaster ride of a movie that never lets up. It would be hard to say that the first, introductory sequence is the best, since there's so much more that the movie offers, but I think it's the best-known to casual moviegoers. It's the one where we first meet one of the all-time greatest screen heroes that is, of course, Indiana Jones. The year is 1936 and we're somewhere in a South American forest. Indy is looking for a gold statue and although he will find it he will get very near to being killed in the process... only to see it being taken away by his arch-enemy called Rene Belloq, played blandly by Paul Freeman. This is the famous sequence where he escapes from a giant boulder, where he finds a miriad of tarantulas on his back, and where picks up the gold statue from the standard carefully but causes the cavern to collapse. After this sensational opening sequence the film slows down a while to show us that Jones also works as professor in college. He is contacted by his superiors and is sent on a mission to find the Ark of the Covenant, an important artifact where Mozes wrote the ten commandments, before the Nazis do (how someone can work as a teacher and an adventurer is beyond belief, of course, but so are many aspects of this movie). He will travel to Cairo in Egypt, and that's where the majority of the movie takes place. On his way there, he goes to Nepal, where he needs to find another artifact that will help in his mission. It is owned by Marion (Karen Allen), an old girlfriend of his, and she initially refuses to hand it over. Soon later a group of Nazis, led by the very creepy Toht played by Ronald Lacey, break into her bar for that same necklace that Indy came for. Eventually the Nazis will cause a fire, fight with Indy and Marion (she's not your typical damsel in distress, she often helps Indy out and takes care of herself), and die under the fire, although Toht turns up again later in the movie. Once in Egypt, Indy and Marion will be thrown into one big action set piece after another. They will be pursued by swordsmen in the marketplace, thrown together in the snake pit where the Ark lies, destroy some Nazi airplanes with undescribable explosions, be engaged in a massive truck chase sequence, tied together with their eyes closed as God exacts his wrath on the Nazis at the film's effects-laden, spectacular climax.This is truly one of those films that you enjoy so much that you don't even dare to think about something like plot inconsistencies. This wasn't an especially ambitious movie, it only wanted to thrill you, but it was so well made that it became a true movie classic. Part of what made it special was that it was a true labor of love, a happy collaboration between buddies Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who co-wrote the story and executive produced. The fun they had really shines through: every set-piece is magnificently filmed and thought-up, with a real sense of fun, excitement, and awe that one just doesn't find anymore in contemporary action films. And who could forget that magical scene where we expect Indiana to start fighting a swordsman showing off his skills and he just shoots him? Another truly magical touch is the unforgettable music score. Who hasn't heard of the legendary 'Raiders March' theme? But that's just the half of the magic that Williams produces here. There is a truly awe-ispiring theme going on in the scene where Indy is underground in Egypt in the room that with the sunlights shows him the way to where the Ark is. It's an extremely effective theme that's also heard in the stunning climax.And of course there is Harrison Ford, who is so confident and simply perfect in his role he should've gotten an Oscar. Unlike many other actors playing heroes, he doesn't hit a single wrong note in his performance. He could never be replaced in that role, while Sean Connery as James Bond, for example, could. It is also clear to me now that a big part of the film's success has to be credited to Ford. And Spielberg was at the absolute top of his form by the time of this film (consider he was nominated for Best Director for this film and the next year for E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL), likewise with Lucas' creativity. John Williams has been Oscarnominated for practically every score he wrote since JAWS. After doing some brilliant work the year before with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, he went on to write his best music ever for this film. All the best talents in Hollywood at the time collaborated in 1981 to make what I think could be considered the best film of all time. No other film in history has achieved the excitement, sense of wonder, and sheer brilliance of this one. It is the ultimate fun time at the movies, and you have missed out on a part of life if you haven't seen it. [PG]",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
extremely entertaining,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is universally considered to be an extremely entertaining action/adventure movie, so I won't waste your time reviewing the film itself. If you've already seen it, you know it's awesome; if you haven't... well, to quote Indiana Jones himself: ""Trust me."" It actually does live up to the hype. What's truly important for those thinking about purchasing this ""special edition,"" however, is a discussion of the bonus material.The extras on this disc definitely do NOT warrant purchasing this edition if you already own the previously-released Indy Trilogy DVD set. The extras can basically be summed up in a word: ""meh."" Each of the handful of featurettes is around 10 minutes or less, and there are no surprises. Some brief ""making-of"" clips from the filming of ""Raiders"" are semi-interesting, but are all very short. Another featurette is just a bunch of actors from the series making bland comments about how great Indiana Jones is, set to overly-familiar clips from the various movies (Watch Indy run from the giant ball! Now watch him shoot the swordsman!). The endless repetition of clips from the movie is one of the tiresome aspects of DVD bonus material, and serves mainly to make you so sick of the film that you don't want to see it again for awhile! The best featurette is the one about how they did the ""melting face,"" but even this is short and, really, no great shakes. Next is the apparently mandatory ""for interest to fanatics only"" stuff like storyboards and a gallery of production stills. Finally, there's a brief commercial for the Lego Indiana Jones video game, which actually (and tellingly) is one of the more entertaining of the extras.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The beginning of the best adventure ever!!!,"Get ready for the greatest adventure to ever hit my TV. Unfortunately I wasn't around back then to see it in cinemas but I bet it was awesome. I had never seen an Indiana Jones film but I liked the look of the newest Indiana Jones "" The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". So I borrowed the first three. I am glad I did. I recommend you do the same!! I thought it would be a boring. But it isn't. There isn't a minute that goes by when there isn't something exciting going on. This is adventure at its best.Now as a teenage girl living in today's movies with the amazing special effects and where they do anything. Some would think how could someone like her like a movie that was made in the 80's and that has such dated special effects. Well I loved the special effects. Sure they were terrible by today's standards but they made me laugh and I wouldn't have them any other way. This is what classic's are made of ladies and gentlemen.My favorite Spielberg movie. It rises above all of his movies. It beats War of the worlds no question and bites Jaws head off. It even rises above Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's list. It is up there with Jurassic Park and The Lost world and ET.The acting is just so easy. It didn't even seem like the actors were trying. It just worked so well. Harrison Ford was just so good. He owns the role of Indiana Jones like Bruce Willis owns the role of John McClane. Karen Allen who played Marion Ravenwood was great also.I give the highest possible recommendation I can.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bumpa dumpaaaaaa dum de daaaaaah....,"So.. 1981...I remember seeing this when it first came out I was 13. EVERYBODY was talking about it, Time magazine did a piece on it (and provided some ugly spoilers) and I saw it with my Mom and Dad, we had to sit in separate seats, because the Palace Theater in Calgary was packed! Everyone enjoyed the heck out of it.. and I saw it multiple times after-wards. I know we were the first ones to rent the video (a beta!) when it first came out..Flash forward 25 (!!) years, and I hadn't seen this for a good 10-12 years. This movie is just as enjoyable as I remember it.

"it's just sheer, nonstop high-quality if implausible entertainment from one of the best directors that we have today","There are very few moments in Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" that is plausible or that could be taken for credible if you wanted to give the illusion that this may happen in real life. But there is hardly a single moment in this movie that is not adrenaline-stimulating in its excitement. Spielberg willingly throws logic out the window in favor of creating something that is just old-fashioned, nonstop nostalgic entertaining fun and he does it very well and with that pure craftsmanship that has made him one of the really good directors of contemporary times. It is the start of the Indiana Jones series and hailed as the best of the bunch. It's certainly one of the most stimulating movies ever made.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stars Harrison Ford, just recently having shot to fame as Han Solo in the Star Wars movies, as an adventurer in World War II who stumbles upon the secret that the Nazis have discovered a city in which the famous Ark of the Covenant may be located. Since the Ark is described as being a source of indescribable power, Jones is hired to retrieve it before Hitler does. Along the way, he meets up with an old flame wonderfully played by Karen Allen and an Arabic friend (John Rhys-Davies) who together work to try and uncover the Ark, battling everything from Nazis to venomous snakes to booby traps along the way.It's not the credibility of the movie, but the energy and stimulation that it uses with such great craftsmanship and enthusiasm that makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" one of the most thoroughly enjoyable movies ever made. On top of that, it is equipped with a very solid screenplay of wise dialogue and interesting characters. Harrison Ford is excellent as Indiana Jones, obviously modeled after Frank Buck and other real-life adventurers and the supporting performances by Rhys-Davies, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, and the others are fabulous. Who can forget Ronald Lacey walking into Karen Allen's pub hissing in his Peter Lorre-like voice ""Good evening, Fraulein."" And who can forget iconic scenes such as Harrison Ford running through a cave with a giant boulder hot on his heels? ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is nonstop fun and that's why it has become a classic. Is it what I would call motion picture art? No. But is it a great movie? You bet it is. It is proof for all that credibility CAN be thrown out the window and still have a movie with a lot to show for itself. But it takes a certain genius that its imitators do not seem to show. And on top that, it takes a great director. And, in my opinion at least, Steven Spielberg most certainly qualifies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best adventure movie of all time. One of my favorite movies of all time.,"My Take: Definitely the very best adventure the movie business has to offer.The INDIANA JONES series may just be one of the best franchises in the history of cinema, and it seems pretty hard even to make a sequel that won't fall short of the predecessor. The INDIANA JONES series has everything that I like about the movies. Action, adventure, thrills, romance, and simply fun. And the first film, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, is the best place to start. The great thing about RAIDERS is that it isn't content with one great scene. It's ready and willing to throw in as much beginnings and endings as far as it can. The film moves from one locale after another, giving the characters much more to do. To a lesser film that tries hard, it's overstaying ones welcome. To a great film with a great screenplay (written by Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan), its terrific entertainment.The film opens with our dashing hero, the ever-daring Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford at best), going on a trek through the rugged and muddy South American rain forest, off to find a priceless idol hidden inside temple ruins, surrounded by a bevy of booby traps. After surviving the ordeal and getting his loot, Indy's little artifact falls in the hands of his fortune-hungry foe Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman), ending with Indy escaping a chase with Belloq's native allies through a plane, where Indy comes across his worst enemy: the pilot's pet python. ""I hat snakes!"" bellows Indy, and who knew such an action hero would admit his fear. Makes me want to admit my complete despise of cockroaches.But this is just the first act, what follows include Indy's confrontation with Sherpas in the Alps, a trek that turns to a chase though Egyptian desert, but not without getting Indy trapped in a pit of snakes. The finale is always the time where the baddies get their just desserts, but that's just part of the charms of these kind of movies. It brings back the pure ""cheer for the heroes"" entertainment. And since this movie is filled with very interesting and memorable characters, the experience is more relevant. The fun of Saturday-matinées are wonderfully relieved thanks to such expert handling by director Steven Spielberg and the breathtaking special effects work by George Lucas' ILM which still holds up pretty well.There's no further a do I can give about how great this film is. For all I know, you've seen it more times than I have (and I've seen it numerous times) and liked it as much as I did, if not more. Its worth buying the DVD set which includes the two films in the series, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, both still stand out as pure classic cinema. Comparisons (especially with the 2nd one) are overrated. One film in the series is just as good as the other. RAIDERS is the most original of the three, but the other sequels are less sequels, and sprout out much original ideas on their own.There's nothing really more I can say about this great films. My endless praises would just be the same thing that the last guy said about this movie. We know it's such a classic as other classics considered as the ""Great Movie-going Experience."" Like Lucas' other work on pure ""fun at the movies"" fantasy STAR WARS, RAIDERS has earned its place in classic cinema.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Designed For The Big Screen,"OK, so I admit I may be a little late to the party with this - maybe some of you have seen it already...There's only one thing wrong with watching ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and that's knowing you'll never have the chance to see it for the first time again. Bruno Wang is too young to have seen ""Raiders"" when it was originally released, but when I did see it as a kid in Taiwan, it was such an amazing experience that I was totally blown away by it, even though it was just on TV. This is not the film you want to see on a 27"" screen - but that was my only option for a long time.Happily now, 31 years after the fact, ""Raiders"" is getting a limited and highly successful run in theatres in a remastered edition in glorious 2D, and Bruno Wang finally had the chance to see it on a big screen, as it deserves to be seen. I'm not sure there are too many folks out there who don't know this film intimately - even among kids, it seems to be regarded as a classic - but it's worth repeating what a truly great movie it is. A collaboration of three huge names - Lucas, Spielberg, Kasdan - ""Raiders"" was conceived as a tribute to a style of film that George Lucas loved as a child, and wasn't seeing from anyone else. While Spielberg directed (as with all the Indy films) and Kasdan wrote the screenplay, anything ""Indiana Jones"" will always be first and foremost a Lucas baby, with all the positives and negatives that implies.RaidersIt's interesting that as with the ""Star Wars"" films, the very best one was written by Lawrence Kasdan - here, the first, and of course with ""Star Wars"" the second, ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I think we can say pretty conclusively now that George Lucas, while he may be terrific at coming up with big story concepts, isn't especially gifted at the details - petty stuff like dialogue and character development. Spielberg is always going to deliver slick, good-looking action films - that's a constant - and what we see in ""Raiders"" is a kind of perfect storm where the talents of all three men are on full display. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" represents a high point which the series would never match in the succeeding three films.In terms of the new print being shown in theatres, it looks great - but the movie looked pretty damn good even in 1981, so that shouldn't be a huge surprise. There's nothing too flashy - no extended new footage, or 3D, or such - and you can see the age showing at times. But it really doesn't matter much, because ""Raiders"" also represents an era before CGI changed the way chase scenes and big set pieces were filmed - it's a movie of stuntmen and real cameras, and real actors doing amazing things. And in that sense, three decades old or not, ""Raiders"" has a degree of realism that big action films today simply can't match.A couple of final thoughts. First, it shouldn't be forgotten that ""Raiders"" is a great film and not just a great-looking film because of the script and the characters. It's damn funny, and there are indelible performances across the board, obviously starting with Harrison Ford and Karen Allen, but also the amazing John Rhys-Davies (what a career he's had), Paul Freeman, Denholm Elliot and even a very young Alfred Molina in the opening set piece. Also, it's truly remarkable to think that ""Raiders"" is only 110 minutes long. In an era of bloated three-hour ""blockbusters"", Bruno Wang feels a film like ""Raiders"" that doesn't waste a second is to be treasured - it's phenomenal how much action and drama is crammed into less than two hours. It's a breathless, exhilarating experience - and all the more so on the big screen, as it was intended to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
THE Ultimate Adventure Movie,"The 1980s were a dark time for cinema -- they didn't give us much to remember them by, unless you have a love of stuffy British dramas. However, the 80s DID do two things very well: adult-oriented comedies and adventure movies.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is THE ultimate adventure movie. There had never been one quite like it and I don't think there ever will be one to match it, not even its sequels. This was a case of everything working just right. Steven Spielberg is at the top of his craft when in playful mode like this; Harrison Ford, though you'd never know it from his wooden persona today, made a perfect Indiana Jones (I can't imagine anyone else playing him); Karen Allen was able to convince you that she could be a damsel in distress one minute and then take you out back and kick the crap out of you the next; and John Williams contributed one of his best and most memorable scores.

Raiders of the Lost Ark,"America entered a conservative period after the Iranian hostage crisis. Ronald Reagan became president, and Raiders of the Lost Ark became the big movie.

The Jones character is a fedora-wearing, bull whip-slinging, adventurer who fights Nazis while traveling the world in search of ancient treasures. The Ark is the chest which held the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want it because legend has it that any army which possesses the Ark will be invincible. Indy's comedic instincts save the movie.

I LOVE this movie!!,"I love this kick-butt movie. I think its the best in the series!! This is on my top 5 most favorite movie list!!!! U RULE HARRISON FORD!! Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are the best movie producers/directors/writers EVER!! I love the part in the start of the movie when Indy retrieves the golden fertility idol. I personally DO NOT think the special effects in this movie were cheesy at ALL. Lucas and Spielberg make a great team. They did pretty good for being made in 1981. Before i saw it i thought it was going to be cheesy as heck! but it wasn't.GOOD JOB! -Luke P.S. If Harrison Ford is reading this message, PLease email me! Please and Thank you.

One of my top five films,"This is possibly the greatest action/adventure movie that has ever been made. If you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, then where have you been for the last twenty years? It's got everything you go to see a film for: heroes you're rooting for through every chase and fight scene, villains you absolutely love to hate (the Nazi leader played by Ronald Lacey is particularly slimy), adrenaline-pumping edge-of-your-seat set pieces right from the word go, jokes that rarely lose their dry sense of (albeit occasionally clichéd) humour, and a quite literally heart-stopping climax. I'm studying this film as my genre and narrative coursework for Film Studies and can safely say that I never get tired of watching it no matter what mood I'm in. Plus there's something about Harrison Ford in that fedora that's undeniably attractive...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Weirdly dated, but still fun.","There is very little, I find, more distressing than going back to films you loved as a child, and finding they weren't all that great after all.  For instance, obviously THE PHANTOM MENACE was an insulting atrocity, but I watched the revered trilogy beforehand, and found it - dare I say it? - a trifle monotonous.RAIDERS isn't that bad - Spielberg is a director, whereas Lucas quite clearly isn't - but it has insuperable flaws I didn't think possible from such a master storyteller.  It sets itself up as a non-stop rollercoaster in the vein of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but, unlike that masterpiece, it has very tedious longueurs, and lacks that film's use of plot as character study. The film's racism is also more of a problem than it might have been when I was five, although Nazi caricatures will never cease to amuse.  The period detail is virtually non-existent.  And the storytelling and direction seems very jerky at times.  It certainly lacks the depth and power of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS or E.T.This doesn't stop the film being a pinnacle of entertainment, offering a multitude of pleasures.  It is a very canny film, as if Spielberg had read a book on Hollywood narrative conventions, and decided to joyously stretch them to parody.  For example, when we first hear of Indy's old teacher and the woman he left with, we expect a classic Oedipal conflict, but minutes later we find out he's dead.  The hero/villain doubling is blatantly alluded to, as if to save us the bother.  The typical Hollywood reining in of an independent, resourceful woman is textbook.The usual course of the hero, with its obstacles and goals, is royally exaggerated: we can see Spielberg, a la Hitch, sadistically piling on the opponents  and life-endangering situations with a trowel, really putting Indy through it.  Each new difficulty is more dangerous, more complex, more ludicrous than the last, and yet Spielberg never lets down on the tension, never patronises his audience, as if he knows what we like, and knows that we know that he knows it, and are clever enough to know better, but craving escape enough to want it.The film has a complexity enough if we want to look for it.  Indy's archaelogical plundering is mirrored by Spielberg's cinematic parasitism: the film is loaded with references to the aforementioned Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Leone, Huston, Welles, Hammer Horror and many others.  There is, despite the racism, an implicit critique of Indy's activities, and the outstanding closing shot, a very brave, dispiriting ending for a Hollywood film, is as much an admission of Hollywood's conventionalising of magic.The Mcguffin of the Ark is brilliantly worked out, despite its patent silliness, and unlike Roger O. Thornhill in NORTHWEST, Indy does not mature, does not realise that human companionship is preferable to childish, egocentric abandoning of responsibility in favour of idiotic ideals that are none of his business.So what are we left with?  Set-pieces to treasure, even though we know them inside out.  A lovely, spunky heroine in Karen Allen (whatever happened to her?), that will be sorely missed in the rest of the series.  Terrific visual gags and witty dialogue.  That wonderful theme tune that seems to ironise rather than lionise its hero.  An amazing Harrison Ford performance, gruff, comic, romantic, yet fundamentally insular and unyielding.  The film's superb patterning, e.g. the fire motif, or the connection between the tarantulas on Indy's back at the beginning, and the Nazis on the back of his truck near the end.  A Gilbert and Sullivan loving Arab sidekick.  Worth revisiting than: I just found it a little dated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Greatest Adventre Film Ever Made,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was one of the first films I saw as a young child, and it was then and still remains one of my favorite films of all time. Harrison Ford basically defines cool in his role as Indiana Jones. The supporting cast is also perfect at doing the jobs necessary to make the film great. There are funny moments, horrific moments, and moments of pure excitement as Indiana goes on his wild adventures. There's a sadistic villain with a fitting trademark, double-crossers, and of course Indie's brave allies. The action is immense, the effects are gorgeous, and the film ages very well. This is a stupendous film, the likes of which will never again be repeated. The plot is of course somewhat far-fetched, but it is presented in an interesting and realistic fashion, forcing us to buy into it. I'd recommend this film to kids ""from 1 to 92.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Film Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first Indiana Jones film (followed by the Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade) and it is by far the best. Yes, the other two are amazing, but the origin of Indiana Jones can not be beaten. Read the parents guide for details on gore, because there is a particularly bloody scene. The first adventure that Indiana Jones embarks on is amazing and is for all the family (if you can deal with planes.) I suggest that you buy this now, because Harrison Ford is full of gold! 10/10

An instant classic that doesn't grow old,"Nothing short of a masterpiece. But with a mind like George Lucas and the expertise of Steven Spielberg, should expect any less?Raiders of the Lost Ark is an introduction into the adventures of Indiana Jones, an archaeologist professor badass. Throughout the movie, we explore the many mystical places that make up the Jones universe. And with a villain as hated as the Nazis, can we expect any wrong? This is a turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy type film.And what an introduction. The audience is catapulted into adventure as they follow Jones' around the world. The thrill moves from one moment to the next. There are moments of tension and real comedy that feel natural. Who didn't laugh at the iconic sword-gun fight?Another thing to love about this film is the practical effects. Without the use of CGI, SFX&VFX teams did an amazing job. No other scene from this film more iconic than the infamous face-melting. Reading about how the team achieved this only grows my appreciation for this film.And don't get me started on the natural chemistry between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. Harrison Ford seamlessly switches from his scoundrel space smuggler role in Star Wars to his scoundrel pop-arch professor/adventurer with ease. Karen Allen's portrayal goes above the typical love interest stereotype and instead opts for a strong female counterbalance to Jones (with a bit of an alcohol problem). Such a strong female role is rare for movies of this time. And her smile is sweet enough to melt any fan's heart. Loved seeing them both on screen!5/5. Instant classic that aged well. Could not have been better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Classic Action,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is definitely my favorite action movie. It's entertaining all the way through. Harrison Ford is great in this movie. I think its his best movie and the best character he's ever acted. Temple of Doom wasn't as good, but the Last Crusade is. Temple of Doom started off good but of fell apart after that. This is not true in Raiders of the lost ark, it maintains a classic action quality throughout. The Last Crusade is about almost was as good as the original, so if you like Indiana 1, you should watch the Last Crusade. These two are definitely worth watching. The fourth one was alright good for the first hour or so. But the plot collapsed at the end (seriously). Most everyone who has seen this film should see what I am talking about. But you haven't seen great action until you have seen Raiders of the Lost Ark though. Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"At times, it's amazing","Sometimes I forget how great ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" really is. Maybe that's because of the hit or miss sequels. Maybe it's because of the theme park attraction and many parodies. But then I sit down to watch it and it all comes back to me. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is really good. It has quite a few moments that are terrific. It's wildly exciting. It's great looking and the music is classic. I saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in the theater (Bellerose, NY) and many times since.

Indy the First,"What's there left to say about Raiders? It's a perfect. Raiders is a movie that knows exactly what it is and just nails it from the opening scene.

The Standard For Action/Adventure,"I've probably seen ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" as many times as any other movie I've ever watched in my life. Each year or two from age 12 or so now to age 31, I've sat down and enjoyed this film. The amazing thing about it? It never seems to get old!For a basic plot summary, ""Raiders"" sees archaeology professor Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) getting a tip that the Nazis are digging at the supposed place of the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. Armed with his trusty whip, adventurer's cap, leather jacket, and journal of clues, Indy rushes to Cairo for perhaps the greatest ""find"" of his life. Along the way, he meets up with old flame Marion (Karen Allen), as well as getting himself both in and out of numerous dramatic scrapes.Almost without a doubt, ""Raiders"" set the standard to which action/adventure movies are now held. The music is eternal, the scale is large, and the action is always moving ahead despite still being able to support interesting characters/dialogue. Only helping matters is the fact that Ford is perfectly cast as Indy, creating what is at least in the conversation for most iconic film role of all-time. From the very first time you see Indy, you know that this guy is an adventurer through and through. It's tough to have such a visceral connection to a character without any background, but director Steven Spielberg makes it seem effortless.I could go on and on about why ""Raiders"" is such a great film (both technically and culturally), but I'll suffice it to say that some 36 years after its initial theatrical release it still remains not only a classic in the ""stuffy"" sense, but also a movie that new viewers of today can appreciate just as much. People 36 years from now will be saying the same things...I'm sure of it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Super tactic!,"Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the first installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise to be released, though it is the second in internal chronological order. The story is filled with the standard elements, (good v's evil, old lovers reunite etc) but the movie is anything but standard.I'll admit from the start of this review that I am bias. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is in my top 10 movies of all time. The opening is in my Top 5 movie openings of all time (only Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Cliffhanger are above it) and the score is one of my favourite soundtracks. I love it.It pits Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against a group of Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make his army invincible.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones. Karen Allen, Paul Freeman as Indy's nemesis, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott all deserve special credit.The action set pieces are superb, the humour hits the mark and the score is another valuable asset to the movie.Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment. To put it bluntly, it is quite simply one of the best movies ever made.Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the highest grossing movie of 1981, considering 'Superman 2' and the insanely popular Burt Reynolds led 'Cannonball Run' was released that year it's an even greater achievement.Perfect entertainment",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Legend of Indi!,"If Adventure exists in movies so prominently today, its because of Indiana Jones. This Adventure God was created by the genius minds of George Lucas & Philip Kaufman, who gave us a hero, who was fun & utterly lovable!'Raiders of the Lost Ark', which is the first Indi Jones Legend, is absolute, unabashed entertainment, at its finest!

If only you spoke Horvedos...,"A pitch perfect homage to the Republic Adventure Serials of the 1940's, directed with energy and assuredness of touch by Steven Spielberg who injects the B movie material with an attention to character and composition missing from the majority of comtempory blockbusters. Lawence Kasdan's script based on George Lucas's story is a masterclass in lean, affectionately crafted action cinema with any extraneous scenes torn out. Thus its effectively a series of finally crafted set pieces laced together with the odd expositionary moment where necessary, moving toward its exceptional climax, possibly one of the best of all time, with boundless enthusiasm, pace and wit. There is a line of argument, particularly amongst European Critics, that the success of Raiders...cemented a trend in American Cinema that had begun with Jaws and then Star Wars for the kind of thrill seeking feature that has lead to the degradation of so much big-budget output throughout the following 20 years. Its ironic certainly, because Raiders is such a well made and perfectly styled creation made with an obvious affection for a lost form that it effortlessly ellipses other films of its type and remains the benchmark by which this type of movie must be judged.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The beginning of a great adventure,Probably the best thing han solo has ever done. As sarcastic and uncomfortable as he's been in other movies he really put his best foot forward in this trilogy.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Hurrah!,"Here's a sordid confession - when I was twelve or so, I preferred ""Indianna Jones and the Temple of Doom"".  A few years later, when ""Last Crusade"" was released, I thought that IT was the best in the trilogy.  Yes, that's the kind of fool I was.  I even thought that sections of ""Raiders"" were just a trifle dull.  THAT'S the kind of fool I was.But I grew up, and, as you would expect, my admiration for the first Indianna Jones film has done nothing but increase; it's now clear as day to me that it's the best thing Spielberg has ever done.  (Not quite clear as day.  In order to be sure I'd have to see ""The Sugarland Express"".)  For this film alone Spielberg deserves a place at the High Table with the great directors.  It's one of the most purely pleasurable cinematic outings of all time.  Perhaps we can't credit Spielberg for the perfectly cantilevered script (what a pity it was to spoil its perfection, by making other Indianna Jones films, good though the second one was), or for the tub-thumpingly terrific musical score.  How lucky Spielberg was to find John Williams, a composer not afraid to write actual music, as opposed to mood noises; nor afraid to take everything seriously, even as he underlined the humour.  Like Spielberg himself.  And I suppose Spielberg was lucky to make the film in 1981.  Made today, it would be arch and hip and flippant, it would showcase inferior special effects, and the soundtrack would be poorly recorded.But good fortune is a tiny part of the story.  This is CLEARLY a film made by a director with eagle-eyed quality control: it contains not a weak shot, nor a dead scene, nor an uncommitted performance, nor a dud line.  (Whatever happened to that director?)  You may START, as I did, thinking of it as a slightly-too-slow-but-still-fun adventure yarn ... but as you watch it again and again (and you will), you'll come to realise that it's a cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raiders of the Lost Oppurtunity...,"Classic scenes abound for sure, but unfortunately they're spread around some of the most lull-inducing moments ever.  Somehow most of the general world overlooked my problems and cherish this thing.  I can almost see how: the huge rolling boulder; the truck chase; and of course, the snakes.  Which makes me not hate this, but really look at it as a missed oppurtunity.  It starts when Ford retrieves a small statue in the opening moments of the film, painting himself some sort of adventurer.  It ends up that he's an archaeology proffessor who makes the occassional globe trotting adventure to pick up nicknacks here and there.  His college receives information on the Lost Ark, which is, as one character puts it, ""a radio for talking to God"". Ford's motto for most things is that it belongs in a museum, so he sets off after it.  But in between some dynamite action sequences are far too many dialogue passages that just lose you (or just me, I guess).  Take the scene in the college auditorium that goes on and on and on and...  Arks and staffs and myths and locations.  Just get on with it!  Then there's stuff with the Nazis and Allen's character, showdowns in pup tents, among other things. Plus a suprising amount of gore at the end, with melting faces and suctioned bodies.  John Williams contributes another classic score which I still whistle twenty years later.  I have found a few like me who must fast-forward a lot of the time, but don't take my word, most everyone adores this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Nice, although i prefer #3...","I watched Indy from episode 3, it was very funny, it had two great leading actors, some great supporting actors, episode 2 was funny in the begging.

Ofcourse Harisson ford ain't no James Bond that's why his character changed through the movies. The direction is superb, the script is just right and ofcourse the spectators are happy to see Karen Allen as the femme-fatale(not with the current meaning of the word) of the series.

The Greatest Action Hero since Bond,"To ""Star Wars"" fans Harrison Ford is Han Solo. To serious film buffs he is the star of classy dramas like ""Witness"" and ""The Fugitive"". To everyone else he is probably best known as the creator of the greatest action hero since James Bond.The character of Indiana Jones originated in the love of producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg for the film serials of the 1930s and 1940s and their desire to create a modern equivalent, set in that period but using the techniques of the eighties' blockbuster. Another influence seems to have been the superhero comic; Indy does not actually have superpowers but, like any self-respecting hero, he has two distinct identities, just as Superman had the shy young journalist Clark Kent and Batman had the millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. In the lecture room he is Professor Henry Jones, professor of archaeology at the fictional Marshall College and a scholarly, mild-mannered, tweedy intellectual. In the field he becomes Indiana, a tough guy whose trademarks are a fedora hat, a leather jacket and a bullwhip. Despite their period setting, the films also have something in common with the Bond series; both franchises feature a tough action hero who travels round the world, often accompanied by a glamorous female companion, to prevent the destruction of civilisation as we know it by the villains. Like the Bond films, the Indiana Jones films often start with an opening action sequence which only has a very limited connection with what is to follow.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the film which introduced Indy to the world, and the only episode in the series not to feature his name in the title. (By contrast, the words ""James Bond"" do not appear in the title of a single Bond film). The action takes place in the Egypt of 1936 (apart from the opening scene which is set in Peru). The plot is a complex one, but the basic idea is that Indy is battling a gang of Nazis who are searching for the biblical Ark of the Covenant, believing that if they can recover it they will be able to exploit its power to conquer the world. This concept- a gallant adventurer in some exotic location battling the villains for possession of an artifact with mystical powers- has served as the basis for a number of more recent adventure film, including ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and the two ""Tomb Raider"" films whose archaeologist heroine, Lara Croft, can be seen as a female Indy, a sort of Indiana Joan.The film was a huge success at the box-office, and was also a hit with most of the critics, although there were a few dissenting voices, notably Pauline Kael (never a fan of the popcorn blockbuster). It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but lost to ""Chariots of Fire"". Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Ford himself, who makes Indy a hugely charismatic figure- not infallible, but determined, courageous and indomitable- the sort of man everyone wants on their side in a crisis. The glamour is provided by Karen Allen as Indiana's former lover, Marion Ravenwood, who makes an attractively feisty heroine- much better than Kate Capshaw's annoying character in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".John Williams's musical score was a popular one, although to my mind the main march theme is a bit too similar to all the other identikit pseudo-military marches which Williams composed for other action blockbusters during this period. (Is it ""Raiders""? Is it ""Star Wars""? No, it's ""Superman""!). Spielberg handles the action well and the film moves along at a brisk pace, making this a fast-moving roller-coaster of a movie- fast enough to persuade us to overlook the fact that the plot is really all a lot of hokum. (Klaus Kinski, who turned down the chance to play the main Nazi character, called the script ""moronically sh*tty""). There are also elements of humour- the scene where Indy whips out his pistol and shoots a man who is threatening him with a sword always seems to get a laugh, largely because it slyly mocks the unwritten conventions of the swashbuckler genre. (The hero must fight at least one hand-to-hand duel per movie and must not take advantage of superior armaments, even against the most despicable opponent). ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" may be a commercial blockbuster, but it offers enough in the way of thrills and excitement to be worth watching, even by those who would normally avoid the genre. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
