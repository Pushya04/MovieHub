Very Pleasant Surprise...,"Just came from a sneak preview held in Baltimore and left the theater feeling very satisfied. You don't normally find a late September movie as good as ""Zombieland"" was. After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. There were not a lot of scares in the movie, other than the few obvious scenes where you could see one coming, but horror is not what the director was going for in this film. Laughs, however, come often and from many different directions. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy, insecure 'Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombie-killing 'Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also solid throughout. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. The film has a simple, easy to follow storyline that does not provoke a lot of questions. Indeed, if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises, you're going to be severely disappointed. There is however, good action, good laughs, and plenty of zombie related gore. At about 90 minutes long, it does not drag on and gets to the predictable but satisfying ending, going out in style. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to ""Shaun of the Dead"", which is nothing to be ashamed of, but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory, but with any comedy so far this year. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting too much, you'll get your money's worth. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Will undoubtedly become a cult classic,"Arguably one of the finest horror comedies of all time is Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead, and since its release in '04, there have been a good number of wannabes. Based on the trailers for Zombieland, however, I thought that the film had some serious potential to match Shaun in terms of quality, possibly even usurp it. Having seen the film, I'm happy to say that Zombieland does just that.Unlike many comedies in recent memory, in which the majority of laughs are already provided by the trailer, Zombieland is filled to the brim with laugh-out-loud moments, thanks largely to the brilliant cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the main protagonist, Columbus, portraying that sense of vulnerability and awkwardness, without becoming too Michael Cera-like. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also terrific as the sweet, yet tough Wichita and the more-mature-than-she-seems Little Rock, respectively.The real stand-out performance, though, is Woody Harrelson as the Twinkie-lovin', zombie-hatin' Tallahassee. Next to that of Woody Boyd on Cheers and Frasier, this is definitely the best performance of his career. There's also a painfully hilarious cameo appearance about mid-way through the film that would be a crime to spoil. Suffice it to say, this is – hands-down – the best cameo that I've ever seen in a film.The most surprising aspect of Zombieland, to me, is how much heart there is. All of the characters feel warm and alive, and what drama there is to be found feels extremely sincere. Ultimately, you feel invested in the story and the characters, which – I think – is the most important thing any film of any genre can do.Zombieland has instantly become a horror favorite of mine (comedic or otherwise). The – for the lack of a better word – quotable dialogue, consistently hysterical tone, and endearing characters, all come together to create a film that will undoubtedly become a cult classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Brilliantly crafted with laughs from beginning to end,"I caught a sneak preview of Zombieland with a friend and was impressed to say the least.Zombieland has to have one of the flashiest openings in memory. There is no subtle build up. You are dropped right into Zombieland as Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) begins listing the rules to survival. Of course each rule gives you a hysterical example of why the rule is in place. Anything that has been taboo for horror films at one time is met head on. I won't list each as not to spoil the movie but Zombieland has a unique ability to make almost anything seem comical. This includes the fact that for some reason it seems that every zombie in Zombieland has a blood belching problem. Literally every zombie has blood spewing from their mouth. This is captured best in the intro as you almost feel like you are supposed to have the 3D glasses in place.Columbus is funny enough with his phobias and geek lifestyle that proves to be what keeps him alive but it isn't until he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), that things really kick into gear. Harrelson seems to have been born for this role. He has more one liners than any character in recent memory. Each line is typically vulgar but even if offensive it is near impossible not to laugh. Let's face it, if you are completely offended by language or blood then you aren't likely to be sitting with a crowd watching Zombieland in the first place.A little romance is thrown into the mix when Columbus and Tallahassee come up on Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). For a zombie comedy I thought Eisenberg and Stone actually had decent chemistry. Not that much time is dedicated to romance but what is there comes across as sincere and lets us watch as Columbus transitions from geek to hero. Even without the romance the girls are an important part of the chemistry of Zombieland. They help to even out the brawn and the brains between the four characters.Zombieland has a simple story. The guys are loners. Columbus with the simple mission to stay alive and Tallahassee with a never ending search for any and all of the remaining golden Twinkies left on the planet. The girls are sisters who are trying to get to an amusement park in CA where they believe, or at least want to believe it is zombie free. A small part of the film feels like the movie Vacation with zombies. The comical trip with a destination which you can just feel isn't going to be what the characters hope for. Like Vacation it shows that the journey is far more important than the destination.The biggest moment of the film has to be the mystery cameo. I'm glad I didn't know who it was and I won't spoil it for anyone else. I will say that it was brilliantly written into the script. PERFECT! It really goes to show how much they focused on getting Zombieland to be a top notch flick that should go down as a horror-comedy classic to remember. It will certainly fit alongside Shaun of the Dead in my movie collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Hop onto this drop tower ride n be ready for ur giggle to turn into a guffaw, tensing ur diaphragm n thereby gaining a solid ab workout.","First saw this in 2010 on a dvd which i own.
Revisited it recently. As a fan of Woody Harrelson, I enjoyed this even more.
The film follows four fellas making their way through the zombie apocalypse on a road trip.
While one fella has a set of rules to survive, another has a craving for Twinkies and stops to acquire some even with the threat of zombies roaming the countryside.
The list of rules, especially cardio, for surviving in the zombie-infested world, a clown-zombie n the drop tower ride, r all uniquely the highlight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Actually quite fun,"I just was exiting the theater after seeing '9', which is also worth a look, when my friend and I were offered tickets to a preview screening of Zombieland, which began almost immediately. I had seen previews for this picture, but I'd say this exceeded my expectations, which isn't to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn't really overstay it's welcome.As you might expect for this genre, it's quite gory, so don't go expecting a light 'R' rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do.I'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering.Let's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Visually stylish & polished - Easily the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time.,"The name Zombieland conjures up a vision of a zombie-themed amusement park -- and that's exactly what this film is. Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said, this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers', Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film, which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear, but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style & sensibility. Jesse Eisenberg (who has a certain Michael Cera shyness/eccentricity to his delivery, but doesn't seem nearly as pathetic as Cera's characters often come off) carries the film well. And of course, everyone is talking about the film's 'secret' cameo, and rightly so. It is absolutely the best and most fun part of an already awesomely fun film -- and it kept me laughing almost non-stop throughout that 10-15 minute section of the movie.This is a zombie-comedy that deserves to take it's place amongst the best of the genre, 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Army of Darkness'. In fact, what I wouldn't give to see a triple feature of these films at a drive-in theater on Halloween... the perfect place and time for a zombie feeding.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best,"(Synopsis) The entire world is hit with an apocalyptic infection that turns people into zombies once they have been bitten by an infected zombie. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a young geek who has a lot of phobias about almost everything from clowns, to bathrooms, to checking the back seat of cars. Being alone and scared of the outside world has kept him alive. His new fear is being eaten by zombies. To survive, Columbus has begun making a long list of rules to survive. Each time he gives you one of his rules, you see an example of his rule in action. He decides to go home to Columbus to see if his parents are still alive. Along the highway, he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) a redneck zombie killer who loves Twinkies. They team up and head for Tallahassee. On the way they meet and join forces with two girls, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abagail Breslin). They may be the last surviving people on earth, and they must rely on each other to survive.(My Comment) Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best. You usually don't see a zombie movie as a comedy, but you will like this one. Actually this isn't really a comedy; it is more a funny horror movie, because there is bloodshed in a comic situation. There is plenty of blood splattering, plenty of killing and gore, and even some nudity of a stripper zombie. The film delivers you four heroes that you can root for when the zombies come after them. You will begin to love the scenes with the rules of survival that Jesse Eisenberg explains to the audience in a background voice such as wearing your seat-belt, or the double-tap rule after you shoot a zombie make sure he is dead by shooting him in the head again. Trust me; this is not a wasted shot. Woody Harrelson's performance is terrific, as a redneck zombie killer who misses his puppy Buck, and must find a Twinkie at any cost. There is one unforgettable cameo appearance that will take place at someone's Beverly Hills mansion. I won't say his name, but it is hilarious. There is one thing that I must say about this zombie movie that is not normally in zombie movies, and that is the fact that once these zombies are infected they can run very fast. As a matter of fact that is rule number 1, be sure that you can outrun the zombies, because the overweight and slow people were caught first by the zombies. There are some pretty funny scenes, and you will laugh from beginning to end. (Columbia Pictures, Run Time 1:20, Rated R)(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
This Parody Of Zombie Films Is So Much Fun,"Jesse Eisenberg plays a socially inept, neurotic young man who has survived a zombie apocalypse. He also narrates much of the film. The result is a parody of zombie films that feels similar to some early Woody Allen films.""Zombieland"" is grossly gory and tongue-in-cheek. It pays homage to many films of the zombie genre and dozens that are not. Surprisingly funny, its humor is spot-on and effective, helped by a strong cast that includes Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.The script hits the right notes continually, whether they are comedic or tender. And each twist feels right, keeping things interesting. The film never lags; it just shifts into a different gear.This is a surprisingly fun film and it feels like it would stand up to repeated viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
America's answer to Shaun of the Dead.,"This film was a fun ride all the way through. It's lack of scariness(non existent) and *GASP!* gore is more than made up for with the constant flow of hilarity and likable characters. This is by far the optimist's zombie film, as the way things play out are definitely different than any one thats come before it(definitely not a Romero flick, though I think his Land of the Dead actually is second place in this regard). It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch for how each rule makes it's appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in the worst of times. I recommend this to anybody who has a remote interest in comedies, zombie/end of the world flicks, or just having a good time at the theater, and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Rule #17: Don't Be A Hero!!,"Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a regular boy with regular gaming addiction, but has serious people phobia & never had any friends in his life & is afraid most of the times. One day, due to the spread of an incurable virus, the whole of USA is over-run by zombies. He wants to see his parents in Columbus & during his journey meets up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who loves to kill zombies. They are conned by a pair of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) & Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). All of them become friends over their crazy journey across America.I seriously loved this film. The comedy is great, we care about the characters, the zombies are gross & the dialogues are seriously cool. This became one of my favourite comedy films of all time, as the character development is strong & there are laughs all the way through. This film has something which lots of films in this genre are missing, it has heart. The characters are warm & the little drama it has is very sincere.The standout performance comes from Woody Harrelson who is Twinkie loving and zombie hating. Jesse Eisenberg is really maturing as an actor. His latest films have all been good. And his rules, God The Rules, that was so much fun. Abigail Breslin plays yet again the girl-who's-mature-way-beyond-her-age. It may sound boring, but trust me it is anything but that. Emma Stone as Wichita, I loved her. All the characters were endearing to me.This will undoubtedly become a cult classic, much in the same way as 'Shaun Of The Dead'. A zombie comedy that's this good has taken too long to come after Shaun of the Dead. But it is definitely worth the wait:)9/10 -Girish,20",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Very entertaining,"There is some (probably requisite) violence in this zombie thriller, but it's also got humor, some nice touches in editing, and it's very entertaining. The cast is fantastic, with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin all turning in performances perfectly tuned to the genre. The scenes with Bill Murray are all very funny, and one part in particular is absolutely hilarious, but I won't spoil it. Eisenberg channels Woody Allen at times with his shy awkwardness. Trying to do both comedy and horror is difficult, but director Ruben Fleischer really pulls it off. This is a fun movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombieland meanders down a river of corpses,"I enjoyed Zombieland, and yet I was left feeling unsatisfied. It seems to have been well reviewed because there is nothing necessarily bad about the movie, but beyond a few laughs, there really isn't much good about Zombieland either. I wanted to like it, and I enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie, but then I got this sinking feeling that it just isn't going anywhere. There's some stabs at character development, but it is incredibly simplified - the main character is a neurotic baby Woody Allen type, Tallahassee is tough because he lost someone or something, and the girls don't trust anyone, because... they just don't. Some people have been comparing this to ""Shaun of the dead"", but I think that was a vastly superior film, mainly because the zombies were an actual threat in ""Shaun"". In Zombieland, the zombies exist more for their slapstick appeal. The plot is loose and unconnected, and makes no real sense. This is a movie that cried for a dark side, just a glint of pain, disaster, personal loss. I was not a fan of the ending either, it felt like a TV ending, leaving everything open so there can be a sequel, and almost nothing is resolved. The acting is solid, I have to lay the blame on the script, the story's arc was weak, even if many of the scenes were strong. Finally, don't get me wrong, it's worth seeing, just not worth gushing over.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"I've never hit a kid before. I mean, that's like asking who Gandhi is.","Zombieland is directed by Ruben Fleischer from a screenplay written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin as survivors of a Zombie apocalypse thrust together on a road trip in search of a fabled Zombieless sanctuary.As it stands now, Zombieland is the most successful Zombie based film in history. Proving that there is still life (no pun intended) in the undead based comedy. Reese and Wernick have stated that the idea for Zombieland was milling around their heads in 2005, a year after Shaun Of the Dead had made such a joyous appearance on the horror/com circuit. You get the feeling that the guys desperately wanted an American version to rival the British torch bearer. They got it.Where Zombieland differs greatly from Shaun is that it unashamedly lives in a cartoon fantasy world. It blasts right out of the blocks with a montage sequence of death, dismemberment, crash, bangs and wallops, and never lets up on its carefree abandon approach. And hooray to that. In fact the film only pauses for breath for a short time at the mid-point, and even then it's to slot in one of the best ever cameo performances to grace a comedy. Away from the tricks and smart gimmicks that gloriously light up the narrative (the rules, baby, are awesome), Zombieland works so well because of its four characters.This maybe a Zombie movie (and what Zombies they are too), but this is about four likable human beings asking us to invest some time with them as they surge from one situation to the next. Something we are only too glad to do. Be it Harrelson (never better) laying waste to any number of the undead, or Eissenberg (hello there little Woody Allen) offering up witticisms that hide a lonely heart facade; these characters prove to have depth. Yes we could possibly argue that both Stone and Breslin (spunky & perky respectively) deserve more screen time, hell they sure earn it, but as a foursome they combine to make one of the brightest buddy buddy-buddy buddy movies out there.It's plot lite, and unlike Shaun, it has no great peril sequences to fully form the horror aspects of it. But it's so funny and awash with carefree charm we have no right to dwell too long on its tiny faults. One of the best crowd-pleaser's of 2009 and proof positive that an apocalypse really can be quite fun after all. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An amusing and fun zombie adventure,A fun adventure that will surely keep you entertained through out. Zombies aren't too scary but they do provide for good action. This movie has a really great opening. You will be drawn into its charm and its loveable characters. Though out you will feel a sense of adventure with some highly comical moments.

A new style of comedy!,"Zombieland is hardly a plot-heavy and dramatic masterpiece, but it IS very, very funny, and not funny in a way you're used to seeing in a comedy.There are very few jokes made, the humor is more from people doing things that people might normally do, just filmed very well in a humorous fashion.Oh, and the movie has lots of zombies and other awesome stuff that surround this entire idea of having every situation be the biggest ""What the frack?!"" you can possibly imagine.The small cast was obviously having a great time when they made it, and all four characters did a very good job of fitting with the style of the movie.Lastly, while the whole movie is hilarious, one scene in particular will have you in fits, one of the funniest single little scenes I've ever seen.

Execrable Zombie Swill,"A captivating opening credit sequence with blasting Metallica and blasting gore deteriorates into the worst zombie movie ever made. I pity the poor editors who had to watch their beautiful introduction followed by 90 minutes of swill, but I feel more pity for myself for having paid a fat $2 to see the movie. Twitchy Jessie Eisenberg (now inexplicably cast in everything, always playing the same nebbish, virginal dweeb) provides an even more twitchy voice-over that makes the combination of Eisenberg's pompous pre-Raphaelite face and boring, self-deprecating personality an unbearable combination. The female characters are twice as malignant as any zombies wasted on screen. I literally prayed for the 12 year old girl to be killed and eaten within the first 15 minutes, securing her repugnant presence a place right up there with Short Round from ""Indiana Jones & The Temple Of Doom"". Woody Harrelson's hillbilly zombie-killer is an exhalation of straight bottom-burp, with his podunk antics lifted straight out of some cartoon. Meanwhile, the surprise cameo in the movie earns some laughs, but--much like the Metallica in the credits--neither element redeems this wretched flick. The extensive CG gore made me feel even more alienated from the lurching masses of cheering, morbidly obese geeks in black jean shorts attending.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I guess people can enjoy seeing a curly insecure virgin boy looking out of place no matter what the script.

I was wrong: it was a total waste of time, not funny as a comedy, not thrilling as a zombie movie, not touching as a personal drama.Bottom line: it's practically a romcom with zombies. Same lack of plot, ludicrous premise and acrid aftertaste. Oh, and zombies. Meh!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The epitome of 'turn off your brain and enjoy'.,"This is NOT a film that will be up for any awards this year (except for maybe those from Fangoria), as it is not an art or prestige movie--nor is it something you'll likely see in the Criterion Collection! No, this film is about as far from this sort of movie as you can get, as it's a 'turn off your brain and enjoy' film--one you can't think too much about but there is still something about it you'll probably like. I say PROBABLY because if you can't stand gore or profuse swearing, then go no further--this is clearly a film to avoid. But, provided you have a relatively high tolerance for this sort of thing, it's a good bet to see--in particular if you've seen and enjoyed ""Sean of the Dead"". While ""Sean"" is a better film, it's roughly along the same lines--an irreverent comedy about zombie-killers!What is particularly good about this film is the dialog and characters as they seem very out of place and just plain strange. One (the narrator) is a total geek, one a maniac who, on some level, actually seems to be ENJOYING the zombie outbreak (Woody Harrelson)! These two later stumble upon the most unlikely pair of girls--an 18-or so year old and her 12 year-old sister. I say unlikely because they repeatedly get the upper hand on the two men and prove that brains, not just brawn and a desire to kill, are what counts. As for the rest of the film, it's mostly mindless violence, action and laughs. Now there is a very special moment around the middle of the film when the quartet meet a new friend. This is GREAT but I don't want to say more as it would spoil the surprise.Mindless, crazy and worth seeing. This is a great one to rent or watch on cable, but it probably isn't good enough to merit adding it to your DVD collection--but you be the judge of that. Surprisingly good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Entertaining and Original Horror-Comedy,"Mad Cow Disease has mutated into a cannibalistic zombie-producing virus to which only a few people are immune. If adding four emotionally damaged characters including a Twinkie-obsessed nihilistic urban cowboy (Woody Harrelson), a paranoid hypochondriac teenage shut-in (Jesse Eisenberg) and a two-sister teenage con-artist team (Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone) doesn't sound like enough to turn this cyberpunk nightmare into a laugh-out-loud comedy, why not throw in Bill Murray playing himself?I don't see many modern comedies. The theme of 21st century comedy is more often than not stupidity, which does not amuse me. What enticed me to see this film was the combination of the concept and Woody Harrelson. With the exception of 2012, Harrelson has not made a lot of bad career choices, and - let's face it - zombies have great comedic potential. I was mostly unfamiliar with the rest of the primary cast (Murray's role is a cameo), but, midway through the film I recognized Abigail Breslin from the excellent Little Miss Sunshine.Despite its unusual premise, Zombieland, like most contemporary comedies, is presented from the perspective of a twenty-something male - its target demographic. Eisenberg's character tells the story as something between a diary and a primer on survival in Zombieland. Predictably, his romantic interest - played by Stone - is the least well-developed character in the film. Harrelson and Eisenberg's characters, however, are more than enough to carry Zombieland.As with many contemporary comedies, it is not very strongly plotted, but unlike many of of its competitors, its characters are made memorable by a script which makes the most out of both the acting talent and the plot's significant elements. My only disappointment with this film was what seemed like an unnecessarily wandering and lengthy transition between the film's first (survival) and second plots (learning how to care), bridged by the Bill Murray cameo. While this transition offered some crucial back-story concerning the primary characters, its lack of action seemed incongruous with the rest of the film.Nicely paced and filmed, smarter than average, and funny, Zombieland is worth seeing - once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Zombies zip past the road to nowhere,"If you go into Zombieland with the idea that it is a Zombie film you will be disappointed. What Zombieland is at it's core is a Coming-of-age, road trip film ala 1980's. The trailers for the film are misleading and if they had marketed the film for what it is, it would have seemed inventive and not so run of the mill. Don't get me wrong, there are Zombies out there, but they are just part of the set-up for the movie, the real story revolved around an introverted young man who is forced by circumstance to abandon college and make his way home. He is sidetracked by an older man who leads him on an adventure where he meets a young woman whom he must ultimately save. I think that the writers must be familiar with Campbells ""The Hero of a Thousand Faces"", because like Lucas's ""Star Wars"" the characters come from those pages.It is not a film without interest though. If you ever wondered what would become of those people that dress up as famous people on Hollywood Blvd., or what would happen to Eddie Van Halen or Bill Murry during a Zombie plague, you'll find your answer here. There are some terrible and unforgivable mistakes in this film though: The first is that it never really resolves itself, the film rambles on and comes very close to making a point then steps back and goes in another direction. Most importantly; the end of the film is a let down. It almost seems like it was an afterthought and the Director gives each character a chance to kill zombies and then drive off with a little voice over narration that is suppose to satisfy the time one spent invested in this film. It is truly annoying for anyone who has seen Dawn of the Dead and wondered what they would do in a Zombie plague; these characters choices make no sense at all. I won't talk about the acting outside of the fact that Woody can not cry to save his life without making it look phony (I though he was pulling the lead characters leg, but it turned out he was emoting). Finally, the lead character sets off on a quest that is discarded without any remorse. There is no way to feel for these characters, they are empty, fractured and one dimensional. Bill Murry who makes a brief appearance in the film, makes one wonder if he had lost a poker game to the producers. That segment of the film is the biggest ""Why ?"" of the film. There is no reason whatsoever for them to be at Bill Murry's house !In the end it is not a good Zombie film, and it is a so-so road trip/coming-of-age film. It isn't worth $12 to see and it isn't worth $24 or so to buy on DVD. Wait and rent it and it may seem better than I make it out to be. I can certainly understand that this poor review will annoy some people who love zombies of any kind, as an avid played of L4D I understand; it is just that this film doesn't do it for me.

Fasten your seat belts.,"I've watched Shaun of the Dead enough times recently, and needed something similar, good old Netflix suggested Zombieland, it's been some times since I last watched this, in fact I last saw it on its release.Even better than I remember, it is a brilliant movie, it came at a time where zombie movies were perhaps at saturation point, Zombieland is unique, funny, exciting, and features one of the most random, and wonderful cameos ever. The Britishness in Shaun, is matched by the American-ness of this, Bill Muarray made this complete.It's still the best thing I've ever seen Eisenberg in, his delivery is tremendous, as is Stone's. Has Woody Harrelson ever looked so damn hot in his entire life as he does bere, he's tremendous.It looks awesome, it's hilarious, it's a classic, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Worst Case Of The Munchies Ever,"I have to say that when I went to see Zombieland I wasn't quite prepared for what I was getting. When it started out I honestly thought it was a variation on the Charlton Heston science fiction classic, The Omega Man which also dealt with some human survivors of a plague that's left the rest of humanity the victim of some horrid disease.Instead I got a good natured farce of a film about this same kind of apocalyptic event. The action is narrated by one of four survivors who find themselves thrown together in this case college student Jesse Eisenberg. The other three are Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. These characters are not referred to by name, merely places either destinations or places of origin.Harrelson has the best most broadly expansive role in the film. It's a scenery chewing part and Harrelson dines on it the way those zombies devour surviving humans.I never did get just exactly how this disease spread and why these four should have been so lucky to be spared. Usually those details are important in science fiction, but I got swept up in the general enjoyment that the cast was having with this film that I didn't care after a while.I agree with other reviewers that this film is destined to become a cult classic. Another future Rocky Horror Picture Show has been born.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Lots of laughs, snappy dialog, Harrelson at his best, what more can you want?","As our local cinema was celebrating its 250th Surprise Sneak Preview showing, people were expecting a special movie, fitting the occasion. I was a little disappointed when ""Zombieland"" came up, because I am not a great fan of zombie flicks. Even the praised ""Shaun of the Dead"" didn't manage to impress me very much.But ""Zombieland"" turned out to be a genuine surprise. Jessie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson make a great team on screen, playing two starkly contrasting characters. Eisenberg's over-anxious, geeky college kid ""Columbus"", who relies on a set of fixed rules in order to survive, is put against Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"", a rough but likable cowboy type with a maniac edge, who likes to kill zombies for fun.Their chemistry works well and B-movies such as ""Tremors"" come to mind, where the banter and quarrel between main characters is at least as entertaining as their fight against evil low-budget monsters. Soon, con girls ""Wichita"" and ""Little Rock"" join the road trip, and an uncomplicated, straight-forward love story develops. The whole plot is extremely simple, so don't expect twists and turns. I guess that's what makes this flick so likable - its simplicity: just plain, old-fashioned fun. Lots of laughs, snappy dialog, Harrelson at his best, what more can you want? One word about the gore - yes there is quite a lot of blood and violence. Personally, even though I dislike excessive gore, I couldn't take it serious here. For me it was more part of the setting than anything else. Zombies, monsters or giant worms - who cares. Then again, a friend's girlfriend left the theater shortly after the opening credits, so be warned in case you don't appreciate the habitual use of double-barrel shotguns.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Terrific Zombie Flick,"Zombieland, what most had expected to be just a rip off of the cult classic Shaun of the Dead ended up being one of the funniest films I have seen this year. I had a feeling from the trailer that this was going to be good, but Zombieland was a lot better than I had anticipated. This film delivers in everything: scares, gore, action, romance, and perfect comedic timing. Woody Harrelson is on top of his game this year with several movie hits under his belt the past couple of years, he comes back to his true form of comedy with Zombieland. Both he and Abigail Breslin stole the show and could honestly have carried the movie on their own. Zombieland also took it's typical concept with the clichés of zombies and took today's twist on it. After all, we've all see a zombie movie or 2 in our life time. We're always screaming something at the screen on what we think the character should do and that's what our main character is all about: The Rules of Zombieland.In a post-apocalyptic context, beginning with narration from Columbus, a college student, who is on his way to Columbus, Ohio to see if his parents are alright. He begins by explaining his ""rules"" for surviving the zombie apocalypse. After surviving a few zombie attacks, he encounters Tallahassee, whose life goal is to find the remaining Twinkies on Earth. As Columbus and Tallahassee search a grocery store for Twinkies, they meet two girls, Wichita and Little Rock. Through a con, the girls get their weapons and car, but the men find a Humvee loaded with weapons and head out to find the girls. Later, the girls use their own weapons to get the Hummer after their stolen car breaks down. After a small fight, Columbus convinces them that it's better to stick together. They decide to drive towards Pacific Playland, an amusement park that is supposedly zombie-free.Zombieland is going to be a hit and I'm sure another classic down the line. It was just a blast to watch. I think that Bill Murray scene is going to be remembered for years to come, but I can't give any spoilers away, you're just going to have to trust me and the others on the IMDb comment boards are talking about. All the actors in this movie worked so well together and were a total pleasure to watch on screen battle it out with these flesh eaters. Also you gotta love that Woody Harrelson's main goal of the movie is to get a twinkie, but I tell you when you have a craving, you have a craving. I told my boyfriend who knows how I get when I have a craving that I totally knew what Woody was talking about, lol. I would recommend Zombieland to others, this was a fun fast paced film with that delivered what the audience wanted and more.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Just Too Much Fun To Dislike,"I have never been a fan of zombie fare. I usually don't like over-the-top hijinks movies. I prefer my plots (and characters) complex and love it when they make me think. Thus, one would assume that ""Zombieland"" is not for me. Yet, I enjoyed the experience because it is just so much doggone fun!For a basic plot summary, ""Zombieland"" sees young Columbus (Jesse Eisenburg) surviving in a post-apocalyptic U.S.A filled with zombies. He manages to stay alive by following a strict set of rules like ""always check the back seat"" and ""never be the hero"", for example. Columbus then finds an unlikely partner in Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who is a zombie-killing legend. When sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) enter the picture, the foursome must try to cope in a world destroyed by the flesh-eating monsters.What makes this movie work so well is that director Ruben Fleischer knows how silly this genre truly is and thus this whole film is about poking fun at itself. It is kind of ironic that those people (like me) who dislike the zombie genre will probably like ""Zombieland"" better than others because of that tongue-in-cheek nature. Zombie material either has to be played perfectly straight (like ""The Walking Dead""), or this completely opposite approach, which lets us laugh at how ridiculous the whole scenario truly is.The acting from that main foursome only helps to suck in viewers, as each of those four turn in a wonderful performance. Harrelson almost steals the show, Eisenburg is the perfect ""loner/nerd"", and Stone/Breslin make their characters come to life as well. A longer-than-usual ""cameo"" from Bill Murray is also a highlight.Thus, even though I usually despise zombie-related fare, this one held my interest all the way through. I could have even watched more material, as it was so funny and fresh.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Irreverent zombie movie,"Zombies are everywhere. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner and that may be why he is surviving the zombie apocalypse. Also he has come up with a list of rules to live by. On the way to Columbus to find his parents, he gets a ride from zombie killing Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who has a Twinkie obsession. He refuses to know anybody's names. The guys gets robbed by sister grifters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). They head to an L.A. amusement park that is rumored to be zombie free.It's an irreverent zombie movie in line with 'Shaun of the Dead' except not as much jokiness. Ruben Fleischer, mostly a TV director before this, is able to bring a quirky style to comedy writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. There is a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray. Even the kills are wacky. The four leads are eminently likable. The last act does turn into more of a straight up zombie fight. If the world does turn into Zombieland, I wouldn't mind riding with these four.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Far from being great but still an entertaining film,"Zombies have been around for a long time in film with zombies going mainstream in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Eventually though the zombie horror genre got stale after 2004's Dawn of the Dead. But it would not be until 2009's Zombieland. I was just in the 1st grade when this film came out and of course, did not watch it. It would take me years and years to finally getting around to this film and now is that time. Zombieland upon release recieved positive reviews from critics and audiences alike and was a big financial success and was for a short time the highest grossing zombie film unitl World War Z. The film was popular enough that it was going to be a TV show, with a pilot being released but the pilot was not well recieved and so that idea went down the drain. A sequel was released in 2019 titled Zombieland: Double Tap. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.Columbus is trying to find out if his parents are alive. Heading towards his intended destination, he meets Tallahassee and Wichita and Little Rock. They are all heading for a place that supposedly is zombie free. It is their only hope and they must stick together.Zombieland is a fun film. Far from being great but still a fun and entertaining film. What it does, it does fine. It is a lighthearted horror comedy. It does that well. Sure, it is not particularly scary and it can be a little too lighthearted for my taste. For one, I think the characters have it way too easy in this film. Nothing bad really ever happens to them. But yet again, the characters are very likeable and memorable and even have great chemistry together. Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus is a relateable character. Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee is memorable, funny, and such a badass. Emma Stone's and Breslin's respective characters are fine but not nearly as good as the previous two. They are mostly there to fill the void in the other two characters. Columbus wants someone to love. Tallahassee wants to be a father figure. It works. The acting is really good and there is a few scenes where the characters become emotional and it is done fairly well. The comedy is good. I get a laugh but no real gutbusters if you know what I mean but it can still be a little clever at times. There is a famous cameo in this film which, had I not knew about before my viewing of the film, would have found it funnier. But had I watched this film and not had that part ruined for me, I would have found it hilarious. This film is not a dark comedy which I would have liked a little better. But instead a more lighthearted comedy. Yeah, it is not particularly scary at all. There are some suspenseful scenes but it ends up being rather predictable in the end. But one has to remember that this film had to do something different and it did. So I can't entirely crap on this film for that. It is just that I prefer certain aspects of zombie films over some of the things that occured in this film. With that being said, this film is rather unique. There are some unique kills and I think just the whole set up is rather unique with a set of rules for surviving the apocalypse and all that. The effects are nothing special. Not bad, just not special. So, yes it is good but that is just about it. The zombies look alright. They look livlier than most zombies but whatever. They are fine. Now a complaint that I really must address is this film's short running time. It is 88 minutes long. For me, that is too short. No film should be under an hour and a half. Especially a film like this where there are some truly kickass entertaining scenes. I was entertained and then the entertainment stopped rather short.In a sense, I think Zombieland is a little overrated but it is still a fun film to watch. Check this out if you have not already.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Great Funny horror movie???,"Wow The birth of a new movie category - was it spoof, horror or a comedy? All I know was it was brutal and graphic and fun at the same time. I some people with kids and maybe its a sign that the times they are a changing or maybe the parents saw the made for TV trailer and said oh this looks like a great family film!? Ah no... Not unless your raising Charlie Manson II. As I said its pretty graphic, they do a great job making the zombie people being killed really look like they are being killed and they swear a lot and I do mean a lot! Now that being said you were warned and trust me, I normally laugh during Horror movies anyway, but at least in this one I supposed to. I saw the trailers and figured it may be OK like Shaun of the dead, but this one wasn't even in the same category.

The casting was really good and the acting was amazing. The killcount of the movie was just nice, really bloody. Gladly, the zombies were portrayed well and their design was fine. The opening scene of the movie was really funny and I really liked the idea of ""Rules to survive a zombie apocalypse"", it was really ICONIC.

"Entertaining but ultimately disappointing, and nowhere near as great as Shaun of the Dead","Touted as an American version of Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland follows Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) as they fight and drive across the United States, avoiding becoming the next statistic of an all encompassing zombie infection. For those wondering, to avoid any real connections to each other, the group goes by city names to avoid exchanging their real names. An interesting touch in an otherwise bafflingly disappointing film.I wanted to love Zombieland the same way I do Shaun, but sadly, the film fails to deliver the same way that low budget British rom-zom-com did five years ago. It has the intentions to be an amazingly hilarious horror film, but it never delivers on the promises of the hysterical trailers.Speaking of those trailers, they are the biggest point of contention I have with the film. They reveal almost every single one of the best jokes. Outside of the crazily hilarious and out-of-this-world cameo appearance, the trailers show and tell almost everything else. And if you have had the misfortune of learning which actor appears in that cameo, half the joke has been ruined already. It feels a bit mismanaged on Sony's part, especially for such a ridiculously short film (80-minutes and change), to basically give away all the best parts. It is something that a lot of studios have tended to not really do so much anymore, but here it just feels silly. A lot of these lines were laugh-out-loud hysterical the first time, but on the second round, seem not so clever or unique. Many of the lines suffer even worse fates. They simply lose their luster, and end up being not funny at all.The film also lacks what is key for every good film involving zombies: satire. George A. Romero became famous for his zombie films, but only because of the ulterior messages he was using the flesh hungry horrors to put across. Isolation and fear were always apparent in his films, and every film from Shaun to the incredibly overrated 28 Days Later has used some part of his famous works to make their own film shine all the brighter. Zombieland does away with this almost entirely. It wisely does not elaborate to in-depth on the cause of the infection, or even how far it reaches (is it just in the United States, or has the whole world become zombies?). But outside of Columbus' rules to live by, which comically appear every few minutes during his narrative speeches, the film never makes an attempt at satirizing anything. It just makes jokes at the expense of pop culture, the cameo actors previous films (good and horrible), and Harrelson's bizarre redneck attitude. Any attempts at drama fall flat on its face.The film also suffers from having an episodic feel. I found it strange how the film seems to take place almost blatantly in acts; sticking to one conflict, subplot or setting at once, and never moving out of it. Learning that the film was supposed to be a television series helps shed light on why it felt this way, but does not explain why the filmmakers did not attempt to jazz it up with more scenes in more places. It gives the film a great low-budgeted feel, and makes it feel more authentic and diverse. But after seeing what a group of amateur South Africans did with 30-million dollars in District 9, I have come to expect a bit more of low budget film-making. Even Shaun manages to do a whole lot more, and from my understanding, it was made for a fairly smaller amount of money as well. The problems Zombieland suffers from here could have only been amended in editing. But with how straight and to the point the film tends to be, I doubt there was any room for added filler at any point (outside of a very dry section taking place shortly after the two groups meet for the first time).The inventive camera angles and consistently dystopic feel are the most powerful points in the film. While the entire film is not made of crazy and unique camera angles, there are plenty that feel original or used far too often. They give a certain taste to the film that makes it much better than it actually is, but do tend to make the film all the more uncommon. The hard rocking soundtrack is pretty well done as well, setting the tone for the film right from Metallica's opening note over the hugely entertaining opening credits.Eisenberg, while saddled with playing almost entirely the same character as he does in Adventureland, does some fairly good work here. His narration adds a comical element to the film that would have been sorrowly missed, and even with his same-note performance, he manages to be convincing in the role. Branching out and doing more unique things with the character could have only been beneficial to him. Harrelson, much accustomed to playing silly and unhinged characters, is solid throughout the film. He has enough finesse and charisma to work off his much younger supporting cast, and manages to make his role fun from beginning to end. Seeing him in roles like this begs the question of why he has not been playing and sticking to characters like these at all times. Stone and Breslin do some decent work in their roles, but are never really explained like Eisenberg and Harrelson are. Their one-dimensionality is a bit silly in the long run (especially when looking at their actions in the final act), but both actresses are convincing in their roles.Saying Zombieland was anything like Shaun of the Dead was the first mistake anyone made with this film. It is a fairly competent film in its own right with good performances, but nowhere near the classic Shaun is and will always be.6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Possibly the Greatest Zombie Film Ever,"This is just so much fun. Few zombie movies can match this one. Action, comedy, horror, a bit of romance, there's something for everyone.All the main actors were great, especially Harrelson, who is probably the coolest and funniest of them.

The little girl is good too, whoever she is.The movie is hilarious, and though it's billed as a ""comedy horror"", it's not really scary. Just gory. There are lots of fun scenes though, like the store scene.There's a bit of action, though the movie has one great set piece that it saves until the end. The finale is awesome. It's a giant battle in an amusement park in which the main characters kill an innumerable amount of zombies in a variety of ways. It's worth the wait.Please watch this movie.

Napoleon Dynamite meets Woody Harrelson in a Zombie World,"That's the way I felt about the movie. I didn't really think of this as an American answer to Shaun of the Dead. Shaun is pretty unique (to this day at least) and really funny. Zombieland is a Zombie action comedy like Shaun, but that's pretty much all these two movies have in common!Were Shaun had a different kind of world and the characters had some goals they wanted to go/achieve, the two main characters in Zombieland don't have that. It pretty much plays like a sketch show, with different settings holding the movie together rather than a story that runs through it. A cameo, that might seem a bit weird, especially the way it does end, is just another testament to that.But again, this movie is here, for you to enjoy and not to compare to other things.

Fun but overrated,"The trailer makes the film seem better than it is, ruining some of the best gags, but the film is entertaining and fun nevertheless. Zombieland has a very good start from the point of view of a young survivor who has created a bunch of rules for survival in this zombie-infested land. Those give us some of the best early moments as his no-nonsense sensible approach contrasts with the usual macho heroics or clueless stupidity of typical horror movie characters. Then he meets the proverbial reckless macho redneck zombie-killing machine, Woody Harelson in a very enjoyable and enthusiastic performance, and thus odd couple hijinks ensue. It seemed to me that the energy level and inspiration dipped down, with occasional upwards bumps, but never down to the ground of mediocrity, as time passed. A bit like a roller-coaster ride after the big first drop. That ""drop"" seems to happen a little after the meeting with the girls, roughly a third of the way through when zombies get scarcer.The infamous cameo (hope nobody ruined it for you) is fun but not as great as some people might leave you to believe. However, it's eventually responsible for one of the biggest laughs so what do I know. I liked the characters, found them likeably imperfect and flawed sometimes even sweet, but I did find little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin) shooting guns somewhat disturbing ;-) This film having zombies, you can expect some gore, mostly of the open mouth spewing blood variety, but the most extreme scenes are more farcical than horrific. As an horror comedy, Zombieland is quite good and should preferably be seen in a crowded theater or with a bunch of expressive friends. It's not as inspired, original or consistently funny as the recent Shaun of the Dead, Drag me to Hell or the more obscure Dance of the Dead but it's a worthy entry in this sub-genre of comedy. I've seen all of those in crowded theaters and there was more crowd reaction for these than for Zombieland who at the moment (at #147 of all-time best films on IMDb) is overrated.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Pretty good, though it runs out of ideas by the end","Fun zombie movie spoof starring Jesse Eisenberg as a nebbish whose host of rules keep him safe during the zombie apocalypse. He meets up with Woody Harrelson, a tough guy who loves killing zombies, as well as two sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, who aren't nearly as helpless as they first seem. The group travels to Los Angeles, where the two girls believe there is a zombie-free zone at a famous amusement park (Harrelson and Eisenberg aren't so sure). The film starts off fresh with a great montage of slow-motion zombies chasing after their meals, and its quite fun for well over half its run. You may have heard that the film has one of the all-time great cameo appearances ever. That's absolutely true, and if it hasn't already been spoiled for you, stay away from its IMDb page and any other spoiler sources. The movie starts to run out of steam as it nears the end. The final sequence in the amusement park is fun, but characters begin to act stupidly. Plus, you can't help wonder why the heck the power is still running everywhere, and just how in the heck the two gals are running the rides and riding them at the same time (not to mention how they get off said rides without anyone at the controls to stop them).

"A Few Notches Below ""Shaun of The Dead""","Turning from the seamless and neat ""Shaun of The Dead"", this film has been downgraded from ""all right"" to ""inferior"" in a sudden. Perhaps British humor works better with me, for the jokes here seem crude and unpolished. Yes, it is a very fun movie, but not as funny as ""Shaun"" would have you feel. I am not sure if ""Zombieland"" is meant to be a parody. If so, a big misfire. ""Shaun"", on the contrary, captures the society we live today quite well. This may be another proof that the Americans have always been more conservative and US-prone than they think. Democrat Party's platform policies may ring true to their desire to become, but Republican platforms are truly the way they do things. This is why American films stop being critical of the American society. Self- criticism is important to the ones in power.

The reason for the survivors to have survived is not explained. Nothing is explained... everything must be taken at face value in this movie. All of the plot elements are borrowed wholesale from the Zombie genre, so there is no real reason to explore them further.What we are left with is an undeniably funny, and enjoyable piece of Zombie fluff. A film that takes place within the well established Zombie-apocalypse universe without challenging our expectations in any way. Except for THAT sequence in the middle, whereby the unexpected appearance of a comedy great lifts the movie from unremarkable to near classic status.The characters play with the well established stereotypes, both conforming to them and then occasionally usurping them for comic effect. In the end, it's a light morality tail about the value of the nuclear family even under the most extreme of circumstances, and it manages to be vaguely heartwarming.I can understand this movie getting good scores. I recommend anyone with a tolerance for Zombie comedy to watch it (though it's a dark comedy - no Sean of the Dead here) but the 8+ score surprises me somewhat. That places it up there with the movie greats, and it really doesn't belong there. I gave it a seven, it deserves to settle at 7.3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Brilliant, a Stunning Movie Satisfying Today's Pop Culture + Epic Awesomeness","Zombieland, a tittle which is so simple and descriptive. What is ""brilliant"" about this movie is that like every other zombie movie, it puts YOU in the front seat of one of the worlds most unique Apocalyptic scenarios, but it does it with a tasteful and comedic twist. The twist mostly playing on the 21st century's internet and video game persona. Unlike other zombie movies with the exception of ""Shaun of The Dead"", this movie plays out the idea that we're not idiots and we know what zombies are. So there is no time wasted explaining how the events which formed Zombieland. The massive video-game influences of this film is what seriously makes it so enjoyable especially if you're an avid video-gamer. The fact that characters in the film never had any remorse for the carnage that they were inflicting with spewing blood and gore is something that any gamer understands because beating on stupid zombies is just FUN. In this movie zombies aren't crazed terrifying cannibals but stress relieving masses of meat where characters like Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) make an art out of zombie killing. So if you're looking for a movie which is hilarious and violent while being familiar and yet original plus being a fan of violent zombie killing video games, this is the movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Twinkie! My Zombie Kingdom for a TWINKIE !!!,"""Zombieland"" superficially looks another umpteenth zombie-comedy, and that's definitely not a good first impression because we have literally been served dozens of these since the release of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and even the most hardened horror buffs are slowly beginning to disregard them. However, this is one zombie movie that has to be seen by both genre fanatics as well as by people who are merely interested in a good hour and a half of laughs, ingenuity and cheerful acting performances. ""Zombieland"" is a seemingly unpretentious and straightforward mainstream horror movie, but it's actually a lot more intelligent than it looks. For starters, Ruben Fleischer's film slyly evades the whole set-up and origin of the zombie plague. The United States of America have turned into Zombieland in barely two months and that's just the way it is. All the slow and stupid people have died and lead character Columbus only briefly refers to the virus that caused all this death and destruction, but apart from that the film only focuses on here and now. Survival is the only thing that counts. To remain alive, the lone and nerdy teenager Columbus – named after his hometown – composed a simple list of essential Zombieland rules. These particular list of rules, which is regularly referred to, is another very intelligent an vital element of the script. The rules practically summarize the essence of zombie horror cinema! The include simple and obvious tips like aim for the brain and always check the backseat prior to getting in a car, but these are things that everyone already yelled to other films in an annoyed tone of voice, because people keep making the same stupid mistakes. Columbus first teams up with the macho cowboy Tallahassee, who seems more interested in finding a Twinkie than in surviving the zombie mayhem, and subsequently the deceptive sisters Wichita and Little Rock who steal their car  twice. Although the general conception in Zombieland is that you're better of alone, the four versatile survivors travel together and develop a peculiar friendship. The third really smart thing about ""Zombieland"" is that it contains quite a few effective and beautiful metaphors about things like friendship, sacrifice, puppy love and even humanity. The diversification of characters results in a lot of terrific dialogs and downright hilarious situations. Columbus is an anxious and phobic nerd whereas his partner Tallahassee (glorious role for Woody Harrelson) is a trigger-happy hillbilly who finally found a purpose in life: killing zombies. There are numerous great sequences, including adrenalin-rushing opening credits to the sound of Metallica's ""For whom the Bell Tolls"", a cameo of a fantastic Hollywood star as himself and a brilliant finale in a Californian amusement park. The film isn't too gory (ideally accessible for larger audiences, in other words) but the make-up effects on the zombies are splendid and occasionally quite scary (the clown zombie!). The film may perhaps have been inspired by the aforementioned ""Shaun of the Dead"", but it's a soon-to-be-classic by itself. It's the most entertaining and feel-good horror film of the year!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fun Zombie Flick,"This is definitely a fun movie. I like the way that they outlined the plot through the ""rules"". The way that the characters interacted with the text on the screen was neat too.Tallahassee is the star of the show with his off the wall personality, yet likable traits.This is not a serious movie, nor does it pretend to be with the comical gore, among other things. The vibrant colors are a welcome change from how dark and gloomy most zombie pictures are shown.I might have been apt to rare it a bit higher than I did, but there was just a few too many times where I was rolling my eyes, despite the fact that this is not a serious film.For me, the cameo was totally unexpected and good for a laugh.Going into this film, I was really not expecting to enjoy it quite as much as I did. For a good hearted action/comedy film, check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Nutshell Review: Zombieland,"Note to self: Lose weight and start working on that cardio program!Should recent apocalyptic films be believed, one of these days we're going to be hit with a virus out of the blue, either engineered or a force sent by Nature, that we're going to turn into angry blood-lusting zombies eager to munch on our fellow man, and woman. And should that day arrive, like in 28 Days/Weeks Later, the Resident Evil franchise, and now Zombieland, working out will become too late too soon, since these new aged zombies sprint with full force compared to George A. Romero's lumbering undead.In fact, Zombieland could spawn a franchise of its own too, since it has solid back stories established for each of its main characters - the geeky Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), redneck ace zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and con-sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who together just seem to be always one step ahead of the boys, thanks to the advantage of gender and some major trust issues, which in any zombie flick you'll know come into play since one can be expected to off a close one in the event that they turn, for self-preservation reasons naturally.Narrated by Columbus, do remember to look for this film from the video store (or your home video library which I will urge you to get) should things outside start to suggest the onset of something ugly. Things like when your wildest fantasy, or Columbus' with that hot chick neighbour from apartment number 406 (Amber Heard, whom all the boys would like to know) start knocking at your door from out of the blue. Contained within this film are 32 rules - OK, so most didn't make it to the final cut but the important ones definitely did - to surviving a zombie onslaught, #1 of which is Cardio (note to self again).Director Ruben Fleischer plays it fast and loose, with plenty of sight gags to boot, especially when reminding us all, like an instructional video, on all the positive examples from Columbus' rulebook, complete with an animated take of the rules themselves. And the relatively short runtime of coming under 90 minutes just makes you beg, yeah beg, for more, which of course is a good thing.The casting here's something to die for as well, with Woody Harrelson heading up the motley crew as the cool as a cucumber zombie executioner with a sensitive heart, continuing his comedic turn in recent years and from his last big budgeted action film 2012. Jeese Eisenberg's relatively new, but plays the formula geek down to a subtle pat. I haven't really seen Emma Stone as a tough-as-nails cookie, so here's one for the road, and Abigail Breslin might just have taken on her first action-movie role aside from her usual dramatic ones.It's been a long time since I experienced that much fun from a film, so I'll go ahead and rate this as highly recommended and a firm contender for one of the top films of this year. Last I heard a sequel's coming up too!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Nice Comedy Mixed with Horror,Zombieland was the last movie that I watched in 2009. I had quite a good time as the movie is mixture of comedy and horror. One of the reasons I like this movie is because I don't like Zombie movies as pure horror. In the past I watched Shaun of the Dead and enjoyed it thoroughly.Zombieland is not trying to tell us how things went wrong and people became Zombies. It is going straight to the point and showing us the ways of survival. The film starts with a good speed with those key ways of avoiding Zombies. (of course Columbus *Jesse Eisenberg* is the main character who is walking us through).Then he meets a born-to-be a zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and they start their journey together. In fact they join their powers and methods and even in your seats you feel much safer. But this doesn't mean they are unbeatable. They meet two sisters on the way and all the way along they are cheated by these two girls. Their aim is to go to a theme park which is supposed to have no zombies around. Our two guys join the girls and they all head up to Florida and they encounter funny situations. Especially Bill Murray part is the best of this movie.All in all it is great fun to watch but also gives you the feeling why on earth this movie was made. For fun and no high expectations go and watch.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
my rating dropped due the house situation,"So it took me 11 years to watch this one, now finally on Netflix. Don't know why it took so long guess that at the time we has an overkill about zombies.Start great an dgory and it stays so until they all arrive at the house of Bill Murray. I did like it because it was full of action and some humor here and there but once at the house it dropped from action towards even some boring moments. And it just takes too long before they move further and the gore comes back in.Overall acting and effects were okay but my rating went down due the house situations. Still worth seeing.Gore 2,5/5

"For A Zombie Film: It Follows ""Shaun"" Roots","As what some critics have stated, it's like ""Shaun of the Dead"" meets ""Superbad"" and I have to say that I agree with them on that point! I thought the 2004 British film with Simon Pegg (the inspiration for this film) was hilarious and scary at the same time, but ""Zombieland"" wouldn't have been worth watching unless you added stars like Woody Harrelson and the underrated Jesse Eisenberg into the mix!As the story goes, the world has been ravaged by flesh-hungry zombies and a small group of survivors must join forces in staying alive and fending off the horrific creatures (albeit in many humorous methods you yourself might think of).I'll admit that some scenes did seem contrived and could have improved on learning more about each character's past exploits, but director Ruben Fleischer managed to come up with a clever idea of blending the typical zombie film with elements of teenage angst. One scene I remember, for example, was when Columbus (Eisenberg) claimed how he scored with this one girl he made up, but the audience would know well he's hopeless on romantic confrontations. This hences the ""Superbad"" reference.As a whole, the movie was pretty much more of a laugh fest than something to fear.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"If you are out of shape in Zland, start adding some Mrs. Dash to your ass, because you are about to be zombie chow.","Swift shot: Zombie flicks and me usually don't get along well, when they are seriously driven, but Zland doesn't take itself too seriously – it is just a sweet ass ride, one that you will want to experience again and again. You'll want to bring different people with you to gauge their reactions, see if they are savvy enough to catch on and find out if they could keep up with the rules of Zombieland. And I know this film is layered, so seeing it two or three times couldn't hurt.Right out of the gate this friggin movie has you by the nuts! From the very beginning, you are introduced to chaos and mayhem. But, fret not, even the meek can survive in Zombieland, if you remember to follow the rules. Rule #1 – Cardio! If you are out of shape in Zland, start adding some Mrs. Dash to your ass, because you are about to be zombie chow.Zombieland has many rules, and if you pay attention you will see them strewn about this amazing film, using that interactive caption technique (you've seen it on a cheesy VW commercial). The rules will be forced down your throat over and over again, but each time is more clever and creative than the next. If you are like me, some douche-bag will be sitting behind you reading them out loud and guffawing as the butter and snot drip out of his mouth, because he is a douche-bag – so it stands to reason that the concession people hocked a luggie in his popcorn. And if they didn't, they should be fired . . . immediately.Just when you think you have this film completely figured out, director Ruben Fleischer throws in a great surprise which I am sworn to keep quiet about on pain of death. Let's just say, you won't see it coming, and while there are quite a few predictable moments in Zombieland, the few times things aren't always as they seem will challenge your experience.Apparently Mike Cera was not in this film, and I really gotta stop getting actors mixed up, it was Jesse (Columbus) Eisenberg, who was in Adventureland earlier this year. I think I can figure out which one he had more fun shooting – at least from what I saw on screen anyway. Woody (Tallahassee) Harrelson found his niche with his redneck rendition of Rambo meets Rowdy Roddy Piper. Tallahassee relishes squashing zombies, thrives at it, and teaches Columbus some new rules . . . and when to break those rules.Delicious, delectable, devious Emma Stone plays Wichita, who is trying to navigate with her own set of rules as she desperately tries to lead her sister, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) out of Zombieland and to the Pacific Playland theme park – or, Disneyland to us r-tards. I think the set they used was straight outta Adventureland or wherever they shot National Lampoon's Vacation . . . Wally World. In fact, it would have been somewhat apropos to use Wally World.You will enjoy Zombieland; as my dad used to say, ""it's an E-Ticket ride!"" My review can't do justice to the experience that is Zombieland – go see it, then run right back out, grab some non-luggie popcorn, and see it again! And if you dare wait to ""rent"" this, please mail your testicles to some Swiss lab, because you got a rotten pair!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

THIS is what passes for a good movie nowadays?,"It is a sad comment on moviegoers in general if this piece of junk has done as well as the trade publications claim. I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this film, other than the fact that it had better production values than most indies. It's not that it's offensive. In fact, it's pretty darned bland. It's just a lot of nothing. (I gave it three stars simply for production values.)To start with, all four of the leads are unlikeable. (And Woody ""leads"" the list.) I never gave a flip what happened to them.Add to that the total lack of originality in the script and shooting. Whole scenes were taken from other films (survival films, zombie films, vampire films, road trip films...take your pick) with predictable results. There's a total absence of originality, quirkiness, or any other aspect that might make this movie memorable.The movie does make a lame attempt to provide some ""guidelines"" or rules for survival, but they are idiotic at best. Furthermore, the lead characters all commit egregious errors time and time again, placing themselves in those wacky comedic situations as their lives are once again endangered. (""Hey, dude, you were surprised once before. Don't you think you ought to be careful this time and look behind the hay bales?"")Finally, I felt so sorry for Bill Murray. I really do hope that he got a great paycheck and that he can afford milk for the rest of the year.Oh, yeah...the CGI is about average for most video games. Are we EVER going to get back to practical FX in movies?Watching this movie lowered my opinion of many of my fellow moviegoers yet again.

Very Very Funny,"I saw zombieland last weekend with a group of friends, and i have to say it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in quite some time. While it does fall under the genre of zombie/horror films it doesn't exactly live up to that description, i would say it was way more into the comedy drama.As one could expect the plot and storyline were not very in depth, and the movie left very little to be had that wasn't in the previews. However, there were a few brief shining moments of an in-depth plot, especially when it came to the past lives of the main characters, before they came to live in zombieland.The acting amongst the characters and their relationships i thought was decent, at least enough so that it got the story going and kept it going, and left no dead spaces in the film. From beginning to end i was involved and entertained by this film. Woody Harrelson was the one who most surprised me, and i was very impressed by. Seeing as the last movie i had seen him in was kingpin, i went into the movie with the feeling he was going to be the weak point, however i felt he brought the film together quiet well. His out of control antics and over the top hatred for zombies mirrored his father-figure roll in the group and his devastating past(thats a spoiler i'll leave out for those who haven't seen the film).Overall i definitely enjoyed this film, and can't wait for the DVD release to see it again. Filled with a lot of moments that made me yell in excitement, Zombieland left no horror film death untouched, and no joke untold.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A unique take on zombie movies,"In 2004 we got one of the greatest zombie films made which was Shaun of the Dead. A film that tried something different that set it apart from the rest of the zombie films. Five years later, Zombieland arrived which fuses, both, comedy and zombies once again. However the film feels fresh enough to make itself stand out.Zombieland is told through the perspective of Columbus as he joins forces with Tallahassee, Wichita and Little Rock as they make their way through a zombie infested America.Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick write a script filled with blood, gore, jokes and heart. Majority of the jokes in the film are executed well and had me laughing throughout the film's entirety. What made this film feel refreshing was its cool visuals and implementation of ""rules"". The ""rules"" alongside Jesse Eisenberg's narration made this film its own thing and kept it aside from being compared to Shaun of the Dead. The narration is interesting and witty which keeps the flow going and the performances of the four leads are terrific.Woody Harrelson is hilarious all the way through and his chemistry with Jesse Eisenberg is a treat to watch. Emma Stone is also very good as well as her on-screen sister, Abigail Breslin, who is also entertaining to watch. There are some great situations involving these four which are guaranteed to bring a laugh from you. Aside from the comedy, there are also some heartfelt scenes with our protagonists that just strengthen the bond between these four and make us root for them.Ruben Fleischer does a great job with the direction considering this to be his first film. I think the story could have been better. There is a situation that takes place and you can easily guess which direction the film was going to take. If only the film had more of an unpredictable feeling through its story then it may have been better.Besides that, Zombieland is a fun zombie flick that can be watched multiple times. The jokes are funny and the group play off each other quite well. The film has great visuals that add to the comedy and create a sense of uniqueness to the genre. Altogether, it's a bloody great time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Creative zombie kills and a talented cast make for great entertainment,"What's most admirable about this most recent zombie-crushing comedy is that it knows exactly what zombies are meant for: killing. Funny, creative and most of all low-budget killing. Rookie director Ruben Fleischer and Columbia Pictures capture that essence in the quick but fun ""Zombieland,"" a post-Zombie infection apocalypse action comedy with a small cast and a whole lot of make-up-covered stunt people.To be frank, there's nothing that will blow you away completely in ""Zombieland,"" it's just all executed very well and the story satisfies despite cutting short its character arch and development. Action-wise, Fleischer I'd dare say one-ups Zak Snyder on the slow-motion technique. He holds little back when delivering some of the more gruesome zombie kills. He'll definitely get some potentially lucrative directorial offers with the success of this film, no doubt.The characters are strong but if anything is lost in the film's barely even an hour and a half run time, it's them. Jesse Eisenberg's neurotic virgin unlikely hero only really learns to grow a pair and Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee has both the conscious and subconscious desire to find a Twinkie. Although writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick allude to some good ideas about how a character would feel being one of few survivors in a barren and zombie- polluted United States, namely a person who was anti-social to begin with, no relationships in the film come out of the oven beyond medium-rare.Truthfully, however, the cast is great. Eisenberg is better than Michael Cera at the dorky hero who manages to get the hot chick and Emma Stone is one of the actually talented young ""hot chicks"" working today. Add Harrelson and Breslin and kudos goes to whoever made the casting decisions. With barely any other characters, a lot falls on them to be real and interesting and as actors, they're all the types who avoid being shallow.What makes ""Zombieland"" likable in the end, however, is creativity. An ending sequence of Harrelson taking out zombies in an amusement park is just good imaginative thinking by Reese and Wernick. Say what you want about zombie-killing scenes, but you don't feel like you're watching something you've already seen. They understand location is everything in these kinds of films (shopping mall in ""Dawn of the Dead"" anyone?). A trip to Hollywood to stay in a famous actor's mansion is another example of outside the box.""Zombieland"" treads the respectable middle ground of delivering quality examples of what it promises and not going too much for glitz and mindless action or the other extreme: shooting way high for excellent character development and drama. The cast and the writers appear capable of that next level, but instead we get more entertainment factor, which is fine considering the entertainment is creative.Zombie genre fans, comedy fans and quirky/creative film fans will all find something to really enjoy out of ""Zombieland,"" one of the better entertainment-driven thrills of the year. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Not too shabby,"Not being a big fan of Zombie movies, I have to admit I had a blast watching Zombieland. It's the kind of movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't get plain goofy on the way either. Somewhat like an American version of Shawn of the Dead (the only other zombie movie I like), it has a good amount of both action and comedy. There is even an intensely sad scene as well, but it is brief enough that it doesn't take much away from the flow of the story while giving a touch of humanity to one of the main characters at the same time. There are a couple of plugs for soda and junk food shoved in there, but overall watching Zombieland is not a bad way to spend an evening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The zombie movie that gives you a Woody!,"From the hilarious opening scenes, in which its teenage loser protagonist Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) informs the viewer about his hard and fast rules for surviving a zombie ravaged Earth, it is evident that Zombieland is going to be a seriously fun ride, and the cool slow-mo credits sequence, depicting a variety of living dead mayhem to the strains of Metallica, only go to reinforce this fact (classic thrash metal and stylish zombie action: they sure know how to get my attention!).The film follows anxiety-ridden nerd Columbus as he attempts to travel to Ohio to find his parents, teaming up with Twinkie-loving, hard-as-nails zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) on the way; but when he meets and falls for pretty con-artist Wichita (gorgeous Emma Stone), who has serious trust issues and a younger sister to protect, Columbus' sense of self-preservation falls by the wayside and he realises that, to be truly happy, risks must be taken and that rules are for wimps.With lots of stylish zombie slaying, bags of visual gags, plenty of slick gore (including CGI blood, unfortunately, but I guess that's just a sign of the times), a quite surreal moment midway featuring a surprise cameo from a well known comedy movie star, and an exciting, action-packed climax set amidst the attractions of a theme park, Zombieland provides solid wall-to-wall entertainment for zombie fans who enjoy a good laugh along with their graphic gut-munching.No doubt people are going to refer to Shaun of the Dead when talking about Zombieland, since both films are zombie comedies featuring a dash of romance; but to compare the two films is pointless—Shaun's humour is so typically British and Zombieland so American in style that they actually bear very little resemblance to each other.Let's just be content with saying that both films rock, but in their own unique way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Brilliant mix of comedy and a true zombie-bloodbath!,"When I first saw the title of Zombieland I was intrigued and excited, because I really like zombie movies. They all seem to be somewhat funny, because Zombies are all just very dumb, walking around, waiting to eat, and look completely and utterly wasted. Very passive, until a car swings around the corner, just to stop, have a guy in cowboy boots step out, and slowly kill them all with a smile on his lip - real bad-ass. Zombieland grabs the exact base of zombie-fans, and puts in a pretty good plot, set in the post-apocalyptic America. During the movie, there were so many hilarious moments, as well as a whole lot of kick-ass zombie-killer moves. I definitely would rate this movie as the best action-comedy of the year, trailed closely by Norwegian ""Dod Sne"" which also has a big humor element mixed into the zombie-infected plot.A must see, if you can handle some ass-whooping and blood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Not Your Garden Variety Zombie Movie!,"My son rented this movie. I remember seeing a clip of Woody Harrelson's performance somewhere and decided to take a gander. This is a a wonderful, tongue in cheek (if you'll excuse the expression), outrageous film with cute performances, lots of charm, and a positive slant that seems impossible under the circumstances. The story is about a young man who is stuck alive as the entire world collapses around him. Ninety-nine percent of the population has become the walking (or running) dead. He has a set of rules for staying alive that he uses without fail and this gets him from one day to another. He meets Woody Harrelson, a true character, who is loaded for bear. They also hook up with a couple of sisters who steal their weapons and their car on several occasions. The relationship among these four is priceless and we really care about them.

Zombies are not scary anymore.,"There was a time when humanity roamed naked on the surface of the Earth. There was a time when every syllable that poured out of a semi-clothed lunatic's mouth became a word of the almighty. And there was a time when zombies were actually scary. But why delve in the past? Now is not that time. Walking nude of the streets has been banned by law, lunatics are stashed in asylums and zombies have become the third funniest things in the world, after glittering vampires and Justin Bieber's puberty talks. Zombieland is based on the latter, not his puberty talks of course, but funny zombies. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a lone man walking through a zombie apocalypse, accompanied by his ever faithful double-barreled shotgun. He has a set of survival rules ('#3 Beware of bathrooms', '#17 Don't be a hero,' '#21 Avoid strip clubs'; to name a few) that he scrupulously follows. They don't do much except keep him alive. He meets another survivor Tallahassee - a brutal, powerful, hulk of a man - who gets sadistic pleasure in kicking zombie arse. Though he is not particularly fond of Columbus, they strike a friendship of sorts, united by a common goal of not ending up as zombie-food. He decides to drive Columbus to Columbus, where the latter wants to find his family. One their way they meet Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), the former a beautiful twenty-year old and the latter a mean little bitch; both con-sisters. Columbus falls in love, things become screwy, zombies get mashed up and everyone goes home happy and satisfied.The movie does not rely too heavily on its plot (when have zombie movies ever?), but scores high on execution. Despite being set in a grim, dystopian atmosphere, comic-timing is one of the highlights of the film. Zombieland doesn't weigh itself down with the bulk of making a zombie- flick; it does quite the contrary. Humans have always maintained a soft spot towards seeing creatures they abhor be ridiculed and maimed. The movie exploits this well, much to its benefit. With witty dialogues and adroitly done action sequences - where zombies are shot in the head, face, gut, groin and otherwise blasted to the moon - it is difficult to suppress laughter every few minutes. Though the humour is inclined towards the slapstick side, it is funny in every sense of the word.The acting is brilliant with Eisenberg proving his mettle as an upcoming actor (he later delivered a superb performance in The Social Network). He befits the lead role with perfection; as a coulrophobic, cynical and klutzy nerd with an awkward gait. His list of life-savers accounts for much of the laughter and as he stumbles through the mayhem, often saving his neck by mere inches, you can't help but marvel at his performance. Woody (the second-best Woody I know) Harrelson as Tallahassee is a hard man with a soft centre. He despises - nay, that would be an understatement - unabashedly and wholeheartedly hates zombies; an idiosyncrasy that is later attributed to the loss of a loved one at their hands. He is to the zombies what Blade was to the vampires. However, making plant manure out of zombies is not his only purpose in life. The thing he wants in the whole wide world is Twinkies, and whoever comes between him and a Twinkie is dead meat.The action and special effects are realistic, to say the least. The zombies look and do a convincing job of being blood-thirsty freaks and certain moments, when they materialize out of nowhere manage to make the viewers jump in their seats. The zombie-slaying, gore and erupting bodies all make it visually appealing. And the fact that the undead are not their usual snail-paced selves, but rather surprisingly agile for their reputation makes the chases and fight sequences even more exciting.The middle, however, suffers from a drag. The director (Ruben Fleischer) tries making the movie into a rom-com-zom; with emphasis on the rom. It seems uncalled for, because the relentless blood-baths suited my taste better. And just when I was about the chop another star from the movie, much like a zombie's head, in came Bill Murray; a man whose mere presence on the screen evokes ebullience. His splendid cameo saved the star and also proved that some actors never become too old to make one laugh.You have to feel for the unfortunate, undead bastards. From being one of the most feared and disgusting fictitious creatures, they have been made into a juvenile joke. They are still as ugly as ever, with skin peeling off, rotting brains and organs ready to fall, yet they no longer inspire fear. They are also stupid as a donkey's testicles, but you can't blame them. Their brains are cross-wired and it's hardly their fault that they cannot differentiate between a dildo and a shotgun. Tallahassee repeatedly bludgeons through their hordes. They get shot, crushed, squashed, run over, whacked, decapitated and otherwise beaten up so much that you actually feel sympathetic towards them. You can empathize, because in a way they are just hungry creatures and humans are their food.If you agree with the above lines, I think you should consider getting a check-up done.Zombies are bad. They deserve to die. Zombieland does just that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
great fun entertainment,"I saw the midnight showing of this, and I have to say it was worth it because this movie was quite good..I wouldn't call it the best zombie movie ever, it is a comedy after all, not a serious zombie movie.But it had everything a zombie killing, zombie gore fest should..I think it should satisfy any zombie movie fan like I said, this is a comedy, there are only a few serious parts, but even then they don't last long before the moment becomes funny again as for the story/plot...uh.. I didn't really care about that..the movie took no time to explain WHY the zombie apocalypse happened, it just did and I think that is just fine, especially for this type of zombie film..and as for the rest of the storyline/plot.. it was fine I guess. Everything flowed well, I didn't think there were any stupid, useless scenes in the movie or anything like that. Its a movie about zombie killing what more do you want? the acting? I think each actor played their character quite well, especially Woody Harrelson..he was the best.So yeah, its a very entertaining film...I know its easy to compare to Shaun of the Dead, but to say which one is better? In my opinion they both stand on their own..I don't think its necessary to compare the two to one another too much.So yeah, GO SEE IT!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Extremely funny...,"""Zombieland"" is a Comedy - Horror movie in which there is a zombie apocalypse and humans try their best to survive from zombies. There are some very funny scenes in this movie that will make you laugh a lot. The great interpretations of Woody Harrelson who played as Tallahassee, Jesse Eisenberg who played as Columbus and Emma Stone who played as Wichita made this movie even better.I liked ""Zombieland"" because it's a movie that combines very well comedy with horror, something that is very difficult to happen and many other movies failed to do it. The direction which was made by Ruben Fleischer it's very good and it's obvious the good work he has done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

ZombieCrap,"**Spoiler Alert** Over the past few years as Gen-X and Gen-Y tastes have begun to skew ratings on sites like RottenTomatoes and all other film review sites and I occasionally get suckered into going to see a film like Zombieland.I think some snarky GenXers spent about 5 minutes over their soy lattes coming up with the concept for this film and then had a 5th grade class spend one period writing the script. It was a piece of utter trash with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. When there is the wonderful Shaun of the Dead out there, why would anyone even try to spoof the genre when it was done so expertly already.Everything that was terrific about Shawn of the Dead is missing from Zombieland. Every single gag in Zombieland has been done before, done better, and to much better effect. The pop-up list was funny once, or twice - but was tedious and stupid as it went on and on throughout the film. The geeky kid as the lead has zero presence and is a blank as an actor. Woody Harrelson merely reprised his role from that bad Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. The product-placement Hostess Twinkie thing was pathetic. The female actresses were pretty terrible, but with a script like that what chance did they have? The gore of the Zombies wasn't even well done, and the filmmakers couldn't seem to decide between slow dumb zombies and fast mean cunning Zombies (the former is always better and scarier).What a nothing of film. It wasn't worth even a dollar as a rental. Garbage. And a true testament to how far standards of taste have fallen as Gen-X and Gen-Y vacuousness pervades the zeitgeist of the art world.Lastly, the Bill Murray cameo was an utter waste. By showing the audience the Warhol painting of Murray prior to seeing him they TOOK AWAY HIS INTRODUCTION. Morons! These filmmakers obviously know nothing about storytelling. If there had been cameo after cameo or the Bill Murray subplot had been more of a central focus of the story this film would have had a chance, but he was just like the creamy filling in a Twinkie - totally without nutrient value.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fun Stupid Movie,"This movie is really stupid but it is also really really fun. This movie is totally for guys but the theater I was in was almost sold out it looked like and everyone seemed to have a good time, with the guys having a much better time than the s. There is a lot of violence and some pretty stupid gags (stupid as in just stupid and silly not stupid as in not worthwhile) that had everybody laughing a lot. Woody Harrelson is real funny in his part in this movie. All the creative ways they ended up killing all the different zombies were really funny too. Not much more to say about this but this is a really funny take on zombie movies but it does get a bit repetitive and boring in the humor it uses. Worth seeing for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"The best of it is killer, very undead, wry, and gross.","Zombieland (2009)What a funny romp. Zombie movies are so mainstream now, this was inevitable, an end of the world zombie comedy. And it's pulled off with enough sassy, unexpected twists (and one spectacular guest star) you have to love it.I'm not sure why they had to include as much filler as they did, not just developing the romance (of course) but creating some dead time (very punny, I know). The movie could have been a flawless, fast, compact classic. If you can just bear with the doldrums, you'll see what a perfect pitch the rest of it has. Kudos to Woody Harrelson, as usual, and to his buddy, Jesse Eisenberg.Aimed at an adolescent crowd, and at those of us who haven't outgrown our adolescence, and so comically bloody, Zombieland will repulse some of you. Think of it as low farce, all makeup and clowning around.It is what it is, and as such is what it is very convincingly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fun horror-comedy,"When I first saw Zombieland I was a little underwhelmed but this is a film that pays off with repeat viewings. Following a zombie holocaust a disparate small band of survivors trek across America.A superb cast bring the witty script to life. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as the geeky hero but the acting honours go to Woody Harrelson as the slightly deranged Tallahasse, a man obsessed by Twinkies. Add in support from two of the best young actresses in Hollywood, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin and you really can't go wrong.

Just read the bottom...I don't believe in letting you read my summary and determine whether you think the movie will be good or not. Read my review.,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I told my dad it would go down as an American classic but he highly disagrees but you can still tell he loved the movie. I think all of the actors were picked accurately to play their roles (why did you casting directors think of Megan Fox for Wichita?).Bill Murray will probably get the award for Best Cameo in history (there is no such award but if there was, he should win it.)Jesse Eisenberg was so perfect for Columbus! He has that scardey-cat essence in him.Abigail Breslin, I bet enjoyed making this film (as any 13-year-old kid would), and she was superb in it.Emma Stone was great and I wouldn't have been able to imagine any one else for Wichita and she did really good! Maybe one of the best performances of the movie (besides Woody Harrelson).Woody Harrelson was truly the best of this movie. He was the funniest (e.g. ""You weren't exactly stormin' the trenches before I came in"") person in it and the awesomest!GO ZOMBIELAND!p.s. see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A comedy well worth a couple viewings,"George A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy has left quite an impact on today's culture. Although the actual phenomena has never been a fact, the idea that an outbreak of whatever causes this possible danger could happen, is reason enough to be prepared (just in case). Of course, the concept sounds preposterous but anything is possible nowadays. Technology and science are our greatest weapons no matter how much they excel our lives. With that, multiple zombie genre films have been created decade after decade portraying zombies in new and outrageous ways. However, has anyone every jotted down the key things in every film that tends to get zombies their meal of the day? Well unless you watched them all, the best way would probably be seeing this movie here. Remember that Nickelodeon TV Show Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide (2004–2007), which gave all the tips and sparknote clues on how to survive middle to highschool? Well this is basically the same thing in feature length movie form instead with zombies.Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)) as their first theatrical screenplay and headed by Ruben Fleischer in his first directorial debut, this collaborative trio managed to put together a solid horror comedy that is fun in a number of ways. The story follows a group of random individuals living among a planet of unlimited zombies, looking to get to their own specific destination. Audiences are first introduced to Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a scrawny geek who has trouble socializing with people and hasn't had one girlfriend. Along his travels he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a funky human swiss-army knife that has a hankering for Twinkies. Then comes Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), a pair of scam-artists that are convincingly good at their craft. The best thing about Reese and Wernick's writing is that majority of the story focuses around the characters and that's important when it comes to development and there's plenty of it too.The second best point made are the guidelines Columbus refers to the audience about key thoughts one should have in mind if being chased by zombies. If this were real, this would probably be the briefing video on how to pull through. The characters themselves do have personalities of their own but the most memorable character of the bunch was Tallahassee. Harrelson looked like he was having a blast in his role and definitely took advantage of every moment that required some amount spontaneity. The only part of the writing that doesn't work in this film's favor is the comedy. It is funny a number of times but only because of how stupid goofy it gets. By this, it means that the world these characters live in don't take the situation very seriously. For example, ""Zombie Kill of the Week"",...who's even keeping tabs? It's funny but ridiculously nonsensical. One of the rules mentioned is to ""Enjoy the little things"", which is fine for some cases but it does seem a little overblown if people are having contests on the best kill on a weekly basis.Other than that however, the special/practical effects do look convincing for the budget as well as the gore. There's plenty of blood, gunshots, wisecracks and zombies. Perhaps the only other thing that some gore hounds may not like is that there are not enough victims in the movie. Yes, there are people who die in the movie but a lot of the story revolves around the main characters mentioned prior. This may leave some viewers who enjoy the gore a little starved of their usual intake. The poster is also a little deceiving because nobody uses a chainsaw in this movie. But there are things that make up for that (kind of). It's not abundant but there are a couple of special cast appearances throughout the movie. There's one of Amber Heard as one of Columbus' neighbors and an extended cameo of Bill Murray playing himself. It's interesting though to hear Murray reference a few of his own works just to break the fourth wall.The last two components to look at are the cinematography and music. Michael Bonvillain was the director of photography for this project. Although there are areas that look like a lot of other zombie films, Bonvillain does get some good shots of landscape to give the setting some scope. Bonvillain has proved his talent before in Tom Berenger's Sniper 3 (2004). Instead of bright colors here, he has a lot of gray colors to emphasize the lack of life, which also helps the colorful characters stand out. As for music, rock enthusiast David Sardy composed the film score. Prior to this, Sardy only had composed music for 21 (2008) but would later do bigger projects like Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012). All in which Sardy uses a familiar sound of hard rock guitars to indicate his unique score signature. Here is no different; Sardy mixes aggressive guitar chords with organic orchestra compositions to create one interesting score. At times it sounds like it belongs to the horror genre with string stings, other times it's comedy with banjo like cues and other times drama using lengthy chord progressions. It's a weird score for a weird movie. Case in point.Other than not having enough victims on screen and some absurdly dumb humor (at times), this horror comedy is a fun watch and not just for one time. The characters are written with distinguished funny personalities, the violence is abundant, the camera-work is competent and the film score is wildly experimental but surprisingly appropriate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Woody Harrelson was born on July 23rd, 1961","We are now experiencing a very zombie-loving world these days in film and television. This is probably the biggest comeback, that the sub-genre of the zombie film/tv show has ever had. The idea of the zombie was different back in the 1930s-1950s. In those days, for better or worse, it usually took a voodoo approach in the plot or subbed as a creature, more resembling a mummy. It wasn't until the late 1960s, that George Romero revolutionized the sub-genre, with his more modern interpretation, in his ""Living Dead"" series of films. That interpretation is the same one, that is seen in zombie films, even today. Romero would create the first comeback of the sub-genre by changing the entire concept of it all. But, once the 1990s rolled around and even into the early 21st century, the sub-genre had slowed to a halt. But, after a small boost from the Danny Boyle directed, 28 Days Later (2002), the real second coming of the zombie sub-genre, began with the coming of the AMC Network, television show, The Walking Dead (2010 - present). However, a year before that, director Ruben Fleischer gave us a refreshing take on the zombie mythology, by integrating all the gore and horror of the zombie experience, with satire and comedy.This film gives to film buffs, as well as all the paranoid people out there, a glimpse into our possible future, as the art of survival and zombie killing is explored in detail. It is this film, that helped to usher in the post-apocalyptic discussion of what it would be like if we lived among the zombies. It also gives some laughs. Four survivors, all unique in their own ways, run into each other on the open road and band together, sort of, to start new lives and survive. One is young man, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), who takes things very seriously and even has a guide book on certain steps on how to stay alive. Another man, Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who is middle-aged and has a Twinkie-infatuation, takes no crap from any person or zombie. The other two survivors are a beautiful woman, Wichita (Emma Stone) and her younger teen-age sister, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). After a few growing pains with each other, mostly revolving around trust, they eventually make it to California and set up shop in a mansion owned by a famous movie star.This film is so much fun to watch, is humorous and quite entertaining. It feeds on certain paranoid emotions/beliefs, that many people think could happen in real life. It is a dark comedy and has a cute romantic feeling imbedded in its main plot. It also has all the frights of any modern zombie film. The entertainment begins right off the bat, with one of the coolest opening credits, overtop Metallica's energized metal-rock tune, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". You also have to prepare yourself for the cameo of the decade, with a surprise visit from a famous movie star. Of course, you should know who that movie star is. If you don't know who it is, that means you have never seen Zombieland (2009), before and for shame to you, because you are missing out. That's all I am saying about that.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Surprisingly good movie.,"As much as I expected this movie to be pure junk, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is actually a good movie. This movie presents an offbeat story that is part science-fiction, part action and all comedy. Woody Harrelson gives a strong and amusing performance as a quirky character who is both a hero and buffoon and clearly dominates the story. The movie has lots of action, good continuity, and, unlike most Hollywood products today, is not overly long. The director wastes no footage as he put together what has to be one of the best edited movies maybe in decades. Gone are all the extraneous and superfluous filler that ruins most movies. Here the story is taut, simple, watchable and entertaining. The zombies are reduced to mere animated objects who can be abused and eliminated without a second thought and here lies the rub. For the ghouls that lay in wait for unsuspecting humans were once human themselves and what happened to them was not their fault but the result of something much larger and more profound. Yet the movie skirts the tragic dimensions of the catastrophe that has befallen the world and instead reduces the disaster to the level of a goofy comedy ... and it works. As long as the movie is accepted for what is is, parody, then it is entertaining. But if you are expecting a hand wringing moralistic tale of epic proportions then you may be disappointed, even while you laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

There is so much fun in the intro itself that most movies today don't have. The soundtrack is excellent and adds an extra dimension of entertainment to the film.As the story progresses, the film becomes more and more fun and hilarious, with Bill Murray's cameo adding some more fun.A dark comedy with a lot of violence and fun characters that is definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Gory fun!,"Rating-7/10Zombieland is a horror comedy which combines all the elements you expect to create a movie with true humour and gore. With a good cast also bringing along the extra fire power, this film tries and succeeds in never quite being too serious but still being very interesting in the story and the actual heart which has been put in to producing this piece. Overall I found this safely a good film and here below is why so.The story is fun but also dark but never dark enough to horrify but never light enough to not feel grossed out. It has it's best moments mostly in the middle with some great things going on and some great characters just thinking up crazy things to do in a crazy world. I felt the comedy is slightly lacking in way of crying out loud but it still manages to throw in a few chuckles and some good jokes here and there.Jesse Eisenberg is good as Columbus but it does feel with his characters a bit, done it all before and a personality that can kind of annoy. Woody Harrelson for me was the star of this movie, such a crazy and wild performance from which the majority of jokes derive from. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin contribute well all the way through and although never being so funny, they do well in the more sweet moments in the movie.It is directed well and the writing is on the same level, both seem to mix together well and there is a lot of smart kind of things that go on within in the screenplay. For me the best behind the camera thing is well, behind the camera. The cinematography is wonderful and done very well all the way through the movie, just very nice to look at especially in the more thrilling scenes.The main problems are the slow story and the lack of big jokes as I've already mentioned. The plot never quite gets going too much and you never feel a great amount of adrenaline or nerves for the characters that so often can link you with a films story. The jokes don't stream like rain but when they do come there OK, but not good and so when you compare the jokes to the overall fun of the entire plot, they don't so much match up very well.If you like your horror you should absolutely love this but if you want funny kind of deaths then you may not necessarily like this. If your looking for a great comedy then this isn't actually GREAT but it is good, it has a lot of funny times and actually some quite memorable moments but still isn't pure gold to be fair. If you like your blood and guts then this is for you, very graphic indeed and in some scenes you just think ""would that really happen in real life"", (although they are in a zombie world).Overall I give this a 7/10 and found it to be Safely a Sound movie which although never becoming Very Good, is definitely more than just OK. I feel with this that it tries very hard to be a classic movie and too much so and although not being far off, still isn't one I'd lock away to watch in a thousand years. Watch and enjoy it and you should to be fair very much have a good time, even if you hate violence and gore you should still have a great adventure in a zombie infested land.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Boring Deception,"After an outbreak with a deadly virus, the United States of America becomes the United States of Zombieland with the whole population transformed into flesh eater zombies. The outcast teenager Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) follows the rules he has created to survive in a country infested of zombies. While going to Columbus, where his parents lived, he hitches a ride with the tough Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) that loves Twinkle and slaying zombies, and they travel together. Along their journey, they meet the tricksters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) that are heading to an amusement park nearby Los Angeles. The sisters only trust on each other and they deceive the guys in different opportunities. But in the end, they learn that they should stay together to survive in Zombieland.The overrated ""Zombieland"" is a boring deception, with a weak humor and non-scary zombie scenes. The greatest surprise is the IMDb Rating of 8.0/10 with 40,436 votes and reviews telling that this flick is great or will become a ""cult classic"". Actually, the story is silly; the narrative of Columbus is tedious; and the cameo of Bill Murray is totally dull.

Quest for a TWINKIE,"You know it is really great to go to a movie and truly have fun and feel you got your money's worth. ZOMBIELAND was awesome !!! Killing zombies is cool, really cool when it is done by a perfect collection of social misfits. Do not show up late for this movie or you will miss out on one of the coolest intro I have seen in a long time. Lots of cool clips of zombies in slow motion while letters from credits fall out of the way, simple yet brilliant.I don't know what it is about apocalyptic movies where only a few humans are left standingI mean sure it would be difficult and dangerous but for some reason the idea of having the world as your playground seems almost like a dream. But I love the concept that 4 of the survivors are on extremes of the social pool.You of course have you gun-toting crazy redneck, probably the only part of society that learns how to use a gun by the time they can walk, played perfectly by Woody Harrelson. The NERD, yep that's right there is always going to be a nerd population that uses its wits and logic to survive, and this one is a sarcastic yet polite person who has developed rules and methods to survive. Jesse Eisenberg pretty much continued the same Adventure land character into the same park just full of zombies. Then you have your con-artist hot girl Emma Stone who has one of the most gorgeous set of eyes I have ever seen, ohh and the rest of her is hot too. And of course there is always the young kid that just finds a way to survive; Abigail Breslin does a great job of delivering in a minimal role.The writers (Rhett Reese + Paul Wernick) and director Ruben Fleischer are young by movie industry standards, did not follow a formula and HIT this movie out of the park. They did not need to rely on stupid formula scare tricks; like ""quick zoom camera"" or ""loud noise before the attack"" or the one I hate the most the ""turn around look behind you"".And the movie has Bill Murray in itwhat's not to love there! The only complaint I have about this movie is it should have been longer, to show more zombie whacking or running in to a few more survivors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The best thing for zombies since Shaun of the Dead.,"I honestly cannot compare the two.I am cynical in nature, and whenever I see an abrupt death in a movie, I tend to chuckle..like in Blades of Glory, when they showed the girl's head getting cut off, I was the only one in the whole theater that found that funny, and it showed because I couldn't hear anyone else laughing.I've always found horror movies in general to be funny, because they're usually terrible.I mean consider House of the Dead, probably one of the worst films ever made,I I couldn't help but laugh through the entire thing, just at how terrible it was. When I saw House of the Dead in theaters, I looked around at the people around me and saw the disgust on their faces, and I noticed them waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It just didn't, and I was the only one laughing out loud throughout. Yes, I realized I wasted $20 in going to see it, but you couldn't try to make a crappier film, and there were zombies...so you might as well enjoy it.I even find some humor in good zombie movies such as George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and subsequent sequels, or 28 days later, But these movies only had some moments that were meant to be funny. They're still very serious in intent.I wish I could have seen it in theaters, but I missed any opportunity I had. I didn't even know about it until it was on HBO, but when I saw Shaun of the Dead a few years back, I was convinced there would never be a more clever, or hilarious horror comedy featuring Zombies. I would find myself watching it every time I saw it come up in the listings. It was a good zombie movie with the intent of being funny, and not some Hollywood writers' or directors' attempt at trying to be too creative,or too serious, which typically gives you something like House of the Dead.I scoffed at Zombieland when I first saw the trailer, because I was certain that it could not top my favorite zombie movie of all time, and I was hesitant to go see it. I had a suspicion that it was just an attempt at trying to take something away from Shaun of the Dead and reap the profits from an unoriginal idea.However, all it took was 20 minutes in to realize that I just might be wrong.I have never been so surprised in a theater in my life. Usually when I've made up my mind about a movie, even before I see it, my suspicions ring true, and my opinion doesn't change much if at all, but this time it did.Zombieland is simply hysterical.As I mentioned before, you cannot compare the two. Shaun of the Dead is like biting into a Golden Delicious apple, and Zombieland is like biting into a Red delicious apple, you might prefer one over the other, but they're both juicy, and offer you the same nutrients.If you like Shaun of the Dead, you will like this too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Excellent movie, not without its flaws","A little late to the party, but I must say, I enjoyed it! The obvious chemistry between the main heroes, the funny script and free flowing story, which in my opinion is one of the best in the ""walking dead"" genre, greatly contributes to the whole ""great show"" concept.Even secondary actors didn't disappoint.That being said, this movie is far from being a masterpiece, but it had no intention of being one.Absolutely advised for all!Special mention goes to Amber Heard. I can't say I knew who she was back than, but she fell right into her role in this one. Absolutely her best performance to date... maybe she was just being herself and forgot the cameras were rolling. Can't say for sure. Never the less she was excellent blood sucking zombie!

A wholesome entertaining zombie comedy movie.,"Zombieland is a zombie comedy movie directed by Ruben Fleischer and stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.The movie is based on the life of four strangers who had survived zombie Apocalypse and embarks together on their different journeys.I honestly enjoyed the movie to a great extent as the movie is funny and hilarious throughout and will keep you entertained. The only drawback which I felt was that the movie was very much straight and plot was too predictable.The screenplay of the movie is fast paced and will keep you engaged throughout the movie. The movie is full of hilarious scenes with laughter in regular gaps. The best part of the movie that it doesn't wastes much time on either plot development or character introduction and comes straight to the point.Acting is amazing and all the characters have given their best but for me it was Woody Harrelson who steals the show he was so perfect it seems that the role was tailor made for him. Jesse Eisenberg, Emma watson and Abigail Breslin was also equally impressive.The climax of the movie is predictable but doesn't disappointments and gives a perfect ending. If you are a fan of Zombie comedy movie then this is the movie for you. A must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""In Mexico, you know what they call Twinkies? Los submarinos.""","I was lucky enough to see this in the theater a second time due to a double feature release before the new one Zombieland:Double Tap. So much fun and great memorable dialogue! Ruben Fleischer created such an awesome zombie flick, hilarious and lots of replay value, which is important!

This is the best zombie movie,Zombieland beats Shaun of the dead in my opinion all the time. This has been my favorite zombie movie I've seen so far and I have loved it even though I'm pretty sure the whole point of it was finding a Twinkie. It was still a great movie. And I go back to the point why are all the best zombie movies comedies like this having a reason to be so good but it was I highly recommend watching it. It being the best zombie movie in my opinion sure there's probably a good series zombie movie out there but that's what makes this one so good it is not serious. So I would recommend a nine out of 10. Thank you for reading.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
horror? Not really. Funny? Definitely.,"Summarized in one sentence, Zombieland is a Dawn of the Dead theme park in Disneyland, if there can be one. Everything in a zombie movie before appear in this movie as a farce, and don't even expect it to be horrifying other than some bloody scenes.The fact that Zombieland is good lies within its correct and precise marketing, that it's for those who love a fun, funny movie which doesn't disappoint. It's solid in technical perspectives, performances(Abigail Breslin is brilliant) and every scene flows with senses of humor. From beginning to the end, it never stops homaging to famous movies and scenes, yet it's not as serious and morally-concerned like Shaun of the Dead. By the way I strongly suggest you don't compare these two movies because they have totally different emphasis.I won't talk about any single scene in the movie to spoil the fun, just expect to laugh a lot in the theater.8/10. Satisfying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Close, But Not Perfect","Zombieland is a film that I would rate a solid 7 out of 10. While it certainly has its strengths, there were several factors that prevented me from giving it a perfect score of 10 out of 10.Let's start with the aspects of the film that I enjoyed:1- The beautiful friendship between Woody Harrelson (Tallahassee) and Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) was a standout for me. Their bond was unbreakable, and I loved how their innocence and simplicity shone through their tough and aggressive exteriors.2- Of course, the presence of the amazing and beloved actor Woody Harrelson (Tallahassee) was one of the highlights of the film. As a big fan of his work, I was thrilled to see him deliver a fantastic performance and portray such a remarkable character.Now, let's discuss the elements of the film that didn't quite resonate with me:1- Lack of sufficient depth: The film didn't explore the survival aspect enough for me to feel the true threat of the zombies. Instead, it felt like they were merely superficial decorations to fit the film's title.2- Uninteresting characters, except for Woody Harrelson (Tallahassee): The other characters failed to captivate my interest. They lacked bravery and comedic sensibility, with the exception of Woody Harrelson's character. I found very few scenes or situations that elicited laughter, and there was a lack of adrenaline-pumping moments. Even the supposedly thrilling scenes felt exaggerated and predictable, failing to impress anyone except perhaps younger audiences. Considering that the film is intended for adult viewers, this was disappointing. I wouldn't go as far as saying that the film was boring, but it fell short of my expectations as it primarily relied on the intriguing concept of a zombie apocalypse and the end of the world.3- The constant betrayal and exploitation from Emma Stone's character, Wichita, and Abigail Breslin's character, Little Rock, towards the kind-hearted Woody Harrelson (Tallahassee) and Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus), infuriated me. It was disheartening to witness the ingratitude and manipulative behavior of these characters, who didn't deserve the sacrifices made by our heroes.Despite these criticisms, Zombieland is still an enjoyable film with its fair share of strengths, including the touching friendship between the main characters and the brilliant performance of Woody Harrelson. While it may not be a perfect 10 out of 10 for me, it is definitely worth watching for fans of the zombie genre and those who appreciate a solid blend of humor and action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A fun ride for a zombie movie,"Out of all the zombie movies I've watched, Zombieland presents an easy going and fun ride for a story compared to its counterparts. This movie can nicely tell a zombie-post-apocalyptic world and retains many traits of a standard zombie movie without having to be overly stupid or gruesome or horrifying. I like how the movie keeps the focus about the survivors on a journey and banding together. The sharply contradictory characters are also deeply developed with each of the characters having a specific flashback sequences to base their behaviors on. The acting overall is a good one. With Woody Harrelson as the senior of the four main cast, I see his role not only extends as in the movie itself, but also as a mentor to the then newcomers of Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Terrific New Take On The Zombie-Apocalypse,"Every so often a movie comes along that creates a new take on a genre or story. If we're lucky, it'll be well acted and funny too.This film checks those boxes...hard!The ""rules for the apocalypse"" as described by Jesse Eisenberg's character (Columbus) are a hilarious actionable series of thoughts that zombie flick viewers have thought for years: don't go in there! Use the gun! Run away! The writer director acknowledged that the Simon Pegg zombie film,
Shaun Of The Dead, was one of his favorite films. The influences are visible, and funny.Consider that every actor has been nominated or won (2xEmma Stone) an Oscar and a tongue in cheek script and you have gold.Columbus, the ""deer in the headlights hapless hero"", Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) the walking killing machine with a smartass one liner for everything, Wichita (Stone) the jaded con artist surviving by looking out for number one, and Abigail Breslin as Little Rock, the naive innocent looking for guidance; they're all a new twist in horror film character tropes.Other tropes are exploded throughout, and there's gross out slapstick (zombie kill of the week) as well as character humor built off of the well fleshed out characters.Highly recommend and I'm not even a zombie flick fan.The sequel, not as good as the original, is still worth watching for a couple of hilarious meta scenes, and Zoey Deutch in a terrific performance that made Jesse Eisenberg frequently break during filming.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Must See for Zombie Lovers,"Zombieland was just one awesome addition to the zombie genre. Not only was it funny, it made sense.Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is the main character and he narrates throughout the movie. The most important part of his narration is the rules for surviving Zombieland. They are some very simple rules that are all too logical. You know, the logic you NEVER find in a scary movie.As a ""The Walking Dead"" fan and fan of the zombie genre overall I loved this movie. Eisenberg was great and Harrelson was even better in his post-apocalyptic quest for Twinkies. I would rate it even higher except I'm not a fan of Emma Stone in anything. Still, this is a must see for the zombie lover.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It's alright...,"Zombieland's main strength is that it toys with something that at least I haven't seen in a zombie movie before - the morbid fantasy of running around amidst an apocalyptic world, killing zombies. Surely many others were satisfied by this in and of itself, I know I certainly was. Despite this, it's still ultimately forgettable.The worst part was the obvious and painfully bad Michael Cera impersonation that Jesse Eisenberg does; I can't help but wonder why they didn't just get Michael Cera himself, it doesn't seem like he's got a whole lot going on right now. His rules too, got to be very irritating. Yeah, you have a list of rules, cool... we already saw them. Bringing them up again and again (presumably for comedic effect) just got annoying after a while.The girls were... eh. Nothing good, nothing bad. Emma Stone was hot, and that's about it.Woody Harrelson is unsurprisingly the movie's saving grace. He's got great one liners, and his charisma alone carried the movie for me. Bill Murray's cameo was cool too, though slightly over-hyped.I liked the music a lot, and the pacing was flawless; I didn't like most of the characters, and there were a lot of dumb jokes, but I was never bored. A lot of people complained about the running zombies, which have become kind of popular as of late, but that's really not THAT big of a deal. Overall it's a passable blend of action and comedy, though it doesn't hold a candle to Shaun of the Dead in my mind. I can honestly say that I did like it, but it's too flawed to be truly memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Really really bad and silly,"As almost every other zombie film. Very exaggerated and very silly, lame, childishly and poorly made. One of the worst films ive ever seen!I don't understand for a second how this film can have the extremely high rating on imdb, which clearly, in my opinion, is very overrated. Why did all the big names say yes to be a part of the horrible film? Very lame and boring acting. Its totally a B-film! No doubt about it!However, the only good thing in this movie is the soundtrack.Horrible and completely pointless plot and storyline. Nonsense. And horrible manuscript.A violent, overrated packed film trying to get as much guns, blood and weapons as possible. Which just makes it so bad.I guess 10 years olds would love this film.Rarely funny.

Expected a C but movie is a A!,"Check out my comment about Zombieland. http://jgz408.livejournal.com/864.html My pick for best flick of 2009 is Zombieland. I saw the movie at the movie theaters on opening night. What I liked about it was the way that they took the elements of a popular genre, such as gore, darkness, and survival and seamlessly, worked it into a comedy. The hardcore zombie fans will appreciate the irony throughout this movie. I expected to watch a C grade movie but its a definite A!I didn't know that Woody could be such a funny character.The movie was fun to watch and I'm glad that they didn't try to make it some PG-13 movie and loose all the greatness off seeing piles and piles of zombies be killed.

Non stop laughs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Funny But Doesn't Always Make Sense,"I love this movie. I've seen it a couple times already, and I was in the mood for it again. Maybe it's just because I watched it alone, but this time around it wasn't nearly as good as the other times.Zombieland is a zombie apocalypse comedy that follows four people on their journey to an amusement park which they have heard is zombie- free. For the most part it's done well, and while it was clear that some parts that didn't make sense were done for comedy, other parts just didn't. They weren't huge things typically, but I noticed them and they bugged me. Some of the timing was off, as well as reasons for doing something were a little unclear or completely nonexistent at times. Some of these decisions work out in the long run, but in the moment there isn't enough reason to make said decision.The characters are developed fairly well. They were goofy and likable, and realistic enough. As far as comedies go at least.Overall Zombieland is a solid comedy. Some parts don't make a whole lot of sense, but the plot is done well and the characters are good. My recommendation: watch this with one or more of your friends. A movie like this is meant to be watched with other people. And in the end I would recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An excellent first half-hour loses steam in the middle section.,"Zombieland is a movie with a great start that ultimately runs out of gas thanks to a plodding middle section, disappointing as it had the potential to be so much more than just another zombie movie lost amid a sea of recent other werewolf, vampire and zombie movies.Disclosure: Zombie fans be warned, Zombieland includes running zombies! If this lack of true to label zombie purity scares or frightens you perhaps you should avoid this one. Although the fact is that as zombies are fictional creations they can do whatever the f*ck a writer or director tells them to do, and perhaps you should do something they can't and get a life.Once again it seems the continental US is overrun by zombies, created by a mutation of mad cow disease - no doubt spread through slutty young Hollywood starlets banging rock stars and athletes who then passed it onto every groupie in the nation. That'd be the quickest way to do it I reckon, so any new virus that comes out from now on should be given a girl's name, like cyclones.I hereby dub the Zombieland plague - the Hilton Virus.Examples of the Hilton Virus are shown through the opening credits, three or four of the most memorable minutes in a credit sequence that I can remember. There is just something about slo-mo zombies in full flight tracking down a helpless victim, it's also why we watch with morbid fascination as the Lion catches the Gazelle, we don't want to see the kill itself, but we feel compelled to watch nonetheless.Circle of Life.The survivors of the initial onslaught are few and far between, and during the course of the movie they are referred to by their destination, therefore early on we meet Columbus, who acts as both star and narrator through the film.Columbus continues on as a survivor by adhering to a series of hard and fast rules that he does not allow himself to stray from. An example is the ""Double Tap"" rule. Once a zombie has been shot there is always the chance that they are merely slowed down, and might still rise up again to pose a threat, a second bullet in the head does the trick and makes sure that this uncertainty doesn't come back to bite you, (literally).A pretty nifty idea is that the rules appear on screen as described, and later on as they are repeatedly utilized, acting as an ongoing reminder that they generally work.Columbus is cautious, methodical and chatty in a nervous and fidgety way, something that the next guy he runs into, Tallahassee, is not. Tallahassee is many things, including hard to spell. He is a redneck with a cowboy hat, big boots and a fondness for big cars, he shoots first and doesn't ask questions later. He is reckless, vicious and hair triggered, and suspicious and untrusting of strangers.He also likes a sugary-bun sort of snack called Twinkies, so once Tallahassee decides to allow Columbus to tag along for a while, they go on an impromptu Twinkie hunt.I feel I need to point out right now that this runs a ratio of around 70/30 comedy to gore/violence, meaning that it's far more a comedy than a straight action or traditional ""Zombie"" film like Dawn of the Dead etc. The gore is often used for comic effect or simply to illustrate a point.Back to the Twinkie Hunt, Columbus and Tallahassee end up at a supermarket where they encounter two young girls, say 18 and 13 named Wichita and Little Rock. One appears infected, and after a humorous exchange it comes to light that our heroes have just been conned out of their arms and vehicle.After a short time on foot they run into the girls once more, this time they decide to team up for a while as the girls describe the destination, a Disney style park called Pacific Playground in California rumoured to be the only zombie-free pocket on the West Coast.The remainder of the movie follows them on their journey.It is worth noting that in a movie in which there are really only four main characters (and one cameo that Woody obviously teed up), they fortunately managed to cast them with likable, credible actors, none of which have the presence to carry a film by themselves, but as a group they do a creditable job.Jesse Eisenberg / The guy from Adventureland (He likes ""Land"" films I guess) low key and self deprecating, a good counterpoint to: - Woody Harrelson / Despite being a pot smoking hippie who was never blessed with matinée looks Woody is still a funny guy and he adds value here.Emma Stone / Best known as the chick Jonah Hill was after in Superbad, Stone is spunky, witty and confident in a non-annoying way.Abigail Breslin / Is also in the movie.As mentioned earlier once the two pairs come across each other again and team up the movie loses its way for about 25 minutes, probably not coincidentally is that this happens to be the period between zombie encounters. In an 80 minute movie 25 minutes of lifeless (if you'll excuse the pun) inactivity between the ""life-less activity"" is inexcusable. (I swear that made sense as I wrote it.)This is not one of the best films I have seen recently, (though overall it is still solid), but it was one of the more enjoyable.Final Rating – 7 / 10. I know a ""7"" hardly screams ""Watch THIS!"" but I was let down after the great start to the film was allowed to go to waste, if you liked Shaun of the Dead you won't hate this.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"zombies, thrill rides, and a killer cameo - and that's just the gravy","I saw this movie at an advanced screening as a reward for dressing up like a zombie and showing up ready to chow down on some medium-rare brain steaks.

And Woody Harrelson... come on, Woody playing the most bad-ass zombie killer ever. Need I say more? I won't spoil any of the awesome moments. I won't tell you who shows up for one of the best cameos ever. Or the clever visual comedic elements. And I won't give and overly long review just because I loved this movie.The fact is if you like comedy at all, or if can enjoy the little things like cannibalism and gun powder, if you like good performances or can understand the temptation to brush a beautiful girl's hair back over her ear this movie is for you.And that's it - Enjoy!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Lighthearted and Fun Take on the Zombie Genre,"Zombieland is a 2009 horror-comedy film directed by Ruben Fleischer. The movie follows the journey of four survivors in a world overrun by zombies, including the timid Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), the tough and resourceful Wichita (Emma Stone), and her sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). The group bands together to navigate the zombie apocalypse and find a place of safety.What makes Zombieland stand out from other zombie films is its lighthearted and fun approach to the genre. The film balances the horror and comedy elements well, with plenty of gory zombie kills and witty one-liners to keep viewers entertained. The movie's self-awareness and use of humor help to make the story more enjoyable, even as the characters face dire circumstances.The film's cast is strong, with great chemistry between Eisenberg, Stone, Breslin, and Woody Harrelson, who plays the tough-as-nails zombie killer, Tallahassee. The performances are all excellent and the characters are well-developed, with each one bringing their own unique quirks and personalities to the group.However, Zombieland does have its shortcomings. The plot is somewhat thin and the movie lacks the emotional depth of some other zombie films. While the humor and action are entertaining, the movie doesn't quite leave a lasting impact or make a significant statement about the human condition like numerous entries in the genre.Overall, Zombieland is a fun and entertaining film that offers a unique take on the zombie apocalypse. While it may not have the same depth or impact as other zombie films, its humor and action make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Awesomely Funny and Action Packed,"It's been a long time since I have really enjoyed myself in the theaters. Sure, Inglorious Basterds was genius and District 9 was also quite good, but that's about all I can recall really enjoying this summer. Now with fall upon us, it's time to head into a new season of film and ramp up for the winter. Zombieland is a great start for the season. In fact, this is really just a summer movie that missed the deadline. It would have been one of the better films this summer, and is one of the better films I have seen as of late.In Zombieland, our focus is on Columbus, an almost neurotic shut-in, is trying to get home to Columbus, Ohio after zombies take over the world. He soon meets Tallahassee, who is simply trying to survive, and find a twinkie at that. The two hit the road, and we find ourselves on a zombie road trip that will have you laughing all along the way.The best thing about the film is that it is in equal parts action packed and funny. Well, probably mostly fun, but there is enough of both comedy and action here to satisfy. However, this is not gag based comedy, thank god, but rather based on it's characters, which is a relief for zombie films. Jessie Einsenberg is perfectly cast as Columbus, who seems afraid of the world at large, but is pretty much forced into it by the zombie situation. His narration, which could have been annoying, is actually quite funny from the very beginning. Just as funny are his rules, which continually pop up in comedic fashion to remind the viewer of their importance. Woody Harrelson is also quite funny as Tallahassee, whose mostly muscle for the film, but also provides quite a bit of comedy through his ""nut up or shut up"" type of character. Completing the cast are Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Witchita and Little Rock, respectively, two young femme fatales who take our main characters for quite the spin.The comedy in zombieland lends itself more to today's style of humor in films, that sort of realistic and awkward humor that has been pervasive in any film starring Seth Rogan or Michael Cera. While it's not exactly that style of humor, the most funny moments are the most human ones. Tallahassee's quest for a twinkie, Columbus' neurosis, tearing up a souvenir shop, even Bill Murray's guest appearance. These are all some of the funniest things about the film. Sure, all the stuff involving the zombie's is fun and funny, but what really shines here are the characters, which keep from being typical, plywood staples of the zombie film. Many will probably compare this to Shaun of the Dead, and it's a justified comparison. This ranks right up there with Shaun and should be an instant zombie classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Feelgood Zombie Flick,"This movie is an amiable, if rather aimless attempt to create a feelgood zombie flick. In order to achieve this it pretty much ignores what we can imagine to be the realities of such a situation in its attempt to raise a few laughs and amuse us with its irreverent attitude towards what used to be a serious horror sub-genre. The fact is, the zombie comedy-horror genre is becoming as over-populated as the straight version from which it was spawned, and Zombieland doesn't really add anything new to the mix.Having said that, it's entertaining enough if you're in an undemanding mood. Woody Harrelson goes all Mallory-lite for his portrayal of Tallahassie, and although he's never convinced me as a tough guy, he's good enough. The lead character's rules for survival in zombieland are possibly the most entertaining part of the film, and it's a shame we're only let in on 10 or so of the 30+ he's devised.For all it's entertainment value, you can't help feeling it could have been a whole lot more – which suggests its writers have perhaps devoted too much time paying affectionate homage to other movies they admire rather than creating something worthy of their own to which others might wish to pay homage.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the best comedy's of the year!,"I went to see this on Friday night, and i must say i was absolutely stunned by Zombieland. From start to finish it has to be one of the funniest movies i've seen. Woody Harrelson does an excellent job and so do the rest of the main characters. All of them are interesting. The beginning had a unique bloody intro with good music that i think will appeal well to all audiences. The thing that really made this movie soooo good for me was the celebrity cameo. it was absolutely hilarious. Probably one of the best i've seen, by far beats Mike Tyson's in the Hangover (although he did provide some laughs). So overall a unique, interesting, and ultimately hilarious horror-comedy that is well worth seeing. So go out and see it! it's one of the funniest movie's this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A funny entertaining horror send up.,"I went in expecting a horror comedy film, but it is more comedy than horror. The horror part happens around the comedy. This film never takes itself too seriously. It was what Shaun of The Dead almost was in opinion. It never gets boring or stupid for a second. All the lead actors work well together. They seem to be having a fun time.Jesse Eisenberg goes from Adventureland to Zombieland, what are the odds. The funny pairing of Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson is done with comedic perfection. I had my doubts about Eisenberg doing comedy. Because he oftener plays serious one and the comedy happens around him, like in Adventureland. But he was pretty funny here, and he and Harrelson are like a perfect team. Now Emma Stone(last seen in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past) in not all funny, but she holds her own. Abigail Breslin I feel was not giving much to act on.But none the less an entertaining film. If you are in the mood for a fun time go see Zombieland.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Woody of the Dead,"For a guy who's portrayed a mass-murdering psychopath (in ""Natural Born Killers"") and went head-to-head with mass murderer Anton Chigurh (in ""No Country for Old Men""), it's anyone's guess as to why Woody Harrelson--he of the perpetual cowboy hat and hickly typecasting--was never enlisted to play the role of undead-whompin' good-'ol boy before. Rest easy, friends: in ""Zombieland,"" that dream is fulfilled, and all is now right with the world. Woody plays Tallahasse, a grizzled zombie hunter plowing across the highways of America to make it to his namesake (and also find a Twinkie along the way, if possible); in his travels, he meets neurotic dweeb Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, who is really cornering the market on this character type), whose obsessive tendencies and notepad of ""rules"" has kept him alive; also on board are Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin--""Little Miss Sunshine""), two sisters with their own tough-love survival instincts, who even add a little romantic tension to the mix. True to its title, ""Zombieland"" knows the character types and conventions of the genre, and expects the audience to, as well: this is a film that plunges us into a world gone to walking-dead hell, and--in the vein of the ""Scream"" films--knows the clichés that accompany such a scenario, to the point where the surviving inhabitants are pretty jaded toward it all. Director Ruben Fleischer creates a convincingly apocalyptic landscape, and even mines some passages of suspense and rip-roaring action to accompany the laughs, courtesy of Rhett Reese's and Paul Wernick's script. While ""Shaun of the Dead"" might have beaten ""Zombieland"" to the punch as far as undead satires/homages are concerned, it's hard to top the thrill of seeing Woody Harrelson pluck strings on a banjo (pretty badly, I might add) to the theme of ""Deliverance"" to draw overweight zombies out of a supermarket aisle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Extremely funny, but it does fall flat at times.","There are loads of Zombie films these days and very few of them (in my opinion) are funny or good.

"Funny, but not conventionally put together","The only time I really tend to enjoy zombies in film is when they're done in a comedic way. 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' and 'Zombieland' are prime examples of how to nail this genre. Don't take yourself too seriously. 'Zombieland' finds itself a great little cast with a lot of chemistry and then the film just flows from there.I'm surprised 'Zombieland' is as well received as it is, particularly by critics, because it doesn't follow the usual formula of a film. It doesn't have a beginning, a middle and an end. It just kind of starts, things happen, and then the film ends almost in exactly the same spot as it started. There isn't a mission trying to be accomplished by these characters or a place they're trying to get to (well there kind of is, but not really if you know what I mean). It didn't really bother me, but I thought it would bother other people more.I think when making 'Zombieland' they just set out to make a film as fun as they could, and kudos to them for that. This cast works and they seem to be given free rein for 90 minutes. While I did enjoy it, I suspect it won't be hugely memorable for me. A good way to kill some time on a rainy day though perhaps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An average comedy,"I've been noticing a pattern in the most recent comedy movies. They all seem to suck real bad, yet, for some odd reason, they get reviewed fairly well, whereas actual movies that require some thought (just a little bit) get bad reviews. This trend is the reason film makers and studio executives are getting away (with millions of dollars) with putting out such crap.As for this, I have to say, this is nothing as spectacular as the IMDb ratings and reviews elsewhere indicate. This is just an average comedy movie (with quite a few clichés) based in a zombie infested environment. The only character I even slightly enjoyed was Woody Harrelson's character. The guy provided some laughs (and no, not because of the fail search storyline). See, it's not like I went in expecting to some dark humour masterpiece, in fact, I expected this to be ""bust your balls"" straight up comedy. By the end of the movie, I wasn't even sure it was a comedy. There was barely anything funny about the movie, and most of the time, it seemed pretty serious (of course, followed by a dumb ""comic"" twist). Really, even cheesy 80s action movie one liners were funnier than this stuff. If dumb humour was really what was to be expected from this movie, why was there no moment where I was rolling with laughter? In fact, I don't know anybody who was. How this movie qualifies for the IMDb Top 250, I have no idea because there are at least 251 movies greater than this that deserve that accolade. The beginning looked quite promising, and I expected the whole movie to be of the same standard. Geez, I mean, it's almost like they fired the writers from the first half of the movie and employed new ones.Lastly, let me say, I am in no way a rigid movie goer. I enjoy my dumb popcorn flicks as much as I enjoy my ""masterpiece"" movies. I've watched a couple of movies that rate on IMDb below even 3 and mildly enjoyed them. I don't demand my movies to be of the highest caliber at all times. If not making a movie of a high caliber, least they can do is not insult my intelligence. I mean, there have been movies that have utilised clichés in a funnier way. The ""romance"" in the movie had me throwing up inside my mouth. Is that the best they can do 50 - 60 years after the art of motion picture was perfected? I've given this movie a 5/10.

"Fun zombie horror comedy, full of black humor, love conflicts, violence, gore and blood.","In the world populated by zombies, the unaffected college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a young man who lives by himself in a beat-up apartment before becoming one of the few survivors of the zombie apocalypse. He unexpectedly becomes a lonely young who has to face an army of zombies. He lives by a strict set of rules to stay alive. Columbus is making his way from his college dorm in Austin, Texas, to Columbus, Ohio, to see whether his parents are still alive. Young Columbus lives in terror, although it is possible that his congenital cowardice disease since childhood has allowed him, precisely, to preserve his life in the face of the multiple dangers that surround him. He lives according to rigid rules imposed by himself, which he tries to follow as far as possible, but things are not as easy as they seem. His rules are: Survival rule #21: Avoid strip clubs, Survival rule #28: Get a kickass partner, Survival rule#4: Don't be a hero, Survival rule #1: Cardio. Along the way, Columbus surprisingly encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and both of whom undertake a perilous voyage moving to the American heartland. Later on, the pair meets Wichita (Emma Stone) , Little Rock's older sister and Columbus's love interest. She is one of the few survivors of the zombie apocalypse, and overly protective of her little sister (Abigail Breslin). Her real name is Krista and is the younger sister Little Rock , she's Wichita's 12-year-old sister, who is very sweet, but not that innocent and has grown up very quickly because of the apocalypse. A comedy that kills !. Our land is their land !. A Ton of Fun!. Superbad meets Shawn of the Dead!. This place is so dead !. Nut up or shut up !. You might be a pulse-less Zombie if you don't get a kick out of this film!An amusing and funny film about a Zombie invasion including thrills , chills , violent events, lots of humor with tongue-in-cheek, guts and blood. Another Terror Zombie movie with some doses of parody, including a little bit of romanticism in the romance between Jeese Eisenberg-Emma Stone and large doses of black humor. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg star in this acid and gore zombie horror comedy, which was a huge success with critics and audiences at the time of its release. It won, among other awards, the public award at the most famous horror festival in the world: Sitges.Well directed by Ruben Fleischer (Venom, Gangster Squad), the film amusingly shows how Columbus' destiny is linked to that of Tallahassee, a zombie-hunting thug whose only goal is to get the last Twinkie bar on a planet Earth invaded by millions of bloody and deeply hungry zombies. Joining them are the equally likeable Wichita: Emma Stone and Little Rock: Abigail Breslin , both of whom give likeable performances. They have also found an original way to survive in this zombie chaos, and they will have to choose, which is worse, whether to trust each other to survive, or succumb to the Zombies. All of them: Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock create a zombie-bashing team , they face off against starving zombies, a few survivors, and the growing pains of their own makeshift family. Adding brief appearances from a young Amber Heard and Bill Murray playing himself.The editing is sincerely frenetic and the violence , though sometimes ridiculous , strong and bloody. Evocative ambiance and appropriate settings , excellent special effects , enhanced by the brilliant and colorful photography carried out by a good cameraman: Michael Bonvillain. Being shot on location in Valdosta, Newnan, Rutledge, Hapeville, Morrow, Atlanta, Georgia, and Los Angeles, California. As well as exciting, moving musical score by David Sardy. This is an acclaimed and notorious film from director Ruben Fleischer who delivers the goods with skillness and aplomb enough .

Next Stop Zombieland,"""Zombieland"" is an action-comedy that capitalizes on the current vogue for zombies. The story is basically one part ""Zombie Survival Guide"" and one part ""28 Days Later"". Not incredibly original but there's still some fun to be had here.The acting is decent enough with Woody Harrelson making an entertaining team with Michael Cera (oops, I mean Jesse Eisenberg). Emma Stone & Abigail Breslin are merely decent in rounding out the main players while there's a celebrity cameo that will undoubtedly thrill some (hipsters, mostly).Hipster-approved cleverness is also present in other areas of the script, particularly when it comes to the survival tips. These got old for me very quickly. Also, the main story is fairly aimless and inconsequential, so those looking for something substantial would be advised to look elsewhere.The first-time direction by Ruben Fleischer is attractive, though, particularly in the credits sequence (niftily supported by Metallica's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). The zombie effects are good enough though I'm certainly no authority on the subject.Ultimately, I think that while ""Zombieland"" is a somewhat enjoyable time waster it's got nothing on ""Shaun of the Dead"". Nevertheless, the film's warm critical & popular reception shows that there is an audience out there for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Dumber and dumber,"Well we all like a bit of a schlock horror comedy to relieve the boredom and stress and not take life too seriously but this??? What happened to the script? The writer must've walked out near the beginning and left the actors and crew to sort of make it up as they go along. What we get is a bunch of bored actors just ad libbing as they drive around the U.S. feigning some bon homie between themselves. There's no tension or excitement but lots of clichés. Road movies are usually great for a music score but where's the soundtrack? There isn't one memorable tune. There are no jokes. Well, there was at the beginning when our nerdy hero says he was always a loner because everyone seemed like a zombie to him before they..............became real zombies. That kinda perked my interest. But even that got jerked off when the final moral of the story becomes: you're a zombie if you don't have friends. Duh! Make your mind up. Jeeeez!! Maybe all the conspiracy theorists are right and this is all part of an elaborate plan by the Pentagon to dumb down America before the final takeover.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A scream of laughter,"What a great way to start a career for Ruben Fleischer, (and I'm not being sarcastic). Following in the gory footsteps of George Romero and Robert Rodriguez, Fleischer brings the story to life for eighty minutes of virtually flawless fun. I guess it could have been a bit longer, but I am fine with it.When the story begins, the world is already a hellhole. A virus has turned the world into a Zombie feeding ground. Our hero and narrator is young Columbus, who takes on the world solo, and stays alive because he follows his thirty one principles, which include: wear your seat belt, check the back seat, and don't be a hero. One day he teams up with Tallahassee; a twinkie-loving, trigger happy cowboy The two of them later team up with Witchita and Little Rock; a couple of sister bandits, cute but dangerous. They all agree to head for Pacific Playland California, where there are supposedly no zombies. Along the way they get to know each other like a family.It ain't scary for a moment, but it ain't dull for a moment either. There are jokes here there and everywhere. Only six members of the cast are not zombies, (well maybe seven). four are our heroes, one is a nerdy gas station clerk, and one is (I'm not supposed to say, but you may find out sooner or later).As a horror comedy, this film is one step above many of its predecessors (the most recent of which is Shawn of the Dead), because it offers likable characters, possibly the most memorable since Tremors, twenty years ago. Although they are not perfectly rounded, we spend just enough time with them to know who they are, what they want and so on and so forth. Now that I think about it, if this movie does well enough (and especially considering the ending) There might be a sequel in store, but that is another movie. Go out and enjoy this one for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
How can you not love it?,"(This is my comment/opinion, like they ask for. If you want the plot, it's not in here.) This movie was fantastic. It's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. There were people on here who downed it, saying it was an awful horror movie. That's like going to see the movie Superbad and saying, ""I wasn't even scared, how dumb."" Plus, anyone who said it was bad was most likely not even watching it, and instead playing with themselves in the theater.It was pretty short, but it's good that way. The humor pretty much never stopped coming. Myself and everyone else laughed throughout the whole thing... with the exception of the guy two seats down... he laughed hysterically.But yes, go see this movie! It was great. If you think otherwise, you may want to go see your doctor, because there is something wrong with you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Dead end.,"I've heard many compare this film as the American Shawn of the Dead. And while the idea seems to be comparable, the differences is what makes Zombieland a more pleasurable movie. The film chugs along at a nice pace for most of the time, and when it does stutter, it's not long before we are watching the creative ways in which Harrelson decides to kill the flesh eaters. There's a wonderful cameo in here and the film is picked up with the set rules that Eisenberg has created. For the most part the entire cast and sequences made me laugh, but I couldn't help every once in awhile feel restless. Perhaps because there was no real story here. That the union between all the characters seemed unfleshed, to pardon a pun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"""Zombieland""","I'm going to begin adversarial and maybe we can meet in the middle. I didn't love ""Shaun of the Dead."" There, I said it. Those still reading can only imagine my reaction then to the ""Zombieland"" trailer, which on every significant selling point seemed identical, without the novelty of having done it first. My primary objection to this burgeoning 'zomedy' genre is that its sense of humor hasn't been transgressive enough to match the post-apocalyptic setting. ""Shaun"" set every precedent for ""Zombieland"" to be a cutesy, inconsequential comedy chock full of gimmicky jabs at the expense of horror convention.So I hunkered down in an irritable cynicism when the film began building a catalogue of positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes, Facebook feeds, and second-hand conversations all seemed to suggest my prejudice toward the film was unfounded. I saw it last weekend as part of a triple feature and was, admittedly, pleasantly surprised. It turns out ""Zombieland"" does employ a cutesy, inconsequential narrative, but its emotional and comedic core is every bit as distinct and charming as that of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but which, as I admitted, I didn't love to begin with.The screenplay for ""Zombieland"" is rife with seasoned surface-level details like zombie safety regulations and an intriguing character name template, but has a great big undercooked pink center. The structure doesn't have the snap of ""Shaun,"" and the plot often feels tertiary to the disposable gags and the 'wouldn't-it-be-cool' set pieces. Certainly aimlessness is an appropriate feeling to elicit for a scenario in which any 'save-the-world' opportunity has long since expired, but it comes at the expense of the film feeling underwritten. As near as I can tell, three things happen over the paltry eighty minute running time: boy meets girl, boy and girl travel to surprise celebrity cameo's house, boy rescues girl from amusement park. And those aren't acts, they're scenes.Fortunately, the screenplay accounts for all but one of ""Zombieland's"" most-rotten blemishes. Besides green-lighting the irksome giant text espousing every survival tip that floats or crumbles or unfolds distractingly amidst several scenes, first-time feature director Ruben Fleisher performs his duties admirably in bringing the film to life, though was blessed by the natural chemistry of his leads. Woody Harrelson stars as Tallahassee, the Twinkie- obsessed badass, while Jesse 'For-The-Last-Time-I'm-Not-Michael-Cera' Eisenberg portrays the swooning, rule-keeping wimp, Columbus. ""Zombieland"" works as often as it does because of the classic dynamic pairing of these two.But I think the primary reason Fleisher's film has been so commercially successful, having already made back its 23 million dollar budget twofold, while other recent horror-comedy hybrids like ""Drag Me to Hell,"" and ""Grindhouse"" have underperformed, is that his directorial sensibilities skew so comedic. A zombie may trigger a ""Boo!"" orchestral spike every so often out of obligation, but the undead don't pose any serious threat until the amusement park finale, and even then, ""Zombieland"" settles for a crowd-pleasing comedic outcome rather than what's logical, mature, or interesting.Nevertheless, I was won over, if just barely. ""Zombieland"" contains plenty to chuckle about, but its tonal levity unfortunately extends to the storytelling itself, and the credits roll leaving a sensation of benign indifference in their wake. To bring it back to fan-favorite, ""Shaun of the Dead,"" which is a better-made film, unquestionably, it's my heretical opinion that ""Zombieland"" is just as funny. The films actually oddly compliment one another in their very English and very American takes on life after the living dead.And for ""Zombieland,"" what's more American than the sequel? Bloggers are already atwitter over early talks of a follow-up, and as much as the idea disinterests me, I guess I have to give this one the benefit of the doubt.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Many innovative killings of zombies in a zombie environment,"(2009) Zombieland
ACTION/ COMEDY/ HORRORAnybody were to see countless of zombie films as much as I have should be relieved that the concept of ""Zombieland"" existed- from ""The Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Dawn of The Dead""! It was becoming very tiring to see the same formula of what one would expect to see on a zombie film that if you were to see one, than you pretty much seen them all, humans trying to get away only to be eaten by zombies turning into one. Here's a film that doesn't carry this kind of trend and doesn't consist much of anything else, but the ""idea"" of rules about what one's supposed to do if one were to confront a zombie or living in a city overpopulated with zombies to me is something I've never saw before! And because zombies can be killed by guns, why not exploit this idea by having zombies killed off on inventive and fascinating new ways! Why not show zombies shot on top of roller coasters as well as on merry-go-rounds since the other zombie films are somewhat labelled as somewhat serious horror films! My rating would've higher except that I feel the film would've been better had they had a bigger budget!

"""It's not the taste; it's the consistency.""","""Zombieland"" is one of the best horror comedies out there. The cast is what makes it an awesome movie. Jesse Eisenburg plays the Michael Cera-niche everyone's accustom to, but the writing makes the character a lot more sympathetic. Michael Cera, to no offense as I enjoy most of his films, usually just comes off as pathetic and inhumanly good-natured. Woody Harrelson is the film definition of a bad-ass. His love for Twinkies is shared by me and the story makes him a lovable gun-toting hero. Emma Stone is pretty solid and Abigail Breslin is a talented child actor. There's nothing more annoying in a movie then a kid who either comes off as bratty or just bad at acting. She thankfully is neither.The story is a brisk one that moves quickly and while sticking to a technically predictable storyline, there are enough surprises in the writing to make it an enjoyable movie. The final battle music by David Sardy is epic and there's enough gore to satisfy me. I'm not quite sure if it's a horror classic but it is definitely a movie I recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"With great humor, good references to pop culture and some very creative death scenes, Zombieland is pure and good enterteinment","Zombieland started in the minds of screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick in 2005 when they wrote a concept script for television that did not bear fruit and caught the attention of director Fleischer, who helped develop it based on the idea of making a zombie road movie. With the script closed and the cast hired, filming began in February 2009 lasting 41 days in all and quickly released in the United States on October 2, 2009. However, if at first glance Zombieland seems just another film that recycles concepts, just go through the introduction to understand that it is a production that deserves to be included in the select list of the best of an increasingly worshiped genre. Right in the opening credits scene, Fleischer opens fire with his arsenal of style. He employs a very slow, high-definition camera to show scenes of chase between zombies and their snacks. The sequences are beautiful to see and very funny because of the situation. It is not just another undead film that is announced, obviously.The plot revolves around the fact that the world population has been wiped out due to a virus, a variant of mad cow disease, that causes people to turn into zombies. Few are uninfected humans, and the journey of these survivors will show us hilarious situations as they flee the United States on the run. One of the survivors is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a student at the University of Texas, who wants to return to his hometown in hopes of finding his parents still alive. Columbus's greatest fear is represented by clowns, not zombies. The boy is a lonely, virgin former video game player who only survived the zombies because he hid behind his strict rules. On the way Columbus takes a ride with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who is going to Florida with the aim of annihilating as many zombies and crazy as possible to eat Twinkies cookies. The two make a perfect pair of survivors, until they stop at a grocery store, where the duo faces three zombies and meets two girls, Wichita (Emma Stone) and his little sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). Only Little Rock appears to have been bitten by a zombie, which divides the group as to what to do.We don't have a highly prepared hero here with all kinds of possible and imaginable weapons and no unprotected or equally prepared heroine in the Alice style of the Resident Evil franchise. In fact, we have a nerd who has the 32 rules to survive in Zombieland and a girl who doesn't need anyone to save her. As events take place, editing enhances the rules, allowing them to interact with slow motion, making everything funnier. The work on Alan Baumgarten's edition is really to be applauded.What newcomer director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick created in Zombieland is no exception. The zombies obey George Romero's playbook - shots to the head, infection via bites and eternal hunger - but it adds to the monsters the speed and explosion employed for the first time in Extermination (28 Days Later, 2002) and black humor that Edgar Wright had already explored in Almost Dead World (Shawn of the Dead, 2004). Fleischer and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, end up criticizing the United States calling the country ""the United States of Zombieland. Not even symbols of American society like a miss or an attractive cheerleader escape the infestation. The director immediately uses high-definition slow motion - to the sound of Metallica's ""For Whom the Bells Tolls"" - in the opening credits scene to show scenes of chase between zombies and their victims. The situations are very funny and the slow motion enhances everything.Zombieland is one of the films that most perfectly walk the boundary between stray entertainment and the offer of elements that amplify and perpetuate the cinematic experience. Returning to the work to write the present criticism only rekindled that certainty. After all, we are talking about yet another film about the zombie apocalypse, something that, especially in the last 10 years, since this work by Ruben Fleischer went on the big screen, has relived with strength as the deaths that have populated the popular imagination since Roger A. Romero popularized them with the immortal classic Night of the Living Dead. Again, as usual, for some reason the entire population of the planet has been infected and half a dozen survivors are trying, umm... to survive. What made zombie films a genre in itself was the insertion, by Romero, of strong social criticisms in the narratives, which started to use putrid creatures only as a backdrop for something much more relevant. That is, entertainment with brain. This is what separates works like Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead and Fido from things like the Resident Evil franchise, for example.Zombieland is well run and has excellent technical aspects like cinematography and zombie makeup, courtesy of Michael Bonvillain (from Cloverfield) and Tony Gardner (who started his career with Rick Baker in Michael Jackson's Thriller) respectively. Even though the bleak scenario that the film is going through is not so chaotic and hopeless in many moments. Despite the chaos that must have been an entire country from coast to coast, perhaps the whole world, infected by the zombie crowd, we don't see any large group of corpses until the end, all roads are clear and fuel and electricity don't seem to be a problem. For the characters.The already traditional references to pop culture, as a reference to the movie Ghostbusters, quotes to movie stars, Velvet Underground! And even the character Hannah Montana. Not to mention Bill Murray's hilarious appearance at his Hollywood mansion in a respectful tribute to those who lived in the 1980s. The main cast is perfect. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were a great pair. Eisenberg - who in the following year would star in the spectacular A Social Network - is the typical stereotypical nerd who, here, also plays the role of narrator, drawing the viewer's attention to the set of rules he follows to live his life. These rules - and variations of them - will dot the work from beginning to end, already bringing that something more than the humorous script of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (and which they would use without brakes in Deadpool and Deadpool 2) always seeks to impose. Harrelson, on the other hand, lives a stereotype, this time of the macho man who loves to kill the zombies in the most grotesque ways possible, who always drives powerful cars and, of course, has that callous shell when inside we know that he is exactly the opposite.Emma Stone contributed a lot to the film as well, both in beauty and in acting. The then promising actress had already done well in the genre in The House Bunny (2008) and consolidated here what she would present with even greater ease in Easy A (2010) soon after. She has a natural talent for comedy. Abigail Breslin had already done something more contained in the humor in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), and here she completes the main cast with mastery. The two sisters who do not trust anyone and have spent their lives hitting others. It is no different after the zombie plague and Tallahassee and Columbus learn in the worst way possible.The interaction of the four characters is almost a ballet very well-choreographed by Fleischer, who manages to extract from them not only immediate chemistry - and in any combination of pairs - but also an almost unexpected freshness considering precisely the characterizations tending to the cliché that the script makes. And, just like in the best films of the genre, zombies are merely accessories to this fun quartet, which lives as if tomorrow does not exist, as if this new world status quo were just a playground for them to enjoy. The side of social criticism, however, is muffled almost constantly, existing only as an invisible and underdeveloped lint, something that is almost entirely compensating for the synergy of the cast, for the hilarious situations constructed throughout the narrative. Fleischer's view of this parcel directly connected to the consequences of globalization, basically formed by the youth who evolved with it, is of incredible precision and forcefulness, today the great reference to be hit on the subject. Faced with the zombie movie, a genre that has been revisited and consequently worn out in recent years, the director builds a narrative that resembles video games and inserts its protagonist in a reality that dominates more efficiently than his own life. Columbus sets rules, performs missions and studies his checklist coldly before taking any steps, and this is how he becomes one of the few survivors of this insane journey.With good humor, the already traditional references to pop culture and some very creative death scenes (including a very funny participation by Bill Murray and his Hollywood mansion - which concentrates some of the best moments of the film), Zombieland is a movie that goes by flying (or would it be running?) and, especially, without the prospect escaping even a moment from the personal realm. After all, screw society, Zombieland's great catastrophe is that of a boy seeking love in the midst of a world consumed by zombies. The film has good jokes that are well explored in the most unusual situations and fulfills its purpose of having fun, besides of course having good action scenes and managing to mix comedy and terror gore at different times. Fleischer competently uses pop and cynical satire to achieve an agile, funny and metalinguistic final result.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
No Z's in Zombieland!,"The witty ""Zombieland"" definitely did wake me up from my zombie state and was a real eye-opener. The film is set in the future where a deadly plague that converts people into zombies has set its mark in the USA. ""Take A Bite out of Slime"" has superseded ""Take A Bite Out of Crime"", sorry McGruff. Jesse Eisenberg stars as pseudo-name Columbus, a gabby, jittery unzombie who has set his own ""zombieland security"" rules in order to defend himself against zombie attacks. Woody Harrelson co-stars as pseudo-name Tallahassee, a bad-ass ""zombie exterminator"" who plays by his own ""zombieland security"" rules which are more of the destroyer mode than Columbus' ones. The two coincidentally meet up in trying to search for locations that are ""zombie free"". In their journey, they meet up with a con-artist sister duet in Wichita and Little Rock, also pseudo-names, who are conniving in stealing property and dollars of the what's little left ""male zombie-free"" population. Eventually, the fearsome foursome do converge in most of the narrative of ""Zombieland"". Director Ruben Fleischer revitalized the zombie genre with some juicy, sharp bites in his orchestration of the movie. Rhette Reese also did a credible job in instilling his reese's pieces in the amusing scribe of the flick. I don't want to be a ""plotbuster"" but there is a cameo appearance of a comedic legend in ""Zombieland"" that does earn the film its ""stripes"". Cheers to Woody Harrelson for his enigmatic performance as Tallahassee, and to Jesse Eisenberg for connecting quite well as Columbus in the ""Zombie Network"". Emma Stone continues to impress as a startling young actress, and her performance as Wichita was one I was wishing I could see more of. Abigail Breslin as Little Rock was no ""little miss sunshine"" here, but she also delivered a fine performance. Hey, can't forget the Zombies! Kudos to those thousands of zombie extras that zom way had to make them believable. Hey, you just read a corny pun review of the film ""Zombieland""! What are you going to do now?

Breaking the Rules of Horror,"Accepting the offer refused by the master of horror, John Carpenter, virtually unknown filmmaker Ruben Fleisher directs a very capable cast consisting of three future A-listers in Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, as well as the ever-reliable and extremely underrated Woody Harrelson in horror-comedy Zombieland, an enjoyable take on a genre screaming out for some mainstream originality.The film centres around Columbus (Eisenberg), a young man living in solitude, believing he is the only person remaining on a planet overrun by the undead. His chances of survival, as well as the opportunity to gain the closest thing he's ever had to a real family, increase upon meeting the trigger-happy Tallahassee and con artist sisters Wichita and Little Rock, all of whom decide to stick together and fend off the zombies as a unit.In a film full of positives, the most refreshing aspect of Zombieland is the way in which it injects brains into a genre typically lacking in any at all. Where most films of this nature usually consist of young, good-looking teenagers screaming and running for two hours, Columbus couldn't be more different from these stereotypes. He understands that to survive in Zombieland you need things like cardio (Rule #1), seatbelts at all times (Rule #4) and, if in doubt, double tap (Rule #2) to turn a 'maybe' kill into a 'definite' kill.This is conveyed best in the opening scene. Running from a couple of zombies, Columbus comes across a car. Fumbling to get the keys into the lock on the door, he sees that his predators are making ground quickly, so he gives up on the keys, lets them chase him around the car park once more so he can again distance himself from them (Rule #1), then returns to find that the car door was unlocked the whole time. It almost feels as if Fleisher sat down, watched a heap of B-grade horrors and thought 'I'm going to make a movie where no-one in the audience will be able to say, ""If they just did X, then they wouldn't have been killed by Y.""' As I said, very refreshing, and very funny.Speaking of funny, the bulk of the laughs unsurprisingly come from Tallahassee, a loose screw whose hatred of zombies is surpassed only by his love of Twinkies. Apparently quite the movie buff to boot, he'll make you laugh in a scene you didn't expect to find funny with a Babe reference, and his particularly unsettling banjo tunes (followed by a compliment no-one would ever want to receive) leave you certain he'd be first in line for a Deliverance remake. Oh, and on top of all that, there's the cameo to end all cameos.For all the competence in the acting department, the film does falter in the Third Act. What was built up as something of a road-trip movie with the occasional assassination along the way turns into an absolute kill-fest in the final fifteen minutes. Sure, it's watchable, but really couldn't be further from the established tone of the film. The ending is ultimately predictable, but this is a minor gripe of mine considering one of the hardest tasks to undertake in filmmaking is to create a satisfying and unique conclusion to a dystopian film, regardless of genre.Comedy in various forms comes through thick and fast, but it is the film's brave steps forward to eradicate some of the most stale of horror clichés, as well as offering a range of individualist characters who are all likable in some way, that tips Zombieland from the 'average' into the 'pretty good' category.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Enjoyable,"A creative and fairly original horror-comedy. It's biggest selling point for me personally is its likable, 3-dimesnsional characters. It avoids the pitfalls of horror-comedies such as having dull characters and cheap laughs. Most teen horror-comedies comprise of an: ""Aaah I'm being chased. Oops I fell over"" kind of comedy, brought to life by pretty little young people who you really couldn't give a toss about. This is different.Jesse Eisenberg is fantastic as the shy and awkward guy who is forced to man up, wake up and smell the decaying flesh. Woody is sublime as the tough man with a sad past and a Twinkie obsession (which they somehow didn't make annoying). The 2 other girls are well-acted and there is definitely good chemistry between Jesse and Emma Stone. I don't quite know how the girls ended up in the supermarket (without killing the zombies) or why they didn't abandon Jesse and Woody (the 2nd time) but apart from that the plot is solid.There are a lot of laughs, and proper laughs; sarcastic comments and comical scenarios. There is enough action to satisfy the bloodthirsty, but not too much which suits those of a weaker stomach. A genuinely enjoyable horror-comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
As Infectious As It Is Exhilarating,"A fun, pleasant & lighthearted zombie comedy that's crafted with heart, told with flair, and is finely steered by a wonderful cast, Zombieland takes a simple premise and just runs with it. Promising all the gory delights but in playful doses, this little horror comedy never takes itself seriously, and delivers a swiftly paced, amusing & entertaining ride from start to finish.Directed by Ruben Fleischer in what's his feature film debut, the story feels fresh despite bringing nothing new to the table, and exhibits no trouble whatsoever in keeping its freewheeling tone alive. The over-the-top treatment serves as both a parody & tribute to the zombie apocalypse genre, whereas its expertly timed wit & endless character banter keep the wheels oiled & functioning.It certainly helps to have likeable actors playing serviceable characters but in this film's case, it is a blessing. Steered by a cast of Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone & Abigail Breslin who develop a seamless chemistry with each other within minutes, and further bolstered by a show-stealing cameo from Bill Murray, the performances are funny, charming & heartwarming in all the right ways.Overall, Zombieland is a smartly directed & surprisingly polished horror comedy that's quite aware of its strengths & limitations, and doesn't aim for much apart from offering its audience an extravaganza that's as enjoyable as it's outrageous. A delightful experience that's got heart, humour, passion, adventure & absurdity in addition to gleeful zombie carnage, this post-apocalyptic horror comedy is as infectious as it is exhilarating.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Entertaining but incomplete and standard,"Zombieland is a standard, cookie cutter zombie comedy. It does have a sharper than average script, and good performances by a cast of good actors, including Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg. But at the end of the day, while it may be able to hold an audiences attention to some extent, it is still rather standard and derivative. It is funny but only slyly and not outrageously so, and the plot also feels incomplete, as if the film were just made for there to be a sequel, something which may at least mildly infuriate some viewers. There is also a contrived love story tacked on, typical of such films. Overall, Zombieland is thoroughly average, and may be a diverting watch for some, but definitely not a transcendental one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Double Tap into the Apocalypse with 'Zombieland',"""Zombieland"" is a thrilling and comedic take on the zombie genre. The film expertly balances horror and humor, keeping audiences on their toes with unexpected twists and turns. The cast, led by Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee, delivers strong performances that bring depth to their characters. The film's use of practical effects and special makeup adds a level of realism to the zombie, making them both terrifying and believable. The action sequences are well choreographed and thrilling, leaving the audience on the edge of their seat. Overall, ""Zombieland"" is a must-watch for fans of horror and comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
would have been better without Jesse Eisenberg,"This movie was very entertaining... but Jesse Eisenberg is such an annoying person... I hesitate to use the term 'actor' because he can't act, he's the same whinny, arrogant, semi-intellectual, jewish stereotype in everything I've seen him in... sometimes it works like in 'The Social Network"" and ""The Squid And The Whale"" but you just hope this guy dies to stop his goddamn voice from narrating... or at least I do.All the other actors are fine... Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are fine actors... and it works as a horror comedy, as long as you're not expecting any scares.The short running time of 88 minutes really works in it's favor as well",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"It's pretty sad when a film like this gets praised by critics... not comedy horror, just plain horrible.","Plot is recycled, unoriginal, and is a sampler of ever cliché in comedy horror. Events which are supposed to be ""shocking twists"" are extremely predictable to the seasoned movie goer. The actor playing the main character, seemed like he went to an acting class which focused on how to imitate Michael Cera (superbad). Woody Harrelson is a the only good actor in the film, and the only reason to not stop watching. The older girl, is the an extremely fake character, who apparently is wearing perfect make up, and a cute coordinated outfit in a zombie apocalypse. The surprise cameo will only be funny to a select crowd. Speaking on humor, there are almost no laugh out loud jokes, and only minor ""heh"" moments. Combat is extremely fake (shotguns have unlimited ammunition, no recoil. I only mention this because if comedy lacks, there needs to be good action, and this misses that train as well. Overall the movie would mostly appeal to teenage males, with a target viewer being a video game player. I am surprised how well this has been received, and I fear this is a new complacent direction cinema is taking. If your a comedy horror fan, go for Shaun of The Dead over this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
5 reasons this movie is better than Shawshank Redemption,"1) Humor. There wasn't much humor in Shawshank Redemption; this movie had more humor. That makes it better by my calculations. Jokes ranging from facebook to fat people to nerds filled my heart with glee. I literally ""lol""d, if you will, at many points in the movie.2) Death Scenes. Shawshank Redemption had a few death scenes, but I didn't get the point. Every death in Zombieland made sense. Every death felt important, planned out, and intrinsically important.3) Plot. Shawshank Redemption didn't make sense. How could a man get out of prison? Prisons aren't supposed to let people out, that's why they're called prisons. Shawshank Redemption forced the plot on the viewer. In Zombieland, postmodernist scripting allowed the plot gaps to be filled in with the human mind! The writing style empowers the people to solve the problems of Zombieland for themselves.4) Tim Robbins vs. Robin Williams. Let's be frank, Tim Robbins just isn't a good actor. That's why Forrest Gump won all the Academy Awards in 1994. In Zombieland, Robin Williams is funny, smart, and knows how to go out with a bang (pun intended). Robin Williams reminds the audience of Caddyshack and Ghostbusters. Tim Robbins reminds the audience of Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Anchorman. Robin Williams is just a funnier man.5) Michael Cera. Michael Cera is funny in everything he does. Zombieland is just another example of something funny Michael Sera acts in. Shawshank Redemption's best actor is probably Morgan Freeman and that's only because he was in the Dark Knight (my favorite movie). Shawshank Redemption doesn't have Michael Cera. Plain and simple.Reviewing this movie in a comparative manner to the #1 movie on IMDb will give you, probably a moviegoer yourself, a good perspective of how good Zombieland really is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
acquired taste that's really fun,"Intermittently hilarious horror-comedy set in a period where the United States of America has been plagued by a rapid strain that's led to a bloodthirsty zombie apocalypse, sans a few who do what they can to survive. Shy, phobic young whippersnapper Columbus is a loner who plays by his own strict set of rules, but those rules will be tested when he pairs up with Tallahassee, a loco, Twinkie-obsessed wanderer in the zombie kick-ass business. In the course of their journey they cross paths with a scheming sister duo hellbent on surviving. A unique and well-crafted project that lampoons and celebrates the genre in one clever swoop, this ticklishly gross, outrageous, and over-the-top bloodbath takes an all-too-familiar setup and elevates it with pitch-perfect casting--most especially badass Harrelson who looks right at home, great lines, and a particularly fantastic cameo. Unabashedly gory and smartly silly, this movie is a trip. **½",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Must See!,"I saw this movie today with a buddy of mine, and I gotta say everything else this year and throughout 2010 is gonna have a hard time trumping this one! The story was simple yet effective, and despite the idea being the Zombie Apocalypse scenario that's been said, done, and done again a thousand times over it was a refreshing new spin on the genre. The actors had solid performances, the zombies were convincing, and the gory special effects were great. Hell they even managed to get Bill Murray in there (I was searching frantically for Dan Akroid once I realized this). Solid acting, truly hilarious, and the story was great. And for any who might be thinking it, no this is far from a Shawn of the Dead ripoff. I can only say this, go see this movie!

This movie gets it just right.,"Let me start by saying this is my all time favourite film, as its on par with other great titles such as ""Shaun of the dead"", both of them falling under black comedy as a genre (you can see why I like them both.) So why is this film so good?Read on to find out!As a massive fan of the zombie genre I often find myself in the mood to watch a zombie film. Unfortunately, as more people like me become drawn to this genre the film industry pumps out more and more tacky films to make ""quick money"". These films generally are 90 minutes of action and nothing more. However not zombieland. The plot is simple, a lone survivor, nerd Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg)is making his way across America. Encountering other survivors they band together to fight the zombies, whilst trying to find those ever elusive Twinkies. Despite the previously mentioned simple plot this movie gets it just right.A great script is present,the characters bounce of each other with humorous quips that are sure to stay lodged in your brain. However the diamond in the rough lies within the characters. Something that is lacking in films now days when compared to TV shows is characters we care about. I understand why it's easier in TV shows, you have about 15 hours with the audience instead of 1 and a half. But in this film you do care about the characters, every last one of them in fact, and that's what counts. When they are in danger, you panic, not like in films when generic soldier #1 is in danger. This connection is down to the actors (superb by the way), they really portray there respective characters well, making it easy to see why they were cast.To conclude, this film has a spot on cast as well as script making for a very enjoyable few hours, and it doesn't get stale over time. So why aren't you buying it now? After all, you ""have to enjoy the little things!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A pretty good zombie movie!,"Zombies are something we will never grow tired of. For generations there have been countless zombie movies, as we, the audience, just can't get enough of people chomping on the bone matter of other people. But with so many zombie movies out there, one can't help but strike similarities with each other. Seen one zombie movie, you've seen them all, right? So what makes this zombie movie different from the rest? Zombieland is a comedy movie, not a horror movie. While some scenes are played for shocks and horror, the majority of the film plays on the comedy aspect, even in horrific situations! However, I personally believe that is the downside to this film. While this film is a comedy, I like my movies with mixes of genres. The movie could have done with some proper horror scenes.That leads to the next point. The humour. The humour is very predictable and somewhat childish, so if you are someone looking for a smart and adult movie, look elsewhere. That said, the humour does work in areas, especially with a certain someone in their house.The movie does do things right. It is surprisingly well written, the characters developed enough to keep us entertained. The zombies look great, and the kills are glorifying! And what else can you ask from a zombie movie aside from some great kills and humour to go with it? The movie entertains and it does it well, but if you are looking for somewhat long lasting and will be remembered in years to come, look elsewhere. This is not for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Unexpected zombie surprise,"Zombies are the second thing behind slashers in the Horror genre. Zombies are portrayed as funny, stupid, and brain-eating beasts, but more often scary than funny. This is like Shaun of the Dead in many ways, a funny Zombie Comedy. Director Ruben Fleischer really did a well done job on this. His future work should be impressive Jesse Eisenberg plays one of the few survivors, a dweeby, girl wishing Columbus when a mass virus turns ordinary people into crazed brain lovers. The virus is never explained. Who else but Woody Harrelson plays as Tallahassee. Thats all we need, a kick ass cowboy and a dweeb to save the world. They become friends and team up to rid the world of Zombies in the most ridiculous ways possible (not that there are any not ridiculous ways to kill zombies). They then run into Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Bresling). Sexy and Sly sisters trying to get to Claifornia to go to Pacific Playland where there are said no Zombies.Classical and Rock music are blended to create the perfect mix. The humor is non stop like Harrelson's hunt for a Twinkie. Not to mention a cameo from one of the best 80s movies. Playing a ""zombiebuster"" perhaps? Zombieland is perhaps one of the funniest Comedies of the year. Still The Hangover takes the cake for the best.Starring: Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.

Columbus of the dead,"I hate all zombie movies except Shaun of the Dead. Now I hate zombie movies except Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland. No other zombie movie has managed to make me feel so good and happy for having watched it. Production value, acting, humor, action, romance, bromance, cinematography, music, presentation, style, reference to pop culture, name the criteria, I love both movies on all levels. I am otherwise speechless and drooling at how good this movie was. And will be every time I'll be rewatching it with friends and by myself.Thank you for making me believe in Woody Harrelson again.Missing the number of lines necessary to make a review, unlike the very concise movie, I shall delve deeper into what has made it such a welcome blast in the face for me. The casting is superb. Aside the obvious thumbs up for the main cast and the triple hoorray for the surreally incredible cameo, every zombie and its victim is simply an amazing selection of vivid faces, making the opening sequence one of my favorites, along with those of Seven, Dead or Alive-Hanzaisha, and Watchmen. The zombie make-up is fantastic. Every new zombie flick seems to try a distinct look for its zombies, but fortunately this one backs up its efforts to make rotten flesh look fresh with a good plot and characters to love. Even the deleted scenes and promotional theatrical trailers in the special features expanded on the characters in completely hilarious directions. I especially love the deleted scene where the pasts of two of the protagonists are hinted/guessed at. It's a scene that is nice left out of the movie, yet must be seen to add another layer to every character involved. Just watch it. The promotional theatrical trailers give you a list of clips from the movie followed by the two main characters giving you zombie survival tips, and serve as great fillers. Very worthwhile.I can't wait to buy my own copy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Nut Up or Shut Up,"Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies.For this review, I'll refrain from comparing ZOMBIELAND with SHAUN OF THE DEAD, even though I probably will in the course of writing it. To start things off, ZOMBIELAND has one of the most beautiful opening credits scene in movie history. In fact, it's reminiscent of one I saw in WATCHMEN months earlier. But let's get to the point, much like the movie, which runs at a scant 80 minutes: ZOMBIELAND is one of those laugh-per-minute movies in which most of the jokes thrown on the screen work because they are clever and witty.It's also not one of those movies in which survivors are looking for a cure or loved ones. In fact, there's not much of a story structure in here. Just think of it as a road trip movie that happens to take place in a world filled with zombies and that's part of the fun in this movie. It's about a group of people who, at first, don't trust each other but slowly, and surely, start to grow on one another. This adds humanity to the movie. At one point, one of the characters call ANACONDA an R rated movie when it's really rated PG-13. This shows that everybody makes mistakes and aren't perfect.As funny the movie is, there's also a sweet and an endearing side to it. One such character we come to love the first minute we see him is played by Jesse Eisenberg, whom many will compare to Michael Cera, although Eisenberg has appeared in movies before Cera, including CURSED by Wes Craven. Along with him, the rest of the cast really make the movie have a higher standard than most in this genre. Woody Harrelson is just perfect for the role, having some great one-liners too. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin also do a great job. There's also one great, hilarious cameo in here which I dare not spoil. You will have to see it for yourself.Although the zombie genre may seem dead, movies like ZOMBIELAND give it a reason to stay. The movie is very funny but also has a sweet side to it. The movie has it's touching moments along with some zombie action, especially towards the end. Oh, and if you're worried about the short running time, don't worry about it. The movie felt longer than that. Watch it if you're a fan of the zombie genre. If you're not, I still think it's worth the watch.

Vastly overrated tosh for the Facebook generation,"I really can't understand why people like this film. I enjoy zombie movies like Shaun, Dawn, and even Braindead. I love comedies like John Landis & John Hughes movies, Superbad etc.Zombieland was just another annoying, self-consciously quirky addition to the recent glut of movies that seem to be written by, produced by, and made for the washed out, tasteless and cultureless facebook crowd. People like it because they think they should.The narration and self-conscious humour was excruciatingly flat and self-conscious - at times I found myself yearning to see Fight Club again just to prove to myself that good writing does exist. The zombies were uttlerly boring, the story totally tedious (I'm not just saying that, although there were a few inspired moments the story was just completely boring and really had no point). I found the weak attempts to use the zombies as metaphors for people totally stupid as well. The final line was ""if you don't have good friends, well you might as well be a zombie"".

Hilarious and enjoyable zombie comedy,"Surviving a zombie apocalypse, a group of rag-tag heroes try to survive in the world where the dead are constantly growing in numbers and try not to kill each other before the zombies do as they try to reach safety.Overall this was quite an enjoyable and fun zombie comedy. That this one stays in the realm of keeping the zombies here as something to be respected and feared in the situation which is always a plus and makes for one of the bright spots in here. The early examination of the rules for survival is a prime feature here for that, making this one treat the main creatures something to be taken seriously even though there's a lot of fun to be had here elsewhere. There's a joy to be had here from the gleeful and over-the-top ways this one goes about doling out the details here which are just quite fun and cheesy not only based on having a spectacular gimmick but also featuring an even greater way of keeping the zombies as threats here and carrying that thread along here as well. That allows this one to get in plenty of exciting action scenes here that are a lot of fun, from the opening attack in the bedroom apartment and the early road scenes of the two which provide this one with plenty of fun, action-packed scenes that offer up some comedy as well. It all gets dropped off later on during the finale at the amusement park which offers this one a large amount of gags utilizing the location to great effect, from the roller coasters and thrill rides to the souvenir shops and concession stands all coming into play here in a hail of gunfire that allows for some nice stunt-work and action along with the few comedic lines thrown in to help this one. As well, the fine make-up and gore here allows for some great-looking zombies to finally round out the positives against the rather few negatives present. The biggest issue to this one is the entire middle section to this one being play off without any attacks at all and is more of an endless stream of teasing between the girls engaging in an endless stream of mind-games that build to absolutely nothing with all of the scenes foreshadowing a finale quite easily. It's not as special as it seems to think this is and really just drags out the pacing unevenly throughout this section. As well, the film's other problem here, and one that might crop up for some where is the comedy which might be a little too goofy or cheesy to some which is somewhat of a problem for this one. These here are the film's main problems.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

So silly it had me laughing my head off,"I have just finished watching Zombieland and I have to say it is so much fun. I was laughing throughout and I'm pretty sure that I was watching it the whole way through with a silly smile on my face. That is how this film will make you feel because it is so silly, but so good at the same time.The plot is a little threadbare but I'll let you know what the plot is meant to be. Jesse Eisenberg plays Colombus, a student who is one of the few survivors of the epidemic which has turned everyone else into zombies, hence calling the USA; Zombieland. Due to him being a bit of a loner, he decides to head across the country on route to his parents in Ohio. As the film begins we see him begin his journey and via narration he tells us his situation, and also explains the rules he has to endure to survive. These rules are put forward with funky graphics on screen and with a short hilarious clip of the problems if you break them. This shows you how quirky this is going to be from the start.Whilst on route he meets a bad-ass zombie killer called Tallahassee, played brilliantly by Woody Harrelson. They become a duo and both head across America, Colombus en-route to Ohio and Tallahassee to find the last box of Twinkies in America. As they travel they encounter zombies and Tallahassee shows us why he is such a bad-ass when it comes to killing them.As they continue they meet two sisters, Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin), in a supermarket, who end up coning them and leaving them car less and weapon less. They set back off on foot and find themselves a hummer, complete with machine guns galore in the back, their lucky day. In their new car they eventually come back across the sisters and this time they join forces. The sisters are en route to a theme park, in order for the youngest sister to enjoy a bit of her childhood instead of living in a post apocalyptic world; also they believe it is zombie free. On their way they take refuge in a Hollywood stars house, resulting in a hilarious cameo, and then once again they hit the road, attempting to avoid zombies and get to know each other a little better.The film doesn't have a lot going for it in terms of story, but what it lacks in it makes up for in laughs, acting, and chemistry. So much about it is fun that you forget the films negatives. The cameo scene steals the show, and one of the lines, their final lines in fact, is absolutely brilliant. The final scene at the theme park is also great and the zombies themselves look hilarious as well as slightly scary.The four leads are brilliant together, especially Eisenberg and Harrelson. Harrelson has some great scenes when he takes out zombies, with the graphics flashing up 'killing of the week' when he makes a good take down.I can't praise this movie enough. Don't get me wrong it isn't the best film out there, and isn't the funniest comedy but it is a hell of a lot of fun. People will state that it is an American rip off of Shaun Of The Dead which I agree it probably is. The director even admits that he wanted to make this because of Simon Pegg's zombie comedy. The point is it knows it is a slight rip off but doesn't take itself seriously enough too care. Shaun Of The Dead has a better story than Zombieland, but Zombieland is just as much fun.

Great but so straightforward,"Zombieland is a great fun ride with some bloody scenes, and it has a good cast whom had a good comic timing but story lacks comedy scenes, movies in this genre like shaun of the dead which provide a strong story and more bloody scenes which is surely required for this genre. But it still manages to entertain audience that's why it is hit but story lacks motives, it dosen't even explains rightfully why they need to go to fair when they know zombies are all around, you can defend it by saying it is comedy but still sometimes you need a good script that bind the comedy scenes.
But all over it is a one time watch.
But if you want to see a great movie in this genre go for "" shaun of the dead"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Beautifully written,"This is one of the best zombie movies i have ever seen. It is able to combine so many different genres into one movie, and it works. Comedy, horror, romantic, emotional, and so many more. I don't know why i never watched it until now, but it was such a great movie, and if you havent seen it, you need to go watch. The characters mash so well together, and it had me rooting for them the entire movie. I will definitely be watching Double Tap as soon as possible because i need to know if Tallahassee gets another god damn Twinkie!!!! I don't know what else to say about it other than how much i love it. You definitely need to watch it this halloween season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"A good, fun movie that'll put a smile on your face","Zombieland ticks a lot of boxes. It's fast-paced, but not too hectic; it doesn't outstay it's welcome at a brisk 88 minutes. It's smart, but not in a too ""knowing"" way; it's doesn't treat the audience like idiots or pretend to be anything that it isn't. It just knows what it is and does it well.So, if you're looking for a fun movie to enjoy one evening, you're not going to be disappointed if you give Zombieland a go. It's not an all-time classic and probably isn't going to make many people's top-10 lists, but it's got both Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray, and it's almost guaranteed to put a smile on your face. What more could you ask for?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Energetic film,Thanks to my friend for recommended me Zombieland. It is freaking awesome and loads of entertainment. This film is one of the great example for a filmmaker because initially the script was for a TV series pilot but later it was upgraded into a feature film. We have three very talented stars too in this film such as Woody Harrelson Jesse Eisenberg. Emma Stone. and they made Amber Heard as a zombie,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Zombieland, USA","Zombieland is quite a nostalgic movie for me, as I first watched it at my babysitter's at a very young age. I remembered some details of the film, but I still felt enticed to go ahead and give it another watch. The premise of the film is basically a comedy horror film that revolves around four very different characters, yet they end up meshing together to provide an overall entertaining journey. The problem with this movie is that it is just average. A comedy horror rarely works, for me personally, but this was quite a good one. However, in terms of being an actual good film, it lacks in several aspects. I don't want to delve too deep into the specifics of the film so I will leave it at this. Zombieland is a fun film to watch with family or friends, giving the viewer an entertaining ride with a quirky cast, but don't get your hopes too high as this is just another average comedy horror film with little to take away with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombies Again?,"I have a feeling that people are actually going to enjoy this movie. If the movies Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the Dead had a baby and chose a Michael Cera wanna-be to be the main character, they would name their undead child ""Zombieland"". Destined to be a cult classic, ""Zombieland"" has everything a fan of zombie movies would ever want, comedy and gore. Director Ruben Fleischer took a risk at making another zombie movie when the genre is already so saturated with mediocre films, but for some weird reason ""Zombieland"" was able to stand out amongst the crowd. Maybe it was the casting of Woody Harrelson?Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fun and zombies...,"I love anything with zombies and of course this is something that had to be watched too. I have watched this 2009 movie several times already, and still find it to be enjoyable.""Zombieland"" has some memorable and likable characters, and the four talents in the main roles were doing good jobs in acting and bringing these characters to life on the screen. However, it was Bill Murray who totally stole the scene with his appearance.I found the movie to be lacking what I had hoped for though, which was more zombies. There were zombies, yes, but I would have liked it to have had a whole lot more of them.Lots of fun, great dialogue and memorable moments, ""Zombieland"" is a worthy addition to any zombie fan's movie collection. However, just keep in mind that this is not your average run-of-the-mill zombie movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It's another zombie comedy,"Zombieland is the newest in the genre which I will now classify as the 'zombie comedy'. The genre began perhaps with the greatest zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead'. That movie was extremely funny and one of my favourite films of 2004.Unfortunately Zombieland is very short on laughs as well as lovable, memorable characters like Shaun of the Dead. The plot meanders and then ends with a silly climax that isn't all that rewarding for the viewer. There's lots of shooting zombies and explanations of the rules of a zombie world but all-in-all it's more like a video game than an actual movie. There have been a lot of zombie comedies in the past but this isn't all that special. It's even worse than the extremely mediocre ""Fido"" which at least added the element of social satire.That's probably one element which should have been included. The social satire element was what made 'Shaun of the Dead' a great movie instead of just a good one. Using zombies as a social satire first evolved as an idea with George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978.This movie also uses 'zoombies' instead of zombies. I'm not sure why. Slow zombies are funnier, but maybe the movie wanted to separated itself from Shaun of the Dead. Save the zoombies for movies like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.There's zombie video games, board games, books, CDs, all numbers of things. Hipsters love their zombies so the movie was a guaranteed hit. Maybe that's the reason the movie was ultimately low on plot and high on concept.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
B-looting: zombie in Hollywood means cool badass,"Basically what spoils the fun for me in Zombieland is that you get the production values of a big movie while the storyline feels like a B-movie. At best.I guess this means Hollywood just kneels to pick up some low concept and try to pimp it up like a cool badass movie. I blame Tarantino for that trend: B-looting. He went on to forage it when he didn't feel too self-assured he could do more mature stuff than something always on the verge of self-spoofing.Zombieland starts out OK with an angle, an editing rhythm that makes up for the lack of originality (post-apocalyptic zombieland). But soon enough it becomes all too easy for the guys. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) is too much of a caricature of a badass with no brains. With him the movie veers off and there simply remains no prize to keep your eyes on. Boy meets girl? This is so lightly presented that it looks like it was designed for a Disney cartoon.By the time they get to BM's mansion in Hollywood (see, no spoilers here) the story already was going nowhere, with very little to fear from the zombies (hey they always have an arsenal with infinite ammo close at hand and manage to drive between crowded spots). The party at BM's is a weird pause. Or more accurately a poseur's pause. BM's joke is half-funny and they stretch it to the max... to the point they kill the joke and just decide to move on with the trodden carnival finale.Dimwits may like this stuff, but the truth is they guys who committed that were too lazy to come up with an interesting story and just self-satisfied with their ambition for an half-baked cool zombie ride.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Not Quite ""Shaun of the Dead"", But the Next Best Thing","After the zombie apocalypse (allegedly brought on by a mutation in mad cow disease), few humans are left to wander the earth, a place now called ""Zombieland"". Four of them are skilled zombie hunters who go by the names Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock. These are their first adventures as a unit, with all the tragedy and romance that comes with it. And the most important objective: find the last remaining Hostess Twinkie.Rookie director Ruben Fleischer has done a fine job with ""Zombieland"", blending comedy and more than our fair share of gore. If you don't like blood, you're watching the wrong movie. Plenty of blood spewing and dripping from every orifice, even by the time the opening credits roll. Gorehounds with a funny bone are going to lick this one up like a dripping ice cream cone.The cast is pretty much perfectly chosen: Abigail Breslin, Emma Stone, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg bring together the sort of team of gritty yet lovable leftovers that could survive in a world full of zombies. There's really nothing to complain about them, aside from Eisenberg's delivery of Columbus' annoying voiceovers. Those got old fast.I have to give credit to Amber Heard, who played the smaller role of ""406"". I really found her to be a burden in ""The Stepfather"", and in desperate need of clothes and lunch. But, mysteriously, in ""Zombieland"" her acting seemed better and she was fairly attractive -- while being fully clothed. I would like to see more of this Amber Heard, especially in the horror genre.I heard that the humor peters out in the second half, and I absolutely agree with this analysis. Not to say the second half was bad, but the jokes got a bit repetitive and I lost interest in the list of rules that Columbus keeps. I found the ongoing search for Twinkies funny and I'm glad that remained steady throughout the film. I'm unsure how I feel about the film's romantic factors: too much or too little? I have to give them credit for not getting smutty, though I wouldn't mind more skin from Emma Stone.After draft writing my own review for this film, I read the other Killer Review from my Canadian colleague Greg Roberts. I had expected a vastly different outlook, but it appears we're on the same page here. Greg says, ""The story is weak and routine... Harrelson's character gets the best one liners but the Eisenberg voice over narrative is too annoying and reminded me of Adventureland (hmmmmm)... I enjoyed the fun the characters seemed to be having during the shooting and there is a cameo that could have been done better, but is still a hoot all the same... It will make you laugh and keep you entertained. It just won't make any top 10 lists when it is done."" Greg is dead on with the cameo. I thought it was a clever idea, but didn't really impress me the way I hoped it would.The creators expressed some concerns about piracy and the sequel. Allegedly the film was downloaded at a record pace, which made the sequel less likely. Believe it or not, Internet piracy does affect the entertainment industry. Luckily, even with all the illegal copies, enough people went to the theater and a sequel seems inevitable. But it's a lesson worth learning: you do need to support films you like. If you are going to pirate (and I'm not saying you should), get chick flicks.This film is: Recommended. I can see it gaining a growing status in years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Maybe a zombie apocalypse wouldn't be that scary after all,"When you think there are no more cool zombie movies left, you just always happen to watch an awesome new one. Zombieland was another example for this fact.The whole story is built up in such a funny way that the fact that the world is taken over by zombies doesn't appear scary at all. Our main character, Columbus is a typical geek from your everydays who could only survive the zombie apocalypse due to his fear of countless things. All the characters are lovely on their own way, and it's really adorable how they become kind of a family as the movie rolls on.The great sense of humor that appears in the movie permanently makes it really enjoyable and fun to watch, and with the great soundtrack it really gives you the feeling that probably a zombie apocalypse wouldn't be that deadly after all.Not much more to say, a fun and entertaining horror comedy that will definitely give you some good laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Way overrated,"This film is about two men who struggles to stay alive in a world infested with zombies.""Zombieland"" starts out fun and stylish. The slow motion scenes is reminiscent of ""The Matrix""; while the way credits and rules appear and get destroyed on the screen look cool. However, ""Zombieland"" has a very thin plot, the first half is so boring. The thing is, they try to avoid zombies, so there is no gore, no escaping for life, no tension and no thrill. To fill time up, they senselessly wreck everything they see which is not exactly comedic. The second half is better, but by then I get bored already. I am disappointed with ""Zombieland"", and I think it is very overrated. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is way better.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Some fun laughs, some decent gore, zombies that run and an amusement park scene.","This movie is a reasonable amount of fun, I was put off a bit by Jesse Eisenberg acting like a complete ripoff of Michael Cera in this movie for an obvious attempt at some coat tail fame. However, the Michael Cera style of comedic delivery is still fun even when it's a ripoff. This movie has Jesse and Woody teamed up to try and survive. This is generally a dorky comedy with a reasonable level of intellect and creativity. They could have been a bit more edgy but as far as marketability to the unjaded non-sentient masses this movie should be a big homerun.We've seen the plot several times before - Zombie Apocalypse.. this is a lighter/funnier but equally gory handling of the topic.Loses a point for being a Michael Cera comedy style ripoff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Top 5 Zombie Movie,"Zombieland Reviewer: Josh, www.overcranked.netColumbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has made a habit of running from what scares him. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) doesn't have fears. If he did, he'd kick their ever-living ass. In a world overrun by zombies, these two are perfectly evolved survivors. But now, they're about to stare down the most terrifying prospect of all: each other. --© SonyNot since Shaun of the Dead has a zombie movie been more than just a zombie movie. Zombieland is a combination of Zombie/Road Trip/Romantic Comedy movie. There are sight gags, one liners, and plenty of witty dialogue that keeps you laughing through the horror. Sure you get everything you want out of a zombie movie as well, but the comedy in the movie is smart and makes the movie an instant classic. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson make a great comedic duo in the movie playing Eisenberg as the straight man and Harrelson being unwittingly funny. Also the narration by Eisenberg gives the movie another source of comedy that just feels right within the world of Zombieland. Eisenberg throughout the movie lists his rules for survival in Zombieland, and the way in which they are implemented into the movie is brilliant and made me laugh every time.The chemistry between Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg is very real, and you are cheering him on the whole way. This is because Eisenberg is playing a neurotic, and at times socially awkward, twenty something that has had no luck in his life. Also Harrelson has a scene that tugs at the heartstrings and gives more to his character than that he is just a zombie killing machine. Another big selling point of the movie is a cameo by a certain comedic actor that if I shed any real light on it you won't enjoy it nearly as much.When comparing this movie to other zombie comedies the only one that really stacks up is Shaun of the Dead, but Zombieland is the superior movie. Part of that is because if you don't enjoy dark humor or British humor then Shaun of the Dead doesn't reach you like Zombieland will. Zombieland mixes dark humor in with other more ""normal"" brands of comedy giving the movie a wider reach as far as getting the laughs. Also Zombieland is faster paced than Shaun of the Dead, and has far more gore in it than Shaun of the Dead. I never thought I would say it, but Shaun of the Dead has been replaced as my favorite Zombie movie.If you had any doubts about if the zombie movie genre had any steam left in it then Zombieland is going to knock that idea clean out of your head. This movie is an instant classic for me, and is one that I would pay to go see multiple times. In an attempt to not ruin any of the parts of the movie I can just assure you that this is not one of those movies where all of the good parts are in the trailer. So, hurry to the theater and watch Zombieland!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Second Best Zombie Comedy of all Time,"If you feel like you got cheated with World War Z (and I'm here to tell you- you did), you'll find an excellent antidote to that feeling with Zombieland. It starts out with one of the greatest opening credits ever with Metallica's For Whom the Bell Tolls as the theme music, and it takes off from there. This one's got good action and comedy and good character interaction as well as a cool special guest star.It runs neck and neck with Return of the Living Dead as the best zombie comedy ever. (I think they're both better than Shaun of the Dead, although that one is real close in the running as well). Zombieland gets knocked to second just for being a big time Hollywood release with a big budget and big stars. You get docked a point for that. Zombies are best as a low budget and indie subject, but it's easy to forgive them for that sin in this case.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Hilariously gruesome, gruesomely hilarious","Nebbish survivalist Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), temperamental cracker Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and a couple of grifter sisters (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) are on a post-apocalyptic road trip, trying to find a mythical place that is free of oozy and ravenous undead. Along the way they encounter numerous vivacious corpses, most of whom are messily dispatched by a variety of weapons ranging from machineguns to garden weasels. The film is both entertaining and educational, as Columbus expounds on his hard-learned rules of survival in the titular dystopia. The broad yet witty script is excellent with lots of clever lines and great sight gags, and the cast seem to be having a lot of infectious fun. Funny snuff (but definitely not for the squeamish) and a great counterpoint to the po-faced seriousness of ""The Walking Dead"" (2010) and its ilk.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Superb fun/horror film,"I am not actually a fan of horror films. One reviewer called Zombieland less scary than ""Shaun"" but I could not disagree more. I think the difference was much more violence and much more energetic directing of the action bits here than in ""Shaun"". In general there is some disturbingly brutal and visceral violence in Zombieland, whereas it was toned down in Shaun. That one was more a comedy in the midst of zombies, this one is much more a horror film with a lot of comedy. In short I find this one much scarier. Also funnier, which is because it is better written; i suspect if all the juicy ""f"" words were taken out of ""Shaun"" not much would be left. But nuff about Shaun. I think the opening credits - about 5 mins, are about the best I have seen and they already make it worth seeing Zombieland. Then the scene with the blond hottie turned zombie is also kick ass well directed and acted. The soundtrack is to crave for and I will definitely buy it. Emma Stone is amazing - a good actress and very hot in an interesting way. And the best of all - BM cameo, an absolute gem! I had a very good time thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

All films can be improved with an 11-year-old girl with a shotgun,"When I first saw the trailer for Zombieland I feared that it was simply to be a poor American copy of the classic British film Shaun of the Dead. Luckily I was wrong and Zombieland is a funny, action comedy in its own right and nearly as good as Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg's work.Two months after a virus turns most of the world's population into flesh eating zombies, Zombieland follows the survivor ""Columbus"" (Jesse Eisenberg), a social outcast who follows his list of 31 rules to survive. On the way back to home to Columbus, Ohio ""Columbus"" meets ""Tallahassee"" (Woody Harrelson), a handy man at killing zombies and on a mission to find the world's last Twinkie in world. After getting rob by two sisters, ""Wichita"" (Emma Stone) and ""Little Rock"" (Abigail Breslin) the four end up joining forces and head west to California, believing that there is an uninfected area.What makes Zombieland work is a very strong and witty script by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, excellent direction from Ruben Fleischer and top comic performances from a great cast. The writers and Fleischer were able to mix both great witty dialogue, funny lines and reactions with excellent physical humour, sight gags and violence slapstick.Fleischer is a very stylist director, with particular the opening credits set during the collapse of society and the way the rules come up on screen. He was able to make a quick paced film, with a lot of violence action. The zombies are more like the creatures in 28 Days Later and the remake of Dawn of the Dead, fast and disgusting looking: they would have fitted well in a serious horror film. Fleischer knew how to handle his set-piece and much of the action was of top quality. The style of mixing bloody violence with a light hearted tone and some serious moments, and the way it was shot reminded me of Kick-Ass (which was actually released six months after Zombieland). The writers were able to inject some character development, allowing the characters to grow from lonely and develop trust and they do allow for serious moments and make the film more then just a mindless comedy gore feast. The scene in the store reminded me a little bit of the scene in 28 Days Later.There is great chemistry between the cast. Eisenberg and Harrelson are both normal comic talents and were an fine chalk and cheese combo. Emma Stone is an actress with potential and she dominate the feisty chick role: she looked the part (and was great looking) and she worked particularly well with a big name actor in cameo role. I look forward to seeing her in the next Spider-man film, but I think she would have been perfect as Mary-Jane Watson rather then Gwen Stacy. I am sure that a bit of dialogue was ad-lipped, which is always smart thing to do in a comedy. Breslin has shown she has had a good child actress ever since her debut in Signs and that had comic talent in Little Miss Sunshine. She also worked well with Harrelson, with them arguing and have a dislike to each other and talking about Willy Nelson and Hannah Montana. Plus she had a shotgun and any film can improve if it has an 11-year-old girl with shotgun.Dave Sardy also gave the film a fitting, intense rock score, adding to fun nature of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Successful comedy - Bad drama,"This movie start up brilliantly. It got the push to get you involved and wanting more, a refreshing look and very good humor. It doesn't have as much blood as you could expect from a zombie film, although a couple of scenes are pretty gory. Anyway, as I say, the jokes, the comedy, is great. That said, things go a bit down when the film advances. There are moments when this movie tries to be serious and, at that, it fails badly. Those serious moments are supposed to be emotional. They simply slow down the movie and make it feel, well, not so good. And predictable.This is a fun film to watch and, even with the clichéd emotional moments, the funny parts and the amazing acting (except for the 2 female roles) is worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I also just loved the list for surviving in the Zombie Apocalypse created by Columbus and then seeing Tallahassee break it down that many just aren't necessary.

Nice Buddy/Zombie Pic,"Zombieland (2009)*** (out of 4)Nice horror/comedy has the world overtaken with zombies and Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) and Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) trying to find a safe harbor. It's funny that this entire movie is built around zombies yet they're not the best thing about the film nor are they really the most important. I think we get a few nice jokes built around the zombies like the overweight people being the first to die during the outbreak simply because they couldn't run fast enough. We even get a few more funny jokes about the ""rules"" of trying to stay alive. For me, however, the best part of the film was the actual road picture and the relationship between the two men and eventually the sisters (Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin) who join them. Both sides are so different that you can't help but have a wonderful time with them and this is especially true of the men. They're meeting and eventual getting to know one another leads to plenty of wonderful scenes including an instant classic where a Hostess truck is crashed off the road and Harrelson goes to investigate in hopes of finding a certain tasty treat. Another highlight happens when we get Eisenberg's flashback to the girl next door finally taking note of him. What really makes the film work are the performances with Harrelson showing why he's such a great comic talent whenever given the proper screenplays. He hilarious here and delivers his finest work in many years. Eisenberg is equally good and his scenes with Stone are very charming and cute. There's also countless gore for the horror fans but it's all done in a rather tasteful manor, or at least as tasteful as it can get. I do feel the film begins to drag a bit but that's just a minor issue to an otherwise fun movie. The funniest bit has to do with a cameo that I won't ruin for those who don't know about it. The payoff is perhaps the biggest laugh I've had in many, many years.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An Entertaining Hit,"For some reason I put this one back on the shelf and refused to watch it, even when I was going through a major zombie/horror movie phase a few years ago, probably because I wasn't in the mood for this type of irreverent/silly comedy when I craved something more substantial and serious.Well, that was a mistake because I had a really good time with this one. It's really well made, has great effects and is pretty funny, which just goes to show that you shouldn't judge anything by its cover or preconceived misconceptions.I also appreciated the musical interludes with snippets from Band of Horses and The Velvet Underground popping up from nowhere.I still can't quite believe I rated this movie a 'seven', however, but it deserves it for pure entertainment and fun, albeit with a silly zombie twist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Still don't (quite) get it,"Okay, so I've pretty much seen and enjoyed most zombie films – everything from George A Romero's offerings to the general silly B-movies featuring shuffling corpses eating people's brains. So I was always going to put 'Zombieland' on my 'to watch' list. As soon as I heard it pretty much had A-list actors in it and a theatrical release, I was definitely looking forward to it. Plus it's worth noting that most people who saw it loved it.I didn't love it.Granted, I didn't hate it. It kind of left little impression on me – neither good nor bad. Yeah, there were some humorous moments where I giggled, but, generally, I found it a bit forgettable. As the title would suggest, the world has been overrun by the living dead and there are few humans left, desperately trying to survive. Jessie Eisenberg is our 'hero' who talks us through the 'rules' of how to live in a world where most of the population is trying to eat you. His voice-over is pretty funny, but after the first act it kind of drops off when he meets his 'love interest' and they head to a theme park.I think the biggest flaw in it comes near the end. I'm not sure I can mention it as it probably constitutes a 'spoiler,' but it's generally to do with a weird (and rather stupid) decision made by the two girls which totally goes against anything a sane person would do in a world infested by zombies.For some reason I just couldn't really get over that and no matter how good the rest of the film was, that one moment of madness (involving doing something that literally drew the attention of every flesh-eater in Los Angeles to them).After a second viewing I do like it a little more. It's not a bad film. It has gore. It has laughs and it has a good celebrity cameo from Bill Murray. I just wish they'd changed that one (theme park-related) aspect towards the end. It really bugs me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Move over Scary movie, there's a new horror comedy in town","Zombieland is probably the best horror comedy I have seen since the first Scary Movie. Shaun of the Dead was good but for some reason or another I never thought of it as being a classic unlike some others, but I feel it might become a cult favourite in a few years. And yet, I feel the same way about Zombieland. I have seen this movie on it's opening weekend, but I just haven't had the time to review it. The laughs just kept coming and coming and I'll admit I jumped maybe twice throughout the movie, but as far as I'm concerned this movie is more focused on laughs than scares. The acting is good, especially for Woody Harrelson as Tallahasse. That zombie-killing redneck is my favourite character of the whole bunch thanks to Harrelson's portrayal of him. Of course Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus should not be forgotten as well: The opening sequence with him and his rules marked me and my friends for a long time and his character was very truthful. Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) were also very convincing as a group of sisters who hijack, trick people into giving them money and more bad stuff.

Flashy entertainment without a message,"I had some fun watching this movie as it works as a horror comedy, but at the same time lately I feel guilty giving this kind of movie a high rating. There's just nothing new to be added, instead, the same plot elements get further condensed and reduced every time, like a new snapshot of a well-know monument.The thing is that people apply the same rating for different kinds of movies. I gave this one a 7 for good but mindless entertainment, but it can't be helped that it will rank there on the same level as other movies which get a 7 for being cinematic-ally or plot-wise interesting. That's just the way it goes. Comedies that the broad public enjoys as funny are usually not clever at the same time, or would you rate American Pie as a cinematic masterpiece? At least Zombieland also worked on the character level so you could identify with the main characters (yes, that's you, nerd).While I have the impression that the bar is constantly being lowered plot-wise these days and plot is being replaced by violence, grossness or any other kind of exaggeration, I also notice that due to the shorter attention span of the twitter generation the run time of movies gradually gets shorter. This one was over just after 80 mins, the rest was credits (and an outtake). And speaking of exaggeration, I also felt that the Bill Murray cameo was exaggerated, the same has been done before, also with Bill Murray as the supposed center of a film cult.As the philosopher said, every nation gets the president it deserves and the audience gets the movies they deserve... and pay for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A  Most  Excellent Zombie Comedy,"This delightful stylish zombie comedy delivers the chills, thrills and laughter. It sets a perfect sample what a good zombie comedy or any movie should be-- great characters meet a good story. Two desperados out to survive the zombie new world setting up rules and eating Twinkies, meet up with two of the toughest bitches still kicking, and set out to prove that their still fun in a world where humanity membership has expired.This movie packs a punch starting with a well crafted story, full of tension and funny scenes, I'm a sucker for the cardio scene where it show is good to keep fit, and when in doubt kill it twist. Nothing like a good Twinkie binch to bring the hero in anyones soul.I urge to go out and rent or buy this one, a most for zombie movie collectors.

Horrible zombiada,"Bad movie, bad taste, all is bad, bad, bad. The ""humor"" is so grotesque, so inhumane, so over the top that in and of itself it is laughable that this flick is filed as ""Comedy."" Obviously big budget, the cinematography meets professional standards, but the content of the flick defeats any achievement in its movie-making quality per se.Harrelson, a good actor, delivers a good performance. But how good of a performance can it be if the whole film is so trashy? Zombies eating flesh and running maniacally in traffic, stores and climbing up the superman ride of Magic Mountain? Who pays to watch such movies in the first place? Obvisouly the idea of the producers was to appeal to the younger, undeveloped audience, deprived of parental control, whose peak of excitement is gory jokes and bathroom humor.One of the great lines is: ""Can't we drive for four hours like normal Americans!"" What is a normal American, if not someone who would not be watching a terrifying flick like this? O, I almost forgot: there is romance. The romantic exchange between the main character and one of the teen females is entirely pathetic at the backdrop of the rest of the zombification galore.There is nothing good, no redeeming value in ""Zombieland.""

"Quite enjoyable, but not great","What I enjoy about this movie is that it does not try to be more than what it is: a family road-trip with zombies along the way.
The acting is incredible, be it with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone or Jesse Eisenberg. Special mention to Woody Harrelson because the dude just kills it! The guy is the coolest guy I have seen on screen in a while.
The CGI is ok, visuals and directing are competently made.
The plot has a lot of faicilities and I am not a fan of some choices. For example, the fact that every rule is written on the screen. For something that is repeated so many times during the movie, I find that Fleischer kind of takes the spectator for a dumbass. I am also not a fan of Jesse Eisenberg as narrator and I believe the film would have been a bit better without a guy explaining everything about it instead of just showing us who he is on screen. Kind of lazy I find.
Anyway...enough nitpicking, I enjoyed the ride and look forward to seeing the second one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Geeky Randy's summary,"Critically acclaimed zombie comedy about a group of apocalypse survivors trying to find a sanctuary. Starts off very promising, with awkward college student Eisenberg and violently Twinkie craving Harrelson learning new skills from each other while also revealing their tragically humorous histories. Unfortunately, Stone and Breslin come along and—while initially helping add elements and humor to the plot—ultimately ruin all the fun, with Stone becoming a love-interest to Eisenberg, and Breslin offering nothing except lame jokes on adolescent ignorance and obliviousness. Started as a spec script for a TV pilot, and even with its short runtime, the film gets less and less interesting as it progresses. Still, despite the easy jabs at the movie's imperfections, it is without a doubt hilarious and entertaining, and even at some points classic.*** (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Plenty of fun, but a wish-fulfilment zombie movie is something of a paradox.","The opening riffs tell you all you need to know. The first scene riffs on the Scream-style survival rules of a horror movie. The second riff is from Metallica's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls'.Zombie flicks, like eighties thrash metal, might appear oppressive to the uninitiated, but to the fans they are thrillingly fun. And Zombieland is very much a movie for the fans. Not a Shaun of the Dead-esquire homage to Romero and the like; but an homage to the fans.The characterisation is simple. Our heroes are named by their destinations- Columbus and Tallahassee- and defined by their driving desires. Geeky Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) craves the opportunity to chastely brush a girl's hair behind her ear, while badass redneck Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) lops off undead limbs in search of the world's last Twinkie.These are less characters than they are avatars for the fans. The title invites us into a theme park for ninety minutes of whack-a-zombie. Columbus has the aforementioned list of rules of how to survive a zombie apocalypse, addressing lore that any fan will have fun recognising. The characters take perverse pleasure in discussing the most disgusting zombie kills they've witnessed, sounding like true gorehounds. And they ratify for us that great (yet curiously unaddressed) desire we all share about post-apocalyptic living: they break stuff. For fun.But that's also the problem with Zombieland; it's too much fun. It's too slickly presented, concerned with looking cool and getting laughs, and seemingly forgetting to be scary. It's a balance that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright managed to get right with Shaun of the Dead. They understood that the laughs come hardest when they puncture genuine tension. Without the peril and the fatalism, Zombieland feels a little lightweight.Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable ride, with funny performances from Eisenberg and Harrelson, as well as a delightful cameo that heightens the fanboy fantasy feel of the movie. But for all the human meat munching it displays, Zombieland is a little too much like confectionery.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

It was okay.,"Zombieland is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the USA, where zombies have taken over due to a mad cow disease epidemic. It follows Columbus, a shy but intelligent college boy, as he tries to make his way back to Ohio from Texas while avoiding the undead. Columbus meets Tallahassee, a zombie-hunting cowboy who loves Twinkies, and together they team up with Wichita and her sister Little Rock. They all embark on a road trip to find a zombie-free haven, with their destination being the Pacific Playland theme park outside L. A.What sets Zombieland apart from other zombie movies is its dry and quirky sense of humor and the fun and relatable characters. Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, who is dorky and awkward, while Woody Harrelson is the charming and badass Tallahassee. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin add to the movie's heartwarming dynamic as the protective sisters.The movie's humor is well-complemented by a kinetic visual style, such as Columbus's rules flashing on the screen. However, it does have some pacing issues, with a great first act followed by a somewhat dragging and aimless second act at Bill Murray's house. Nevertheless, it redeems itself with an inspired final shootout at Pacific Playland, which is a relentless display of gory zombie slaughter set against the backdrop of flashy amusement lights.While comparisons to similar movies like Shaun of the Dead are inevitable, Zombieland possesses its own distinctive personality and stands confidently on its own merits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
You'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining way to spend 90 minutes.,"Zombieland boasts the funniest opening credits sequence of the year. A stripper zombie chases an overweight business man down the street. Countless shots of gory, comical attacks on petrified humans. Blood splatters and chunks of skin fly. All in super cool, super-slow motion. If Antichrist used this technique to add poignancy and effect in it's opening moments, Zombieland uses it purely for laughs. It works. And it sets the tone perfectly for what is to come.Director Ruben Fleischer doesn't attempt to cover up the silliness of it all. He goes for broke on unashamedly cartoonish violence and slapstick humour. He doesn't give a second thought to what the critics will say. Truth is, his balls-out approach is what makes the movie so easy to indulge in. There's barely a dull moment and when the talkative scenes start to slow things down you know something is about to jump out... and most likely get brutally murdered just as suddenly. Or perhaps a classic comedian will appear for a gut-bustingly funny cameo. Either way, Fleischer never loses sight of the desired result.The male duo on screen are excellent. Their polar opposites share undeniable chemistry as they go back and forth with increasingly amusing banter. Harrelson continues his current career-reinvention with another great character: Tallahassee is up for beefcake of the year with his beyond-macho persona and comic-book style antics. Eisenberg, aka Michael Cera with curls, follows his Adventureland success with pretty much the exact same shtick, assumedly living by the maxim ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Their relationship develops predictably, but when you are enjoying their company so much, who cares? The oestrogen providers, Stone and Breslin, offer up little to rave about, their roles not much more than plot-pushers.Flawed and excessive without doubt, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining way to spend 90 minutes.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
goes from funny to dumb in a flash,"I saw this film on a truly huge screen with a bunch of people who were, like me at the time, right into seeing a no holds barred zombie film. I can remember thinking at the end , it was like poetry, but not quite. I saw it again and I realized that Woody Harrelsons character was talking about a puppy named Buck at one point and then a boy named Buck later on in the film. I can overlook that what was supposed to be Bill Murrays place in Beverly Hills probably really belonged to Bette Midler, but I think the mixing up who or what Buck was supposed to be was just downright dumb. Maybe the people who make these movies just think people are dumb. Maybe it is some kind of calculated insult.

This is very special because i have lived in Austin my whole life and my dad grew up in garland. The movie ends in LA, where my stepmother grew up. these 4 humans make there way half way across the country battling the undead.

Lightweight quick-witted subgenre movie.,"If there is actor better suited than Woody Harrelson to play comically disturbed tough guys he probably doesn't have enough juice to open a film. His casting and that of Jesse Eisenberg as the nebbish-y Columbus Ohio elevate this feather-weight zombie comedy from good to very good. The plot which could be thoroughly summarized on an index car is also aided by gimmicks including titles which interact physically with the world of the film (similar to TV's ""Fringe"") and some ""Lost"" style flashbacks. The rapid-fire and snappy dialogue (reminiscent of ""The Girlmore Girls"") also helps although there are obvious gaps where the writers take a breath after running short of it. To his credit, neophyte director Rubin Fleischer does not resort to gore that to fill the slow parts and limits the heavy blood-play almost exclusively to the beginning exposition of the zombie infection. Zombie films are often interpreted as societal allegories and this one could also be viewed in that light. The characters spend a lot of time driving a Cadillac Escalade and a yellow Hummer H2 the two least politically correct vehicles. Harrelson's Tallahassee is travelling the ruined U.S. society in search of Twinkies, the least politically correct food. The two female con artist characters (there are all of 6 total characters) have set for their post-apocalyptic goal getting to the Pacific Playland Amusement park -- such parks are the least politically correct and environmentally unkind form of entertainment. The Columbus character has managed to survive because he abides by a set of politically correct rules (another gimmick) that effectively make him a zombie of sorts. So is the spread of the zombie virus a means of lampooning the spread of political correctness so pervasive that nearly everyone thinks and behaves in a self-pious homogeneous fashion? Maybe. Although the hilarious Bill Murray vignette in the center of the film doesn't quite fit the thesis. Murray's classics including ""Stripes"", ""Meatballs"" and ""Ghostbusters"" are risqué at times but never counter-cultural. Deeper meaning or not, this is a film worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Twinkies, v1.01","I found this by searching for features by Abigail Breslin, Emma Stone was a big additional plus. A fun, watchable zombie story.The story also set me to searching for Twinkies, a piece of USA culture that occurs frequently in stories and discovering that they are vegetarian and at my local supermarket allowed me to find out that they are something that I personally prefer to avoid. That also led me to wondering about Fat Cakes as in iCarly and the real world equivalents I found were totally brilliant, until I discovered that some were not vegetarian, but some are.The Abigail character rates 'Hannah Montana' a lot, so I followed that through but did not find the series as watch-able. Miley Cyrus features are better and I rate 'So Undercover' (2012)Other zombie stuff I have seen recently includes Warm Bodies, very different but equally memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Gives some real bite to it's characters,"Zombieland goes to prove that one of the key elements needed to produce a good movie is producing likable characters. It's premise is very simple, 99% of the the worlds population has been wiped out by this virus and the survivors are on a trip to LA with the bad ass Tallahassee (Harrison) leading the charge of this very well assembled cast. In addition to this there is an hilarious cameo role played by Murray that probably worth watching the movie for on it's own. The zombies obviously play an important part and contribute to scares and humorous moments but the beauty of this movie is that the four central roles produce the vast majority of good that comes from it. There's nothing wrong with zombieland, it's well acted, well directed and very funny and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Shaun Of The Dead when it comes down to zombie horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
OMG this is some funny a$$ sh*t!,"Saw it in the movies. Loved it. Bought the DVD. Just watched it => felt obliged to spend my 2 cents on it. I think this along with the original ""Dawn if the dead"" are two of the best zombie movies ever, period: DotD delivers the message with blood n guts, ZL delivers the laughs with blood and guts... and some. On the surface, this is like ""Hatchet"" with Zombies with some of that post-Scream self-aware. But I'm also willing to claim that under the surface, there's more: I would go so far as to say that this is like both a parody and a right-on-the-spot take on the post generation-X comedies... a Kevin Smith movie, ""Dazed and confused""... or perhaps, most fittingly, ""Say anything"" with zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is perfectly cast as ""Columbus"", a geek who gets a rude awakening into a world suddenly overrun by flesh-eating corpses. Woody Harrelson is perfectly cast as a trigger-happy mentor who picks Columbus as his sidekick. And Emma Stone... perfectly cast, playing the damsel in distress/ femme fetale along with... (sorry. I just got lost in her reindeer-in-the-spotlight eyes. Did I mention she's perfectly cast?) with an okay Abigail Breslin on her tow. That's about all you need to know. Won't spoil you the fun, but all I can tell you that there's plenty of it: I'm an 34 year-old Finn with a master's degree, and I laughed my ass off along with all the 18-year-olds in the crowd.

There is an audience for that, and they deserve this movie of course, I'm just not part of it.Our protagonists have arcs, we find out at the very... very end of the movie.

Zombieland A Funny Horror Comedy,"Zombieland is a funny horror comedy which turned out to be much better than I expected. Director Ruben Fleischer is admirable in making this movie about four people trying to survive an apocalyptic world that has been taken over by zombies. The film has a nice balance between character development, the humor, and the action which mostly involves the zombies getting killed in gruesome but hilarious ways. The cast are very impressive in their roles including Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin who seem to be having a blast in this movie. Harrelson and Eisenberg have great comic chemistry with each other. They played off one another very well which made their growing friendship believable. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are just as good as two smart sisters who reluctantly join Harrelson and Eisenberg on a road trip across the country. The four actors also played off each other well during their scenes together. With that said, Zombieland ended up being much better than I thought it was going to be and the film left me feeling entertained. I can see why a lot people and critics for the most part enjoyed it. There's a surprise cameo by a well known actor halfway through who makes the best of his small part. I can't really think of anything I didn't like about this movie. Zombieland has it all character development, plenty of humor, drama, and a little suspense with just enough zombie action. I'd recommend you see this without knowing too much about it because it might ruin the experience for you.

The movie starts with Columbus, who is a college student at the University of Texas that shares rules throughout the movie on how to survive a zombie apocalypse. The survivors all meet crossroads with one another and end up making travels together. The first destination was Columbus, Ohio which was where Columbus' parents lived. Tallahassee was determined to go to Florida in search of ""Twinkies"". Wichita and Little Rock were eager to get to an amusement park near Los Angeles, California, which was rumored to be zombie-free. The group's different ending destinations create conflicts at different points throughout their adventure.One of the main themes in the movie is isolation. Isolation is shown throughout the movie. Isolation is shown through each of the character's personalities. Columbus is an individual that lived far away from his family and had very few friends, even before the zombie apocalypse. Tallahassee 'admits his feelings of isolation through the loss of his son. Wichita and Little Rock started off only trusting each other and even though they found Columbus and Tallahassee who were two other survivors that could aid them in their travels, they chose to go against their backs and rob them as they wanted to travel just the two of them. These character traits, leaving each of them feeling isolated, prevented them from finding out much about one another.Dark lighting throughout the movie created the intense feeling of not knowing what is about to come next. Dark lighting helps the audience grasp the feelings of the characters. Dark lighting and not knowing what is about to come next contributes to the film's theme of isolation. Another filmmaking element that contributed to the theme was the choice of setting and background. Usually, the pack traveled along countryside two-laned roads. Usually there was not much else around when the pack traveled except for abandoned cars. This leaves the viewer left with a sense of emptiness and isolation. Each group member was isolated in their own way but further into the film each members feelings of being isolated starts to fade away.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Rating: A-,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I haven't seen Zombieland in quite a few years, but with its sequel being released this week, now it's the perfect moment to go back to the hilarious world of zombies. It still holds up incredibly well. In a time where zombie films and TV shows were starting to come up (The Walking Dead premiered one year later), this post-apocalyptic zombie comedy flick still remains as one of the best zombie movies of the century. Their use quickly became something cliche, and neither funny or scary. Nowadays, people are used to seeing the living dead on the screen all the time, so why does a 2009's film like this still work?Well, first of all, the outstanding cast is halfway through success. In 2009, only Woody Harrelson was already a renowned adult actor. Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg didn't star in anything truly remarkable yet, so much that Abigail Breslin was more recognizable than them. Even with only 13-years-old, she already had an Oscar nomination in a supporting role (Little Miss Sunshine). However, everyone delivers fantastic performances, which carry the simplistic yet entertaining story to such a success that it became a zombie classic.Harrelson portraying Tallahassee, the guy who's not scared of anything and likes to ""enjoy the little things"", is one of his career's coolest roles. Eisenberg is not exactly the type of actor I like since he can only do so much with his acting abilities. He always offers the same type of character: a quirky, twitch-full, idiosyncratic personality, which most of the times doesn't work. Contrary to this tendency, Columbus is a character that logically and hilariously fits this model, hence Eisenberg is the movie's primary source of comedy. From his list of rules to his weird behavior, everything feels natural since the character's background justifies his awkward self.Stone and Breslin share great moments together, as well as Harrelson and Eisenberg, but the former duo has less exciting sequences. Nevertheless, even though the girls could have received more character development, their relationship gives them a compelling reason for us to care about. Wichita might just look like the cliche hot girl who falls for the good guy, but she would do anything to protect her sister, and her love for Little Rock does give her some gravitas. The cast's chemistry is undeniably astonishing. It's visually palpable that they had tons of fun doing this film, and that elevates every single conversation or action scene.The short runtime allows for a fast-paced story, packed with fun moments, and a lot of bloody zombie killings. The production design is remarkable. Excellent use of practical effects and real sets, plus a perfect soundtrack. Ruben Fleischer knew precisely what he wanted the movie to be, and he never tried to make it something more. Yes, it still involves a romance of sorts, and some backstories might not be funny or joyful. However, it never feels forced or fabricated. It never overextends its stay because Zombieland is neither a romance or a drama. It's purposefully campy, plays with stereotypes creatively, and it's merely 88 minutes of good fun. We are in 2019, and studios forgot how to make films like this!Every year, there are dozens of blockbusters that would be extremely entertaining if studios would just let them be what they are meant to, but no. They need to have some relevant story that carries a political tone or a social message. Zombieland has all the attributes of a pure blockbuster: a phenomenal cast, a straightforward narrative packed with thrilling sequences, a short runtime with fast pacing, compelling characters, and thousands of zombies. Put together a funny screenplay filled with chuckle-worthy jokes, and you have yourself one of the best zombie movies of the century. It's one of those films which don't exactly have what people address as ""flaws"". Zombieland has its cliches and lazy exposition, but it heavily compensates them with 80 minutes or so of spectacular entertainment. It's a zombie cult classic. Nut up or shut up, but watch the goddamn movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Hit and Miss,"Zombieland is not dissimilar to Shaun of the Dead in its level of probing satire and bleak humour. The half indie-horror and half angsty comedy - on a level parring with Juno - Zombieland uses the undead as a metaphor for growing up, the inevitable fight between wild youth and the grey conformity of adulthood, and where else are we safe but a theme park completely devoid of all zombies. The longer I think of Zombieland the smarter it gets, but unfortunately I didn't really enjoy watching it that much enough to want to watch it again. The ever-pleasing Emma Stone was wonderful once again, however not much else is there to stifle the interest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
what if you were one of the last survivors of a Zombie Armageddon?,Zombieland attempts to answer that question. the time is now the Zombie takeover began when a customer ate a tainted hamburger at a truck stop the burger had a new stain of Mad cow disease instead of killing him it made him into a cannibalistic Zombie with anger issues. Everyone he bites transforms into killer zombies those who don't survive become Food. Simple plot into this chaos comes Columbus and Tallahassee two survivors who team up with the understanding that once they reach their destination they will go their own way. However they like each others company and they know that being together increases their chances of survival. then they meet two sisters Little Rock and Wichita who are con artists and take the boys for a ride every chance they get. They too realize that the strength in numbers will work for them survival wise. Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee is a Zombie hating Twinkle addicted Gunfighter who turns Zombie killing into an art form. He makes the movie it is his movie hands down. The rest of the cast compliment him wonderfully they add to his strengths and add to the fun of the film. It's a fun shut off your brain don't question it or take it too seriously movie. I hear Zombieland 2 is being considered and I hope so because this is the beginning of a beautiful franchise.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Columbus Crew,"I rewatched ""Zombieland"" on Saturday in preparation for the sequel this weekend. I was surprised to discover that although I still feel positively about the film, it's both slighter and shorter than I remembered and I didn't love it as much as I thought I did.Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg) seems an unlikely survivor of the Zombie apocalypse, but several months in he's still alive and living by his list of rules. He runs into Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who seems destined for this new environment, and then sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). Together they traverse the US, headed for Los Angeles, and for an amusement park, legend has it, is Zombie freeNot sure quiet why, over the last decade, ""Zombieland"" has gone from a movie I loved to one I just liked. Maybe it's the proliferation of that sort of irreverent, gore spattered fun that has made it feel less unique and distinctive than it once did. Some, but not all, of it feels a little more tedious than it once did. I was surprised about how short the film was, coming in at less than 90 minutes as that wasn't part of my recollection of the film. I think you can see how the film is a pilot script filled out to get close to running time. You can also see that legacy in the plot of the film, it's pretty ... inconsequential, I suppose. It's more a collection of things that happen, rather than a real story that builds to anything.This is all, again, not to say that I suddenly now don't like the film. The CG effects are starting to show their age a little, or perhaps are starting to betray the budget of the film a bit, but the practical effects are really good. It is consistently funny, particularly with regards the dialogue and interaction. I love the characters and how the cast play them. I like Eisenberg's narration, I enjoy spending time with these people.It's just that I didn't quite enjoy the film as much as I thought I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Visually Stylish.Acting was good.,"Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said, this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers', Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film, which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear, but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style & sensibility. Jesse Eisenberg (who has a certain Michael Cera shyness/eccentricity to his delivery, but doesn't seem nearly as pathetic as Cera's characters often come off) carries the film well. And of course, everyone is talking about the film's 'secret' cameo, and rightly so. It is absolutely the best and most fun part of an already awesomely fun film -- and it kept me laughing almost non-stop throughout that 10-15 minute section of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombieland (8/10),"After Shaun of the Dead, zombie-comedies came out in full force with a lot of good flicks and a lot of bad. Perhaps the #2 zombie-comedy according to many since Shaun is that of Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland. Right off the bat, Zombieland presents a comedic rulebook in order to survive a zombie apocalypse. The film's quirky writing style left a lot of possibilities for fun characters and interested actors to fill roles. The casting managed to snag some big A-listers, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Wood Harrelson, and Abigail Breslin. The story is centrally focused on the four characters named after U.S. cities, and follows them along as they venture out looking for safe havens. The gore and zombie action is top notice, lots of good original dialogue but most of all it's truly a funny flick. Take a look at Zombieland in case this was overlooked, it wouldn't be a regret.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombieland,"A very light and enjoyable movie to watch with family and friends. It has a simple but engaging plot and the slow motion cinematography is a cherry on top . Actors share great connection and play their roles with passion. The zombie designs are detailed and all vary immersing you into the movie experience, one of the only movies that truly make you laugh purely out of good comedy.The movie looks very pleasant aesthetically wise and has a lot of plot twists throughout it leading you off tracking but also keeping you entertained and intrigued. Easy to develop a liking to all the characters creating tense moments for the viewer.Recommend this movie to anyone who wants to just have a good laugh and take their mind off of things:)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Z-Land,Zombie land is an interesting spoof on the genre. Slick and stylized. It's fun but it's missing something to really push it into proper greatness.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Catches most of the love behind the Zombie fantasy.,"Zombieland - The world is once again (or maybe it's the same virus as the one in Shaun of the Dead) ravaged by a virus that turns the world's population into hordes of mobile (is the running/walking debacle really so worthy of ire? Either would destroy the world) cannibals. The main character is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a squeamish nerd who has survived so long because of strict adherence to a rulebook that neatly skips over most of the mistakes horror film characters fall prey to. He soon meets Tallahassee (played with vinegar and vigor by Woody Harrelson), a man with a savage penchant for killing zombies. They meet two untrustworthy young women (Emma Stone and Abigail Bresnin) and the four slug it out joyfully in an apocalypse of enormous proportions.The film marvelously captures most of the love most teenage men have for the zombie scenario. In a word or two: legitimized anarchy. If the story lacks direction for any reason it's this. One of the best sequences (of which there are several) shows the foursome breaking everything in a shop just because they can. The jokes come often and are amusing, with pop culture references aplenty. One cameo made me fall in love with the film. There really is nothing like the comedy greats of the 80s and 90s, is there? The opening credits sequence would be the best if the Dawn of the Dead remake hadn't done theirs so perfectly.The film only sparingly adheres to reality so as not to detract from the fantasy. Running out of ammunition never seems to happen. It's hard to imagine three out of four of the crew, capable as they are at times, faring any better than millions of other people, much less the US Army. But speculation about that hardly seems the point of the film. The final quarter is nothing if not constant visceral fun.If I have some minor issues, apart from the ammo tiffs, it's this: The casting of the film seems extremely calculated. We have a kid that looks and acts like Michael Cera, the hot girl from Superbad, the cute kid from Little Miss Sunshine, and Woody Harrelson. If there weren't zombie nudity, blood, and cussing here I'd say it's practically a family friendly film. I've become a little less of a fan of comedy relying on pop culture over the years because it relies on an audience's knowledge of other films, not the film standing on it's own merits. But I don't want to flog an undead horse too harshly, especially such an entertaining one. I'd gladly watch Zombieland again, and it remains at least the second best zombie comedy ever.The masses have spoken: we love us some zombie films, and it is a fantasy that will likely spawn countless more movies, both comedic and horrific, being made. And for once, I'm okay with that. A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombies!! Entertainment!! Fun!!,"It's been quite a while since I've seen a good zombie movie. The last one I saw was Land of the Dead, which was so horrid that it completely put me off the genre for a while. Thankfully, Zombieland came along to remind me of why I like these kinds of movies so much.Zombieland doesn't try to make any grand social statements, or critique the ills of modern day society. It's just a funny, enjoyable ride. The small cast is uniformly great, the story zips along at a lively pace, and (maybe most importantly) lots and lots of zombies meet their end in violent and creative ways. This isn't a revolutionary movie, by any means. It doesn't do anything that hasn't been seen before in the genre, but does everything it borrows, fairly well. Bring on the sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The zombies are fast, scary and hungry, and it is a movie that entertains. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Above average horror comedy,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a post apocalyptic world in the not too distant future, Earth has been taken over by zombies and formerly nerdy kid Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has had to buff up to fight off the maurauding masses. He crosses paths with Tallahasse (Woody Harrelson) a naturally tough, no nonsense redneck with his own demons to fight (on the inside.) But they soon find themselves in a battle of wits with two sisters, the older, beautiful Wichita (Emma Stone) and her feisty younger sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) before they figure it'll work better to work together...The zombie movie franchise is alive and booming at the moment, both played straight with the new batch George A. Romero keeps dropping out and in terms of serving as spoof fodder, since the formula is so familiar. So much so that Zombieland keeps serving up self referential quips, with the rules that Columbus has established for himself constantly flipping up on screen in order of how he thought them up, which do have a bearing with how characters tend to survive in these sorts of films. Although it isn't a brilliant film, it somehow worked for me much more than the over rated Shaun of the Dead.Cast wise, Harrelson could carry the role of the tough, grizzly redneck in his sleep, constantly cracking wise and at one point revealing an unexpected, dramatic trauma from his past that's as out of nowhere (and sort of out of place) as a similar scene in the aforementioned SOTD. Otherwise, Stone is sexy and sassy as Wichita. Eisenberg and Breslin are decent in their roles, but are secondary to the two I could write home about in a film with such a short cast list.Short and sweet at 81 minutes, this is a forgettable but worthwhile send up, better than SOTD or even the more recent British counterpart Doghouse. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Oh yes....just a great bloody ride!,"I have 3 words for this movie: BEST CAMEO EVER! This movie was very very well done with just the right mix of gore, plot and humor. To build a zombie movie strictly on a foundation of drama and horror is to invite disaster. Sure there have been movies to do that well, The original Night of the Living Dead, for example, 28 Days, and even I am Legend. But more times than not if taken too seriously, a zombie movie without an element of humor just tends to be grim and joyless and just not much fun to watch. Zombieland was just a great film that was infinitely enjoyable on multiple levels!One of the things I found most interesting was the lack of back story given in the setup. The country is overrun by zombies with very few survivors, yet the electric, gas and water still work. We are given a brief history of the outbreak and aftermath but besides that, very little further information. I suppose it is just a given with the movie makers that the major utilities are on autopilot and will simply continue to run until any vital machinery gives out. It is not a bad supposition, and makes for a more colorful and visually exciting world, but it does strain credibility somewhat. Aside from that minor detail, everything else was as nearly perfect as it can be for a film such as this. The casting was brilliant! Woody Harrelson was simply perfect as the efficient and effective zombie killer. Jesse Eisenberg was a great in his role as his nebbish traveling companion...though at times his mannerisms were reminiscent of other actors whose stock in trade are similar. By that I mean that you could have dropped Michael Cera or Topher Grace (as Eric Foreman) into the role as ""Columbus"" and it would have been a seamless replacement. This isn't a bad thing, but rather a bit predictable.OK, to sum up: Fantastic movie that was just fun to watch. One of the first movies that I didn't adjourn to the parking lot to have a smoke at some point...and that is high praise. Usually you can see a dull spot or lull in the story from a mile away and can therefore pick a spot to have a smoke without missing anything vital. With this movie, I didn't find anywhere that I felt I could take that quick smoke break. I knew that the pacing of the film was such that as soon as a slow point did appear, it was going to be here and gone just THAT quickly. Again...not to spoil is for anyone, but, BEST CAMEO EVER! and that is all I shall say. When you see the movie, you will know of whom I speak.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"ZOMBIELAND (Ruben Fleischer, 2009) ***","As I have often said, I am not too fond of the zombie genre (at least the flesh-eating variety), so I was not exactly looking forward to this one; however, knowing it had a strong sense of humor (zombies are lured out into the open by the strumming of ""Dueling Banjos""!), I was willing to make one more trip to the well. In fact, once one gets over the initial ""do we really need another zombie spoof?"" feeling – especially keeping in mind the satirical elements in George A. Romero's vastly overrated original DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) and, obviously, the equally ultra-hyped SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004; which was voted ""best comedy of the decade"" for cryin' out loud by the British magazine ""Empire""!) – ZOMBIELAND proves quite enjoyable most of the way. The film's second trump card is the (obviously human) characterization, not a typical asset in this sort of gory fare: here, in fact, we have two guys (geeky kid and gung-ho modern cowboy – the latter played by Woody Harrelson) and two girls (the younger being LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE [2006]'s Abigail Breslin) against the rest of the world, infected with some virus (as always) and thus appropriately dubbed ""Zombieland"". Despite its trim running time, the majority of the action occurs during the opening and concluding sections (with the creatures a blood-vomiting and often obese lot, one is actually thankful for it!); that said, the highlight is perhaps the hysterical scene at Bill Murray's estate (with the ""Ghostbusters"" star appearing as himself and even becoming an unfortunate victim of the paranoia that understandably grips the normal segment of humanity). The remainder, as already intimated. is devoted to the budding relationship within the group – Harrelson takes on the kid against his better judgment but, then, both are repeatedly double-crossed by the girls (who had made a pact not to trust anyone); of course, at the end, they are happy to join forces and the teens even become romantically involved. New-hand director Fleischer brings plenty of style to the table and generally succeeds in breathing new life (no pun intended) into a by-now exhausted formula; by the way, who would have thought I would ever be hearing an all-too brief snippet of ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin'"" by my beloved The Velvet Underground on the soundtrack of a zombie movie? Needless to say perhaps but a sequel to this one is already in the works",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Sorry Movie,"I just got through watching this and it was the most worthless waste of time I've ever spent. I remember seeing the commercial on TV when this movie came out. I didn't get suckered in to the theater to see this, but I gave into temptation and rented it on blu ray today and I hate that I did. This is one of those movies that after you see it, you've forgotten about it 5 minutes later. The movie was totally pointless and meaningless, kind of like Ghostbusters except with zombies. The movie starred some Jewish kid that nobody ever heard of, with veterans Bill Murray and Woody Harellson thrown in for posterity's sake (no doubt, just a marketing ploy to sell the movie to an older audience). To make things worse, Netflix never has it available and i went to Blockbuster 3 days in a row before I finally tracked down a copy. I'm almost downright MAD, this movie is so lame. I think if I hadn't spent so much time trying to find a blu-ray rental copy of it, I wouldn't have even watched the whole thing. At least it was only an hour and 22 minutes long, so I didn't really have to suffer THAT long. They should have thrown in a few Mutant Nija Turtles - it wouldn't have made much difference to the quality of the movie. Totally stupid and pointless. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
This Zomedy has real heart!,"OK, so I can understand how some of you horror buffs who didn't see the trailer might be disappointed by the lack of said thrills in this genre bending flick. And its true one of its movie posters does feature prominently two shotguns, a shovel and a bloody chain saw but just because a movie has zombie in its title doesn't mean it's a supposed to be scary. Now get over it and enjoy the little surprises in life because this movie is frigin hilarious!Zombieland is a very cleverly written very well directed teen action comedy set in post zombie flu apocalypse. And as a ""zomedy"" it joins the hollowed ranks of at least two other films I can think of. Fido and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. OK, OK so you probably haven't seen either. Fido is a terrificly funny inde about keeping zombies as servants with an inevitable working class revolt. And Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is about... well... killer tomatoes. Which I know are too round and too red for zombies. But they both combine cannibalism with comedy in a sweet ketchupy stew and so will help you understand the genius of zomedies. Which is that with a zomedy you can have all of the gory kills and hardly any of the ""why am I watching this"" guilty shrills. All while laughing your butt off. And yes, you might also compare it with Shaun of the Dead. But, thats more of a scary zomedy. Or ""dark zomedy"". In fact if you were to compare it with an Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg film, Hot Fuzz is closest in style. Both are fast paced thrill rides full of laughs, kick ass slow motion sequences, gallons of fake blood and a surprising amounts of genuine character development. Just substitute walking dead for all the crazy village people in Hot Fuzz and its a true zomedy as well. Then again maybe that makes Zombieland just a hilarious action comedy with zombies. Either way Zombieland its a Purell fresh, Twinky powered road trip through a very funny zombie hell. Now ball up or shut up and enjoy the movie for what it is.Oh and it's true it also has the best celebrity cameo since Bob Barker kicked the sand trap out of Adam Sandler in Happy Gilomore.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What every comedy these days should look at for inspiration,"Before my review, me let just get it out of the waySHAUN OF THE DEADThere I said it, because frankly, every review I have read so far about Zombieland has to have a reference to Shaun of the Dead somehow.Many do compare this movie to Shaun of the Dead. And while the two movies share the same theme of zombies and comedy, they take the idea of the zombie genre very, very, VERY differently.This movie starts out with Columbus, played by Jesse Eisenburg, who is afraid of everything and is pretty much a wimp. Frankly, being in a zombie infested world is still not a good enough reason for Jesse Eisenburg to grow a pair in a movie. Colombus is trying to get back hometown, but then comes across Tallahassee, played by Woody Harleson, who is the very opposite of Columbus. He is not afraid to kill zombies with whatever he has on him whether it is a bat, gun, clippers, or a banjo. The two then comes across Little Rock and Wichita, two girls who have survived the zombie apocalypse not just because of their gun-ho nature, but because of trickery and deceitfulness. And at that point, the rest of the movies is just zombie slaughter after zombie slaughter.FYI, the reason for their weird names is because their name is the location that each person is planning to go to get away from the zombies.The movie is just hilarious and always have quick jokes throughout that do not drag on like most comedies do in their movies. And with Eisenburg narrating the story, it is even funnier. Woody Harleson is the funniest of them all. Even with the scenes without him, the film is funny but when Harleson is in a scene, it just becomes better. And Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin playing the two girls were also really good.What this movie did that really made me proud of this movie was that they actually created a zombie film. With many movies out there that poke fun at things, they often forget the things they are poking at. In this movie, they wrote a movie about zombies and then added comedy to it, so now you can appreciate it not just as a comedy, but also as a zombie movie as well.This movie is definitely not for the weak of heart because like most zombie movies, it does have it's share of blood, gore, and graphic images, all of which I thought were cool, well-caught on camera, and realistic. And I also really liked how they supplemented the zombie slaughtering with metal music. It really fit in well.And if you have seen Shaun of the Dead, do not think that you will watch it again when watching this movie because like I said before, they are different. Zombieland had awesome action sequences while Shaun of the Dead stuck to a more slower pace. Plus, Shaun of the Dead's setting was before the zombie apocalypse, while Zombieland took place during the zombie apocalypse. And for Zombieland, the whole movie was dedicated to zombies while Shaun of the Dead also stuck in some romantic comedy sub-plots.This movie is a well-crafted film that has everything you want in horror comedies. Bloody violence, laughter, and more bloody violence after that. There is nothing in this movie that I could find wrong in it and hopefully you will not either.4.5/5P.S: This movie probably contains one of the best cameos that I have seen this year and in a long time. It was funny and well-executed. You would never guess who it is. You just would never guess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombie Comedy In An Entertaining Flick,"'Zombieland' is a zombie horror drama that sprinkles on comedy in a fun, action-packed film. A recluse college student, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. His parents live in Columbus, Ohio, prompting him to drive there to find out whether they survived. Once his car breaks down on the way, he hitches a ride with a brutal Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee has a certain fondness for Twinkie's mini-cake. On the road, they stop at a supermarket for some Twinkies. There, they run into the conniving sisters, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin).I have become fatigued by the overdone zombie horror subgenre, but I liked this movie. The script, dialogue, character development, acting, and cast chemistry were decent. Although I rarely watch horror films and this falls under that genre, I didn't find it particularly scary. It had plenty of gore, blood, and violence to keep you on the edge of the seat. I chose this film for a couple of reasons: it was a short 90 minutes, and I liked the cast. Emma Stone is one of my favorite actresses, and Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson are solid actors who I have watched in multiple films/shows over the years. Bill Murray was in a side role here, but he is fitting here in his hilarious cameo.Would I recommend it? I don't consider this a must-watch. This film had its share of up-and-down moments throughout, and the plot was nothing unique or fresh. I still found it entertaining throughout and never found myself bored. The comedy added a light touch to a zombie horror film that can get serious quickly if you allow it. If you like zombie movies, you may have already seen it (if not, watch it). Otherwise, you won't miss much skipping it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

None the less This was one of the best theater experiences in a long while and I cant imagine how anyone couldn't have a fun time watching this. So.......

Fun spin on the zombie movie,"A not bad take on the genre. Hearing the neurotic nerds rules, contrasts nicely with the rednecks dive in attitude. It introduces the new idea of what would happen if you met a celebrity after the apocalypse, and is told quite entertainingly. The zombies themselves are not well realised, but then like many zombie films, its not really about them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
You want an overrated movie? Go watch the Shawshank Redemption!,"Defiantly my favorite zombie movie besides the dawn of the dead remake and Shaun of the Dead. Whoever says this movie is overrated should nut up or just shut the f**k up. Seriously it's not like the movies got a 9.8 or like a 9.0 rating on here!? Half the reviews and comments say this movie is overrated! By the standards that are set. I'd say this movie is underrated. Now a movie that is extremely overrated is the Shawshank Redrmption, we get it he's in jail big whoop! I liked that movie but it doesn't get to me like zombieland does. And I'm more of a Comedy/Sci-Fi person so I don't enjoy dramas or crimes that much. Zombieland. 10/10, for the zombies, guns, comedy, Emma Stone(yes!), and Bill Murray.

Quite enjoyable,"The film looked good. There's not much to say, it looked modern and pretty. The effects were good but looked CGI. The girl was pretty! It also sounded good like most modern films. It lost its way a little but was quite enjoyable. The 'rules' thing got a little annoying and the characters weren't that lovable until the end. Still it passed the time and was entertaining although it is too much like a cross-breed of Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Adventureland (2009). It's pretty good and entertaining although will I remember it next week?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A solid zom-com,"The Zombie Apocalypse has struck and a nerdy college student in Texas just wants to get home to Columbus, Ohio to see if his family survived. He soon meets up with a fellow survivor who firmly states 'no names' so they refer to each other by their home towns; Columbus and Tallahassee. They haven't been together to long when they meet sisters, 'Wichita' and 'Little Rock'... who relieve them of their transport and weapons! However they are soon reunited and end up heading to California together; constantly on the lookout for zombies.Horror comedy is a difficult balance to get right but I think this film pulls it off nicely. There are both gory moments and solid laughs right from the start as Columbus explains his main rules for survival; these flash up on the screen whenever they are applied. Once the situation and rules are explained the characters are introduced in a way that provides more laughs. The cast are solid; Jesse Eisenberg as the slightly nerdy Columbus; Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee and Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as the sisters who were grifting before the zombies took over. As well as individual funny scenes there is a good running joke about Tallahassee's search for a Twinkie bar and a great surprise cameo. If there is a weakness it is that we go quite a while between zombie encounters in the middle section of the film... at least there are plenty for the finale. Of course there are plot holes but if they'd just stocked up on food and driven to the middle of nowhere rather than heading to a major population centre it would have been a pretty boring film! Overall I'd recommend this for fans of zombie comedy; it may not be as funny as 'Shaun of the Dead' or as gory as 'Dead Snow' but it is still well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An entertaining movie to enjoy,"Zombieland is a movie that combines horror (although it doesn't scares), comedy, with a lot of black humor, action and adventure. The story focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies. It doesn't shows us anything new and it is a little predictable but at the same time it is funny and entertaining. It never gets tiresome because of it fast paced rhythm. The music is excellent and the make up design is very convincing. The cast is good. Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee makes a good performance, he is very funny, Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus is quite decent, Emma stone is Wichita and Abigail Breslin is Little Rock, they are also very convincing but the best one of all was Bill Murray in his short appearance as himself, the 15 minutes he is in the movie are hilarious and they really worth it. As a conclusion, Zombieland is a movie which only purpose was to entertain and make people enjoy and spend a really good time and I think it accomplishes it in a very good way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
best zombie movie ever.,"incredible movie. if there were more ""zombie kills of the week"" then this would get 10 out of 10, which with all things considered is a very small critique. everything fit so well together to give what is hands down the best zombie movie ever. intuitive casting, with interesting choices for the roles of Tallahassee and Columbus. but step aside Michael Cera, Jesse Eisenberg is the new awkward teenager in town. And Woody Harrellson... what is there to say? not a role we've ever really seen him in, and he absolutely NAILS it. with hilarious twists and turns, and scenes that in any other circumstance would be considered cheesy, but just enhance the comedic effect and plot line. The opening credits are really cool and are enough to get you salivating over this awesome zombie flick. This movie is a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Fun for the whole (undead) family.,"ZOMBIELAND is no classic comedy like SHAUN OF THE DEAD (which it emulates in small snatches), but it still gives veteran zombie auteur George A. Romero a lesson in how to insert all that ""black humor"" and ""satire"" that he never puts into his movies yet that he is famous for.Directed by video nobody Ruben Fleischer (written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick), ZOMBIELAND also addresses a deeper theme that Romero could never envision: that of its characters running FROM zombies but running ever TOWARDS the past that they lost; the ""innocent"" time before Zombieland.Surface story follows four people with guns that never run of bullets, traveling across country while trying to remain un-undead. Guns, guts and gore, hero shots, geek-gets-girl, blood-spattered undead end to end. 'Nuff said for most rednecks, and a subtle character study for normal-colored necks.Woody Harrelson brings his NATURAL BORN KILLER, as laconic cowboy loner, Tallahassee, who picks up Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus (doing such a good Michael Cera homage, I feel like beating him up for his lunch money); Emma Stone wearing enough mascara to embarrass a prostitute dressed as Jack Sparrow; and Abigail Breslin growing up on screen in front of our eyes.Once again, the ""realistic"" reason behind the zombie epidemic is updated. In the '50s and '60s - radiation; the '80s and '90s - genetics; 2000s - now a virus, spawned from mad cow disease.Amber Heard cameo - not naked. Waste of skin.

"Good movie, and well worth a watch","My friends really wanted to watch this and at first I was dubious but while it isn't ""Shaun of the Dead"" it is really funny.One or two of the jokes are telegraphed and as usual with Zombie movies I found myself asking why, oh why, when characters do the most stupid things, while trying to avoid being eaten. Especially towards the end where two characters who have proved very cunning throughout the entire movie loose all of their common sense during the final few scenes.

Funny Zombies and such.,"Zombieland is the next entry to the horror comedy genre. It is directed by Ruben Fleischer who did some episodes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, but no movies. It stars Jesse Eisenberg who was in Adventureland earlier this year, which I thought was a very good film. It also has Woody Harelson in a rare comedic performance and he's brilliant in it. It also stars Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone. The acting is of course very high quality especially considering that 3 cast members are Oscar nominated actors.The plot is very simple. The movie takes place in a time where the zombie apocalypse has occurred and America is now known as Zombieland. Columbus, who is played by Jesse Eisenberg has his own rules or surviving Zombieland and he's actually doing pretty well by himself. That is until he meets Tallahassee played by Woody Harelson and they agree to travel together to their destinations. Along the way they meet two sisters who are constantly stealing their car. The whole movie, they are travelling to their destination stopping to kill zombies. They are travelling to a Hollywood amusement park that is supposed to be zombie free.It is important to note that that these aren't traditional zombies, but they are living people that have been infected with mad cow disease that has become mad human disease. It really isn't a big deal because there have been several great zombie films with this angle, such as 28 Days Later. I like that there isn't much of a plot to Zombieland because that leaves a lot of time for some really intense action scenes and jokes even though the movie is only 81 minutes long. It may sound too short but the movie itself is so satisfying that it feels like the perfect time.Zombieland worked for me on so many levels. It happened to be the funniest film I've seen in a very long time. Not a single joke fell flat for me. I think this has the potential to be a comedy classic for years. Before Zombieland, I would say that the best zombie comedy was Shaun of the Dead, but I think it was a little funnier than Shaun of the Dead and a lot more fun. There's also an amazing cameo mid-way into the movie that has to be the best cameo in years. The audience was applauding during this epic cameo. I'm not going to be spoiling it here because it will not have the same effect if you already know who it is. The movie also had a good amount of gore and you could tell that it wasn't CGI. I was pleased that they didn't have too much CGI gore because it looked really fake and cheesy in some of the movies that were used in My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination. That's all I have to say about Zombieland. I think it will appeal to different people. Both comedy fans and horror fans will both love this movie because there is a balance of both in here, though if I would have to pick one I would think that it is more of a comedy than a horror because everything is played for laughs. You shouldn't miss the best comedy of 2009. I give Zombieland a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Clever and entertaining,"Funny movie with a good story. Fun tone with good characters and some moving moments. Well-made overall. My only issue with the movie is a few decisions made by the characters in dangerous situations.(about 5 viewings, 3/14/2020, 1/3/2025)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Funny - if you've never seen a zombie film,"I'd noticed the high ratings and reviews that ZOMBIELAND was getting, and sat down to watch it expecting something a bit out of the ordinary; what I got instead was a film packed with tired, sub-standard schtick involving the lamest kind of zombie gags put on screen. Hell, even RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART 2, complete with its moonwalking zombie, was funnier than this! The main problem, I'd say, lies in the presence of such irritating characters. Jesse Eisenberg is the nominal hero, but he overdoes the whiny-geeky thing so much that I almost switched off. Why make the main guy so darned irritating? Woody Harrelson, as a redneck zombie killer with a penchant for Twinkies, fares much better, but he isn't enough to save this film from being near unwatchable. The less said about Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin's supposedly 'with it' sisters, the better, leaving this a movie without a single likable character to root for.The plot less story uses all of its decent gags (i.e. the zombie 'rules') in the first ten minutes and for the rest of the running time meanders from one vapid scene to the next. One extended celebrity cameo is cringeworthy, and clearly thrown in in a desperate attempt to pad out the still-short length. By the time we reach the climax, a lunkheaded set-piece in an abandoned amusement park, I was long beyond caring thanks to the poor writing and sheer senselessness of it all.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

More fun than you'd think,"Funny tongue-in-cheek comedy about a world overrun by zombies. The ""rules"" alone are enough to make you smile and realize you're in for an interesting ride.

"Good, but not as good as the critics are saying","Twice the critics have set me up to love a movie and after seeing it, I walked away slightly disappointed. The first time was ""District 9,"" a true disappointment considering the acclaim it received. This time, to a lesser extent, it's ""Zombieland."" It's not ""Shaun of the Dead."" Too bad, too. It's more like ""Juno"" meets ""Shaun of the Dead,"" without the pregnancy fun.Bill Murray's cameo is great fun. Woody Harrelson does light up the screen at times, but the movie's main character is Jesse Eisenberg as ""Columbus,"" who is quirky and fun, but never lights up the screen as well as Woody Harrelson does. Trust me, Woody gets LOTS of screen time and I believe he carries this movie.The characters are rather shallow. With Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin never being fleshed out much more than Amber Heard's ""406."" Would have been interesting to find out why these two sisters were traveling together before the zombies attacked.In general, the storyline is rather thin. There are zombies. Lots of them. They're angry and hungry, though not necessarily for brains. There is a reason given for how they turned, but it's not much of one and it's easy to miss the quick reference to ""Patient Zero."" Otherwise, not much is said to explain them. (Do zombies need an explanation?)

Top Five on my Zombie Movie List! So good!,"Those of you who know me know that I can sometimes go off on a rant about crap movies having no problem getting a wide, theatrical release while good films crawl around under cover of ""Mom and Pop"", small screen venues or after hours purgatoryif the see the light of day at all. There are movies that get rave reviews during test screenings that are still battling it out to even get a DVD release. So, seeing a zombie genre film that is this much fun, this entertaining, and this original in wide release is just so damn refreshing.""Columbus"" (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner with compulsions who is trying to get back to his home inColumbusafter the zombie plague has ravaged the world. He's worked out certain rules to help himself stay alive in this dangerous, new environment. On the road, he meets ""Tallahassee"" (Woody Harrelson), ""Wichita"" (Emma Stone), and her sister ""Little Rock"" (Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine fame) and the four of them work together to make their way towards a safe spot where there are no zombies. The basis for a classic, road trip scenario.When I first saw the trailer for ZOMBIELAND, I wanted to love the film. I wanted it to be an amazing, 2 hour fun park ride. However, we all know trailers can be utterly deceiving, tricksy and false! However in this case, just like GRINDHOUSE before it, Zombieland had everything it promised – fun, comedy, horror, interesting story and, of course, ZOMBIES.Zombieland walks the fantastic line of horror and comedy. Not since the likes of SHAUN OF THE DEAD have I had so much fun in a horror film. The story is a vehicle for situations to arise and little more, but it's a zombie film and that's all it needed to be. The main four characters are grand in their roles and bring enough to them to make them interesting without getting too muddy or clichéd. The movie never takes itself too seriously, but also avoids becoming silly. One minute you are giggling at a sight gag and the very next second you are startled by a sudden zombie mishap. Witty writing and attention to the story arc made it all work well together.This is a very smart horror film as well. Someone has done their research on both the genre and it's fans. I am a huge zombie fan. I've seen many a zombie film. Reese and Wernick gave me fantastic zombie action while calling out things that drive me crazy when I watch lesser zombie fair. They play with genre norms, clichés and lore to bring a truly witty and engaging story to the screen. Clever visual gags and some fun cameos and setups had me wanting more and more of what this film had to offer.If you're a fan of zombies, comedy, and some fun scares, this is SO the movie for you. Don't wait, just go see it and enjoy!

Sometimes Simple Ss Better,"In almost any definable way, ""Zombieland"" is an easy movie to review. There is not myriad of layers to pull back, there is no deep allegory or social commentary – rare in a zombie film – there is no Art House-like direction, bizarre script, or really anything that is beyond just regular-like. That in no way, however, means that ""Zombieland"" is a film one should ignore.Sometimes the viewer of a film are so aware of the trickery, reveals, twists, and hidden meaning offered up to them – canny to keep an eye out – that he forgets the reason he goes to see movies in the first place: To be entertained. I was appalled when I saw on some fora where the wonderful Trick r Treat was being deconstructed and denounced because the viewer, in those cases, had forgotten that not every movie is directed with sequel building, dense allegorical connections, or overly cute cleverness in mind. If a person is the type that could not watch ""Trick r Treat"" with the understanding that it is whimsical slice of childhood fear produced with a loving infatuation for the subtler and more honest feelings of Halloween and the thrill of being scared; and if that person wants gore, archetypal origins story, torture, twists, and a whole heap of pop psychology, then both ""Trick r Treat"" and ""Zombieland"" are movies that person should sit out. They're not going to get it.However, if one likes to be entertained, to laugh and chuckle, and to come away from a movie – not feeling moved – but feeling as though he just paid a fair price to have a lot of fun for 80 minutes, then ""Zombieland"" is a movie that person should check out.Jesse Eisenberg is Columbus. He introduces himself at the beginning of ""Zombieland"" with a funny and gory montage involving others while explaining his main rules for surviving in Zombieland. There is also a small flashback sequence that just barley touches on the beginning of the trouble with zombies.Columbus is a neurotic loner and has never been close to his family. He feels the need, though, to see a familiar face – or even another non-zombiefied face – so he sets out from his college in Texas traveling to Columbus hoping that his family might be alive. Shortly thereafter he meats Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee is a zombie killing party animal who believes in one thing: Enjoy the little things. For Tallahassee the little things can be a good zombie kill, having nice wheels, testosterone enhancing firepower, or, his holy grail, a fresh Twinkie.Though they are opposites, Columbus and Tallahassee form a partnership and decide to travel together. Once traveling they quickly meet up with Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) – a young woman and her aged 12 sister. The two girls are more wary of forming alliances and leave Columbus and Tallahassee behind a few times before the four finally agree to head west together to an old amusement park outside of Los Angeles that is rumored to be a zomebie-free zone.That's pretty much it. The middle of the movie turns more to a light romance between Columbus and Wichita as Eisenberg assembles his typical charming neurosis while trying to woo the ballsy bad girl Stone. Franky the romance part does not work that well. Eisenberg is charming in the same way he is in every role he is seen in, but Stone was a non-factor. I didn't buy the bad girl, I didn't buy the romance, and in many ways Stone was slightly upstaged by her younger co-star Breslin. However Stone was cute enough and so little of the film was wasted on the romance as to make it forgivable.As I am sure many have heard, there is quite a surprise cameo in the film. I am not sure how much of a surprise it is; I remember reading production news about the film and there was word that this actor was on the set. Either way, surprise or not, it is one of the best cameos of recent memory with some cult worthy scenes playing off that actor's well known body of work. It works as being ridiculously funny and as a great segue between the road movie first act and the escape and rescue third act. The cameo also does a nice job of helping one forget the non-starter romance side plot.""Zombieland"" has a running time of just over 80 minutes and those minutes are well spent. My gut feeling is there might have been a lot of sappy character building and romantic scenes cut out of the movie and that led to the shorter than average length. Great, I say. ""Zombieland"" is not a story that takes 100 minutes to tell. The 80 minutes are packed with action and humor and is short enough so that the one mismatched ingredient is easily forgiven. ""Zomebieland"" is great fun and movie that can be enjoyed in almost any environment. What it excels at is reminding us that movies are at their best when they deliver uncompromised fun and enjoyment.from: www.PopBunker.net @popbunker",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Thanks largely to the brilliant cast....,"The most surprising aspect of Zombieland, to me, is how much heart there is. All of the characters feel warm and alive, and what drama there is to be found feels extremely sincere. Ultimately, you feel invested in the story and the characters, which – I think – is the most important thing any film of any genre can do.Zombieland has instantly become a horror favorite of mine (comedic or otherwise). The – for the lack of a better word – quotable dialogue, consistently hysterical tone, and endearing characters, all come together to create a film that will undoubtedly become a cult classic.Unlike many comedies in recent memory, in which the majority of laughs are already provided by the trailer, Zombieland is filled to the brim with laugh-out-loud moments, thanks largely to the brilliant cast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
To survive in this land you must follow the rules!!!,"First off, is it just me or of all the genres in horror is the zombie movie the one that makes the best comedy. Not only do you have this gem you also have ""Shaun of Dead"", ""Dead Alive"", ""Return of the Living Dead"" one and two, ""Reanimator"", ""The Undead"", and many more. This one is a nice little zombie comedy that is more comedy than horror by leaps and bounds as there are lots of scenes where the zombies are not seen for long stretches. Almost all the zombie munching comes right at the beginning of the film as the lead guy code named Columbus goes over the rules that have kept him alive so far and shows what happens to those who do not follow them. Then the next stretch where there is a lot of zombie action is the end which is still not quite horror, but is tense enough at times to make for a good action sequence with still just a little touch of comedy to make it perfect. The film basically follows this young man as he meets another calling himself ""Tallahasee"" as everyone they meet go by where they are from rather than their name. They are just trying to survive, perhaps with destinations on their mind or perhaps nothing more than trying to find a Twinkie. The story is simple, but very effective, be prepared for a very funny cameo appearance. The acting is great, but then I always enjoyed seeing Woody Harrelson from his Cheers days so it was nice seeing him in this role. The other cast members are great too. The film does not over stay its welcome, nor does it run time feel to short.

Refreshingly Revamps the Zombie-Horror Genre,"Carrying all the hallmarks of the great zombie movies of George Romero, Zombieland breathes new life into a tired and diluted genre with its refreshingly sardonic wit and reverses the common horror trend of rooting for the monsters with its genuine and likeable cast. The gore and gristle are unapologetically grim but balanced well against its more heartfelt themes of family and unity in the face of crisis, while its cleverly utilised soundtrack helps build intense and enjoyable scenes of action which weaker films of its genre sorely lack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What a stupid predictable movie,"There are 4 main characters in this awful movie.

So..the main characters are stupid. In this move, you can learn that girl are stupid and like to light up all light in amusement park even thou there are in a f-kin town full of zombies. Further more, you'll learn that they cant drive and panic when the have zombies on the roof of the car, and prefer running, than driving with zombies on it. Buy the way zombies run real fast in this movie.Guys are not so stupid just softhearted, oh sorry, one is stupid, why would anyone carry two barrel shot gun if you can have any automatic weapon you want, or you could just take ouh...hmm...PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN, YOU IDIOT. And those stupid stupid girls...they need someone to help them they have little tiny hands, and little tiny brains, and little tiny feet. What an idiotic story. When you see Bill Murray you'll know what will happen to him even before it happens. I laughed once HA, and that was all. American Shaun of the dead..Shaun of the dead is Citizen Kane for this stupid movie. And what and ending, what a bullets/zombie killed ratio..wow..

Zombies never learn,"Zombieland is exactly what it sounds like. Zombies are everywhere and they are hungry. In his feature film debut, director Ruben Fleischer presents an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead, only this is more about the zombie killing. It stars of Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus. He plays one of the few remaining non-zombie humans left. He is methodical in his survival tactics and rarely takes chances. When he decides to head out of Texas and towards his hometown in Ohio, he encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a Twinkie loving, zombie killing fanatic. The two team up and head on out of Texas.Along the way they run into more zombies and more non-zombies, including Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin). These presumably innocent little girls will stop at nothing to survive. They give Columbus and Tallahassee more than they bargained for.The theme of the film, like almost every zombie/post apocalyptic story, is survival. The characters don't give their real names, only their home towns for fear that they might become too attached to another person. Loneliness is part of the life when trying to survive a zombie epidemic, but having someone to talk to doesn't hurt, just as long as you're okay with killing them should they become infected. I though Shaun of the Dead dealt with this more than Zombieland did.Dealing with a zombie infestation means that you will more than likely have to kill someone. There is plenty of that here. The blood and gore is more on the comic side of the spectrum. It's over the top, very red, and not discreet whatsoever. It's cartoonish at times and never really grosses you out, unless that kind of stuff really bothers you, but I think for the most part the humor and the story will overlook it.For a movie about zombies this is a pretty smart film. There is a lot of physical humor, i.e. killing zombies, but it is wrapped up with funny dialogue and outlandish situations. Harrelson in particular is right on target here. Even Eisenberg does a good job. He is a more emotional Michael Cera, which is a good thing. There is a cameo by one of my favorite comedians, but I won't say who for fear of taking away from the surprise. Needless to say, I was in hysterics.I was surprised how invested I became with the characters. I knew this was a completely ridiculous plot and that zombies aren't real (at least this kind) so I expected just to go along for the ride. The characters are very well drawn out, each with a distinctive personality and back story. It made the film a little more enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Great genre flick,"I understand why the fans wanted a sequel, but this is a one of a kind film, that wasn't begging for a sequel. I watched this again in preparation for Double Tap. The film is clever, but tends to follow a predictable storyline road. Zombieland wasn't exactly fresh, the zombie sub genre has been done to comedic genius in Shaun of the Dead. Zombieland has fresh ideas and allows all the characters time to shine. I just felt the overall story lacked real substance and was more of a one-shot storyline. I've heard mixed responses for the sequel so I feel my opinion was correct. Zombieland deserved to be an isolated cult favourite.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

But in his team, they are all weird from each other. A macho man, a clumsy man, a brave woman and his impassive sister. I'm not talking about it because the exaggerated scenes are a comedy movie. The movie is considered above average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A must see for any zombie fans out there,"Its the zombie apocalypse, the streets are deserted, buildings are destroyed, and everyone except a small group of survivors are flesh eating monsters.This is hardly a new concept in the horror genre, having been done over and over and over, can Zombieland be more than another tired, clichéd zombie flick? Definitely. With likable characters, witty dialogue, and tons of zombie killing action, Zombieland makes it to my top 10 list of favorite zombie comedies.One of the best things about this movie is the characters, Colombus (Eisenberg) is a nervous, socially awkward teenager who survived the zombie apocalypse by following his own set of ""rules"". While Talahassse (Harrelson) plays the exact opposite; a zombie killing badass who doesn't follow any rules. Along the way they meet two young girls Little Rock and Witchita (Stone), who are on a quest to get to Pacific Playland, a theme park that is supposedly zombie free.While the dialogue between these characters is very natural and funny, it can become a bit tiresome as a large portion of the movie shifts away from the zombies and focuses on them instead, this is in my opinion, one of the movies only flaws.The zombies themselves are very scary looking, and although they are absent for a somewhat large portion of the film, the climax more than makes up for it with nonstop zombie killing awesomeness. (A note to zombie purists, the zombies in the film aren't actually true zombies, more like 28 days later infected people)Overall, this film is a fresh, funny zombie comedy that can be ranked up with the likes of Shaun of The Dead, and Return of the Living dead. While it does suffer a few minor flaws, it still is a must see for any zombie movie, horror, or comedy fans. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Zombieland is sugary, spicy and with a little dash of Murray.","While 'Shaun of the Dead' started the trend of blending the undead with self-referential comedy (and arguably the better film), Zombieland puts the ""Z"" in zany. Both a survival horror and a road trip comedy that has just enough memorability to justify its ridiculously short runtime, ultimately leaving the audience wanting more. After the world is ravaged by the walking dead, four individuals travel to California in search for sanctuary and nostalgia. It immediately starts with a montage of clips that outlines the rules our protagonist abides by. Ranging from the sensible fastening your seatbelt and maintaining cardio to the more specific such as avoiding public bathrooms. Accompanied with quirky narration, these are adhered to throughout the film and provide several scenes of callback humour. The characters are quickly introduced and grouped together as they journey to Pacific Playland, each harnessing personalities that make them relatable. Columbus is exaggeratively awkward whereas Tallahassee is the Twinkie-loving badass who relishes in slaying zombies. Perfect casting choices with Eisenberg and Harrelson, with the two exhuming onscreen chemistry. It makes for sufficient, albeit predictable, character interactions and development. Some of the humour misses, but for the most part it works well. The laughs do not come from ""double tapping"" zombies, but rather the quips and dialogue between these survivors. The highlight being the complete ten minute sequence set in Bill Murray's mansion, with an ingenious cameo from himself. There's just something about him reenacting 'Ghostbusters' that puts a twinkle in my left eye. More often than not, scenes are rushed in an attempt to stuff the film with as much content as possible. Realistically the runtime needed to be twenty minutes longer to further flesh out the characters and the romance. Still, Tallahassee got his Twinkie, and that's all that matters. Zombieland is just as amusing as the amusement park it concludes with. Bloody good fun. Sequel please!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
See this movie,"This is the best zombie movie that has been made in years. In my opinion, even better than Shaun of the Dead. See it. Giving a synopsis of this movie, just might ruin it for many.

Personally, I didn't really care for their characters, but they do grow on you. The rules that the paranoid lives by, are rules that every zombie fan needs to know. Your survival in Zombieland depends on the rules. The best part of the movie, really is the cameo by a famous star. If you've already seen it, don't tell anyone who it is. Just tell then to go see the movie. With any luck, there will be another Zombieland movie. We need more care free, kill'em all zombie movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Really fun if you go in expecting a fluffy zombie flick...,"I have to say, right off the bat, that I went in expecting a gore-filled black comedy - and I was disappointed. What we have here is a light, comedic, mildly violent romp through, what the incredibly charming Jessie Eisenburg calls, Zombieland - and if you go in expecting that, you will really love this movie.Zombieland is a silly flick at heart... thinks it wants to be a teen romance flick... and is a little confused whether it also wants to be a horror movie as well. Columbus, (Eisenburg, channeling Micheal Sera... and is a lot more charming than Sera could ever be), wants to get to, well, Columbus, and Tallahassee, (Harrelson playing a mix between Peter Griffin and Snake Plisskin), wants a twinkie. They kill zombies in silly ways. They meet some girls that are also silly. They have a silly run-in with a pretty awesome celebrity. They have a silly time in an amusement park. Sure, it's a silly movie. However, it's not incredibly crass, not over-the-top, and it knows exactly what it is, which is a silly movie with zombies here and there. With all this silliness going on, they (strangely enough) also find time to be kinda dramatic in a few scenes, and downright touching in others. However, what this movie is not is scary. You may find yourself jumping at MAYBE one or two scenes... but I doubt it. If you expect a fun little zombie movie with that girl from Little Miss Sunshine, the guy from Natural Born Killers, that kid from AdventureLand, (who apparently likes making movies with the name ""land"" in the title about amusement parks... plus, is INCREDIBLY cute), and some girl that I'm sure has been in other things, then you'll enjoy yourself.

Twinkies aren't the only that survive.,"Zombieland is first off, and I am so happy to say this, not a Shaun of the Dead rip off. While the two are arguably two of the best zombie movies to date and comedy oriented, they are two separate humors in their own glory. This also has set a new standard in reviewing, I found it quite difficult for how unique it truly was.What you can expect from the trailers and the descriptions, Zombieland is largely based on the comedy at the expense of zombies. Woody in this movie plays a no talent renegade--though everyone is in this world--who finally did find a one talent--killing zombies. He makes it a point and what seems like a goal for the most creative ways of killing zombies. One notable scene is when he lures zombies out, in the hopes of snagging Twinkies, with a banjo. I won't go into further detail, but you can use your vivid imagination until you see the movie.No zombie movie, regardless of horror or comedy, is complete without a set of survivors. Each is represented by their territory, all with a cause and purpose to band together to survive. As noted before, I don't want to reveal too much since this is a movie that is meant to be seen, not relayed through words.While you will not see too much of gore or anything stomach churning, there is plenty to keep the more than casual blood fan satisfied.Another thing you will notice, again comparing Shaun to this, is there is a lot of humor to be found here despite the setting. Anything from Twinkie searching to creative zombie killing, and even a special cameo who some will be quite amazed by.Overall, without wanting to reveal too much and let you just simply know that as an avid zombie fan, I couldn't be more happy with this movie. Those who want a traditional zombie experience, with humor and logic, with some very unique settings, this movie is a must see. Definitely one of the best of the year, if not, all time movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Awesome movie that quickly became a favourite,"Before going to see this movie I was told numerous times that it was great, hilarious etc. so I was hoping that it would live up to these expectations. And it did...and more.There is an amazing cast that fits this film exceptionally well, there are great laughs and ,of course, zombie galore. The opening sequence to this movie is probably one of the best that I've ever seen. Woody Harrelson was legendary in Zombieland and supported everything really well. And of course there was that cameo by one of my favourite actors and everything in those scenes were just mind-blowing.Zombieland is full of style and is like no other zombie movie that I've seen before yet is probably one of the best I have seen. Before watching this I hadn't seen a great example of comedy blended in with zombies (sure Shaun of the Dead was good but it wasn't hilarious) though Zombieland got some good laughs out of me.This is a movie that you've gotta see.

"8th best movie of all time, 2nd best movie of 2009!","The movie Zombie Land staring Jessie Eisenburg and Woody Harlson, is set in a post apocalyptic America, two months after mad cow disease became ""mad person disease"" which later mutated into ""mad zombie disease."" Eisenburg's character, Columbus makes up his own very smart and hilarious rules to survive the apocalypse. He meets Harlson who is the exact opposite of him and will risk his life for a Twinkie. Later on they meet two girls who help them fight the zombies. And the movie is basically about these four different people using team work to fight zombies. The writing was probably the strongest part about the film. They are able to make very chuckled jokes through out and give depth into the character while showing you the fun of fighting zombies.

"Post-apocalyptic zombie comedy is charming, gory, and nearly stolen by a hilarious cameo","I remember loving this film when it first same out, but it didn't hold up quite as well upon rewatching it. It's still good, but zombie films are pretty played out and the film doesn't offer anything unique except for some decent comedy. Co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would go on to write the highly successful ""Deadpool,"" which I actually haven't seen but hear took the highly played out superhero film and reinvigorated it by bringing self referential humor while also delivering loads of ultra-violence. Wes Craven's ""Scream"" did the same thing when slasher films were becoming very routine and very played out. When ""Zombieland"" came out, zombies were not quite to the point where the living dead had become tiresome, so the film's adherence to the conventions of this horror sub-genre were perfectly acceptable, especially since they were executed with style, with an A-list cast (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin), and with better production values than it's lower budgeted contemporaries. However, watching the film now, it's unoriginal take on the zombie film sub-genre feels pretty tired this time around. This film was a major studio production of what's usually a B-level budgeted genre film. The story, such as it is, is basically a road movie with some dueling comedic duos. The main pair is Eisenberg and Harrelson. Eisenberg is the relatable everyman. He's who we all would actually be during a zombie apocalypse. Harrelson, on the other hand, is complete id, and is who anyone who's ever ruminated about what they'd be like during a zombie apocalypse imagined themselves as being. Harrelson is supremely confident and macho, driving big trucks, carrying big guns, and blowing stuff up real good. These two are repeatedly outwitted by con artist sisters Stone and Breslin, who leave them high and dry on multiple occasions, that is until the two reach an uneasy alliance on a quest to drive across the country in hopes of reaching a zombie-free amusement park in California. In the film's favor, the film is populated with four entertaining and likable lead characters. Also, the road trip premiss allows for an entertaining series of episodic events. The film also benefits form it's studio support, which allows for better special effects, a better cast, a more talented of director in Ruben Fleischer, and an overall a bigger scale and better production for their version of a zombie apocalypse. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film, but there's a hilarious cameo that on it's own earns ""Zombieland"" an extra star in it's rating. On the downside, I did not care for the frequent breaking of the third wall, where Eisenberg directly talks to the audience, or when the film makes a random cutaway to the ""Zombie Kill of the Week."" Also, the film doesn't present any zombie scenarios that seem all that original or interesting, which wasn't all that bad when this film came out because there hand't been quite as many quality living dead films at this point in time, so anything well produced was exciting and good, but now that we live in an oversaturate undead media environment, you need something original like ""Dead Set"" or ""The Cured"" or the long-form storytelling of ""The Walking Dead"" to stand apart from what's become pretty familiar stories and scenarios. Still, despite the film's seeming unoriginality in story and situations, the actors and characters are quite likable, the film's comedy for the most part works, and the better than average production values make this zombie film well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"BORING waste of time, couldn't care less","Boring, predictable, never tense at all, characters you can't care less about.The movie tries to be gore zombie apocalypse, but never gets really tense. Characters casually stroll though an ever-so-epic zombie apocalypse. ""Oh, wow, we're in zombie apocalypse, there are zombies! Pew-pew-pew!"" Those get dropped in like in beginner-level shooter game. Stuff is abundant, cities seem to be still living normally. Any situation is obvious to be solved quickly.Neither the movie ever gets funny. Jokes are situational like in sit-coms (the cameo), and self-referential or meta-jokes (the ""bad"" girl laughing at the whole situation). The ""survival instructions"" feature could have added some tension and conflict to the plot, but it only gets you the ""don't forget to have fun"" statement after destroying an abandoned store. Pathetic.Enduring this waste of time, you see scriptwriters piecemeal you 15-seconds sad moment, 30-seconds romantic moment, edgy-ever-so-road-movie guitar riff etc, not forgetting to put on piano music to make you understand they want you to squeeze out a tear.This is a monumental example of what happens when marketing departments write scripts. Unfortunately, ""Zombieland"" only started a decade of boring time-wasting movies, like ""Hunger games"", ""Maleficienta"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", etc., full of ""epic"" battles, with carelessly-strolling mighty heroes single-handedly killing dozens of ever-so-dangerous monsters.

The only person he can trust is yourself,"The world has been overrun by zombies and has few survivors ... that tells Ruben Fleischer in ""Zombieland"" (2009), his new film that proposes a new comedy about the undead, which is about the trust in others and how we always need the other to survive.It is narrated in a linear fashion and from the point of view of the protagonist: Columbus, played by Jesse Eisenberg, who is presented as a guy insecure, paranoid and unsociable. Throughout the story, he and the other survivors will help them stay alive and risk the possibility of being betrayed. We do not know who is good and who is bad, the only thing we are sure of is that they are dominated by the fear of knowing that if a zombie bites become one ... they are afraid to stop being themselves, what they want is to survive, find stability and move on, which leads them to fight for their lives and face whatever it takes.Everything that happens directs the viewer to worry about who will die and who will survive, even remains some mystery about people who know Columbus, do not know if you can trust them, do not fully know who they are, and that helps keep the suspense and retention.The touch of comedy is interesting, because it is a film that could be scary, but the funny thing helps make the film what it is: intelligent, knowing balance between entertainment and the depth and seriousness of the story that is counting because it makes the viewer laugh at the moments that must laugh, keeps the suspense and the story moves on naturally.It is a film that is entertaining because it is about zombies, but finally, the great thing about the film is not due to the zombies, is due to the protagonists, the story itself and the good performances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A good action packed zombie comedy movie,"Zombieland (2009) is a hilarious and action-packed zombie comedy that delivers a fresh take on the genre. The film follows four survivors navigating a post-apocalyptic America overrun by zombies. Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, a timid rule-abiding survivor who meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a tough, gun-toting badass. Together, they encounter sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), who initially distrust the men but eventually join forces.The film expertly blends horror and comedy, with plenty of gruesome zombie kills and laugh-out-loud moments. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with their distinct personalities driving the narrative. Columbus's neurotic tendencies, Tallahassee's love for Twinkies, Wichita's rebellious spirit, and Little Rock's youthful curiosity all add layers of depth to the story.Zombieland is not just mindless entertainment; it offers social commentary on consumerism, family dynamics, and the human condition in the face of chaos. The film's ending is both satisfying and bittersweet, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.The movie's success can be attributed to its sharp writing, strong performances, and clever use of visual gags. It's a testament to the power of subverting expectations and finding humor in even the most dire of circumstances. Zombieland remains a beloved classic in the zombie genre, proving that even in a world overrun by the undead, there's still room for laughter, love, and the pursuit of Twinkies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A disappointment,"If you like intelligent zombie movies, with a plot development and some sense of character progression, then I suggest you skip this one.If, on the other hand, you are just looking for a video game style shoot'em up movie, then you may like this one: A completely unscary, splatstick style, violent-pornographic flick... which as far as i understand has many followers (Which is something I don't understand.)The very interesting scenario that is presented in the well done beginning loses strength after the first 10 minutes. Very soon, the movie becomes more and more senseless until it reaches a point where you understand why the whole thing became so uninteresting: It is made for zombies.There are no questions, no thoughts, no character development, no tension, no suspense. The only thing to see is just a lot of shooting, trashing and killing, filmed in a very cool way, and taken to a higher level with loads of bad-ass rock & roll, big trucks and cool names... The whole thing feels just so childish.It is a shame that the director decided to approach the film as a game. It is a zombie movie where zombies are completely meaningless, not even threatening. They are nothing but targets, the perfect excuse to display all brutality, violence and sadism as possible.So, what can I say? Probably some people will like it but this was the complete opposite of the kind of zombie movies I like (28 days later, dawn of the dead, diary of the dead,...).

He plays the virgin geek who learns how to survive by his set of rules. He meets up with three others. Woody Harrelson is the gun toting blood thirsty zombie killer. Emma stone and Abigail Breslen play con artist sisters. Together the chemistry is great. What makes this movie great is the chemistry between these four actors.

Should have seen it earlier -- might have liked it more,"I feel like I came to this a little late. I was never crazy about zombie movies, and now not so much about Jesse Eisenberg although his performances in THE SOCIAL NETWORK and THE DOUBLE were incredible. Sadly, although peppered with enough humor to keep me interested, the thin story left a lot to be desired. The basic plot is ""zombie apocalypse...yada yada...a group of people has to survive."" Whatever. What else would you in that situation? What I didn't like was how aimless the narrative was. There were a number of laugh-out-loud moments, most courtesy of Woody Harrelson, but they felt strung together in an episodic fashion. The only time where the narrative felt cohesive and ""about something"" was the climactic battle in an amusement park. And even then, it just felt like a concentrated version of the crazy stuff we'd been getting in more measured doses up until that point. The film is also surprisingly short on zombie action until that sequence. The only detour that felt ""worth it"" was a visit to a certain celebrity's house (even now, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen the film yet). Even though the sequence was just an excuse for an extended cameo, it was funny enough that I didn't care. When it comes down to it, even though ZOMBIELAND is fairly short at 85 minutes, there was still the palpable feeling of being padded and occasionally directionless, despite the gonzo, post-modern approach to the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Delightfully irreverent,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The movie is full of funny little jokes and one liners. The special guest pokes fun at himself. The movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously.It is not just another zombie movie trying to capitalize on the recent very good remake of Dawn Of The Dead. The cast work well together. Although this is not a movie that does not need character development the movie makers have managed to make sure you feel something for the characters.There are no masses of explosions all too common in too many movies today.Yes the characters are somewhat stereotypical, but in this movie it works.

Survival of the Dead,"Having survived a zombie apocalypse by adhering to a strict set of rules, a timid college student cautiously partners up with a gung-ho fellow survivor and two sisters on the run in this walking dead comedy starring Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. The film has amassed a considerable following since its initial release, despite never quite being as funny as 'Shaun of the Dead', the film that inspired it, with Harrelson's energetic performance frequently talked about as a highlight. Solid as Harrelson is though, tinkering between down-to-earth and absolute loose cannon, it is Eisenberg's often deadpan performance and witty narration that makes the film work. He has some simply hilarious moments (casually tossing a swig of alcohol out of a car window so Harrelson does not notice) as well as several amusing observations to make about human interaction and the way society functions. The chemistry between all four main players is really good too, with Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin additionally well cast. The film trips up though by letting Eisenberg ramble on too much about love and his unrequited lust for Stone; some very heavy-handed messages about family and relationships overtake the comedy and horror elements towards the end, causing the film to end on a low note. For the most part though, 'Zombieland' is highly watchable. With zombie attacks kept at a minimum (until the climax), the film unexpectedly succeeds best as an uncanny road trip movie with the characters gradually bonding and learning to appreciate each other along the way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"two girls, a guy, and... a stooge","Let's see, we have a 'fish out of water' character, two damsels, and Woody playing... Woody. The movie itself can't decide if it's a parody of a zombie movie or a zombie movie or just a three-stooges homage (that could only afford one stooge... Woody.) In the end, I just couldn't care about any of the characters, and so what happened to them didn't matter. All I could think of as the running time ran out was ""thank god this will end."" And... Bill Murray? Really? He has one (bad) joke, and insists on being so annoying we all wish somebody would shoot him, so they do. All his appearance does is show that the makers were able to find a character more annoying than ""Tallahassee."" Oh yeah, who decided everybody's name was a city?

Nut Up or Shut Up is The Important Rule. . .,". . . and it's a great rule in the aptly-titled, shameless B-grade, horror comedy, ""Zombieland"", which, unlike the film's blood-and-flesh eating monsters, keeps on going strong within its 88 minutes.Due to some poor schmuck eating a diseased cheeseburger, humanity has devolved into ravenous zombies. Fortunately, there are smart yet unconventional holdouts amidst the chaos: nerdy, coward college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg of ""The Hunting Party"" and ""The Squid and the Whale"") who wants to reunite with his parents and free-spirited, gun-loving redneck Tallahassee (two-time Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson of ""Cheers"", ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""The Messenger"") who has a ""love jones"" for Twinkies snack cakes (I heard they can survive a nuclear holocaust).Along the way, they meet (and get conned) by sibs Wichita (Emma Stone of ""Superbad"") and Little Rock (Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin of ""Little Miss Sunshine"") while trying to find sanctuary in a L.A.-based amusement park. Can this foursome, whose names are shared with the towns they were born in, get along without becoming zombie chow?Rookie helmsman Ruben Fleischer and co-scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have a ball and a half in the flick that delightfully echoes the works of Carpenter, Raimi, Romero and Smith. As CGI captions, the rules to survive and deal with zombies (like being in shape and avoiding lavatories) are boldly and tongue-in-cheek noted, voice-over style, by Eisenberg, who could probably out nerd philosophize Michael Cera any day of the week. His caution trait is matched by Harrelson's macho goofiness and tenacity, keeping each other alive. A younger version of Stockard Channing and a possible Tarantino stock actor, Stone acts way older than she looks while Breslin slyly reps struggling innocence in a dark world; both ladies pull it off.The appearances by Amber Heard (""Pineapple Express"". ""The Informers"") and Oscar nominee Bill Murray (the Ghostbusters films, ""Broken Flowers"") are self-mocking and reliable. I wish there was more of the clown zombie. Oh well. . .""Zombieland"" is a nice place to visit. If you plan to stay, plan to have lots of guns and ammunition, follow Columbus's rules and have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"A funny, stylish, rip-roaring ride through Zombieland","Zombieland is hands-down the funniest horror-comedy I've ever seen.The plot is similar to that of a typical zombie film – anything from Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later – a small group of the living searching for refuge amongst a population of the ravenous undead. However, it's the brilliant and likable group of characters and satirical tone that add spice to an expected storyline. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg serve as a well matched, funny, zombie-kicking duo, while Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin form a likable supporting cast.If I were to compare Zombieland to any other film, it wouldn't be Shaun of the Dead, it would be Scream. Zombieland exudes the same satirical edge of Scream without treading into spoof territory. It remains as a witty comment on the zombie horror film genre without resorting to excessive pop culture references or toilet humour. In Zombieland, if you follow the rules, you'll stay alive.From the ""Zombie Kill of the Week"" to the laugh-out-loud hilarious celebrity cameo and the rocking soundtrack, to the stylish and original ways in which the undead are dispatched, this film reeks of originality and genuine fun. Not in a long time have I had this much fun in the cinema.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"It's entertaining enough, but it isn't quite the 'Twinkie' of its satirical sub-genre.","'Zombieland (2009)' is relatively fun but it just isn't all that funny, aside from a brief but inspired cameo late-on, and, though it satirises the genre in general, it isn't as sharp as something like, say, 'Shaun Of The Dead (2004)' - instead, it's an experience that falls victim to the very tropes it aims to dismantle. It's entertaining enough and there are a few memorable set-pieces, but it isn't anything all that spectacular. It certainly doesn't come close to being the 'Twinkie' of its satirical sub-genre. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zombieland,"Jesse Eisenberg does his best Charlton Heston impersonation as ostensibly the last man left on the planet amongst an army of pathologically fed up zombies. His initial narration gives us a little clue as to how he has survived, unbitten, for this long - and just how dangerous it is to use the toilet - before he encounters ""Tallahassee"" (Woody Harrelson) on what's left of the freeway. Convinced they are both still human, they join forces and go off in search of ""Twinkies"" (that's the food variety and not young gay guys!) They find a grocery store where they are quick to rescue ""Wichita"" (Emma Stone) and her twelve year old sister ""Little Rock"" (Abigail Breslin) only to quickly discover that it's now them that needs the rescuing. Some cat and mouse antics now ensue between what is now the last four remaining people, before things settle down for an an hour of comically inspired adventures that sees them seek safety - in the Beverly Hills mansion of Bill Murray for a while, before a denouement in funfair that sees a battle royal commence that's only really missing Ennio Morricone. The four characters here all gel well and with Harrelson on a form that reminded me of why he became famous in ""Cheers"" in the first place, Eisenberg and Stone developing their rapport and the young Breslin looking on with a degree of sagely amusement, this is a fun film. It's well written with plenty of pithy one-liners and plenty of homages to other films and actors who've tackled the zombie theme over the years too. It's nice and short so we've no extended and repetitive combat scenes to bore us, just some short and sweet slaughtering using just about every piece of kit you can imagine (even a food mixer!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Worth watching - zombies and a comedy rolled into one!,"I thought it was funny and very entertaining. Sure there were some parts that were hokey, but come on it's Zombieland!!

Abigal Breslin was great, too. A matter of fact I thought the movie worked mainly because of the the four main characters. There's a little gore which would normally seem odd for a comedy, but in this movie, it fits. The cameo with Bill Murray was perfect. Of course, I thought adding Ghostbusters was dead on.

Zombie-killing Comedy at its best!,"Well, Zombieland is not exactly the movie you would describe as a ""serious"" horror movie. And, for me, that is the whole point behind the movie.Personally,I believe that it deserves a 9/10 rating and that does not mean that it is the best movie ever known to man. It means that it is one of the best movies in its kind and that it succeeds in delivering a straight-forward blend of action, zombie shooting, parody elements and even some more emotional moments.Now, as far as the acting is concerned, I can say that all of the actors and especially Woody Harrelson did an amazing job and as a result, every scene, from simple conversations to zombie-smashing is depicted in a very natural and vivid way.What is more, when it comes to the scenario, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick created a storyline that can support endless gunfighting, humor and action. Basically, Zombieland, is a movie that does not depend too much on its storyline and just uses it as a means to make things even better. As a result, there may be some gaps in the whole story but this can be considered ,in a way, as one of the advantages of the movie, together with the excellent stage direction.All in all, it is a ,very fun to watch, zombie movie and each and every of its 88 minutes is worth watching. If you are into zombies, action and parody-style humor then this is definitely a movie for you!Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The Twinkie finding plot is weak, and throughout the movie there is no real build up towards a satisfying pay-off, except for interludes between jokes. Basically all characterization occurs through an over-used and highly expository voice over, with no effort put into to bringing out drama actually on screen.Watch it to have a laugh and don't want to really pay attention, but it is a 6, not a 7.8.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Not a good horror, and not a good comedy.","I didn't see any jokes (y'know, funny stuff), beyond the odd obvious bit of visual satire. I didn't see any suspense, or originality. No atmosphere either. This film put me in mind of an extended cut scene from a rushed and unimaginative video game.The only surprising thing about it for me was reading the reviews on this site. One of the reviews I read seemed to suggest this nonentity of a film has usurped Shaun Of The Dead!Shaun Of The Dead had a plot, it had sympathetic characters, it had a clever, well thought out script, it had well conceived and executed scenes, and above all, considering it's supposed to be a comedy, it was funny. This film, on the other hand, had paper thin characters, virtually no script at all (beyond Woody's one liners), no real plot (beyond something akin to a single level of a bad video game, as I've already alluded to), and wasn't at all funny. Funny is subjective only to a certain level of tolerance. I can see what *some* people find funny about rubbish like Mall Cop, I can see what *some* people find funny about Will and Bloody Grace, and I can definitely see what people find funny about Shaun Of The Dead. This film has absolutely nothing funny in it at all - not even smile worthy. No hold on, the 5 minute cameo appearance made me smile...if a little sad too, as he should be a little more selective about which projects he gets involved in by now.Wooo-bloody-hoo.

Any fans of Romero's 'Of The Deads' or Edgar Wrights 'Shaun' are in for a good time,"As an audience member, to get the most out of Zombieland, there has to be a certain amount of surrendering to the material. Anyone familiar with George A Romero's 'Of The Deads', or Edgar Wrights 'Shaun' should breeze through all 88mins with a permanent smile. That said, i wouldn't go as far as to conclude that 'Z-Land' is purely for the schooled flesh- eating aficionados among us. Like it's UK counterpart, 'Shaun', this is top notch silliness played for laughs first, with gore and splatter for seconds. Like the zombies, the jokes come thick and fast. Eisenberg and Harrelson make an unlikely, but highly likable screen duo while Emma Stone adds a dry, sexy charm. If there's a weak link amongst all this fun, it's Abigail Breslin's 'tougher than the guys' 12yr old character who serves as nothing more than filler and soon becomes irritating. The writing by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is razor sharp and although the zombie film is a worn formula, there's enough clever ideas and humour injected into recognising the personality clashes within our central group of characters to make Zombieland feel like a fresh take on the genre. It goes without saying, but probably shouldn't that the make-up and special effects are also a joy to behold and the tight running time assures that the film seldom sags. One last nod must go to a very special cameo. For anyone who hasn't seen the film, i won't spoil it here, but it's a treat and yet another fun ingredient to add to what is a joyous, efficient and likable film watching experience which while not quite measuring up to Edgar Wright's similarly themed zom-com effort, comes a very, very close second best.

ZombieBusters: Your funny bone will be ripped out and gnawed on,"No critical analysis is possible. I just flat out loved this thing and there is not much more that can be said. It's the best comedy I have seen since Tropic Thunder. There's gore galore, it's a zombie movie after all, and it's not for kids but the worst stuff is over in the first few minutes of the movie. From then on, it's sheer inspired goofiness all the way. Zombieland is so good in fact, I wonder if it will kill off the zombie genre. If you watch Zombieland, you simply will not be able to watch another zombie movie without thinking of this one. Casting is perfect. I think this is Woody Harrelson's best comedic performance since Kingpen. And Bill Murray is in it! And he's funny for the first time is years and they're riffing on Ghostbusters! OMG, what more could you want? Man, we needed this movie.The premise is that some kind of virus infects the burger chains and the next thing you know anyone who has eaten one of the mad-zombie burgers is crazy for ""manwiches."" I don't know about you but it makes sense to me. Now, movies about only a few survivors of the end of the world taking on the crazed remnants of civilization are old hat these days. Think about (or not) that awful Will Smith vehicle I Am Legend. Half the trailers these days show movies where people are running around screaming about the end of the world. Get a grip.Zombieland makes the end of the world fun again. It doesn't worry about anyone's sensitivity and doesn't have a serious bloody bone in its body. It's like Mad Max on goofy gas by way of Douglas Adams. Someone must have told the writers to go crazy and not worry about a thing. And you know what, the result is a script that is pretty darn good, a real rarity these days. The survival tips which pepper the film were so good in fact, I was tempted to take notes. I mean if you must have an end of the world movie, at least tell us how to deal with it. Zombieland does just that.My only criticism is that I wished they have made the movie longer so we could see how other survivors are coping (in the film we see only one, a nun who can dispatch zombies with the best of them).

Rule #32:  Enjoy the little things!,"This is a pretty fun view. Not as laugh-a-minute funny as Shaun of the Dead, but it has some wonderful moments.

However, Woody Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"" made this movie for me. His manic energy makes his part lovable yet scary -- look for all the references to movies his character makes. Great stuff! Bill Murray makes a cameo appearance, although - to his credit - that monstrosity is NOT his mansion (it belongs to some real estate tycoon in the Buckhead district of Atlanta, GA). There are some wonderful montages of scenes where the undead (from all walks of life) chase the living (ditto) and there's the subtle underscore of social commentary you can pick up on if you're looking.

The Zombies can keep up the enthusiasm...why can't we?,"First of all, I really liked this film. Well-paced and, in the end, folds with a healthy stack of chips on the felt. Just in time before the tables turn, I thought. ""Nice job!"" Still though, the movie illustrates a gripe I've had with the motif of the resulting production of what seems to be evidence of gestating talent at the helm. I'm talking SUSTAIN, people. There is the pure magic at the beginning of the film....the seduction, if you will. Those of us in the movie going world begging to be seduced WANT to be intoxicated and then sinfully transported into the same rapture promised in the throes of the seduction. To be blunt...we want a crescendo and then a earth rupturing climax, dammit! And why not? Millions of dollars were involved in the production, were they not? Where's the goddamn sustainable energy....enthusiasm.....unadulterated LUST that causes us to wiggle in our seats at the beginning...turn to our date and say, ""OMG...this is gonna be GOOD!""? A movie rarely lives up to the initial thrust. Why is that? I don't get it. The inspirational juice is flowing at the beginning...why can't it flow right up to the end? It's just not fair.Same thing happens with Zombieland. The cinematic displayed action literally disinters us from reality so thoroughly, like the initial rush of an IV drug, I felt suspended right along with the time elapsed motion of the zombies and their exquisitely rendered panic-enslaved prey. It was perfect. Within a few moments, I felt the swoon and said, ""Take me!""....that wonderful feeling while watching a film we're all familiar with. And then...the story unfolded...the character development amidst the motion of the plot. Don't get me wrong. There was novelty...enough to keep me alert and appreciative. But, it wasn't quite what was advertised, I'm afraid.It's so rare that a movie sustains a level of energetic edgy-ness.

Tackling a sub-genre more deeply mined than most, it attempts to do so in an original and interesting way.Zombieland concerns an apocalyptic world in which the main character, Columbus (named, like the rest of the characters, after his hometown), tries to survive regular onslaughts of zombies. Meeting others along the way he carries on, determined not to be eaten, by abiding to certain rules.The film is very very funny. Many laughs, consistent and effective, and well hitting. The rules are a great running motif, popping up in the background where necessary. Additionally, the editing is quite effective in creating laughs of its own, cutaways to other people and flashbacks adding much to the laugh factor. Performance-wise, the acting is great, particularly Eisenberg's, carrying the film well with his appropriate dorkiness. The now infamous cameo, which I won't name in case you're lucky enough not to know and want to retain your ignorance until viewing the film, steals the show with its brilliance: the perfect implementation of the film's style of humour. The plot is fine and nothing particularly original, but ultimately unimportant, the film more concerned with keeping us chuckling. All of the characters work quite well with each other, giving a good balance and range. The central love story, though not all that involving, is perfectly cute and amusing in itself. Harrelson's side storyline is one of the film's better elements, his search for Twinkies the perfect antithesis to his amusing yet surprisingly sad backstory.Good characters, great interaction, funny dialogue, consistent quality. Delivering all you can possibly ask of it and hitting all the right spots, Zombieland is a pure comedy, and quite a good one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Great Fun,"Zombieland is a rare gem: a horror-comedy that delivers on both fronts. It's got a fresh sense of humor and moments of gut-wrenching suspense.I've got a few minor complaints, which I'll get out of the way first. A friend saw Zombieland the day before I did, and she said she was laughing the entire time. I didn't have the same experience - there were certainly some unexpected, gut-busting laughs, but the comedy isn't non-stop. It seemed like the first half of the film had a lot more laugh-out-loud moments than the last half.Also, the horror/suspense elements are mainly an after-thought. Most zombie movies have a pervasive sense of dread, but Zombieland doesn't give you that feeling (aside from a couple fleeting moments). This is easy to forgive, though, since it obviously isn't trying to take itself too seriously.Complaints aside, Zombieland is very entertaining. It grabs your attention right from the beginning, when Jesse Eisenberg explains his tips for surviving in zombie-infested America. The use of slow-motion, narration, and superimposed text in this introduction is stellar.Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Emma Stone are all perfect for their roles, and it's a blast when they're all together. The movie spends more time focusing on their relationships with one another than developing any sort of detailed storyline, which is a good thing.Once the credits roll on Zombieland, you'll be left wanting more. Given the buzz it's received, and its well-deserved box office success, a sequel seems likely. If and when that happens, you can count me in.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Cartoon acted out.,"Its a funny movie if you let go of the fact its not meant to be like Walking Dead or Black Summer. Its a comedy.Having said that, I still can't get over the complete wimp of a 'hero'. Any other actor would have worked. Aaron Paul or Justin Long would have popped in my head first as casting director.As a fairytale the movie is entertaining, but if it involved less 'disney style romantics' and just had more actual entertainment, I would rate it higher.Weak lead, lazy directing and mediocre script.

"A ""Need For Speed"" version must for zombie movie collectors !!","Adds a little bit freshness on zombie movies but nothing more special i gave the vote 8 because of the fresh idea prescribing how to avoid zombies subtitles in the movie rule no7 Double Tap etc...that was amazing.Generally funny movie but i could give a better vote above 8 if i haven't watched a couple of English movies recently this year and last year that i was laughing to death but i cant remember the name of the films at the moment .Brittish succeeded better fun than this but this too was OK for me because i am a fan of zombie movies .This film it is a ""need for speed version"" of zombie movies and a must for zombie fans.Don't miss it is a nice watchable fresh and funny zombie movie with a lot of action but if you prefer really funny zombie movies that will make you laugh till you breakdown in your knees then you should prefer British movies because they really are funny as hell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Cure for the Common Zombie Movie,"The film follows a geeky, somewhat neurotic college student known only by his destination of Columbus (Jesse Eisenburg) as he navigates his way across the abandoned, undead infested wasteland that used to be America. Despite his many phobias and some mildly OCD tendencies, he's managed to stay alive thanks to a set of rules that he lives by, including Rule #1- cardio, #2- the double tap, #4- buckle your seat belt, and #17- don't be a hero. Each of these is introduced bullet point style with hilariously grisly examples of what can happen when you fail to follow them. I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky that he never reaches rule #34.Traveling with him through the deserted remnants of civilization is all around badass Tallahassee, played by the one of a kind Woody Harrelson. The thing to understand about Tallahassee is that he's a bit... off. Most people's first response when encountering a zombie is to kill it, but for Tallahassee, it's not just a matter of survival, it's his favorite hobby. And make no mistake; he's very good at killing zombies. In his hands even a banjo can be a lethal weapon. His one weakness and biggest obsession is that most American of foods, the Twinkie. He knows that somewhere out there is a box of Twinkies with his name on it, and he absolutely will not rest until he finds it.Rounding out the cast are sisters Wichita and Little Rock, a pair of born grifters who make their living by their wits and trust no-one but each other. They're not too keen about working with Columbus and Tallahassee at first, but there's safety in numbers, and it's not like there's anyone else to scam or befriend, so soon the four find themselves LA bound on a post-apocalyptic cross-country road trip.Like Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland has lots of fun lampooning the clichés of the genre, and blood and gore are used to side splitting effect. Never has the falling piano gag been as bloody or as funny as it is here. Columbus and Tallahassee's odd couple dynamic and continuous one-upmanship are also worth more than a few chuckles. And Bill Murray even appears for a fairly entertaining if all too short cameo. Where the laughs really come from though is Columbus's constant narration, which is like a workplace safety instructor crossed with a teenager's diary. It's kind of like those thought balloons in the comics, only more introspective and with more flashbacks.Best of all is the climactic battle at the amusement park, which has all the stylized violence of a Resident Evil movie but with ten times the wit and originality. They've found more ways to incorporate carnival rides into zombie slaying then I ever would have thought possible, and the scene manages to be funny, frightening, and downright awesome at the same time. This is certainly not a kid's movie, but it's one hell of an action comedy, and the cure for the common zombie movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
this movie is disgusting and we loved it! (tiny spoiler),"okay so maybe my daughters and i are twisted, but we started laughing during the credits and laughed almost all the way thru. got a little creepy for a minute but then ramped up the jokes for the end. we were still cracking up when they turned up the lights. i liked SOTD but this was funnier. I can't imagine anyone else in the Woody Harrelson role -- he was magnificent. and the casting for the kid was perfect.this is not a movie for uptight people. but if you've got a pretty sick sense of humor, you might enjoy it.I think it's worth bringing up one of our favorite scenes so you can decide if (a) you think we need counseling or (b) you might enjoy this movie too: we thought the scene where the female zombie was sucking the marrow out of the dead guys' leg incredibly funny -- and calling him her Manwich was inspired.this is one of those love it or hate it films. we found it thoroughly entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Witty, clever but somehow unfulfilled","When i went into this movie i had read the IMDb reviews and checked out the rating, so i guess in a sense i was walking into this movie with some average to somewhat good expectations, however as good as this movie is in terms of humor and wit it still didn't fulfill me in the way that i had expected in the beginning. This movie is similar to the movie burn after reading in the sense that after one watches it kind of slides to the back of your head and you'll either forget it or it wont really have a great impact on your life, which i guess is the aspect i was expect and missed out on. It is however humorous and one is placed in a world where zombies are normal and survival is part of every day life, and i guess they make life and death a joke in the way they play it out and the script itself. It was extremely short, and i also didn't enjoy that aspect, i guess then again there is nothing more to add to the film that wasn't shown already i mean you can only show so much in a world filled with zombies, when there is no true back-story to how it happens and unfolds, but nonetheless i believe there weren't enough violent scenes as well scenes that really put me on the edge of my seat. I will suggest seeing this as it is something new and intriguing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Rule #1...,"Overall ""Zombieland"" is above average entertainment for this genre. It has plenty of new things that add some depth, like the zombie kill of the week and the quirky rules that show up sporadically throughout the narrative, but that being said it doesn't make up for the lazy character decisions and forced moments. It has a nice classic rock and roll soundtrack that fits nicely to the carnage, the product placement is absolutely ridiculous but it is done right in some instances, like the Twinkie which is partly what made this movie so memorable. The way Harrelson looks at the yellow sponge cake at the very end is gut busting funny. The action is bloody and frequent, keeping viewer's bloodlust in check while providing plenty of laughs, it's a great blend of two genres and it's a movie that can be viewed multiple times and the laughs still remain fresh. Despite some serious writing flaws Zombieland is a satisfying way to spend and hour and a half in the undead world.

Zombie fun,"I attended a preview of 'Zombieland' this evening and was very impressed. I tried not to spoil myself much beforehand, so pretty much all I knew was that there were zombies and it was a horror-comedy. Of course, this immediately brings 'Shaun of the Dead' to mind, so I was hoping I wouldn't compare them TOO much and end up being disappointed. I need not have worried. This is a genuinely funny film with plenty of blood and guts to satisfy the horror fan as well.Woody Harrelson is absolutely fantastic in this. Seriously, about 95% of my favourite moments involved him. The rest of the cast is good as well, though, with Emma Stone getting a special mention for also looking great! Look out for a certain extended cameo, as well, which pretty much steals the show. All in all, it's a really fun film. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments and lots of gore – just as it should be :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Funny-scary,"Horror movie spoofs are becoming pretty common—some of them are great (""Scream""), while others are just forgettable. The really good ones manage to both spoof the genre and simultaneously exploit its effectiveness. ""Zombieland"" does just that. The main character has developed a list of rules for surviving a zombie apocalypse, which we can easily assume he has developed from watching lots and lots of zombie movies. These rules flash on the screen at strategic moments, and we come to appreciate their wisdom. The plot, although clever and amusing, is subordinate to the characters here—Jesse Eisenberg as our hero (who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a definite handicap when one is fighting zombies), Woody Harrelson as the bad-ass who's hiding deep sorrow, Abigail Breslin (yes, the girl from ""Little Miss Sunshine"") as a rough tween who fears nothing, and Bill Murray in a hysterical but all-too-brief cameo. This one is good scary fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Family movie disguised as a horror comedy!,"I am actually so happy with watching this movie that I immediately need to recommend it to you if you like zombies and if you like having a good laugh. Humor is not tasteless and stupid, characters are great and movie's style is fantastic. I was laughing like an idiot and every single one of the actors is giving a marvelous performance. It's very hard to make a good horror movie. It's even harder to make a good horror comedy. But while this movie isn't scary, unless you count the presence of the zombies, it sure is hilarious and enjoyable in it's innovative presentation. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Time to nut up or shut up...,"Zombie movies are a cultural phenomena to the modern world. Classics like night of the living dead and zombie paved a walk for the successors and more like dawn of the dead, resident evil and 28 days later have followed. Eventually the interest in zombies deteriorated since the flesh-eaters doesn't had much to contribute. So, movie-makers found a way to revive the genre, which was to add a few sprinkles of humor. The first one was 'Shaun of the dead', and then came zombieland. As the movie promises, zombieland is a fun ride, with lots of laugh and not so scary dead-walkers. Plot doesn't bothers to explain the outbreak of the virus or about the cure, but who cares. All we wanted was a few tough bad-asses shooting and smashing zombies and some situation jokes which will save our money. Zombieland guarantees both.On the acting department, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson shines as Columbus and Tallahassee. Apart from social network, this is the movie that I really liked Jesse Eisenberg(normally, I considered him an overrated actor), and as for Harrelson, I never expected him to be this much bad-ass. It's sad thing that Emma stone and Abigail Breslin couldn't catch up with the duo. The movie also featured the most famous cameo ever done - Bill Murray.The only barrier I experienced was the childish treatments of climax sequences. Other than that, zombieland is worth your money...",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Entertaining and fun,First half of the movie was brilliant then everything seemed a little confined and small in it's scope and its momentum was gone too bad but it's still good imo . Many laughs 😀,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Good Zombie Fun,"I was drawn to this by the presence of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg in the lead roles. They're both good actors and I figured they'd make this worth watching. I wasn't disappointed. This was a fun movie to watch and Harrelson and Eisenberg both did great jobs with their characters.Set in a time when the earth has been over-run with zombies after a plague, Tallahassee and Columbus (Harrelson and Eisenberg - the names of the characters refer to the destination each wants to get to) team up in their efforts to survive. Tallahassee is a tough as nails survivor who's afraid of nothing and who spends much of his time trying to find whatever twinkies might be left after all this time. Columbus is a socially awkward, nerdy loner who nevertheless manages to survive in this zombie-infested world and actually finds love in it as well! They were a pretty good team. They were matched with Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Wichita and Little Rock (sisters). I'm less familiar with Breslin and Stone, but thought they were also quite good as thieves and manipulators who constantly try to run off with Tallahassee and Columbus's vehicles, but then are constantly brought back together with them. There's a really good cameo in this from Bill Murray as himself, who survives in this ""zombieland"" by disguising himself as a zombie in order to fit in - with ultimately tragic results!This isn't your typical zombie movie. To be honest, I wasn't even clear that these were ""real"" zombies. Were they really the dead who came back to life, or were they just really, really sick people? It seemed to be the latter. It's also not really frightening (although there are a few of ""jump"" moments scattered throughout.) But it's a good, lighthearted take on the whole zombie concept, and it's fun to watch.

Fantastic,"This movie was definitely as good as I hoped it would be. Personally, I never doubted the acting. Each actor was in the role they were born to play. For being low budget, the effects and production value were fantastic. Anyone grossed out by any of the ""gore"" or ""graphic violence"" as described in the R rating description, is a bit of a softy. In my opinion, this movie blew spoof cliché's out of the water. It seemed to me that it spoofed spoofs somewhat (i.e. Shaun of the Dead). Cliché's sicken me and this one kept itself from delivering that. The only thing i found as a fault was the actor who played Columbus (who's name slips my mind) was a little/lot like Michael Cera (the guy from Juno, Year One, and Superbad) which I tended to notice a little much. All in all, one of my favorites and one I'm sure to recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

It's a trip. Funny,"Tallahassee (Harelson) and Columbus (Eisenberg) team up with Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) to fight and kill Zombies that have taken over parts of the United States. Tallahassee is also on a quest to find a Twinkie. Yes, a Twinkie. Go figure.To think I had to watch Zombieland to find a movie with real laugh-out-loud (at times) comedy in it. Zombieland has many, many good lines and physical comedy within. To put it bluntly, it's a trip. Normally, I would have stayed away from anything to do with Zombies (hey, I have to sleep at night), but a promo I saw gave me a different perspective, and, of course, the promo was a funny one. So I took a chance.If the movie explained how the Zombies were all over the place, I missed it. Didn't matter, it was what it was. Yes, there is some gore in the beginning, but the scenes didn't last long and later on the gore had subsided. But, cover children's' eyes when you fear a close-up of a Zombie is coming toward you. Later on the Zombies didn't seem to have the same scary effect. They become kind of funny. Really.Harrelson gave a comfortable, comedic, spot-on performance. He is extremely talented. The rest of the cast performed well and no one over-acted or acted stupid, or silly like you usually see in what they call ""comedies"" these days. A good job by all. Well done.Not sure why Bill Murray was in the movie. In fact, those scenes at his residence could have been anyone's place. He was okay, just not sure why he was in there. He was not a Zombie, but was outfitted like one. His reasoning for the get-up did make a lot of sense. But what was really bad, was what happened to him. Didn't make sense. Judge Judy doesn't like things that don't make sense. But, there it was Judge. Go figure.To sum up our history. We have gone after Indians, the British, the Mexicans, each other in the North and the South, Vampires, and now Zombies. What is next? Is there anything left? Whatever it will be, let's hope that there is a serious sense of humor about it all. This was surprisingly good.And, they left it open for a Zombieland 2. Can't wait.

Not your average zombie movie...,"Hilariously funny zombie-comedy-drama.Plot is fairly random, but it doesn't really matter. In fact, the rambling nature of the story just adds to the charm. No, the best thing about the movie is the one-liners, and their delivery. The comedic plot devices, eg Columbus' rules for dealing with zombies, are also great.Woody Harrelson is the known name in the cast, and delivers in spades as the hard-bitten tough guy. However, it is Jesse Eisenberg who steals the show as the dead-panning nerd. (I saw The Social Network before Zombieland, otherwise I would never of heard of him before).

Good Zombie flick,"Considering I am not really a hardcore fan of zombie movies I thought to give this movie a try.I also have to admit there were a few actors in the movie that I have previously seen in other movies that I have enjoyed so that is why I leaned on the whole ""yes,I will see this"".First off if you don't like a little gore and blood this movie isn't for you. If you like cheesy gory fun with some twisted humor thrown in well this movie just might be for you.The movie itself is( I am not going to spoil it for you) about some people trying to stay alive and stay away from zombies and of course kill them. I found that the actors such as Woody,Jesse and the others were did a good job. I must say that Bill Murrays cameo did it for me.That was a hilarious scene/part all together.

Excellent comedy...,"ZOMBIELANDOK... It's time to nut up or shut up.I have seen this movie before and loved it. And can say I loved it just as much the second time around.The story is straight forward enough... it is about a student trying to make his way to his parents house whilst the rest of the population are zombies. Along the way he meets a guy who is very much unhinged and on the edge... they also run into a couple of girls who are trying to make their way to an amusement park as they have been told there are no zombies there.This is not a horror as such... it is more comedy. I was laughing all the way through this film. The language and situations they all get put in was hilarious. Also the facial expressions on the cast are brilliant.There are also a few animated sections in it too which makes this film even better. When one the the guys is telling us about the rules he sticks to to survive, you see them appear in the background on the screen. The same kind of text is during the credits at the beginning. It is really well done because the letters and words get smashed and knocked out of the way by zombies.The casting was brilliant. The actors were Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone & Abigail Breslin. Every one of them had funny moments in the movie and they all had good chemistry. They all worked very well together. For me though, the funniest and main character was Woody. I think he is such a great actor. He can play serious roles and comedy roles excellently.There was also the best cameo ever in a movie... The characters make their way into a mansion and then you realise it is Bill Murray's house... Bill Murray... BILL F*****G MURRAY! haha. Also, Bill has the best line in the whole film. That man is a genius and he makes me laugh so much.The make up was good... the zombies looked gross and the guts looked nice and juicy...

A Good Horror Comedy,"Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best. You usually don't see a zombie movie as a comedy, but you will like this one. Actually this isn't really a comedy; it is more a funny horror movie, because there is bloodshed in a comic situation. There is plenty of blood splattering, plenty of killing and gore, and even some nudity of a stripper zombie. The film delivers you four heroes that you can root for when the zombies come after them. You will begin to love the scenes with the rules of survival that Jesse Eisenberg explains to the audience in a background voice such as wearing your seat-belt, or the double-tap rule after you shoot a zombie make sure he is dead by shooting him in the head again. Trust me; this is not a wasted shot. Woody Harrelson's performance is terrific, as a redneck zombie killer who misses his puppy Buck, and must find a Twinkie at any cost. There is one unforgettable cameo appearance that will take place at someone's Beverly Hills mansion. I won't say his name, but it is hilarious. There is one thing that I must say about this zombie movie that is not normally in zombie movies, and that is the fact that once these zombies are infected they can run very fast. As a matter of fact that is rule number 1, be sure that you can outrun the zombies, because the overweight and slow people were caught first by the zombies. There are some pretty funny scenes, and you will laugh from beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Zombieland is an elite addition to the zombie genre, an absolute must-see","I recently rewatched Zombieland (2009) on Tubi.

The supporting cast, especially Harrelson and Watson, delivers magnificent performances. Well-written dialogue keeps you smiling, and makeup and special effects rival any zombie film. The clever, fun-to-watch action scenes and storyline pairs perfectly with a brilliant soundtrack.

Indie Hollywood finally has an answer to the British classic Shaun of the Dead,"There just aren't enough movies about zombies nowadays. Now, vampires are the go-to horror clichés because of the emergence of the overrated, over-hyped, and overdiscussed Twilight. Now, a GOOD zombie movie comes along even rarer than a real-life zombie attack. Shaun of the Dead is the only exception to the norm, becoming one of the greatest horror-comedy hybrids in the history of film. Zombieland is a successful and entertaining American version of the cult classic. By combining action, comedy, horror, a bit of absurdity, and a small dosage of heart, Zombieland is America's first good zombie movie in an extremely long time. Its box office success can be attributed to the previous fact, by proving potential thrills not seen in the genre in over a decade. The most successful zombie movie in history deserves its major success.The plot is extremely simple, as it doesn't dwell deep into why zombies have taken over and also because there aren't that many speaking characters throughout the flick. Columbus (Jesse Adam Eisenberg), one of the remaining survivors, runs into a trigger and violence-happy Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). They both team up together and go on a road trip towards anyplace that doesn't contain zombies---and contains twinkies. Along the way they run into a dangerous sister duo, a well-known actor (awesome cameo too), and of course zombies. Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Warnick, this movie contains plenty of action but also a lot of laughs and helpful tips. While Scary Movie started the entire how-to-survive-horror-movie shtick, Zombieland perfects it.Woody Harrelson runs the show in terms of performance and scene-stealing moments, but the rest of the cast does an admirable job. Jesse Eisenberg's dry subtle style of humor resembles that of Michael Cera, but let's just hope he doesn't carry this personality to every movie (therefore suffering the Will Ferell Effect). Of course in every horror movie you need attractive ladies, but Emma Stone (of Superbad fame) isn't just a pretty face to look at as she adds a mix of toughness, beauty, and quiet vulnerability. Final note, Abigail Breslin is always fantastic, and it's amazing she isn't 16 yet but displays the maturity of a professional actress.However, the best quality from the movie is the fantastic directing. Ruben Fliescher, a rather rookie director, directs this with plenty of flair and indie flavor. The slow-motion shots throughout the movie are some of the best you'll ever see, and they just add to the visual cleverness of Zombieland. The opening sequence is one of the best in recent years, as it immediately propels you into the mood and tone of the movie. Fliescher doesn't pull any punches as you will see plenty of blood, plenty of gore, and most of the carnage can be seen spewing right into the camera. The camera is never fixated, but is also never shaking to a point in which you can't see what is going on. The special effects are minimally used, which makes it much more effective. Sometimes, excellent make-up can provide better thrills and scares than the cop-out CGI.What makes Zombieland work is that it's as much of a comedy than it is horror and that minimizes the tension and allows for the audience to enjoy the ride---granted there are indeed a few scares here and there. This movie never takes itself seriously, which makes it more enjoyable and more gleeful for the indie crowd. For anyone getting tired of the gruesome rated-R horror movies with little character development, little reason to care, and awful special effects, Zombieland will become your breath of fresh air.Bottom Line: Zombieland is a brilliant action/comedy hybrid, and becomes the best film of its genre since Shaun of the Dead several years ago. Neglecting Shaun of the Dead, you have to go back to 1996 to find a superior horror comedy, which was the instant classic (and genre-changing) Scream. This movie has superb directing, great writing, a wonderful cast, plenty of action, and plenty of humor to look forward to. The only problem is that the movie is short and leaves you asking for much more. But this is the sign of a good movie, leaving you actually requesting a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Had to search this movie and finally rate it,"Just gotta say that I watched this movie when it first released and ever since then it has never been topped. This movie is still my hands down favourite movie of all time no exaggeration! Love the comedy, and plays perfect with the actors ( The actors are all amazing too). I had to finally come back to rate it since the new one is coming and hope it just as good or better, just hope they don't get rid of the old vibe and the feel of those actors with new ones actors. Would definitely check it out if you haven't already but yeah obviously there are people giving it worse rating rating then I but everyone got their own opinions about movies so just be open minded check this perfect movie out",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Darkly humorous romp through a zombie-infested America.,"Having not seen ""Zombieland"" on it's first day of release, I decided to watch it on DVD this night and I was pleasantly entertained yet strangely surprised at how touching and warm it could be.Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, an average Joe who has always wanted a family and to score with a girl. Eisenberg as well as Woody Harrelson(especially Harrelson) give great performances throughout the whole course of the perilous trek with a dash of dark comedy and zombie bashing. There's very little visual effects, but that it's used sparingly is really effective as it lets the audience focus on the great aspects of this film: characters and a well-written and darkly witty script. The story's a bit thin but in the context of the whole film, it works unlike some other films that try to be fun and smart, but end up failing in all levels.I really missed out on this film on it's theatrical fun but fortunately I watched recently and I got to say that Zombieland simply rocks. Black comedy mixed with well-written dialog, zombie bashing, and some touching moments, Zombiland is a blast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Time to nut up or shut up!,"I have now watched Zombieland fourth time and its still great fun to watch. It may not have been as surprisingly fun as first view but Zombieland has good enough rewatch value. More than the comedy I like the feel good theme of film and the way it balances all its drama,horror,comedy,romance and everything else.We all know the plot of any Zombie movie. Here it says some mad cow diseases spread to humans making them mad humans then into mad zombies. Well its absurd but that's not focus of the film. Much of it is about surviving the onslaught of zombies and to find the feeling of being a human in the world filled with these horrid creatures. The story is of 4 such people who are referred to only by the names of the place where they come from. Jesse Eisenberg's nerdy yet disciplined for survival character 'Columbus' meets Woody Harrelson's character 'Tallahassee' who is more of zombie kick-ass with a bit too much love for something called Twinkie. This odd duo meet another duo of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who again know all the tricks to survive Zombieland. Romance is thrown in which looked a bit forced but we are busy admiring the uniqueness of each character that it did not matter much.The character of Columbus is hands down my favorite. His set of rules to survive Zombieland which pop up every now and then were absolutely hilarious. The script is highly enjoyable with some really witty and hilarious dialogues. There is quite a lot of gore which wasn't quite necessary but it adds to the horror element. There is also a surprising cameo by a great comedy star and his entire sequence was the funniest bit of the film. At the run-time of only 88 minutes it never gets boring. The cast is only of 4 people (plus the cameo) and everyone else is Zombie. Each one of them was amazing to watch. It is a nice blend of horror comedy with the right amount of drama and thrills. Nothing feels a bit too much thus making it entertaining all the way.I try to avoid Zombie movies because at the end all of them follow the same path. But Zombieland is not only one of the best zombie film among the few I have seen but also a very good comedy film. Even if you don't like Zombie movies watch it. It is really fun, but make sure you can handle some blood and gore. I would give Zombieland a 7/10 but the cameo part was a show stealer.It is one of the most hilarious sequences I have seen so gave it an extra star.RATING: [4/5]",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"4 survivors, battling 100's of zombies, in search of 1 Twinkie.","With it's gory violence, interesting characters, and flesh eating zombies, 'Zombieland' knows exactly how the zombie genre works and how you can add a little humor to it.The whole movie revolves around Columbus.He is a survivor of an infection that has ravaged most of the world and has turned millions of people into flesh eating corpses.He soon finds out that he is not alone. He meets another survivor named Tallahassee.When they gang up, Tallahassee tells Columbus that he's searching for something.You're probably asking yourself what this thing is.It's a Twinkie.Just an ordinary Hostees Twinkie.Afterall, he explains that it may be the last Twinkie in the universe that anyone could ever enjoy.They soon reach a grocery store where they encounter two other survivors, Wichita and Little Rock.They hijack Columbus and Tallahassee of their vehicles and weapons and they soon encounter each other once more.They eventually learn that they must stay together if they want to survive the zombie apocalypse.What really surprised me about 'ZombieLand' is that it's in the top 250 list on IMDb.Sure, I enjoyed it, but it's not exactly the best zombie movie ever made.There's still a lot to enjoy in 'ZombieLand'.It's 82 minutes ( without the end credits) of pure fun that's either as good or slightly surpasses 'Shaun of the Dead'.Did I also mention that there's a cameo by Bill Murray? Well, there is and it's one of the surprising things about this movie.I give it a solid 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""Zombieland"" survival guide rule #1: Love this movie!","Ruben Fleischer's ""Zombieland"" is one of the best horror-comedies ever made. The horror genre has some real shockers that will no doubt have you cringing with fright in one moment, and then laughing out loud the next - George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) (my favorite zombie movie of all time, and my favorite horror movie of all time), ""An American Werewolf in London"" (1981), ""The Return of the Living Dead"" (1985), ""Evil Dead II"" (1987), ""Tremors"" (1990), ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), and last year's ""Drag Me to Hell."" It comes close to rivaling ""Shaun of the Dead,"" Britain's comedic take on the worldwide zombie pandemic. Now on our home soil, we now have ""Zombieland.""Of course after a worldwide zombie pandemic, one of the last few human survivors is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a nerdy college student whose only real reason for survival is that he's scared of everything, and has an almost endless list of rules for survival; they've done him good so far, but he needs to loosen up a bit and ""enjoy the little things in life."" He soon meets the gun-toting, Twinkie-loving Tallahassee (a scene-stealing Woody Harrelson), who makes killing zombies look easy, cool,and fun. In their travels across the country, they also meet the traveling pair of sisterly survivalists/con artists Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and hope to head for a rumored zombie-free getaway somewhere on the West Coast. (Note that none of the characters in this film have real names, just the names of the places that they supposedly hail from/or are going to.)""Zombieland"" is literally fun from the very start. What gets the movie working from its first moments (aside from the hilarious slow-motion opening credits sequence) are the knowing wink-winks aimed directly at the audience that promise you that you're about to watch something very special. And special this movie is, indeed. The movie is pure fan service to the literally dozens of zombie movies and the nihilistic zombie comic books/novels (think author Max Brooks's titanic ""World War Z,"" which is required reading for any zombie movie fan) past and present that all seem to reference each other. In that regard, it's really nothing special but damn it, it's pure fun from beginning to end. ""Zombieland,"" like ""Shaun of the Dead,"" references them all with a knowing wink-wink and a big, goofy smile.(Another aspect of the film that I thought was ingenious is that the zombies themselves are quite formidable. In keeping up with the recent trends in zombie-themed horror flicks - which I believe originated in ""The Return of the Living Dead"" - these zombies can run and climb over obstacles in order to munch on human flesh. And true to most zombie movies past and present, there are some impressive special effects zombie kills and the zombies themselves often become objects of some of the film's best laughs. It should also be noted that the zombies themselves also have very little screen time whe compared to the four main leads, and don't really become a major element of the picture until the last 20 minutes. Lastly, how do these characters get away with dropping so many ""Z""-bombs? Don't they know that you never say the word ""zombie"" in a zombie movie?)Like ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I had a lot of fun watching ""Zombieland."" As a fan of zombie movies, I'm not quite sure how I missed this movie in the theaters. But I can say that the wait for the DVD was well worth it, especially Best Buy's exclusive ""Nut Up or Shut Up Edition."" It is clear that the cast and filmmakers had a ball making this movie, the most obvious of which is Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee. As a zombie-killing redneck with a sweet spot for Twinkies, he really takes his role to heart with one-liner after one-liner and a knowing wink-wink that he's got this part in the bag.If there are any downsides to the experience, it's that the movie is way too short at just a mere 88 minutes, which actually kind of surprised me when I learned that no extended version of the movie - presumably with more character development and gore - is available. But I guess that's only a minor grievance for a movie that does everything that it promises to do, does them right, and then some.""Zombieland"" is an impressive new feature about the soon-to-be worldwide zombie pandemic. I can only hope that the (proposed) sequel set for release some time in 2011 is as good as this one.10/10P.S.: In a movie that never ceases to surprise you with the laughs, watch out for a hilarious cameo by comedic actor Bill Murray about halfway through.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Best Zombie movie since Shaun of The Dead,"The USA is now Zombieland. Most of the population is either dead or zombies. This is the story of a young man known as Columbia. He is trying to survive in Zombieland. He meets up with three others, and together they fight their way through a constant stream of zombies.This is a well written story, full of humour mixed with absolute gore and carnage.From the outset, there is completed action, without the story slowing down, even for a minute. When you least expect it - there are more zombies.Bill Murray, places himself, and is excellent. A really funny guy. One of his best parts in a long time.The zombies are the fast running kind, who can climb fences and ladders. They are some of the best zombies I have seen.The photography and special effects are first rate, as humans and zombies meet their messy ends.The script has many great lines, and links to many movies.This movie is not for the faint hearted, but if you can bear the gore, you will love the humour.Cannot wait for Zombieland 2!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Dead good..........oh yeah, like you didn't consider using that one !","Perfecting the right mix of 1 part comedy and really any other genre has proved to be difficult over the years. Horror and comedy, as a combination, has been attempted many times, usually the results just underline how difficult it is to achieve.I know i don't need to but we'll rattle off a couple, Shaun Of The Dead, American Werewolf In London and certainly Romero loves him some social satire. Zombieland can well take its place on that list now, the tension and atmosphere of the Zombie sub-genre are intact and the comedy always comes out of the situation and the ""cameo"" is beyond funny.As far a ""genre"" films go this is easily the best film i've seen this year, with the notable exception of District 9, gory, funny, original and fresh, just watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Quite exceptional,"It is fun, it has lots of qualities, sometimes is scary, other times is hysterically funny, but in the end you only get from ""Zombieland"" an entertaining film that overused a few things that worked better in ""Shaun of the Dead"".Zombieland is America after almost all of its habitants were transformed into zombies after a virus, being the last human survivors of this place four people (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone) who have many issues of trust, fighting and surviving with their own rules, trying to escape from being transformed into disgusting creatures. Down on the road they'll met thousands of zombies, will go to Bill Murray's house and meet the real Bill (the funniest part of the film!), and try to have some fun in a amusement park. There isn't much of a goal here for these characters, although the film explicits one at its ending in a almost cheesy way about having a family, having company is what matters in life.The movie works its style of horror and comedy very well, good jokes here and there (Woody's tactics to kill the creatures; or Jesse's rules flashing on the screen all the time e.g. #1 Cardio, things like that), some hilarious moments but its premise gets very weary after a while, closer to the ending which is something very dangerous for the film's good impact on us. It gets stranded in this lack of purpose that one can only wonder: ""So, here's a bunch of characters, they try to survive in a place dominated by zombies and...?"" It is entertaining and all but sometimes even entertainments can be and should be more than just that! ""Shaun of the Dead"" got better results by being scary, funny, intelligent and surprising. Now, ""Zombieland"" fires a lot but only hit a few points.The acting of all the ones involved is very pleasant and funny (Harrelson and Eisenberg being the funniest on scene), some spectacular scenes (the supermarket attack) and it is a nice film to spend a great time.

Does Zombieland deliver? Yes and No... more no than yes,"Having been a fan of the undead since I was 6 I pretty much am a sucker for anything zombie. hell, I have even played one in Land of the Dead, and made two of my own low budget zombie films.After seeing the trailers for Zombieland I thought, this looks like it will be a good movie, and the word of mouth just made it sound better and better so i was excited to see it today.I headed to work early so I could leave in time to catch an early matinée, I was psyched, got my ticket, my popcorn, and drink. Found my seat and settled in, but when it was all over I wasn't sure what i really thought of Zombieland.So, After letting it simmer for a few hours. here is what i think. You will walk away feeling a bit unsatisfied, but your not going to complain you spent $10.00 on it. The best analogy I can give is your thinking you're gonna have this great orgasm and in the end it just didn't happen. You blow your load, but you're not sure if you want seconds or not.The Murray cameo is easily the best part of the flick, and the film has a moral to its story, but it just didn't deliver in the way the trailers make it out too.Final grade - 7.0 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Love it,"""Zombieland"" is such a fantastic ride, it is hard to find fault with it. The first five minutes with the opening sequence and credits set up the exact style of this film. You know right off the bat that it's funny, quirky, scary, gory, and a new bend on an old idea. It is a wonderful black comedy, so much so, that you will be hard pressed to predict moment after moment.Seldom is violence so entertaining. Other than Nazis, zombies are the perfect enemy. They live, only to kill, completely devoid of any positive trait. So, watching shot after shot of zombies getting their comeuppance is satisfying on a colossal scale. The main characters (played by Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin) are constantly finding new ways to kill, dismember, squash, and destroy zombies. And watching it done has never been so enjoyable. Sure, at times the violence is for comedic effect, but elsewhere in the film it is used as a release from a genuinely tense chase scene.Furthermore, this means the movie is genuinely scary. This is not just a hack remake of the same thing we have seen a thousand times before. This is fully new and inventive. From moments full of heart pounding tension to moments that make you jump, the movie does not disappoint. There were several audible gasps, screams, and guffaws from the audience throughout the film.Also, seldom do you find a touching love story in a zombie movie. Since, zombies, by their very nature are thoughtless, irrational creatures that are void of any emotion other than rage; you would not expect any hint of a romantic storyline. Furthermore, most zombie movies are hell bent on inspiring fear. So, to find an emotion connected to a zombie film that is even remotely connected to an inspiring heartfelt one is almost absurd to imagine. Yet, they are able to create one here. I give total kudos to writers, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who so poignantly point out the true difference between the walking dead and us as humans. In a world where zombies live to destroy and kill, we as humans still live to connect and build.Finally, it's nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the big screen in a role that allows him to play cocky, brutish, and stupid: three characteristics worthy of ""Zombie Killer of the Week"". Eisenberg also steps up his game, proving that he is equal to his more popular twin Michael Cera.While some may say that the zombie genre is overdone, I say as long as there are new and inventive ways to kill zombies, I'll keep watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Thar's adrenaline in them thar zombies!,"Went with my fiancée to see this, and from the opening scene it was a bang-bang kind of film, action from one scene to the next, but with enough humor to take the gruesome edge off. Plenty - I mean *plenty* - of gore and laughs to boot. Those who have a weak stomach might think twice about Zombieland. Even I squirmed during some of the more intense violence.And this is the new wave of zombie. Forget the slow meandering living corpses with outstretched arms, moaning and groaning. They kick, scream, run, yell, jump and hoot -n- holler their way to feast. I enjoy the honest spin, how the protagonist gives the true low- down on survival skills. Much of what he shared had me nodding in agreement. The producers take the road less-traveled to give an honest approach of how to cope with zombie life, as though they sensed the frustration of audience members who wind up screaming in frustration at how stupid main characters tend to deal with dead people.Near the end of the film I had to knock a point off for a small dose of stupidity (in my mind) with the main character who paused a while. I felt like kicking him in the britches. But the plot twists and terrific spin by the climax had me sold completely. All in all, it was well worth the price of admission, plus a bucket of popcorn and soda! Just do yourself a favor: Wait past the end of the credits, okay?

Good Zombie Horror/Comedy,"I watched Zombieland yesterday and I must say it is a good horror/comedy zombie flick.I do find it a bit overrated though.It has some hilarious moments, especially from Woody Harrelson's character and a fair amount of zombie gore and action.I don't personally think it should be in the IMDb's Top 250 though.The film is basically about the world being overrun by zombies and four survivors who band together to get to an amusement park which is apparently ""zombie free"".Along the way they kill zombies and get into other misadventures.The acting in the film is fairly good but mostly it has what you would expect from a horror/comedy.

Souped Up Shaun of the Dead,"Zombieland is a more extravagant higher budget, gorer version of Shaun of the Dead, despite this it doesn't feel as comedic or as well polished as the Shaun of the Dead mainly because of the way the film is written in a Deadpool like way. Which I don't mind for one film where our main character; Columbus speaks directly to us because it is a self aware rom-zom-com. Despite this, the film works incredibly well (unlike it's sequel); making fun of classic zombie tropes such as gas station snacks (man that was satisfying), betrayals, amusement parks and romance in the middle of the apocalypse. Overall there isn't much to say except that it is far, far superior to it's unnecessary sequel it came out at a time where zombie hype was quickly accelerating and even if you are tired of the genre today it's still worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Shaun of the Dead 2,"Zombieland successfully does something that hasn't happened since Shaun of the Dead, make zombies enjoyable. While the movie arguably isn't a ""real"" zombie movie like Dawn of the Dead, it still is an exceptional addition to the genre. To put it lightly, the zombie genre has grown stale, boring, and lame if you will. Gems such as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland are what keep it alive, and that isn't a bad thing. While many terrible movies will be released because of these movies, we suffer through them for movies like Zombieland. Speaking solely of this movie though, the acting is great, the jokes are hilarious and very clever (plus an amazing cameo), and the zombies look great. He best part is that there are actual scary parts of this comedy movie. I think the most amazing thing about Zombieland is it pulled a Shaun of the Dead, make zombies funny but also still be a zombie movie, which many believed to be a one time feat.

You can try to restrain him, but one bite and you'll end up a zombie and then the rest of your family will have to face the same choice you have and that's the big danger of the Z scenario.There are a lot of people who hate on this movie, but the negativity should stop because what should be taken away from this are the 10 or more rules, such as Double-Tap, Exercise Running, and the rest.When World War Z occurs, the people who hated on this movie will be happy they watched it.Still, with the shambling zombies, I don't believe world-war Z could occur. With the fast-moving human-eaters in those Return of the Night of the Living dead movies...we'd all be screwed with or without the rules...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Rule 1, Cardio Rule 2, Stay Together and Rule 3, Enjoy","Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has made a habit of running from what scares him. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) doesn't have fears. If he did, he'd kick their ever-living ass. In a world overrun by zombies, these two are perfectly evolved survivors. But now, they're about to stare down the most terrifying prospect of all: each other. Going into this, i thought this might be a cop-off of ""Shaun Of The Dead"", but really it was the most enjoyable film of this year. Woody Harrelson has a lot more fun in this than any other film he was ever in. Fresh off from ""Adventureland"", Jesse Eisenberg lends some talent to this film. And Bill Murray, well, he's just Bill Murray. Zombieland 7/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A hilarious comedy about zombie survival,"Zombieland is a great horror/comedy film about a group of uninfected, who finally become a group after a couple of comedic run-ins with one another. Everyone had a city in mind that they were going to but ended up still together at the end. That explains why everyone goes by a city and not an actual name. The film features a star-studded cast that features Jesse Eisenburg, who plays Columbus. Woody Harrelson, who plays Tallahassee. Emma Stone who plays Wichita. Abigail Breslin who plays Little Rock. Lastly, Bill Freaking Murry who plays as himself.Some themes of the film would have to be friendships and family and chaos. In ""Zombieland"", we see a group of unsuspecting characters in a post-apocalyptic world, come together like a family would during chaos, to cherish the small joyful moments together. The cast did a great job filling the comedic roles needed for the film. I wouldn't want anyone else in any of the roles.Columbus is an introvert, who's careful about everything he does and lives by a set of rules he's made to protect himself during the outbreak. Tallahassee is a rugged survivor, who opens up more about his situation and shows a softer side to him. His main goal is to find a twinkie on his journey. Wichita, who's Little Rock's bigger sister, is reluctant to become attached to Columbus and Tallahassee. We get to see her open up even more to Columbus as the film progresses. Lastly, Little Rock closes herself off to others at the beginning but opens up and becomes brave to protect others when needed.Another film that I would like to mention that's like Zombieland, would have to be Shaun of the Dead. We see both films dealing with friendship throughout both. One did start with friends at the beginning but uses friendship to get them through the chaos of the apocalyptic settings.Some key elements that's used to enrich the themes of the film would have to be the lighting. The film does start out rather dark until more characters are introduced and start their journey together. As friendships start to form, that's when it starts to become lighter until an important situations happens. Camera angles also play a crucial role within the film, as high angle shots were used to show characters during vulnerable states. The audience also gets some bird-eye views of different action scenes to help show large scale action scenes throughout the film.It's a film that I've watched numerous times but still enjoy it every time. It has a great story that includes powerful friendships that are built amidst the chaotic atmosphere of ""Zombieland"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Hilarious,"I'll be blunt, Zombieland, is hilarious. If you're looking for a good zombie flick, then you wont be disappointed. This movie has great action,comedy and characters. The characters are the type that are likable. You get attached to them, and care what happens to them. The atmosphere is excellent too. You really sense the despair in the movie. Society has completely collapsed because of the zombies, and they do an excellent job of showing that. However, you don't need to worry. The vast majority of the flick is comedy. You won't get bummed out. If you like zombie movies, funny or serious, then check this one out. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of my favorite zombie movies,"Zombieland made me laugh so much that I almost cried. I especially loved the beginning of the movie, it is just so weird and different from all the other movies I'm used to see.Zombieland follows two guys, Columbus & Tallahassee, who have figured out a way to survive in a world swarmed with zombies. Columbus is very scared and not much of a brave person, and he has figured out that his fear can keep him alive. Tallahassee is a badass who kills a whole lot of zombies, his only wish is to get his hands on the last Twinkie on Earth.I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and I must say that this one is my favorite alongside with 'Shaun of the Dead'. This movie has a great concept and I so much enjoyed Bill Murray's part in this movie, he has the most awesome scene in the movie, it was hilarious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Great movie.....loved it.....!,"I dint get a chance to watch this movie in theatre. Anyway, i've downloaded this and watched at home. Wat can i say...it was far beyond my expectations. When i saw the trailer, i thought..yeah 'another tryng to be funny zombie movie'. This one s definitely one f the best feel gud movies i've ever seen. Even zombies were superb. Unlike some old movies, where zombies walk slowly, in this one..they'll run after us....so its kinda more fun. Yeah this movie s funny..i found myself laughing most of the times. Really humorous one....i mean humour, not some joker type comedy. And yeah its thrilling also...The movie consists of mainly 4 characters. A teenage guy, funny middle aged guy(not so aged probably around 40), then two sisters. One a teenager and the other a younger one.The hero...our guy, yeah he have certain rules to be followed during this zombie period. He follows them like double tap, seat belt,checking the back seat of the car...which had really savd his life before. And the chemistry between him and the gal s nice...will keep u wondering whether they'll fall in love or not. The middle aged guy who loves twinkies...s very funny. The little gal also have a gud role.I'l say a definite watch movie...if u r looking for some thrils and fun and gud laughs and feel gud stuff. All in one...GO FOR IT... :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Best Zombie Flick Till Date...,"Ruben Fleischer's Masterpiece 'Zombieland' is undoubtedly the Best Zombie Flick Till Date! I don't remember being so, so ,so entertained in a film! Paul Wernick Rhett Reese, the writers of 'Zombieland' are geniuses!The word Zombie petrifies people, but in 'Zombieland' they try their best, but our Hero Tallahassee played by America's first cult star Woody Harrelson beats them to death. 'Zombieland' is funny, brutal, gory, & clap-trap. The climax at a theme park, is full-on.... one of the best climaxes ever!Coming to acting, Woody Harrelson is my favorite actor, right now. De Niro, Pacino, Michael Keaton, Jim Carrey, Dustin Hoffman, Tim Robbins & now Woody Harrelson. His outstanding portrayal proves what he is! Jesse Eisenberg acts & narrates wonderfully. Emma Stone looks a million bucks, and performers, as expected, superbly. Abigail Breslin is just getting better & better with every release. An Icredible Performer! Bill Murray stands out in a brief role.'Zombieland' rocks...... Reccmended for all!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
So The Best Zombie Film in Its Genre,"I believe that if you want to dive into the world of zombies, you must watch all the parts of Zombieland. This film shows that even a small group of people can achieve great victories. It conveys the understanding that, in tough times, only people can help us - indeed, only people. As strange as it may sound, if the film had only Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) left, he would likely have either gone insane or lost the battle with the zombies. The film masterfully blends humor and action, making it a must-watch. I don't know what else to say... My motto is: If you haven't seen it - watch it; If you have seen it - rewatch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
More than a zombie  gore flick,"This film is very well tuned! The direction blew me away in the style of Oliver Stone, with a faster pace and more light-hearted laughs.Characters develop at good pace, and you don't feel empty, but wanting more afterwards. The film parodies much of modern culture which I found fun, while it doesn't detach from the main storyline. The main characters' anonymity (yes, more than one) might be a reference to Tarantino, and if so it's well deserved.The acting is solid and convincing, and the narration throughout is a nice touch inside this genre. The special effects are well used to progress the plot, and blood makes it so much more fun!I recommend this film, if you're a thinker, and you like some messy fun on the side :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
