"Good, Not Great","I saw this movie at a sneak preview, and I had high expectations given the hype, but sadly, this was no ""The Right Stuff."" The problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based, Neil Armstrong. He is portrayed as a colorless technocrat, who is somewhat cold to his family. The movie focuses mainly on his family relationships, and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary, therefore the movie lacks a lot of drama. This is unfortunate since Armstrong led a very charmed life as a fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. The movie covers three of his serious incidents while flying, and he had at least three more, that could have been covered in a miniseries. A miniseries would have allowed for more in-depth probing of how Armstrong became the man he was. The main characters all suffer from superficial once overs. The astronauts were all household names but you wouldn't know it from this movie. The movie also had a hard time capturing just how terrifying some of the events were. Apollo 13 did a far better job of recounting the terror of that flight. Claire Foy as the wife was ok but she also had a degree of coldness about her. The movie also glosses over the misplaced disdain military pilots had for their civilian counterparts. The complaint was that civilian pilots by virtue of their engineering training were too mechanical and not true flyers. This was not true of Armstrong who got his pilots license at the age of 17. The movie should have started there. He was considered a brilliant engineer by his peers, and he was rightfully selected to be the commander of Apollo 11. That brilliance is not captured on screen. By the end of his career he had flown over 200 different aircraft. He was a giant. I think the movie should have brought that out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It felt genuine but left me bored,"The attempt to make it all feel dated and real worked well. There were no glossy space scenes. Add some interesting sounds and a lot of shakes can and the overal scene approach works.But then there is the story. We all know what happens. So it was just about the angle they approached it at. Unfortunately they picked the boring angle.The struggle with grieving was irritating. The lack of substance in the characters was disappointing. The frame was non existent. The length too long. The outcome underwhelming. The ending an anti climatic relief.I will remember this film for the dirty toilets, great acting and my repeated checking of my watch. If you want to learn a tiny bit then watch it. But it is sadly no masterpiece. Let down but the story telling...Recommend? Yes. On a Sunday...",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"One of the most momentous events in history, turned into a depressing drag.","If you are thinking this is going to be a fun, great movie like Apollo 13, well, just rent Apollo 13 and watch that one again.I've been a 'space-nut' and an aficionado of NASA and the space program since I was a kid in the 70's. I'm not sure how they could have made a movie about Neil Armstrong and the first moon landing more sobby-eyed or depressing. It managed to capture none of the majesty, grandeur, or scope of the undertaking- it was just a wet-blanket of constant angst.The close ups were so close-up that they made you want to back right out of the theater, and were shot in a way to make them resemble shaky-handed home-video footage shot on a hand-held. The camera just refused to hold still for anything in this movie, and it was infuriating.I'm sure, at least at a few points in his life, Neil Armstrong cracked a smile. You wouldn't think so from watching this. I know he shunned public attention, but I find it impossible to believe Neil Armstrong could possibly have been as lifeless and wooden as he was portrayed in this film. Foy's portrayal of his wife came across even colder and less joyful than her depiction of Queen Elizabeth.Sorely disappointing. 6/10, and I feel that's being fairly generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
To experience the impossible journey,"'First Man' intrigued me from the get go. It was based on one of the most important and fascinating true stories and achievements there's ever been, and a very interesting man. It had talented actors such as Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, both of whom have done a lot of fine work. And it was directed by Damien Chazelle, responsible for 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land' which for me were both among the best of their respective years.Seeing 'First Man', there is a lot to admire and it was not a problem for me that it took a different approach and an unconventional way of executing a biopic. Can see why 'First Man' hasn't connected with others though, it is a polarising film where one can see both sides of like and dislike and part of me was a little disappointed. With so much going for it, one expects a great film but 'First Man' for me was only good and not as good as 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land'. Ranking it amongst other 2018 films seen, it's nowhere near among the worst it also falls short of being one of the best.Starting with the not so good things, 'First Man' runs a little too long, something that would have been solved by trimming a few of the scenes that went on longer than they needed to. Which would have tightened some of the pacing, some of the film drags.At times structurally it's disjointed, with some of the back and forth not always clear while aspects could have been delved into further. Do have to agree too sadly that the shakiness of the camera work was excessive at times, did feel queasiness on occasions. The ending felt anti-climactic.However, on the most part 'First Man' is visually stunning. It's immaculately designed and there is a lot of atmosphere and elegance in the way it's shot, an effective claustrophobia in the more tense scenes being evoked. Not everybody has liked the music, personally found it very haunting and like with 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land' Chazelle's utilisation of it is masterly. Chazelle's unique directing style is all over the film.The script is intelligent and thought-provoking and while the storytelling was not perfect mostly it did engross me and boasts some thrillingly tense moments (like one of my favourite opening scenes of the year), a subtle intimacy and emotional power. The human drama is affecting and the training and flight sequences tight and have a suitable tension and grandeur. The characters are not what one calls likeable but there is a realism to them and 'First Man' is very strongly acted. Ryan Gosling shows a remarkable ability of conveying a lot without having to say a lot in scenes while Claire Foy provides the film's emotional heft magnificently. There is a detachment in their chemistry but that worked considering the situation, coping with grief and loss does drive a wedge and push people away. The rest of the cast do well, with Corey Stoll surprisingly providing one of the more colourful performances.Summing up, good but could have been better. Not a giant leap in film-making, not a small step either. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Thru the eyes of the first man,"I now laugh when I reread some of the negative reviews - to summarize: it made me have motion sickness so I left, didn't develop the orher characters enough, too somber and brooding, didn't cover all of the events of Niel Armstrongs career, etc. Well, most of these individuals missed the point of the movie or don't understand this genre of storytelling. It is a first person account basically told through the eyes of the first person to walk on the moon. I found this refreshing and not your typical Hollywood approach of trying to fit too much, too thinly for such an epic sweeping story that covers decades and dozen of key figures. It could have been 3-3.5 hours long. Yes, it could have been a TV mini-series or two (or more) movies. I love that it was told through the eyes of one central figure. Told through the eyes of the man that all of the accumulated effort of thousands of people and billions of dollars spent to accomplish one goal before the Soviets and for humankind - having a human step foot on the moon for the first time. I cannot remember a cinematic experience that got me as close to experiencing what it was truly like to be there first hand, in the drivers seat if you will, or better put, insabely strapped into a coffin fixed atop a massive liquid fuel explosion. How any person would be brave enough to face this, be able to perform well while in the thick of it and want to do it again and again is beyond words (or sanity). With death and fear all around no wonder there was a dark cloud hanging over everyone. I am sure all of us have marvelled at what has been accomplished by the NASA space missions especially Apollo. The movie Apollo 13 was a very good story that I thought put me as close to being an Astronaut as i could get. I was wrong. So, go and see First Man. Go and let yourself become THE astronaut. THE first human that was there at the very top of a giant pyramid of people because many before had made the ultimate sacrifice to make possible one giant leap for mankind. i will never look at another manned space vehicle, past or present, or astronaut again the same way,",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Aesthetically laudable, emotionally vapid","More an intimate character drama than a grandiose examination of man's place in the cosmos, First Man is far more concerned with domesticity than the actual journey to the moon, attempting to demonstrate that behind the great moments of history exist personal demons and private motivations. Nothing wrong with that of course - contextualising small character beats against a larger historical canvas can produce excellent cinema.Terrence Malick'sThe Thin Red Line (1998), for example, uses the Battle of Guadalcanal as the background against which to engage all manner of personalised existential Heideggerian philosophical conundrums, whilstMichael Mann'sAli (2001)is more interested in Ali's private struggles outside the ring than his public bouts within it. However, for this kind of storytelling to work, one thing is essential - emotional connection. The audience must, in some way, care about the people on screen, otherwise their introspective problems are more than likely to feel like they are just getting in the way of the larger story. And that is exactly what happens in First Man - there is a lifelessness at the film's core, an emotional vapidity that can't be filled by exceptional technical achievements and laudable craft. The film attempts to celebrate Project Gemini and the Apollo Program, whilst also working as a character study of a man known for his emotional taciturnity. And whilst it achieves the former, the film's Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is so stoic and closed-off as to be virtually disconnected from the rest of humanity.Based onJames R. Hansen's 2005 biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, the film begins in 1961, and hits all the beats you would expect in the lead up to the Apollo 11 mission in 1969; the death of his daughter, Karen (Lucy Stafford) from a brain tumour; his acceptance into Project Gemini; NASA's shock at the Soviet's successes in the Space Race; his selection as commander of Gemini 8; the death of Ed White (Jason Clarke), Gus Grissom (Shea Whigham), and Roger Chaffee (Cory Michael Smith) during a plugs-out test of Apollo 1; Armstrong's selection as commander of Apollo 11; his marriage problems with his first wife, Janet (Claire Foy); the lunar landing alongside Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll); and his private sojourn to the Lunar East crater.With this framework, the film remains tied almost exclusively to Armstrong's perspective, with the occasional shift to Janet. This sets up something of a problem, as the real-life Armstrong was very much a reluctant celebrity/national hero, and despite his extraordinary accomplishments, he was not the most interesting, relatable, or easy-to-empathise-with-individual. With this in mind, the film sets itself the task of attempting to penetrate this most private of men, explaining why he was so singularly driven, even to the detriment of his family, to the point where not only did he plan not to tell his children he may not return from the Apollo 11 mission, he intended to leave without saying goodbye at all, until Janet changed his mind. And herein lies perhaps the film's most egregious failing. It's almost as if directorDamien Chazelleand screenwriterJosh Singerthink the Apollo 11 mission isn't interesting enough by itself - there needs to be some kind of deeper ""why"" behind the whole enterprise.In any case, the attempts to tease out the inner workings of Armstrong's mind don't really work, as he remains very much in his own world, impenetrable to both the other characters and the audience - no matter what Gosling, Chazelle, and Singer do to dress him up, Armstrong comes across as aloof and interiorised. Partly at fault here is Gosling's performance, with its fulcrum of emotionless stoic masculinity. This is a performance we've seen him give several times before - inThe Believer (2001),Drive (2011), and, especially,Blade Runner 2049 (2017)- and this familiarity doesn't help matters. Instead of giving the character hidden depth, the few discernible traits he possesses make him something of a cardboard cut-out, a 21st-century screenwriter's idea of what an American man who grew up in the 40s and 50s should be (complete with retconned political correctness).Another issue is that the filmmakers choose to locate Armstrong's primary motivation in the death of his daughter, which is presented with a mawkish sentimentality that, at best, fails to convince, and, at worst, actively distracts. With the lunar mission presented as much about advancing mankind as it is dealing with personal trauma, Chazelle goes to great lengths to link Karen's death with Armstrong's determination - as she is dying, he holds her and looks wistfully into the sky; after her funeral, he slips her bracelet into a drawer; later, he has an hallucinatory vision of her playing with other children; and on the moon's surface, he drops a bracelet belonging to her into the Lunar East crater and cries a few tears. At one point, Janet reveals that he never mentioned Karen after the funeral, and that's a believable, and deeply emotional, detail. The problem lies in the overkill surrounding it, detracting from whatever genuine emotion such details should evoke. Every time we see Gosling stare yearningly into the sky, the potency of the film is diluted just a little bit more.Did he really drop the bracelet into the crater? The answer is, we don't know. During his interviews with Armstrong and Janet for the biography, Hansen formulated the theory that maybe Neil left something for Karen on the surface. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong if he could see the manifest for the mission, Armstrong told him he had lost it, something which would have been highly out of character for such a fastidious record-keeper. In fact, he hadn't lost it, he had donated it to the Purdue University Archives, but it is under seal until 2020. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong's sister June if it was possible he had left something of Karen's, she said that it was. So, the fact is we don't know what Armstrong did when he wandered over to the crater (his sojourn there was literally the only part of the landing that wasn't by-the-book). However, for me, the whole thing comes across as far too syrupy, an amateur psychological profiling of a man who was intensely private. Personally, I would have much preferred the Lunar East trip to remain a mystery - by showing us what they think might have happened, Hansen, Singer, and Chazelle cheapen the intensely personal nature of the moment, which Armstrong obviously chose to keep secret for a reason.Aesthetically, Chazelle wastes absolutely no time in letting us know that this is Armstrong's film, with the excellent opening sequence taking place primarily from his POV. However, the scene also introduces the first example of Chazelle's pungent romanticism. As the shaking of Armstrong's X-15 momentarily stops, and the noise dies away, a majestic sense of calm descends. However, rather than trust the audience to extract their own interpretation of the moment, Chazelle can't resist a BCU of Gosling's eyes, with the curvature of the earth reflecting on his visor. On the other hand, a well-handled aspect of this technique is that because the film adheres so rigidly to Armstrong's perspective, very little of what he himself can't see is shown. So, for example, instead of depicting the vast infinite expanses of space, Chazelle keeps the audience tucked tightly inside the Eagle landing module up to the point of the descent to Tranquility Base.Indeed, make no mistake, the lunar landing itself is beyond spectacular, withJustin Hurwitz's incredible music andLinus Sandgren's superb cinematography coming into their own. The sequence was shot in 70mm IMAX, and it makes extraordinary use of the larger frame, with the first panorama of the lunar surface almost as awe-inspiring as anything in2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)orThe Tree of Life (2011). An especially well-directed part of the lunar descent is that rather than lay down a busy foley track, Chazelle pulls out the sound altogether, creating an eerie, otherworldly moment that literally gave me goosebumps.However, despite the magisterial last 30 minutes, and some sporadically well-handled moments, First Man is underwhelming, and, for long portions, interminably dull. As good as that final sequence is, it's no compensation for the plodding and lifeless two hours that precede it. And overall, the film isn't a patch onThe Right Stuff (1983).",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Bore-opic,"Overall, I have to say, I found this pretty boring. Felt like I'd gone to church or something, if you can dig that type of boredom. Kind of a bewildered boredom that you can't put your finger on, but you know you'd have rather been doing something else. Almost anything else.Yes, it told the story from the human side, from the side of a father and husband. Yes it was nice that the film wasn't over-glamorised with a whole heap of American chest-beating and back-slapping; if anything it showed the petty pride of the space race perhaps for what it was: a dick-swinging contest. And yes, it showed just how primitive 60s tech was, as though they were being strapped into a rocket-tomb. But boy is this film dry. When it ended I felt underwhelmed and wanting more.Great acting from the two leads, who held the space really well. Certainly didn't find this 'visually stunning' as some reviews have said; I thought the visual treatment of the film was well considered and appropriate in that it felt very mid 60s. In fact, that's how I'd describe the film: considered and appropriate. Except for the music/score, which was c grade. But do we go to films because they're considered and appropriate? I know my father does. Yawn.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent Understated Biopic,"The opening scene will take your breath away. I don't think a single cell in my body flinched for a solid five minutes as I watched Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) fight to keep his craft from floating away into space. The scene is spectacular visually and in every sense of filmmaking execution. It's also a bit misleading.The rest of the movie, aside from the moon landing, is remarkably tame. It's quiet. There are virtually no loud outbursts or emotional speeches. This story is about people doing their jobs, completing their missions. Gosling understands this and plays to Armstrong's stoicism perfectly. He is often an understated actor, choosing to let his subtle facial movements and glints of the eyes do as much talking as what actually comes out of his mouth. Neil is much the same except even less outwardly expressive. He clearly comes from a generation that did not display emotion. They suffered in silence, which no doubt frustrated many family members, especially spouses.Armstrong's wife Janet (Claire Foy) is a classic case of a spouse desperate to glimpse beyond his emotional shield. She restrains for the most part, but her building frustration is apparent throughout. When she finally does unleash her emotions, it's startling. Her outbursts stand out in such stark contrast to the silence that we see from the other characters. Foy is smart and measured with every choice she makes, and she never comes across as unhinged or overly supportive to a point of unbelievability. She's strong as a quiet devoted partner and strong when she senses the need to speak up. Look for her to add another award nomination to her resume come that time of year.For as great as Gosling and Foy are, Damien Chazelle is the star of this movie, just like he has been the star of every one of his movies. I don't mean this as a bad thing. They guy is simply so skilled at what he does that his impact stands out among all the other standouts in his movies. He doesn't take the conventional approach to a space movie, which is to hammer viewers with showy visuals and action sequences. He's careful not to overdo it those areas, instead focusing on Armstrong's psyche and life outside the space shuttle. Chazelle crafts a personal, intimate film and shoots it in a creative way that uses a variety of framing choices so the closeups never feel stale.This is a giant story told on a deliberately small scale. The choice to focus on Armstrong's objectively less captivating homelife rather than the moon mission is risky. Only the most talented of filmmakers, which Chazelle is, could pull it off. ""First Man"" is another showcase of Chazelle's mastery. He's one of the best directors currently working. The fact that this film may eventually be considered Chazelle's 6th or 7th best and is still this excellent, is a tribute to his talent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great visuals, lacks the drama of other treatments","Pretty much gets a 'meh' from me. The story has been told well in From the Earth to the Moon and the film Moonshot. The visuals are stunning, and I do like the (mostly) first person point of view which adds immediacy. Gemini missions never looked so dangerous and claustrophic, which is good. But the film-makers had a choice between covering new ground, and retreading the same ground the other films did, and didn't seem to come down firmly on either side. All the drama of the Apollo 11 landing was pretty much sucked out - yes, it's a foregone conclusion how it will end - but they really dumbed it down, to the film's detriment. Aldrin is reduced to a minor character - and not very sympathetically portrayed, though I'm okay with the latter. No doubt people found him abrasive. But we see none of the clashes that are famously portrayed in the other films (who gets out first, what should be said). Maybe that's the point of the film, we're not *supposed* to know anyone because Armstrong himself was so private and unengaged with those around him.The one thing I thought this movie did better than the others was the actual first step on the moon. I thought From the Earth to the Moon did a slightly comical job, inadvertently, by panning the camera to Armstrong's midsection just as the music swelled. First Man gets this moment right, with a much different musical approach. The scenery looks absolutely real, and the crater that Armstrong flies over in order to land looks as terrifying as it is supposed to, something the other film's could only hint at through dialogue.For those who have the transcript of the landing memorized, though, it's a bit too bad not to hear ""413 is in"" and much of the other famous dialogue - ""drifting to the right a little"", ""picking up some dust.""Worth seeing for the visuals and the Gemini 8 portrayal but all in all seemed, to me, to be a bit shallow. We all know Armstrong bit his tongue bailing out of the LLTV, but this is one of the many details left out in order to streamline the film.Oh, and the idiotic ""where is the flag"" controversy is completely unjustified. If you just have to see the Stars and Stripes, there's a very nice shot of Armstrong's kids hoisting the flag on their front lawn during a launch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Slow, melancholy, boring","My son and I both almost fell asleep in this movie.While the film is technically superb, visually stunning, and artfully portrayed, it's just so SLOW.

It was a depressing experience.I really expected First Man to be something in the realm of Apollo 13 (1995), but I was wrong. Since I am fascinated by history and my favorite types of movies are those based on true stories, I had to see this. But it was a missed opportunity. The director really blew it., since he could have made it an interesting, up-tempo, high-spirited movie. Instead he made it the opposite of all those things.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A very well made, informative film.","One of the most amazing stories ever told, and one of mankind's greatest ever feats, putting a man on the Moon, this film tells the remarkable story of Neil Armstrong, we learn something about the famous man before his incredible endeavours, the hardship he endured, and some of what drive him.On the plus side, the story, as we all know it's incredible, I felt this was told in a very respectful, dry style, events weren't sensationalised, it somehow feels informative. Incredibly well acted, Gosling and Foy are both terrific throughout. Best of all, the visuals, it looks incredible, sets, props, effects are somehow in keeping, it always feels earthly, it never ventures into Sci Fi.On the downside, it's too slow, some of the scenes are endless, it could have been edited to feel a little sharper, it also feels repetitive. The film's length is the major flaw, it's way too long, it's hard not to get a little restless, a little fidgety in your chair, the pacing isn't such that you'll be glued to the edge of your seat. It's hard to engage with Armstrong or any of the characters, you're not given anything to make you warm to them.It's mildly entertaining, incredibly well made, it feels accurate, I feel it's a film that seems to inform, more so than entertain.If you're in the right frame of mind, you may just enjoy it, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This is the experience of being Neil Armstrong over the course of several years and several missions.

"From Utterly Terrifying Spaceflight To Raw Emotional Gut-Punch, First Man is Setllar","First Man, directed by Damien Chazelle cold opens with that I could only describe as an absolutely terrifying look at what it was like to be a test pilot in the 60's, you hear every little nut and bolt warping and you feel every massive unnerving vibration for what felt like an eternity. This set the tone for the rest of the film and signalled that we were in for one hell of a ride.And yet First Man is not just a bunch of planes and rockets flying around, in fact the entire Film is mostly more focused on Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) and how all of these event leading up to the Moon Landing affected him, specifically his mental state. This is where the film absolutely excels, by chronicling his journey from test pilot all the way to Apollo, losing friends along the way.Gosling and Claire Foy push out really stellar performances here, the relationship between the two seems very very plausible and there is a lot of very emotionally charged scenes between them throughout. The supporting cast is packed to the brim with recognisable faces too, a standout for me was Jason Clarke's performance as Ed White, the first American to EVA in space who at first I thought I really wasn't going to like the character but by the mid-point of the film I was sold.One of the qualities of First Man that I noticed almost instantly was the very unique Cinematography which most of the time uses handheld medium to long telephoto shots creating a very intimate and raw look to the images on screen. The other main quality visually is the fact that most of the film was shot with 2-perf Techniscope film which gives a very organic vintage look, usually i'd take issue with a lower resolution stock for a film like this but here it really fits in with the overall aesthetics.In First Man we do get some really ridiculously stellar space sequences, the way these are edited and shot create almost pure dread, in fact the only time I have felt this on edge was when I saw Gravity for the first time, it is that bloody good. Production design is fantastic and of course when we get to the Apollo sequence the images on the screen are graceful and an utterly mesmerising experience.From impeccably shot terrifying spaceflight to absolute gut wrenching heartbreak, First Man is something to be seen on the biggest screen possible with the loudest sound. I highly recommend this film and the moment this comes out in UltraHD you can be sure I'll be there Day 1.Thanks to Universal Pictures Australia for the invite to the Premiere.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history,"First Man is a historical biographical drama film based on the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong, directed by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land). Starring Ryan Gosling in the lead role, it paints a beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history.In the 1960s, the space race between the USA and the USSR is at its peak, with the latter having a clear lead over the former. In attempt to outdo the Soviets, the United States plans a manned mission to the moon, with astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) being the first to set foot on the lunar surface. Despite the deep personal losses he has endured throughout his training and in his home life, Armstrong agrees to the mission, knowing full well that he may not come back alive.Superbly directed and acted, the film is less a story about the space race itself and more about the struggles and perseverance of titular first man. Ryan Gosling gives what could very well be the performance of his career. His nuanced depiction of Neil Armstrong shows the audience how much the astronaut has to lose if he does not survive such a monumental journey. Claire Foy is also worth noting as Armstrong's first wife Janet. Her concern and worry for her husband's safe return from the moon were brilliantly represented during the film's more emotional scenes. Director Damien Chazelle demonstrates his talent for creative cinematography, showing the vastness of space and how small and insignificant Earth is in comparison. Films like this truly emphasise how much mankind has accomplished in the short amount of time we have existed and further highlight how much more is needed to be done.I rate it a solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It's a splendid ride worth taking in history.,"""You're a bunch of guys making models out of balsa wood! You don't have anything under control!"" Janet Armstrong (Claire Foy).After Janet, wife of Neil (Ryan Gosling), in 1969 has been told by Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) at Mission Control that they have everything under control for the moon landing project, Apollo 11, the audience has to agree with her that the control is dicey and probably rests mostly with the astronauts. As Janet implies, no one is completely in control, perhaps only fate is.First Man is the story of the flying '60's, from Neil 's X-15 ride in 1961 (""bouncing off the atmosphere,"" as Mission Control says), to the Apollo 11 initiative as the crew prepares to land in 1969 on the moon. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) walk the walk.Throughout, the film is as cool as President Kennedy seeing the obstacles merely a proving ground for the greatness of the US and mankind. It's a powerfully immersive film placing audience in the seat with the star sailors, especially Armstrong, as they go through the various stages of space flight from the important Gemini Project in 1961 to Apollo 11 in 1969.The Apollo 13 film about the aborted 1970 Apollo lunar mission and The Right stuff about the first manned space flight by the US are romantically right on and visually glorious. A different kind of success for First Man is director Damien Chazelle's, who takes us into the cockpit in the air, and at Neil's home, for what are reality shows as they ought to be.The glamour is in the sealed capsules and the ingenuity of the astronauts, whose engineering skills are amply used in harrowing glitches. The reality is the possibility of failure and death families must live with each day.The point of view is mostly Armstrong's even when he's not at the controls. Jane is unlike many other whimpering, complaining 
wives in films where the men do the daring; like Armstrong, she's cool, and especially when she exhorts him to explain to his sons that he might not return from the moon. She's tough with the right stuff for a partner in what the film shows to be an icily daring and dangerous profession.First Man is a story of history, adventure, sentiment, and humanity. It has it all, and while some may complain we don't see the colorful earth and moon enough, Chazelle has shown what the astronauts saw, not what film makers would have liked them to see.""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.""What Neil Armstrong supposedly said with his first step on the moon.

"Good movie, but questionable sequences and headache-inducing camera work","""First Man"" (2018 release; 141 min.) brings the story of Neil Armstrong and NASA's quest to get a man on the moon before the Russians could. As the movie opens, Armstrong is testing a plane in the upper reaches of the atmosphere (140,000 ft. altitude), and after initially bouncing off of the atmosphere, managers to get back safely, at which point the movie tells it's ""1961, Mogave Desert, CA"". We get to know the Armstrong family, including the desperate health battle of their young daughter Karen. Armstrong makes it through the Gemini astronaut selections in 1962, prompting a move to Houston. ""It's a fresh start"", comments Janet. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Damien Chazelle, whose previous two films (""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"") hit the bull's eye. Here he brings the book of the same name to the big screen. The biggest challenge with a movie like this is how to keep things interesting, if not dramatic, when we already know the outcome (will Armstrong perish in the test flights? urr... NO!). That doesn't mean that some of the footage of these flights isn't terrific. I have a greater issue with the camera work. I totally get it that Chazelle wants to convey the claustrophobic feeling of being inside the small space capsule , and he does a terrific job at that (if you have visited the National Air $ Space Museum, it truly is shocking to see how small and primitive-looking these capsules were). But the movie incessantly features extreme close-ups and headache-inducing handheld cameras for much of the time, for no apparent dramatic reason (at one point Janet crosses the street to talk to her neighbor Pat--you'd think that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale has just hit). Also questionable to me are some of the sequences involving Neil and Janet (just one example: when Janet visits Neil in quarantine upon returning to earth, neither of them has any smile or joy--or sign of relief. I doubt that was really the case. But maybe I am nitpicking.In case you aren't aware, Neil Armstrong lived the last 30+ years of his life here in Cincinnati (where I am) until his passing in 2012. He was a notorious pack rat of memorabilia throughout his career (never mentioned or alluded to in the film) His sons Mark (who still lives in Cincinnati) and Rick have recently announced that thousands of items from Neil's personal collection will be auctioned off...The movie opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely but not quite a sell-out. The movie performed not quite fully up to expectations at the box office ($16.5 million). I can't help but feel that many expected bigger things. The movie is good, maybe very good, but it is not the critical home run that was either of Chazelle's earlier movies. Still, it will likely garner a number of Oscar nominations. If you liked ""The Right Stuff"" or ""Apollo 13"", I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A Subtle, Well Done Film","Having seen this film twice and liked it a lot, I also can understand why it has received so many harshly negative reviews. This is a character study of a famous man. However, it also strips away much of the glamour and nostalgia with which older Americans remember the space program. It has many scenes filmed in darker colors and deliberately has a claustrophobic feel to it. The handheld camera shots annoyed many viewers, but I felt that they symbolized the haphazard way in which the space program moved forward. As a country, we spent a lot of effort to lock up a few men, send them off into space, with the goal of having a photo-op on the moon before the Soviet Union got there. It is difficult for anyone who did not grow up before the 1980's to understand how frightened we were about the Soviet's lead in space exploration and how we made everything a battle between good and evil, with the Soviets being portrayed as evil. Given the logic of the Cold War, the notion of beating the Soviets to the moon made sense. We see a little of this emerging today with the fear of China, but it is hard for someone who did not live through the 1960's to appreciate how well this film captured what likely was going on under the hood.For someone who wanted to see a real-life version of Star Wars, and wanted nonstop action, this is absolutely the wrong film to see. For someone who wanted a well-crafted study of a person who was really a pawn in the Cold War, this is a masterpiece. This is a film that bears additional viewings, becaus there were many scenes in which what was not discussed, but was in the background, whether it was the music, the staging, or the throwaway dialogue, was more important.I did not give it a ""!0"" rating because I felt that it could have been 10-15 minutes shorter, retained the message and feel of the film, and been even more powerful as a result.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well-Intentioned but Generic Recreation of a Great Event in History,"Being a fan of Damien Chazelle's other films as well as of Ryan Gosling's acting, I was excited to see their interpretation of Neil Armstrong's famous moon landing, an event which has served as an inspiring symbol of the greatness that mankind can aspire to be. In a time when franchise movies and blockbusters dominate the marquee at mainstream multiplexes, it's refreshing to see good old-fashioned adult dramas in wide release like this and ""A Star Is Born"" (even though, of course, I do enjoy some blockbusters.) While the film has some good cinematography and a commendable lead performance by Gosling, the film feels dry and rather generic.I understand and respect what Chazelle was trying to do here, and I acknowledge that the moon landing has been depicted enough times in popular art that it can be difficult to depict it one more time and still feel uniquely authentic, but the film unfortunately does have some serious flaws. The film's pacing is rather strange, as much of the middle section of the film feels melodramatic in a way that is directly at odds with its rousing opening scene and climax. Gosling's performance is poignant and thoughtful in its inner simplicity, but unfortunately Claire Foy is not given too much to do here as Janet Armstrong. (Too bad, because she certainly has acting talent.) Additionally, the film's juxtaposition of scenes is rather unusual. Before the moon landing finale, the film jumps from moment to moment dealing with Armstrong's life, yet not all of it adds up. These depictions generally miss the mark in terms of making you further care about Armstrong moreso than what you see in the space scenes. I liked that Chazelle shot some of the space scenes in the cockpit to allow the viewer to engage in the intensity of the experience, but the cinematography sometimes felt off during these moments. Perhaps it could have been even more effective and immersive to film some of the space scenes in first-person from Armstrong's perspective. With their old-fashioned aesthetic and simple dialogue, many of these scenes feel like Chazelle is playing it far too ""safe"" here. It's commendable that he wanted to show respect to Armstrong and his family, but he's a seasoned auteur who could definitely have created a thoroughly respectful portrait of Neil Armstrong while taking a bit more artistic risk.All in all, I didn't dislike ""First Man"" by any means, but I wasn't too enthused about it either. 6/10Note: I saw this movie in IMAX. The opening scene and moon landing scene were both very good in IMAX, but the rest of the movie (which adds up to a little under two hours) barely uses the format at all to enhance the viewing experience, even slightly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Incredibly Moving, Visually Stunning, and Simply Breathtaking.","I was fortunate to see this fantastic movie at a small film festival in Oregon and it was a wonderful cinematic experience. A Visually stunning story of one of the great achievements of humanity. The science is fascinating and the effort behind that science is paid a wonderful tribute. The journey to the moon is as much a spiritual one as a human achievement. The men who made that trip are portrayed in all their humanness and incredible dedication. This is indeed a patriotic film and despite some controversy regarding not depicting the planting of the flag on the moon, flags are everywhere in the movie and the flag is certainly shown at the landing site. There is no doubt this was an American accomplishment and that is clearly celebrated. The inexplicable controversy about the U.S. flag is one of those contrived internet stinks from fringe elements who have never seen the film. It would be a tragedy to allow such nonsense to savage a film that is so inspiring and emotionally satisfying. This is a spectacular, exciting, stunning film and it should be seen by everyone as a reminder of the beauty of what happened in July, 1969.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not overly engaging historical drama,"'First Man' is the story of Neil Armstrong (Gosling) and how he became the first human to walk on the moon. It's amazing that after almost 50 years, this film's never been made before - but we've had 'Space Cowboys'! While largely focused on Armstrong, the film does a good job of showing how essential all the other NASA engineers and astronauts were during the 1960s to making the Apollo 11 mission a success.The film spends almost as much time exploring Neil's relationships with his family - wife Janet (Foy) & sons Eric (Winters) and Mark (Blodgett). They certainly go through their share of tragedies and funerals, making the film quite melodramatic. It almost gets bogged down in politics in the middle too. While Gosling's OK, he comes across a quite bland and boring - possibly intentionally. I think he was going for humble, but ended up as mild.The film's at it's best when it's focusing on space - rather than watching the rocket launch from distance, like on TV, we're stuck in the cockpit with the astronauts as they're shut in, and it's quite claustrophobic. But instead of cutting away, we experience lift-off from their point of view - all the noise, shaking and velocity. It's annoying there's often a black screen for seconds at a time, but it's realistic for space. The score's OK and you do get to spend some time on the moon. It's certainly no 'Apollo 13' or 'Gravity', but has it's moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Highly recommended.,"I really enjoyed First Man. It was realistic, emphasizing the skills of the astronauts and the risks they took in this endeavour. Ryan Gosling very good as Neil with an excellent well known supporting cast of actors.

Fine editing too in this film, no unnecessary scenes getting in the way of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Incoherence marries Interstellar (seen in IMAX),"There's a huge difference between something that was ugly from the start and something beautiful that was marred. This film is the latter. Gorgeous shots, creative composition and movement and cinematic energy are juxtaposed (intentionally, but not necessarily well) with shots that I can only conlude were taken by putting the camera at the end of a giant spring doorstop and *thwang*ing it, and somehow doing the same with the audio.Disorientation, lack of visuals, and auditory confusion are all key to portraying period's equipment and technology. However, there is a rhythm of confusion and order in space faring filmmaking. It's being upside down and sideways, struggling to regain control of the craft, audible and visual chaos, etc. that movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey and Interstellar perfect, but ""First Man"" gets so so wrong.The second issue with the film is it's extraordinarily poor character relatability. After losing their daughter in the first scenes of the film, Neil and Janet Armstrong are emotionless and heartless characters, but not in a manner that's useful for storytelling. Their rare displays of feeling are in Janet's case put off onto an apparent smoking addiction and in Neil's case shielded by his reflective headpiece (with the exception of a spoilery moment that didn't ring true because of lack of substantive foreshadowing).We've all seen gorgeous imagery of landscapes in space. I wanted to feel the moment of man's first steps and the look on Neil's face, and all I got was a half-recreation, half-historical footage emotionless piece any youtuber could have made.Then there's Buzz Aldrin, whom Damien Chazelle really seems to have it in for, making him out to be a royal a-hole at every turn and earning the disgust of Armstrong. But it all backfires on Chazelle, because he gave zero screen time to any relationship building between the two men, who are described by historians as having a great working relationship despite being very different men. But no, according to this film, Buzz was an a-hole, and we don't know much else. Do you think NASA would have allowed two men to depend their lives upon one another if they had that poor of a bond?There has been much attention given to the film for things like it's attention to the flight maneuvers and descent onto the lunar surface, but zero attention is given to the things that people want to know: who decided who would step out first? How did Collins feel seeing the moon from so close but yet having to stay in the command module? What was it like to plant the american flag? Show us the reactions of houston, his family, and the planet as a whole!But no, just panorama shots of the surface and flashbacks to a picnic.5 stars in generous for this extreme disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A cinematic masterpiece.,"Gosling and Foy are at the top of their game in this one. Damien Chazelle managed to make a perfect moon landing movie that shows both the positives and negatives of the NASA program. Don't go into this thinking it's a huge patriotic, space adventure.

Way too slow and untidy camera work,"Came watching this with high expectations but was kinda bored by it, actually my wife did literally fall asleep in the cinema.As many have said there were too many facial close ups and too much shakiness, a lot less would have worked.The story made Buzz Aldrin out to be very dislikable and totally put Mike Collins into the back ground. Whilst this film is about Neil Armstrong these guys also went to the moon (apparently) too, so a little bit more respect with their characters would have been nice.This film had great potential but it focussed to heavily in many wrong areas and this was it's ultimate let down.Save your money and wait for hit to hit the internet.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Slow, responsible, and balanced but produces quite the emotional aspect too","First Man is not the film for air-punching relief at the end of tense scenes of danger which have been preceded by tender scenes making us care about the people in those moments; this is not to say that on this basis alone that it is a better film than those that do these things, but it is certainly different. There is an emotional core to the film but mostly it is deliberately distant, cold, and balanced. The Armstrong of the film is all these things, and the film follows him in that way. There are no big moments to speak of - even the moon walk is reflective and silent.This produces a film that engages by how consistent it is, and the feeling of accuracy and observation. It runs long but if you get the feel/pace early on then it doesn't feel it. Instead it offers more character in Armstrong, as hard as it is at times to like him, it is engaging for how he is. The downside of this approach is that the film can be boring if you aren't going with it or if you wanted it to be more like Apollo 13. While at times I wanted it to have at least some scenes like that, it worked well without them, and the impact of the opening scenes ripples through the final ones because of how restrained it all is.Chazelle's direction gets this tone right, and produces a convincing performance from Gosling. It is an odd one because it seems so featureless but yet there is a lot there. He is well supported by a host of recognizable but not too recognizable faces, but it is Claire Foy who gives the film its heart, and pulls off the difficult job of having the human, emotional moments but yet not making them feel like they are breaking out into a different film.First Man is slow and deliberate, but it works for what it sets out to do, and plays like a responsible, balanced, and even-handed bopic which manages to have more of an emotional impact due to how little of it is worn on the sleeve or shouted over the orchestra.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Stunning direction... poor characterization... mediocre production,"I attended the premiere of the movie in Salt Lake City with my friends, whom I brought to the cinema with a promise of a great movie, staring Ryan Gosling, and they were not disappointed. Most of them liked the movie but it was not what is expected from an admired movie about Apollo mission to the Moon.
The pace of the film is reasonable. It starts at the right place, where it shows how Neil Armstrong joins NASA and it does not jump forward. Everything is on the track. It TRIES to keep a balance between showing Neil's domestic relations with his family and his achievements and struggles at work until he makes it to the moon. That is good directing and somehow good script.The problem with the characters is that after the movie you cannot tell what kind of person each on of them are. Neil himself does not talk much and he's always down and blue, apparently because her daughter dies of cancer many years ago. What we see is that he is a silent person who does not care much about his family and is too much into his work. There is a strong presence of apathy in his reactions which is rooted in directing, screen writing and the acting altogether. It kinda ruins your notion of a successful person and not like non-perfectionist realism, but more like why that guy acts this way. Other characters are not developed any better. Neil's interaction with his wife, children or even his colleagues are always vague and ambiguous at best.And just because it is an admired movie, don't expect a production quality like Gravity or Interstellar. There are too much camera zoom and too much camera shaking. A large portion of the movie shows thrilling moments of launching rockets or when rockets are in trouble, and all you can see is the camera shaking like crazy for too long while it is zoomed on faces or spaceship walls. That along with the loud sound of cinemas you get a small dizziness by the end of the movie.For most of the part I focused on drawbacks, but it is still a relatively good movie that shows the chronicles and history of the most important (claimed!) space travel, with good production design.
It is worthy to watch. Go and see it. But lower your exceptions!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

DONT EXPECT IT TO BE WRAPPED IN GLORY,"I think the main problems that arise in other people's reviews is that they all expect this movie to be glorified and happy since the moon landing is presented as an exciting and exhilarating moment in history. Don't get me wrong, it is very much that, but this isn't about the moon landing per say, and instead it focuses on Neil Armstrong's journey to how he got there. His story is depressing to say the least. There were points in the movie that I teared up because it depicts what Armstrong lost to get to where he got, and this is extremely interesting in my eyes. I think with this film we got to see behind Armstrong's fatigue, and the happy man you see on historic evidence.Overall, I absolutely loved this film. But if you don't like depressing and shocking films and would rather stick to the moon landings being about celebration and making history, then I don't recommend First Man to you. Despite saying that, I think at the end of the film you feel a lot of contentment and tranquility, and at times the scenes are extremely silent or shocking. So I don't know how people found it boring. Could watch 100 times. Very highly recommend to people who seem interested.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The Man Behind One Of The Most Famous Events In Human History,"Easily one of the most famous events in human history is centered around a singular man, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling). Behind the Apollo Mission that landed the first human on the moon, Neil is a man with conflicts, a man with a history and a man with a mission.Despite being mainly focused on an intense-action packed mission, First Man explores many avenues that include dramatic and intense moments which spawn from the heart-wrenching grief of losing a child to the intricate and beautiful romance with his wife, Janet (Claire Foy). Much of the movie has emotions that are quite far from being out of this world, specifically in its massive focus on the family.The film begins up close and personal seeing Armstrong in his daring mission on the rocket-propelled plane, the X-15. Immediately, the story shows just how dangerous space exploration can be and how close those who brave exploring the final frontier get to never returning home. It follows Neil and his story intimately from the X-15 mission to the loss of three astronauts (close friends of Neil's) in Apollo 1, the near-lethal mission of Gemini 8 and, of course, the incredibly daring mission of Apollo 11, that landed the first people on the Moon. Throughout these milestones in space exploration, the story pauses to look at the relations and life of Neil, truly unveiling the blueprints showing who he was as a man.While incredible in revealing a massive side of this well-known historical event, the film attempts to focus so much on a story that has little to tell. The length clocks in at just under two and a half hours, which feels very stretched after the adrenaline of the exciting opening scene wears off. Neil Armstrong is portrayed as a deep man with little visual emotions mixed with dramatic internal conflicts. While this decision allows for excellent character design, it makes him rather boring at times. It seems the writers wished to divide First Man into three stories - one, the story of Neil as a man; two, the story of Neil as a father and three, the story of Neil as an astronaut. All three have their pros and their cons, but mixed together, the film becomes daunting and stretched.The cinematography sadly could have been better. Only a handful of camera shots do not shake. In most shots, the camera moves constantly or jitters. In the beginning, with the X-15 mission, this effect adds to the entertainment of the film. The audience quickly becomes sucked into the important and lethal mission with dangers at every corner. After two hours of shaky camera shots, that excitement changes to annoyance. While a mix would be ideal, and in more intensive scenes a camera shake would be appropriate, having the entire runtime featuring shakiness as well as many blurry shots, looks amateur and comes off as poor execution of what should be an interesting and captivating story.However, the film does go beyond the moon in many ways - predominantly, in the acting. Neil Armstrong has deep faults and that stands as a challenge to any actor. Ryan Gosling nails the role in what turns out as an Oscar©-worthy performance of the famous astronaut. Others, including Claire Foy, also deliver extraordinary performances bringing each character to life. Despite the fact that no one can hear you scream in space, the sound design really belongs out of the world due to the quality and complexity of the sound effects. Much of First Man contains loud, intricate sound effects that vary and cover a massive spectrum. Perhaps more powerful would have been the use of silence in the most dramatic moments, sending chills to the entire audience.My favorite scene is one of these moments of eerie silence. In this scene, three members of the Apollo 1 mission do a test in the Apollo capsule. It goes horribly wrong and the interior of the capsule catches on fire, sadly, resulting in losing the lives of all three. Yet, the film takes this a step further, as the three fallen heroes are not new in this scene. The viewer gets time to like them, understand them and befriend them - just as Neil did in real life. This makes their sudden and dramatic loss nothing short of shocking and cold, replicating the real-life impact it had on Armstrong.Although, First Man has a strong beginning, a strong ending and many high points throughout, it also has many mistakes and things that could be improved that simply negate the extraordinary story of this story. For that reason, I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. The story is quite intensive and is best suited for older audiences that will understand the impact of the events so I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. This film opens nationwide in theaters on October 12, 2018 so, look for it.

"Not exactly a biopic, nor a comprehensive account of the moon landing; First Man feels conflicted","For a largely uncharted territory, space has proven to be well-trodden ground in film. From Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, which offered a uniquely visceral perspective into the sheer force of will necessary to survive above Earth, to Hidden Figures, which provided valuable insight into the overlooked behind the scenes work of female minorities at NASA, there have been no shortages of quality space films over the past few years.For his fourth feature film, acclaimed director Damien Chazelle, provides his own addition to the space race by charting the life of Neil Armstrong in the years leading up to him becoming the first man on the Moon. While ostensibly a film about Armstrong, it would be remiss to call First Man a biopic. The film splits its focus between Armstrong's family life and the intense weight his mission bore down on his loved ones, while simultaneously trying to glorify the magnitude of his achievement as a sort of hagiography. By trying to have it both ways, First Man feels conflicted and struggles to provide a fresh perspective on well-documented history.Part of the problem lies in Armstrong's inherent nature. As an introverted individual, Ryan Gosling's performance comes off as accordingly cold and distant. He embodies Armstrong as a quiet, contemplative man who mostly keeps to himself and is singularly focused on the success of the mission. The blandness of Gosling's performance may be misconstrued as shallow characterisation but he successfully communicates Armstrong's stoic determination that was necessary for the lunar mission to succeed. The issue, however, is that the film never successfully matches his low-key nature with enough dramatic heft (particularly as the outcome of the lunar landing is well-known history), leaving long stretches of the story feeling dry and uninvolving.In fact, most of Armstrong's personality traits can be gleamed from his relationship with his wife, Janet Shearon, played with powerful force by Claire Foy. Without a doubt, the most effective dramatic scenes are the ones shared between Gosling and Foy. A dutiful housewife and loving mother, Foy's Shearon is no pushover and she stands her ground against the boys club that is NASA. When Armstrong attempts to leave for the Apollo mission without saying goodbye to their sons, she confronts him emphatically and forces a family sit down. Her assertive nature clashes sharply with Armstrong's nonchalance, and she offers a stark psychoanalytical counterpoint to him.However, the film defers digging too deep into Armstrong's psychological state by keeping the lunar mission in the forefront of the narrative and his family life as ancillary, in case it would lessen the reverence surrounding his achievement. You only get glimpses of his home life and the resulting fractured sense of characterisation is likely to leave you feeling more conflicted about who Neil Armstrong was by the film's end.The other part of the problem is that, as a retelling of the trials and tribulations of the lunar lading, the film is hardly an exhaustive account. Covering the time period from 1961, when Armstrong was an X-15 pilot, to the eventual Apollo 11 mission in 1969, the constant jumps in time leave little room for detailed recreations of both the physical and mental preparations that went into putting the first man onto the moon.Moreover, certain contextual details of the time period are touched upon but quickly go by the wayside, such as one scene depicting African American musicians singing the lyrics of Gil Scott-Heron's ""Whitey on the Moon"" which hints at a fascinating social-political subtext to the story that never arrives. Thus, those seeking a fact-based take are better off seeking one of the countless documentaries on the moon landing.Instead, First Man exists in a middling space (pun unintended) where it's easy to see the passion behind the film but hard to see its exact raison d'etre. It's respectfully made, but perhaps too much so, seemingly content on re-treading past achievements by fairly conventional means.Where First Man excels is in its more personal touches, in particular in its handling of grief and trauma, stemming from Armstrong's personal loss of one of his children, as both fuel and a drawback to his professional pursuit. It's a through line that is poignantly tied off in one of the film's closing scenes and it's this sort of nuance that feels like it offers something fresh to the story, despite its historical trappings.Ultimately, while it's easy to admire the craft behind the film and the respectful means by which it treats its main subject, First Man's resistance to probe too deep into Armstrong's psychology or to provide a fresh, modern perspective on well-documented history leaves it, too often, feeling lost in space.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don't believe the triggered americans over a flag controversy,"This was a well made movie, structured as a blockbuster but managing a 90's indie vibe, which was much appreciated. The story wasn't so captivating in the beginning but succeeded at being compelling after the rocky start. 
Gosling portrayed the character quite well, although it's not his best performance (nor should it be). The supporting cast was on point, but again, nothing Oscar worthy.

Disappointed,"After watching the trailer I felt that this film would be an uplifting biopic of human achievement told from the personal perspective of Neil Armstrong. After seeing the film I came away feeling disappointed and let down. The film starts up slow, with the feeling that one has started in the middle or somehow missed something important. I feel that Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Neil Armstrong was a bit weak and very stoic; I'm not sure he smile more than twice. The script (or lack of it) was very bad; there is very little dialog, and a lot of staring into space. The visual effects are very good; however, many of the views feel incomplete (for instance: you hardly ever get a good look at the Saturn V Rocket). The score wasn't bad, it wasn't over the top either. I believe if there would have been more dialog, and less feelings and emotions this film would have been much better. As it is, I personally think they could have cut around a half hour of the film and nobody would ever notice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A TV Movie on Huge Budget,"Ryan Gosling seems able to do just about anything on screen successfully. For director Damian Chazelle, he got La La Land - an otherwise unmemorable film musical - across the finish line admirably, even though he did not receive due credit for it. In First Man, he tries valiantly, but in the end the production values and the enormity of the story weigh him down, a burden he pushed aside in La La. First Man is only incidentally about the moon mission. Principally, it is about Neil Armstrong the man himself. The film practically ties itself in knots - unnecessarily, in my opinion - to show Armstrong as single-handedly committed to making the Gemini/Apollo program a success. The script carefully portrays Armstrong as somewhat one-mindedly committed to his flying career, cleverly linking it to Broadway musicals in his youth - a monomania for some theatre wonks. (He even revered Gilbert & Sullivan, the Holy Grail for true musical nerds). Gosling seems to be finding his balance between the pilot-Armstrong and the family-Armstrong several times , only to be interrupted by NASA wizardry, which would have been better served by being more tightly delineated. Claire Foy ably assists in a role which should have been more a principal focus. Foy's portrayal of Neil's wife, Janet, could have been seen as the home front spouse who nurtured Armstrong's familial side which she surely did. But the only dynamic indications of this we see come across as angry more than determined. However, First Man is Gosling's charge, and he does everything possible to bring it home. Chazelle could have helped a lot had he seen the project as more Whiplash - a virtually perfect film - than La La Land.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Technically beautiful flat story,This movie is extremely tedious. Many small elements that may have meant something to either the Armstrong family or NASA do not make for a compelling movie. His overall contributions to the advancement of the space program incredible but not truly worthy of a movie.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinema at its best,"Damien Chazelle is one of the greatest current directors, and this movie just reaffirms that. First Man was such an incredible emotional and visual experience, that I'm amazed at how they did it.
Chazelle is my favorite director, and when First Man didn't get to any theatres on my city I was so disappointed. This is a movie that NEEDS to be seen on a big screen. Neil Armstrong isn't a character I'm really interested in, but this movie changed the way I saw him completely. Many of the critiques this movie had was that it was kind of ""emotionless"", which I completely disagree in. Armstrong was such a reserved guy that this movie does a great job at studying his character and the way he sees and feel the world. The performances by Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy we're moving but also they have a lot of depth that is unraveled once you analyze the film after it's done.
The way this film is shot and edited gives it such a realistic feel that moments after the film ends you start to release this feeling of tension carried throughout the whole movie. Some criticized that it is too ""shaky"" but that's an aspect I loved. I saw many interviews with Chazelle where he talks about the whole filming process and the way he interpreted the story is transmitted with the filming style. He wanted to create a documentary like film that showcased the life of Armstrong as well as the risks of the space race, and working with the DP he achieved it. The space launch sequences gave me an anxiety lever that I've never felt in a space movie before.
I truly could continue to talk about how great this movie is, but you just need to experience it in order to understand. I cannot wait to see what this incredible director does next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lack of realism detracts from the reality of the actual events,"Overall I am disappointed by this movie, which tries to be docudrama. While visually spectacular, it often fails to depict the environment of space realistically.Some of those scenes are beautiful and great (lunar module Eagle gliding serenely in lunar orbit) - but other key scenes fail miserably, if you know what the reality is like. Many of the scenes set in the vacuum of space (not inside the ship) have explosive and whooshing sounds. The director is trying to make it more ""exciting"", but it's not exciting to me if I know it's not real. A few movies have gotten around the ""space is silent"" quandary in imaginative ways - ""Gravity"" used extremely effective music to go along with soundless explosions, ""2001"" used the sound of breathing as the astronaut drifted through the void.The lunar landscape is depicted as ridiculously craggy and extremely steep, especially at Apollo 11's landing site. At one point Armstrong walks up to a crater, which looks like a deep black well. Silly and phony-looking. The craters and slopes on the real Moon are almost always very gentle and lunar terrain has been softened and sandblasted by micrometeoroids for billions of years,The Earth is depicted as a crescent during the Apollo 11 EVA, when actually it was gibbous on July 20, 1969. You might say that's a very minor nitpick, but the movie presents itself as a docudrama - displaying technical sloppiness with no regard for realism.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
He captured a feeling. Sky with no ceiling.,"I am a child of the 60's, born in 1961. The ""Space Race"" for me was not some historical concept but a pervasive backdrop to my childhood. I still recall, at the age of 8, being marched into my junior school's assembly hall. We all peered at the grainy black-and-white pictures of Neil Armstrong as he spoke his famously fluffed line before stepping onto the lunar surface. The event happened at 3:54am UK time, so clearly my recollection of ""seeing it live"" is bogus. (I read that the BBC stayed on air until 10:30 in the morning, so it was probably a 'final review' of the night's events I saw). It is probably lodged in my memory less for the historical event and more due to the fact that there was TELEVISION ON IN THE MORNING! (Kids, ask your grandparents!)But back to Damien Chazelle's film. We start early in the 60's with America getting well and truly kicked up the proberbial by the Russians in the space race: they fail to get the first man in space; they fail to carry out the first spacewalk. So the Americans, following the famous JFK speech, set their sights on the moon. It's the equivalent of making a mess of cutting your toenails but then deciding to have a go at brain surgery. NASA develop the Gemini programme to practice the essential docking manoevers required as a precursor for the seemingly impossible ('two blackboard') mission that is Apollo. But the price paid for such ambition is high.Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong as a dedicated, prickly, professional; altogether not a terribly likeable individual. Claire Foy plays his long-suffering wife Janet, putting her support for her husband's dangerous profession ahead of her natural fears of becoming a single mother.There is obviously little tension to be mined from a film that has such a well-known historical context. Those with even a subliminal knowledge of the subject will be aware of the key triumphs and tragedies along the way. The script (by Josh Singer, ""The Post""; ""Spotlight"") is very well done in developing a creeping dread of knowing what is shortly to come.Even with these inherent spoilers, Chazelle still manages to evoke armrest-squeezing tension into the space flight sequences. A lot of this is achieved through disorientating camera movements and flashing images that may irritate some but I found to be highly effective. (Did anyone else flash back to that excellent ""Mission Space"" ride at Epcot during the launch sequences?) This hand-held cinematography by Linus Sandgren (Chazelle's ""La La Land"" collaborator) is matched by some utterly drop-dead gorgeous shots - beautifully framed; beautifully lit - that would be worthy of a Kaminski/Spielberg collaboration.Those expecting a rollercoaster thrill-ride of the likes of ""Apollo 13"" will be disappointed. The film has more of the slow-and-long-burn feeling of ""The Right Stuff"" in mood and, at 141 minutes, some might even find it quite boring. There is significant time, for example, spent within the family home. These scenes include turbulent events of which I wasn't previously aware: events that form the cornerstone of the film's drama. For me, the balance of the personal and the historical background was perfectly done. I found it curious though that with such a family-oriented drama Chazelle chose to ditch completely any cuts away to the earthbound onlookers during the tense lunar landing sequence. (Compare and contrast with Ron Howard's masterly inter-cutting in the re-entry scene of ""Apollo 13""). With the outcome foretold, perhaps such tension building was considered unnecessary? I'm not suggesting it was wrong to 'stay in the moment' with the astronauts, but it's a bold directorial move.Overall, the foolhardiness of NASA trying to do what they did with the 60's technology at their disposal is well-portrayed. If you've been lucky enough, as I have, to view the Apollo 11 capsule in the National Air and Space museum in Washington you can't help but be impressed by the bravery of Armstong, Aldrin and Collins in getting in that bucket of bolts and putting their lives on the line. True American heroes.On that topic, the ""flag issue"" has generated much self-righteous heat within the US media; that is regarding Chazelle not showing the American flag being planted. This seems fatuous to me. Not only is the flag shown on the moon, but the film ably demonstrates the American know-how and bravery behind the mission. If Clint Eastwood had been directing he would have probably gone there: but for me it certainly didn't need any further patriotism rubbed in the viewer's face.Are Oscar nominations on the cards for Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy? For me, it would be staggering if they are not: this film has ""Oscar nomination"" written all over it. I'd also certainly not bet against Foy winning for Best Actress: her portrayal of a wife on the edge is nothing short of brilliant. And perhaps, just perhaps, this might be Gosling's year too.Elsewhere there are strong supporting performances from Kyle Chandler (as Deke Slayton), Corey Stoll (as the 'tell it how it is' Buzz Aldrin) and Jason Clarke (as Ed White). It's also great to see Belfast-born Ciarán Hinds in another mainstream Hollywood release.For me, another dead cert Oscar nomination will be Justin Hurwitz for the score which is breathtakingly brilliant, not just in its compelling themes but also in its orchestration: the use of the eerie theremin and melodic harp are just brilliant together. I haven't heard a score this year that's more fitting to the visuals: although it's early in the Oscar season to be calling it, I'd be very surprised if this didn't walk away with the statuette.In Summary: loved this. Damien Chazelle - with ""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"" and now ""First Man"" - has hit all of three out of the park in my book. It's not really a film for thrill-seekers, who might get bored, but anyone, like me, with an interest in the history of space exploration will I think lap it up: for this was surely the most memorable decade in space history... so far.On leaving the cinema I looked up at the rising moon and marvelled once more at the audacity of man. My eyes then drifted across to the red dot that was Mars. How long I wonder? And how many dramatic film biographies still to come?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I was disappointed,"I'll be honest I was expecting more from this film. Claire Foy's character had no depth, so her excellent acting skills were not brought to the fore.
Ryan Gosling played this part like every other part he ever plays, enigmatic...almost sullen, and uncommunicative. That's not how Armstrong was. Also the film was focused seemingly on their poor marriage, and secondarily on the moon landing.
I remember the real moon landing on the TV as a boy and it marked me for life, I remain consumed with all things space but this film did not bring back the emotion I felt at the time, or make me interested in the trip.
In fact I had to watch it in 3 goes, because it was so boring.
I've given it a 6 in memory of Armstrong and the other men and women who made that trip possible, but simply as a stand alone film not attached to any memories or unfeeling, it's worth about 3.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Glacially-paced, muddled film","""First Man,"" the highly anticipated (partial) bio-pic about Neil Armstrong, the commander of NASA's Apollo 11 mission and the first man (thus the title) to walk on the moon, is a muddled mess.Director Damien Chazelle's film-making choices, from shaky, way-too-close cinema verite close-ups and long, long silences (OK, OK, we know Neil Armstrong was a Silent Sam type) to banging, shaking, roaring and rattling blackout shots where the viewer can't understand what's going on, to lack of exposition (about precisely that -- what's going on), to Armstrong's constantly angry wife, are not only disorienting, but unpleasantly distracting.This film can't hold a candle to superior films like ""The Right Stuff,"" ""Apollo 13,"" or the excellent made-for-cable HBO series ""From the Earth to the Moon.""Neil Armstrong deserved much better than this.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very dark,"Did the producers forget to pay the electric bill? Many scenes looked like they were shot at the bottom of a coal mine. The overall theme of the movie was not an uplifting story and didn't portray NASA in a positive way. This could have been a positive chronicle of the USA space program in the 50s and 60s but there was so much focus on the negatives and failures (and there were failures) and how the Russians were so much better and doing everything before the USA....except landing a man on the moon and returning to earth. The best thing about this film is I didn't pay to see it. I got a DVD from my local library for free. If you have 2 hours and 20 minutes to waste it's an OK film. Otherwise, use your time to do something more enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A rather lengthy biopic in a sombre mood falls short of a must watch.,"Within the first few minutes of the movie you will realise that you are in for a sombre style of film making, which really fails to entertain much.

Enthralling telling of a momentous event in human history,"The life of Neil Armstrong. Starts in 1961, with Armstrong as a test pilot and ends, shows the Gemini and Apollo projects and culminates in Armstrong's most famous event: being the first man on the moon.Directed by Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash), a great, riveting telling of the man behind and the events leading up to one of the momentous events in human history. Shows incredibly well the development of the NASA space program, the dangers involved, the sacrifices made, the narrow margin for error and the courage and determination involved.The space flight scenes are incredibly realistic, often putting you in Armstrong's shoes. Even though you know how it is going to end, you're still on the edge of your seat throughout these scenes. Very nerve-wracking, gritty and engaging.Unfortunately, Chazelle can't replicate this engagement in the Earth-bound scenes, especially the scenes showing Armstrong's home life. The domestic stuff is pretty dull. Some of this is deliberate. Chazelle wants to show Armstrong as cold and calculating and show how this is a positive and negative: what makes him a great astronaut makes him less perfect as a husband and father. It's also a counter-point to the sheer adrenaline rush that is his job.However, the domestic stuff never leads to any great profundity and ultimately is largely filler. Chazelle could have cut most, if not all, of it out of the movie and we would have had a perfect film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

But the story wasn't executed in a way where you really felt the tension. And we've already had more than enough films depicting floating around in space and firing thrusters to successfully dock.

"Well made, assuredly handled biopic","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the 1960s, NASA is preparing one of the most audacious exercises in the history of time, the first manned space mission to the moon, on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), one of the candidates up for selection, is still recovering from a traumatic personal tragedy, but displays an aptitude and ability that sets him far apart from the other test pilots putting themselves forward. As he prepares to take the lead in an endeavour that will push the boundaries of what was thought possible further than ever before, he must contend with the inner dynamics of NASA, the social upheaval of the time and his own conflicts in his personal life.I often wonder if the present generation would feel more inspired to aspire to greatness and really dedicate themselves to what was possible if some great, magnificent event were to occur that opened their eyes to what can be achieved with determination and dedication. Instead of pandering to be on the next vacuous reality TV show or going on some demonstration about largely perceived racism or climate crisis, something like the moon landing could motivate them, something that still stirs the pool of wonder today, with various people even claiming that they were faked.The actual moon landing itself is fascinating enough, but Armstrong the man behind it is also has dynamic potential for the story , a studious and slightly nerdy man who developed the personality to command the mission to the moon. Gosling's physical resemblance to the man helps no end, and his performance is thankfully assured and convincing. Reuniting with La La Land director Damien Chazelle (making his second feature film), their respective roles within the production combine to produce something markedly different from their last outing.In the end, it's just not exceptional enough to truly linger in the memory, but it's involving, well acted and examines a fascinating real life character/event that were two parts of one of the defining moments of our age. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Subject Matter - Poor Cinematic Execution,"I'm a bit of a space junkie.I've traveled to Kennedy Space Center, and remember watching the Shuttle launches on the edge of my seat growing up.I love seeing the human side of Neil Armstrong, and the interplay between his family life and his professional life. Astronauts do extraordinary things, but at the end of the day, they're human, just like anyone else.What I didn't love was the execution, namely, the camera work. I saw this in a large format theater, and the hand-held camera work for the vast majority of this film was jarring. As a viewer, I shouldn't be aware of the camera.

He makes no discernible response to the news. Instead of asking his superior about the matter he just stares at him and waits for him to talk. After a pause and a small smile he nods.

I agree, it shows a human side of him, but to make it central to his desires and ambitions is pretty simplistic. That is forgivable, but what is lacking is a taut story that really grabs us.

Better story than expected. But too slow and shaky,"I was pleasantly surprised that this isnt an Appolo 11 version of Appolo 13 as I expected.Instead it is a Neil Armstrong biopic encompassing his time from the early 60s till his moon mission in 69. The strength of the movie to my surprise was how interesting Armstrong's life was leading up to the mission. And what makes the movie work (to the extent in which it works) is seeing how lucky and unlucky Neil was to have survived all the roadblocks he faced to get to command the his successful historic mission. It was fascinating to see all the roadblocks he and his family faced. Neil and his family had a very effective real quality to them. The acting, sets and effects all seemed very accurate to me, although I'm hardly an astrophysicist and NASA historian.What didn't work was the pacing. Over much of the film it is glacially slow. The film is about 2 1/4 hours long and IMO it would have been better closer to 1 3/4 hours long. For the dvd instead of an extended cut they should have an abridged up tempo cut.The other issue is all of the camera shaking. Yes it really is that big of a problem. The director was clearly trying to illuminate the feeling of the astronauts from their perspective and how unstable much of this early NASA technology was. And I don't mind some shaking cameras from time to time for those goals. But this film far eclipsed the point where it was effective and instead it became a distraction. Many of the scenes where they weren't even in motion had the camera shaking. It doesn't have to look like a home video for me to treat characters seriously. The shaking was too much. You know the idea failed when it doesn't feel like I was experiencing things shake. Instead I was observing camera shots where the camera as/or background must have been shook.

"Very underwhelming and poorly produced, considering the historical significance, talent and anticipation.","141 minutes and the producers give us this garbage?Only the last 30-35 minutes of this film stopped my nausea and kept me awake. Allow me to elaborate...Either Clint Eastwood or Steven Spielberg SHOULD HAVE directed this film and NOT Damien Chazelle. His atrociously annoying shaky-cam and zoom in/outs were way overdone and unbearable. Has he never heard of a camera stabilizer? Did he film this holding his iPhone? I may have been able to handle it watching 30 mins of The Office, but 141 mins of amateur camera work was garbage and gave me nausea. Only the lift off, flight, landing and moon scenes where steady and enjoyable for the full 30-35 mins, and a few shots where I guess his hands got tired and he used a tripod or stabilizer. This was a HUGE flaw for a film of this caliber and length.Then there was the hack-job screenplay by Josh Singer (poorly adapted from the biographical book by James R. Hansen) who should have stuck to writing TV series. I mean seriously, 141 mins of irrelevant shots of a swing, long walks, pointless conversations, multiple long shots of the moon, and constant irrelevant directions towards his daughters' grieving? I get this film isn't supposed to be ""Hollywood"", and instead seen from the perspective of Neil Armstrong, but way too much drama was focused on his struggles over his daughter and wife, and less about his mission and progress towards it. This films pace was WAY too slow it was annoying. Too many dragged out scenes - was this film even cut for final? The pace may have been acceptable had the film been cut down to 90-110 mins tops.Finally the overly rambunctious and overbearing score was so loud, I missed most of the dialogue during important scenes, especially when Gosling whisper-spoke like he was in a library. Score volume 10-MAX, Gosling volume 3. I get all the producers missed this, but not even Spielberg didn't catch that and all the other flaws??As for the acting, I'm not sure if (especially) Neil and his wife's personalities were that drab, because if they weren't, then Ryan Gosling sure looked bored acting out his character. The rest of the cast were decent, but nothing spectacular. Corey Stoll as Buzz's character seemed to be the only fully awake actor.The 1960's sets and wardrobe were impressive, but the winner in this production was the S/VFX - simply outstanding shots of space and the lunar planet.This film was disappointing and missed the mark for me, by being very underwhelming and poorly produced, considering the historical significance, talented cast, and anticipation of learning more about Neil Armstrong and his mission.Would I see it again? Certainly not - my time is much more valuable to waste 141 mins again on this mess. I'd rather spend many more hours and read the book by James R. Hansen. Would I recommend it? Nope.

Come Fly with Me,"""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."".Neil Armstrong did the impossible in 1969. As the U.S. and the Russians ran a cut-throat competition to see who could reach new imperial heights in outer space, it was Armstrong, Aldrin and all the good folks at NASA that took it upon themselves to wage an all-out, all costs battle to touch our lunar friend in the sky, plant our flag and mark it ours. They all did just that on July 20th, 1969 as millions of Americans sat in front of their TV sets and watched the first ever glimpses of the surface of our moon. Ever since, space travel has expanded and advanced to heights beyond our wildest dreams and to think there's an eternity left to be discovered. But the story of the moon landing has just as much to do with the man that Armstrong was as it does with the nation that let him pursue his remarkable journey. First Man is perhaps the most fitting cinematic memorial of one of the most incredible men that ever lived.Walking out of the screening, I kept thinking how impossible it was to imagine anyone having brought this film to life other than Damien Chazelle. If Whiplash was an excruciating assault of the senses detailing the teeth-nashing art of drumming, First Man is a sensory body blow that needs to be experienced on the largest screen possible and the loudest sound system you can find. Chazelle found a way to place us right there in the spacecraft. The shaking, the pounding, the soaring and the crashing into earth. I hear simulators on Earth can gives us near perfect space travel experiences, but the entire masterful opening sequence will suffice for me. I was clawing the back of my seat. It's a moment in film you'll never forget. Even more so is the final sequence on the moon. Armstrong exits the ship, and the soundtrack cuts out immediately. You take it all in. The miles of sediment leading to a black abyss. You look up, and there's Earth staring back at you. The only thing we see of Armstrong is the reflection on his helmet of what's in front of him. Apollo 13, eat your heart out for breakfast, lunch and dinner.In between the breathless, action-packed space travel sequences is an unexpected emotional journey into Armstrong's family life. The loss of his youngest daughter, and his wife, Janet, who begs him never to travel to the moon, out of certainty that he'd be gone soon after. Claire Foy is a powerhouse and steals the show as she corners the boys at NASA for a stern talking to. Never get in the way of the strong woman behind every great man. These scenes don't carry the effectual gravitas of the scenes in outer space, rather, they come across as home movies, complete with a shaky 16mm camera. Authenticity is what is being strived for here, and it sure accomplishes that. What is also not lost in First Man is Chazelle's ear for good music and how to utilize it powerfully. First Man is no musical, that's for certain, but throughout the film, little cues from scratchy records of the 1950's captures the tenderness of Neil and Janet, and the underlying love story that thematically bookends our experience.This is a story not just about accomplishment, but self pride and selfless love of those that are nearest to you. It's what keeps us all going, and it's comforting to know that it's what got Mr. Armstrong to the moon. This has been a long winded explanation in telling you all that First Man shouldn't be missed this season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A biopic about a not very interesting person,"Don't get me wrong. I have the utmost respect for Neil Armstrong and from everything I have read or heard about him from people who knew him personally he was the perfect man to become the first human to set foot on another celestial body. Despite his well-deserved place in history, his life and personality don't make good cinema. Armstrong kept most of his emotions and thoughts to himself for a reason -- that's the way he wanted it. To speculate about what emotions the man might have had and displayed privately borders on disrespectful. It as if the film wants us to believe that Neil Armstrong was more emotional than he was, so it fabricated moments in which he was emotive. It was the man's ability to control his emotions that made him great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An inspiring biopic that will make you appreciate the man it is based on,"The norm of an average biopic is that the person it is based on is deified and the narrative distorted to suit the worshipping of the protagonist and an almost predictable story of rags to riches. There have been many movies about the various NASA missions told from various perspectives but 'First Man' is not like any of them and that is what makes it unique.
'First Man' is an extraordinary inspiring biopic of the first man to set foot on the moon, what I loved about this movie is that the narrative is extremely personal. Neil Armstrong is not portrayed as a 'hero' but as a man who is driven by personal motivations. Ryan Gosling delivers a delicate, nuanced performance as Neil Armstrong, it's his movie through and through.
The direction, screenplay, costumes, set design, background score and cinematography is top-notch. The cinematography, in particular, is just out of this world. The space sequences give a sense of awe and wonder. Honestly, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire Apollo 11 sequence. It gave me goosebumps as it is shot with such precision and accuracy.
This movie was one of my favourites of 2018 as the scale and talent on display here is stellar. Go watch this movie, if you love cinema and appreciate good film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

First Man makes Damian Chazelle look be a veteran.,"Damien Chazelle was catapulted to the top of America's hottest young directors so quickly, it's difficult to comprehend his thrillingly original music drama cum psychological horror story debut, Whiplash, was only four years (and six Oscars) ago. But as much as I loved that pneumatic opening act to his career, I detested the second; the inexplicable awards and acclaim devourer, La La Land. I didn't think it was overrated or not worthy of the all the shiny baubles that went its way, I actually hated everything about it. Almost uniquely both a bad movie AND a bad sloppy, cheesy, clichéd musical, with sit-com worthy acting, that saw him become the youngest recipient of a best director Oscar in history (and Emma Stone, perhaps the worst performance to win Best Actress this side of Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love).
So I arrived in the orbit of his Neil Armstrong-moon landing biopic at a loss as what to expect, something compounded by the name Steven Spielberg in the executive credits - the last person I'd want near an all-American hero movie, as prone to black and white moralizing and sentimental heart string pulling as he is. Yet once again and in another very different environment to either of his previous movies, Chazelle's dynamic confidence gives an accurate indication of what's to come from the opening minutes.
Here Hollywood's go to young leading man Ryan Gosling (arguably usurped now by Bradley Cooper) playing first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, enters the 1960's cocooned inside a rocket with wings, bouncing off of the edge of the earth's atmosphere, almost achieving space flight before intending to. It's a thrilling gut punch, full of the eerie silences, scraping metallic noises, whirring dials, serene beauty and absolute terror that inform much of the film's sky high action. Quickly we are back to the suburban white-bread American home with his wife (played with wide-eyed edge by a stunning Claire Foy) and their young children, the youngest of whom is at the end of her short life.
First Man makes great use of these opposing environs, juxtaposing the near impossible danger of Armstrong's day job, with resolutely normal home life - just with a little more relief greeting each, ""Hi honey, I'm Home'. After Gosling's Armstrong manages to score a spot on the nascent Gemini astronaut program (designed to prepare for the actual Apollo moon landings themselves), the wider cast of like-minded picket-fence adventurers assemble in a Houston via NASA recreation of suburbia. In particular he befriends fellow pilots, Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and Ed White (the always excellent and increasingly prevalent Australian actor, Jason Clark).
What follows (taken from James R. Hansen's official Armstrong biography, First Man: The Life of Neil Armstrong) is a decade of growing family life, terrifying technological milestones, ambition, personal rivalry, tragedy and the social upheaval of the sixties, where Russia is always one crucial step ahead and where the enormous physical and monetary cost of the race to the moon, is equally unpopular with the public and politicians alike.
If there are many praises I could sing about First Man, I'd start with it's even handed, subtle dryness - my fears of a saccharine, noble, swelling, heroic guiding hand from Spielberg were completely unfounded, to the extent I wonder how much of his influence was flat out rejected. There's a matter of factness to proceedings and a focus on detail and events that's entirely welcome, these men are extraordinary in their work but resolutely ordinary men. Chazelle doesn't amplify faults or heroism to histrionic levels, neither does he engage in the kind of reductive moral absolutism and offensive simplification (bordering on propaganda) that blighted a film like American Sniper.
His cast are similarly allowed to breathe and exist without the awards-worthy grandstanding so common in ""great"" true life stories, Gosling's low key internal performance (something a grand-stander like Cooper could learn from) won't win him awards but is pitch-perfect for a modest, quiet man like Armstrong. His role is amplified by the late arrival of Corey Stoll as the far more vivacious, outgoing and polarizing Buzz Aldrin - who would accompany him to the grey shore. The standout is undoubtedly British actress Claire Foy, as Armstrong's wife Janet - she is magnetic without doing anything, her startled eyes conveying incredible building pressure, she owns every scene she is in and is almost the antithesis of the kind of American housewife we are used to in this terrain (ironically it's Chazelle's own real life wife Olivia Hamilton, who gives us that standard Tom Hanks wife role).
Chazelle's direction is mature, appropriate, sure-footed and intelligent throughout - rarely making himself centre-stage. Gone is the all-singing floral overkill of La La Land or the dynamic intensity of Whiplash, showing we are just coming to terms with his already formidable range (I could not tell you what I expect him to offer next). He handles the scary intensity of action, the mundanity of home life and the transitions between both with equal consistency. This already excellent and fascinating drama (seriously, how any sane human had the courage to get one of these explosive, metallic death traps is beyond me) is elevated further by some stellar production values.
The sound is across the board magnificent - regular stalwart Justin Hurwitz's score is one of the best in years, a sometimes exciting, sometimes haunting amalgam of period appropriate vintage electronica that heightens or enhances anything it touches. The broader spectrum of sound effects is equally compelling, particularly the clanking, creaking terror of the giant, possibly malevolent, shiny space beasts. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren (his work on La La Land the only high point for me) is notably realistic - often the tranquil beauty of space collapsing into a vortex of impending, furious calamity.
The moon landing itself is of course the denouement, thankfully mirroring the rest of the film's dryness and with an eye for recreating the collective TV experience we all have of that one small step moment in history. I'd love to know who was responsible for the brief moment with Armstrong's daughter's bracelet - it's the only time I felt the ghost of Spielberg in the entire movie.
First Man is a near magnificent biopic but more than that, it effortlessly sidesteps all the pitfalls of the overly heroic, simplistic, swelling, borderline jingoistic film I'd feared and for that Chazelle deserves all the praise. Much was ludicrously made of the failure to include Armstrong planting the US flag on the moon - in these polarized times, one single solitary moment can have an entire section of society write something off as the enemy. This is doubly stupid in a film that never stops being about a heroic and entirely American adventure, filled with nonsense low-key American heroes. Especially as the flag does indeed wave, both on the ground and on the moon. I wonder how Armstrong would feel that so many American's now feel he was nothing but a crisis actor, in some converted warehouse and that his most impossible achievement never even happened.
The two true apexes of this story are not the flag planting anyway but that first step on truly foreign soil, by any living creature we know, and that creature's return to his wife's gaze - both handled beautifully and without embellishment. Spielberg may have been there to guide the young punk through the difficult terrain of a story as important to the American psyche as the moon landing, but after watching something like Spielberg's clunky same-period The Post, First Man makes Chazelle look be the veteran.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Armstrong biopic prioritizes conflict over outer space,"The renewed interest in the final frontier in film has resulted in some really good (and pretty bad) projects. Damien Chazelle's critically acclaimed box office bust 'First Man' falls somewhere in the middle of the pack, as some had a much different vision of what this film would be about.At its core, 'First Man' is the story of the conflict experienced by the most famous man to ever visit space. Ryan Gosling stands in as Neil Armstrong alongside Claire Foy as his wife, Janet. The two are very good actors in their own right, but they do not have the necessary spark or chemistry to make the strained relationship feel authentic. That said, this is very much an actor's movie, and neither one should be disappointed with their performances. The supporting cast is alright - nothing spectacular, but they do the job. The special effects are not the main attraction here, that's for sure. Yes, part of the film takes place in space (and more specifically, on the moon), but these scenes feel like they are inserted just because they need to be based on the story.The one aspect that really stands out in 'First Man' is the soundtrack. Just Hurwitz ('La La Land,' 'Whiplash') really goes all in and delivers a memorable story through sound. It earned a Golden Globe, and easily could have ended up with an Oscar, too.Despite its poor commercial success, 'First Man' did not deserve all the negative attention it received. It's not an amazing film by any stretch, but it's an important story of one of the most beloved American heroes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Entertaining,"I had higher expectations of this film. The flight scenes were realistic and gave me a rush. But it was slow in between. Ryan Gosling was great as always, but it kind of lagged.

Man Of Man... Firstly,"I am a military dad and space buff- and I don't usually write reviews- but just finishing this movie, I had to reach for the tablet.

And it's well done- It's just tough events in a tone of depressed, stressed chronicles leaving you with No joy or elation or even pride of American, patriotic accomplishment. 180 from flick The Right Stuff- Toward end , I wanted to get the guy some Prozac or Zoloft...

"Ignore the Politics, Watch the Movie. Period.","👍👍""First Man"" is excellent on all accounts. A masterful film both dramatically and as a cinematic experience. It is easily a must see. And as for that flag controversy, could we all grow up? Yes, there is NO dedicated shot of the American flag being planted. There is merely a wide shot that shows both the lunar lander and the flag from a distance. The film doesn't rewrite history or try to be anti-American. The movie still goes out of its way to point out the event as an American achievement. Heck, it even had a French woman say something like ""I knew America could do it, I had faith"". If you choose to boycott this movie because of that one shot that wasn't in the movie...then that is honestly sad. And you if see it and then hate it for that reason, you completely missed the point of the film: Armstrong dealing with a personal family tragedy. In place of the flag planting, the film choose to focus on something more personal that many are lead to believe really happened. Honestly, I hope it did because it was beautiful.

First Man (to leave the theater),"In my opinion First Man fails on multiple levels. From a historical perspective, there is nearly no conveyance to the audience about the political motivation that was behind the entire program to get an American on the Moon before the Soviets. The Soviets' lead in the ""space race"" prior to the Apollo program had been considered an existential threat in the struggle for the hearts and minds of humanity and the American government considered it essential to win the race to the Moon. While the American flag is seen at a distance next to the lunar module, the actual planting of the flag on the moon was, in a certain sense, the entire raison d'être for the Apollo program and yet this moment was completely ignored by director Chazelle, making such a blatant omission seem an intentional anti-American political statement.
From a cinematic perspective, Chazelle seems obsessive in his constant use of closeups for even mundane moments and downright abusive in his use of ""shaky shots"" during moments of physical trauma. I always feel ""cheated"" when a director wimps out by an excessive use of shaky-shots as a cheap way to avoid the expense and creative effort otherwise required to depict what is actually happening to cause trauma.
From an acting and character development perspective, none of the characters gain our sympathy or empathy in this film. Its as if they are all reading their lines from a script rather than investing themselves with the spirit of the people they are supposed to be portraying. Armstrong, in particular, is portrayed by Gosling as extremely unemotional and cool, even when saying goodbye, 
perhaps forever, to his wife and children. And while Armstrong may or may not have been that way, it seems overdone in this film. Strangest of all was Claire Foy's depiction of Janet Armstrong who is portrayed as constantly annoyed with her husband and resentful of the sacrifices he had to make as the first human selected to set foot on the moon. I find it hard to believe that Armstrong's wife could have been this way in reality and if she was not then Chazelle and Foy have done her a great disservice.
Finally, from a story-arc perspective, the movie's pace is plodding with Chazelle spending way too much time on the familial interactions of the Armstrong clan. While this may stem from the fact the movie was based on a biography of Armstrong rather than upon a depiction of the Apollo mission itself, the fact that this was, as far as I know, the first major cinematic portrayal of mankind's first voyage to the moon really deserved a much more expansive treatment than it receives in this film.
I am confident that this film will not be, nor should it be, the definitive telling of America's triumphant landing of man on the moon, a story that is epic and will require a director with an epic vision to tell the tale. It is with regret that I say that this movie and this director were not up to that task.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Excellent & Beautiful,"Chazelle beautifully takes viewers on an emotional and disorienting journey through the most formidable years of Armstrong's life and the risks these pioneers of space exploration took. If you're looking for an Apollo 13 or Right Stuff experience solely focused on the endevours of NASA and the American triumph in the Cold War space race, you may be disappointed by First Man. This is not a movie about Apollo 11. While Apollo 11 and the journey to the moon are the primary focus of Neil Armstrong's experience in First Man, this movie is instead exactly what Chazelle promises in the choice for the film's title; A biopic on the First Man.In First Man, we get a glimpse inside the soul and character of Neil Armstrong. Gosling truly nailed it. His portrayal of Armstrong's calm coolness in the face of extreme danger, his quiet and inwardly shy demeanor, and his contemplative stares. Gosling really shines when we see Armstrong's stunted, yet deeply personal emotions, even to the point of appearing cold to the ones closest to him.The real heart of the movie appears during Armstrong's flight missions on Gemini 8 and Apollo 11. Chazelle does a great job showing the audience how rickety the earliest flying machines were and how limited the astronaut's visual field was. The sounds and shrieks had me on the edge of my seat. The limited space in the space shuttles is claustrophobic and the appearance of the moon as the Apollo 11 space shuttle approaches its surface is as eerie as the actual nasa footage.This movie was definitely a must see. I've never seen a movie that more accurately depicts the beauty and creepiness the astronauts of the early space shuttle have described.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dry,"In 1961, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is a test pilot for the X-15 with nerves of steel. He manages to save the landing after some difficulties. Others dismiss him as simply an egghead engineer. He is severely private but he does break down over his daughter's death. Janet (Claire Foy) is his dutiful wife. He joins the Gemini program run by former astronaut Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) which would lead him to be the first man on the moon.This is Damien Chazelle's first film without music as the subject. He is able to bring action to the space exploration. There are a couple of nice visceral close shaves. The Gemini uncontrolled spin is really thrilling. The marriage is interesting with two compelling actors. The over-riding feeling is a dry unemotional narrative. Most of that is due to the quiet reserve of Armstrong. He is not a man of emoting and the movie has to work within the constrains of his personality. The production is impeccable.

Most realistic but shaky handheld camera and Gosling hurt it,"The historic integrity and realism of experiencing the Gemini and Apollo missions from the astronauts' perspectives and a bit of their families really made this enjoyable.Unfortunately, the casting choice of Ryan Gosling is a poor choice and really hurt the movie and the role of Neil Armstrong.Gosling has an extremely narrow range and can be not only quite unconvincing but even oblivious and vapid, which are not traits of Neil Armstrong as evidenced in a great deal of available footage.Also disappointing was the rather obtuse usage of shaky handheld shooting which is frequently out of focus, dizzying and leaves us, the audience, believing that the cinema's projector is not working correctly. In fact, how would the projector personnel even be able to focus when it appears that the footage is so poorly shot.To the director and producers: we the paying audience pay our high ticket prices and expect to see a multi-million dollar production shot with the highest quality cameras, lighting, equipment and editing. We do really ever want to see a box office movie that appears it was shot by our 7 year old with the first iPhone.In addition, there already exists ample original, old footage which suffers from age and dated technology. We all lose out on the perfect opportunity to see historic moments and life the way it would have and could have been recorded had they possessed today's technology.

Far Too Dour To Be Anything Close To Inspirational,"There is no doubt that the moon landing was a seminal moment in United States history. However, that landing took place in 1969. Since that time, it has been covered in more books and forms of media than can probably even be counted. So, in order for ""First Man"" to tell an original or engaging story, it would seem to have to find an angle, whether that be cultural or character-based. Sadly, neither of those things happen here.For a basic plot summary, ""First Man"" is a biopic of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), especially focusing on the events leading up to and transpiring during his infamous moon landing mission in '69. Key factors in his backstory include the death of daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford), relationship with wife Janet (Claire Foy), and just his overall attitude and demeanor as an individual.The problem with ""First Man"" is very easy to diagnose: it has absolutely no soul, instead choosing a very mechanical beat-by-beat description of the Gemini and Apollo missions that led up to the moon landing. Two main missteps really hamper the proceedings here:1. Only lip service is paid to the social conventions or frustrations of the day, and that is a shame. Had this movie focused on, say, the controversy over the space program itself or its place in a culture going through the civil rights movement, then maybe it would have had something emotional to examine. As it is, this is about as mechanical of a film (just plodding forward) as you'll ever see.2. Even a bigger faux pas is portraying Armstrong and his wife as so dour and lacking in any real emotion. I'm not sure if this was just bad writing or an interpretation of the real-life figures themselves, but either way it is inexcusable. Emotional moments are telegraphed left and right only to fizzle out with Gosling's Armstrong looking dour and serious and Foy's Janet coming across as cold in comparison. It's been awhile since I've seen a film with so little emotion, especially odd considering they are trying to describe a cultural touchstone moment that everyone who saw remembers vividly!I had been anticipating ""First Man"" for quite some time. Director Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" is a favorite of mine, as is Gosling, and the trailers/concept seemed incredible. I left the theater feeling incredibly disappointed, however, at such a wasted opportunity. One can't really call this film ""bad"" in the sense that it was technically deficient, but it just lacked any reason to care about any part of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Great Filmmaking but not Oscar-worthy,"I've always thought there needed to be a sequel to ""The Right Stuff"". That movie followed the Mercury program, the first step to getting to the moon. It was an exciting and fun ""you are there"" inside look into events that occurred and the people involved. Finally we have a movie that picks up with the Gemini and Apollo programs and gives us a first hand glimpse of what it was like going to the moon.However, while ""The Right Stuff"" was an ensemble narrative, focusing on the bigger picture, ""First Man"" is a very personal look at Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. While the other film spent time showing a lot of details of the space program, that time instead is spent showing Armstrong with his family. The movie's real narrative is about how Armstrong hid his personal demons from other people. If this was a fictional character, there would probably be a scene where all those upsets that he kept inside come out in some dramatic way. But this film, the only apparent consequence is that his wife demands he opens up.Gosling seems to be a natural for introverted characters and works well. But there was one thing from the outset that prevented me from really enjoying this movie. Shaky Cam. I remember the time when ""Bourne Supremacy"" came out. It was a time where filming trends had turned to shaky cam to give the impression that it was more like a documentary and feel more authentic. The down-side is there are people out there like me that are sensitive to motion sickness, and the exaggerated shaking seen on the large screen easily induces nausea. Within the first couple minutes where I realised nearly the entire film was going to be shaky, I had to move farther back from the screen. Even then, with the majority of the framing being extreme close-ups, I had to look away a few times to keep my stomach under control. I was extremely disappointed they chose to film using this overrated and outdated style of cinematography. Latest trends have the majority of a film like this being shot Handheld, but without deliberately bouncing the camera all over the place. Handheld camera operators are capable of shooting very smooth shots, and capture the action without calling attention to itself. There was an interesting technical flaw that I was able to catch while watching this film on the large screen (not real Imax, but the Minimax featured at the AMC theater near me). I could see dirt and hairs in some shots. Real film not digital! It was a nice reminder of how dirt on films was accepted like it was in the 70s. On the other hand, I wonder if the camera assistant was checking the gate properly.One other nitpick is the lack of factual accuracy when it comes to what happened in the NASA space program. There are times that Neil seems to be the subject of attention (as if he's the one in charge) to the expense of the other fellow astronauts. At times it felt a little frustrating that the film would not show major events outside of Armstrong's perspective. As for all those scenes with the family, Claire Foy does a fine job as his wife. There are moments of family time that seem derivative of ""The Tree of Life"". I usually groan when films go over 2 hours, however the subject matter for First Man is so deep, it could easily run 3 hours to cover the many major aspects of the space program.One thing that stands out is the use of sound design. There are moments during the launch or flight that a loud cacophony of sounds scream out of the speakers. Some of these sounds are intentionally meant to be scary haunted house type of sounds. Including the sounds of screams, moans, and eery wind howls blended into the mix. Again, in the name of factual accuracy, were there really such spooky sounds happening? On the other hand, those sound effects do a great job of adding tension during the test flight scenes, which are very exhilarating.In the end the whole is equal to the sum of it's parts. Not greater or lesser. It definitely wants to get Oscar attention, but I doubt it will be a front runner. It achieves what it sets out to do, and tries to explain Neil Armstrong's psyche as he went through the space program. In real life, Armstrong never revealed his thoughts and reaction to being the first human to take the first step toward reaching the stars. This film probably feels required to give us some private insight of what Armstrong was thinking while on the moon, but it is probably not accurate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Disappointing,"Coming off of one of the most colorful and exuberant films of the last decade with La La Land, Damien Chazelle made a grim, colorless, and just plain dull film with First Man. It's not that the trailers ever wowed me or got me super excited, but I was certainly looking forward to seeing his follow up to one of my favorite films of all time. And heck, he even brought La La Land alum Ryan Gosling along with him. The problem with First Man has nothing to do with the whole American Flag controversy that people are complaining about, nor the tone really. It's more so the fact that this script is without life or energy. It trudges along from an amazing visual sequence to the next and the pacing is just tough to get through. It's also unfortunate that the characters are not likable at all and I found it difficult to connect to Gosling's performance as Neil Armstrong. I admittedly learned a lot and the story is undeniably fascinating, but I definitely could have used a more broad scope to the movie, instead of just Armstrong and the U.S. I get that's not the story they were telling, but I felt there was something missing.6.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best astronaut movie I've ever seen!,"This was a great story, and a well done history lesson. I learned a lot that I didn't know about what led up to the moon landing, and all the actors involved did a great job. It had a lot of intense moments, and emotion as well. It all felt very real, and deserved all the award nominations it received!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
If you Thought 2001 Was slow and Solemn,"And Keir Dullea was wooden, get ready for almost two and a half hours of close-ups of Ryan Gosling's eyeballs. I remember watching 2001 when it was released, and the Moon landing when it happened, but movies like Hidden Figures and The Right Stuff give much richer portraits of the time and the people involved. And who can forget Sam Shepard as Chuck Yeager striding away from the crash scene--a much more powerful image than the one depicted here. Yeager, by the way, gets almost no notice here. As with other recent historical movies like The Post, this film would benefit from subtitles identifying some of the true giants who flit almost un-noted through the story.Granted, I loved Claire Foy as QE II, but for my money this is her movie, and she's the emotional center. Maybe she should have married that boring dentist after all.Star Wars gave us space operas full of beat-up junky old crates, and First Man has something of the same feel, with cramped claustrophobic capsules and drab GI offices. Not unlike the new Blade Runner, but Gosling isn't Harrison Ford, and he isn't Sam Shepard either.On a final note, this movie opened nationally just as Gus Grissom's widow finally passed away some fifty years after his heroic death. Folks who get their knickers in a twist about insufficient displays of Americanism in this movie might reflect on how our Great Nation treated the widows and orphans the Space Race cost us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Get out of their faces!,"Close-up, after close-up, after close-up. The director of photography should be dragged outside and tarred and feathered. As if the capsule scenes weren't claustrophobic enough, did every scene with the actors have to be so tightly cropped? Gosling is not a serious actor - his portrayal of a true American hero was exhausting. Also, why do directors these days cast actors in roles of real historical people that do not even closely resemble them (Buzz Aldrin excluded)? It makes it hard to follow who is who, especially since a lot of the characters are not well developed at all. Skip it at the cineplex and watch it on video.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Unquestionably a biopic...,"First Man is one of the reasons I am continually wary of biopics, and is virtually a metaphor for the all so detestable ""seven out of ten"" film. Being such a film, it lies in between the realms of acceptable and very good, thereby delivering a final product that demonstrates great potential, but fails to utilise it. This may be in part due to the drab and monotone performances of leads Gosling and Foy, presenting the viewer with a more diluted version of the all so refined Gosling we saw in Drive. First Man is undoubtedly a nuanced and competently crafted piece of filmmaking; but one that I fear will claim an undeserved academy award.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Understated excellence,"A very good movie, a slow-burning, moody biopic that fuses science, history, and personal struggles to very good effect. I have read a few reviews here and they range from laughably unaware and one dimensional to pontificatingly over-analytical and nitpicking. This movie goes for the understated approach, and while that might put off the action junkies who demand fast-paced scenes and machine gun speed dialogue, in the end it perfectly suits Armstrong's character - a cool, calm, reserved, logical-thinking engineer. Brains put man on the moon, and those brains operated in silent spaces far away from the melodrama of mainstream society.
I am far from being a fan of Gosling, but his laconic, emotionless performance works here, by accident or design. It is probably somewhere close to the truth of how these kind of people operated. Constantly immersed in their scientific and technological challenges, obsessive, focused, meticulous, no room for error. Everything was built on fatal mistakes and personal determination, learning, suffering, failing and starting again.
The visuals are fantastic and the space missions are magnificently done. I don't know why people are slamming the emotional arc concerning Armstrong's daughter. It is a biopic, and as such, his personal tragedy had every right to be given some treatment, and something as monumental as the loss of his daughter had to be measured on screen, personally for me that arc works without being overly sentimental, and while there is an emotional stiltedness at the core of this film, it is about NASA, science, engineering, space flight, so what exactly would you expect? Overall a pretty great film, visually polished and structurally sound, maybe a little too long? but the moon landing scenes are epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not a smash boom bang film, but well told story","So many people have lambasted this film because they expected lots of rockets, planes, explosions etc. That is not what this film is totally about. A few great moments are highlighted during the film but basically it tells more of what it took socially, psychologically and intellectually to get through the training and eventually succeed in the mission. Yes, so much emphasis on the family life can be a bit long and slow, but understanding more of what it was like to do it makes it worth seeing. It would help if one has the knowledge of what it took to be a test pilot in an X-15 getting dropped from the wing of a B-52. That, and some basic knowledge of the timeframe of NASA and the strive for the moon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Slow paced wonderful biography about Neil Armstrong,"Damien Chezzele is a phenomenal director at least for Whiplash and La La Land, maybe not so much except bits of incredible cinematography! Ryan Gosling is pretty good except a little bleak and I still this deserves a fair rating. Mostly interesting to look at and the acting is spot on, but at the same time there are plot holes like others made more in depth note of regardless it's a marvelous film purely cause I don't think Neil Armstrong's story has been done at least not much. Love it or don't I do understand either way!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What a disappointment,"What a disappointment.I never thought I would use those three words to describe a film made by the man who gave us Whiplash and La La Land. But when you have a film that is mostly empty of emotion, doesn't give the actual moon landing sequences the grand feeling it deserves and then have such a weak ending from a director who has given some of the best film endings I've seen in the past few years, as I left the theater, I couldn't help but think what a missed opportunity this was.If anything, my favorite thing about this movie was Claire Foy as Jane Armstrong. She gives this film the tension and emotional depth that still gave me any interest in the story. But the music by Justin Hurwitz doesn't work, Ryan Gosling's performance is weak and the entire experience felt incredibly underwhelming. This is such a letdown from a director who had built an already impressive resume for himself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
No real need to see twice,"I loved ""The Right Stuff"". Must have seen it more than a dozen times. Loved ""Apollo 13"". Loved"" Top Gun"". This movie, while for the most part being historically accurate, doesn't warrant the same type of reaction. It's an emotional effort that last bare the feelings of one of the most private individual this side of Howard Hughes. The history, the X15, the training, the flight, all are second tier to the dark brooding character that gets portrayed. Only the Armstrong children can attest to how accurate the portrayal is, but the final scene is so dark and unnecessary that it soured the previous two hours for me.

Not a leap in film making,"I had high hopes for First Man. Sadly this was passable and forgettable.With films about great historic figures or events you need to show interesting or unique events and create 'moments'. By moments I mean elevated scenes, great build ups with a good soundtrack so you create an experience. What we got instead was rather boring and lackluster. It did not feel like a blockbuster film but a miniseries broken into 4 or so parts.The acting and lead could have been better. Gosling is a box office draw but he did not have the chops to pull off this role. He is an average actor with no noteworthy roles under his belt, this film can be added to the list. Somebody in the category of Tom Hanks or Christian Bale could have been suitable. Despite some good performances from Claire Foy and the other cast this film does not hit the mark. Neil Armstrong was a hero and the moon landing was iconic for humanity. A film should have lived up to a high standard and paid good homage.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A slow & negative perspective to a humankind's most inspirational milestone,"The movie's storyline surprisingly takes a very sombre approach leaving you with negative feeling instead of being getting motivated after watching it.
The director and writers have done a poor job in getting in-depth with any aspect or emotion in the movie. They ended up showing all aspect of an astronaut's life but not in detail that makes you feel part of it.
All aspect like loss of child, loss of colleagues life, effects of loss of astronaut's life on family (wife & kids), lack of pragmatic approach to people opposing the initiative and completely missing euphoria on landing on moon. They have touched each aspect but from 10,000 feet top.
The movie also shows Neil suffering from some sort of depression after lost of his daughter and am surprised how he run away from his family later. I am surprised that NASA didn't noticed it during their evaluation.
Also, the movie ends up demeaning the role and involvement of other crew members and NASA team involved in getting a man on moon.
The picturisation on landing on moon was more positive in TV Series Mad Men than in this whole movie.
Overall, a great opportunity lost in inspiring viewers towards space exploration.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"conventional in some ways, but its deep well of feeling and experimentation resonates","Who knew what the astronaut dramatization needed was the aesthetic from Saving Private Ryan? (Or Man of Steel came to mind too, and here it is far more effective viscerally and emotionally, and apt as it is, you know, real people who have lived and suffered and triumphed)Every time Damien Chazelle and company have one of the space sequences, from the opening to the Gemini 8 sequence, to the horror of the Apollo 1 test, it occurred to me that this is less the Right Stuff and more a hardcore war movie: these men are as much soldiers as they are scientists, and so the feel of the thing makes sense. If you're facing death and have an acceptance of it (not to mention in Neil/Jane's case, after the worst has already happened), that should ask of the storyteller something more than locked-down cameras. This is to outer space what Black Swan is to dance - there's largely horror to what happens and, if we're lucky, some awe, though not so much.This resonates and the filmmakers use a mix of 16mm and 35mm photography to achieve the kind of intimacy that could grow old fast, and we've seen this style before, but, what can I say except I responded to Chazelle and Lundgren's closeups, the way they would keep some shots steadier than others to keep the pace off our guard, Gosling channels convincingly how men of engineering (and men often were in general) from that generation, and it's Claire Foy's time to win like 700 awards for this performance.This is the kind of Oscar bait Im happy to watch, and I'm anticipating this will get best picture for reason to do and not do with the film in and of itself (in a sense this would win because Right Stuff, which is greater and more artistically ambitious, lost). And, man, seeing this in IMAX really does make a difference and feels a part of the whole thing (and unlike Nolan and Dunkirk, it doesn't change at random moments, it's IMAX on the moon and that's it). It's a gripping tension between conventional (the script) and experimental/loose (Chazelle)....I might've liked Buzz Aldrin to come off as more than just an a-hole though (and Lukas Haas gets the short shrift as Mike Collins, who is barely even named that out loud). 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Would have been an excellent movie if not for the frantic editing and home video style camerawork in many parts,"What a missed opportunity to make it a proper, thoroughly enjoyable watch. The use of photography ruins badly the whole experience with senseless shaky pictures adding nothing to the story. Unfortunately, the editing follows suit. People, in real life, do not shake their heads when they look at something that's why our inner ears balance (vestibular system) was invented in the first place by evolution (or God, depending on your view). It is a pity because it takes so much away from the film. The leads are very good, especially Claire Foy who is by far the most realistic figure in the story.

Good movie with a potential spoiled by shaky camera,"This could have been a great movie about Neil Armstrong early US space program, but it would have looked similar to the multiple other movies and I strongly suspect that Oscar winning director couldn't tolerate such an affront. He probably decided to be ""original"" just for the sake of it and introduced all the bad parts in the movie.All these extra close shots, bordering on the macro video, when half of the face fills whole screen from top to bottom. Constant intense shaky cam in still shots and regular room scenes. Walking a few steps after character and managing to wave camera everywhere, from empty corner to character and back. And all silence scenes, that look so ""original"" compared to the usual shouts, cheering and talking in normal, not so ""original"" space history movies.While operator/director managed to screw half of Earth scenes, their rocket scenes are amazing. Only minor nitpick is abruptly cut Apollo 1 scene. They could throw away a few minutes of Earth footage and instead complete A1 scene properly.Casting was mostly good and I suppose in character.This easily could have been a 9/10 movie with a more thoughtful editing and stabilized camera with normal distances in Earth scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Do not go if you suffer motion sickness!!,"I went to see this movie with my partner, her mother and a 14 year old cousin. While we all appreciated it, that was the strongest recommendation from any of us. My major problem with the film was the ""action"" camera work. While I understand that hand held shots lead to a greater sense of immediacy, having the camera 10 cm away from the subject and shaking it violently did not draw me in, rather it repulsed me. I literally closed my eyes for any sequence where this effect was used, as it was hurting me to watch it. As far as the story goes, it felt incredibly slow and distanced. In the interpretation of Armstrong as a person, it seemed to drive me away from relating to him or the situation, and I had no sense of the grandeur or the excitement that should have accompanied such a story. I was tempted to see this movie by the 2013 webby award winning site, and I can still say that the actual recordings are much more engaging than this film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Outstanding at its best, but not without issues that diminish it","Of all Damien Chazelle's features to date, this one slunk by without much fanfare in 2018. 'Whiplash' is all around exceptional and unquestionably his best; 'La La Land' is his most celebrated, though it didn't make a huge lasting impression with me; 'Babylon' met with mixed reception, but even in its imperfection might actually be my favorite. Why did 'First man' come and go, relatively unheard of, between the latter two? For all the esteemed, reputed, skilled individuals who participated in its creation, I'm of the mind that it doesn't take long before we begin to see why. The story is compelling, examining the life and career of one of the most important people involved in one of the biggest scientific and cultural events of the twentieth century, and maybe of any century. The film is competently made, meeting the high standards of modern production values, and to read of how the visuals were achieved is rather gratifying as a viewer for how the approach differs from what is all too common. All the pieces are here for what should be a roundly solid, superb viewing experience.Unfortunately, the problem is that it doesn't feel as if there is necessary polish and finesse in the construction to stitch the component parts together. We get light humor, heartbreaking tragedy, Neil Armstrong's personal difficulties, the anxiety of those at home waiting for news and their own tribulations, strong personalities, glimpses of ""the space race"" and the ground-breaking venture into a new frontier, discussion and illustration of mechanical and logistical considerations, public reactions and bureaucratic red tape, emphatic visual demonstration of the physical experience of launching into the atmosphere at immense speeds and against all the forces of physics, harsh sound effects, a commendable if sometimes surprisingly severe (and therefore somewhat uneven) original score from composer extraordinaire and regular Chazelle collaborator Justin Hurwitz, several very recognizable stars we know we can trust, and more. We also get hard edges as all these elements butt up against each other where there should ideally be seamless connectivity and smooth flow. Especially as the mood readily bounces back and forth it too often comes across to me that we're getting an outline of a narrative, or a rough draft, instead of a wholly refined, finished product. The result is that the picture struggles to evoke the active engagement and subsequent feelings that it should; nothing has what we must suppose was the full intended impact, if any. That extends to dialogue, characters, dialogue, scene writing, the overall plot, the acting, and at length, even Chazelle's direction.Some instances are better than others; one definite highlight, coming at around the one-hour mark, is the sequence of the Gemini 8 mission, executed for the audience with a fierce tension that makes us sit upright. To my pleasure, Claire Foy gives such a fantastic performance that I wonder if she doesn't outshine lead Ryan Gosling and herself become a top highlight of the title. One thing that I think this does very well is speaking to the actual costs of human life involved in this enterprise; unless one specifically seeks out information, we're unlikely to learn by the usual passive means of how many highly trained, experienced astronauts died in the process of progressing toward the first moon landing. And still 'First man,' as it presents, ping-pongs heavily from one idea or vibe to another, like excited electrons shooting off in all directions and colliding in unstoppable motion, sometimes with particularly regrettable outcomes. Everything herein is worthy of exploration, analysis, and remembrance; far too little of everything herein meets with the desired success, least of all in juxtaposition or otherwise combination. And this is nearly two and one-half hours long. That's a very long movie to face such issues; we feel that length, and not in a good way.Please don't misunderstand: I don't dislike this flick. I believe that more than not it remains worth watching, for every reason, including Linus Sandgren's cinematography, the stunts and effects, the costume design, hair, and makeup, and everyone behind the scenes and in front of the camera. It bears repeating that some scenes or small moments are wonderfully smart, and happily, more than that - when within the last hour the saga starts to climb to its zenith, it at last comes off that the feature is firing on all cylinders, and is benefiting from the utmost focus and care of all. It took nearly ninety minutes, but at last the effects, the visuals, the acting, the writing, the direction, the editing, the pacing, Hurwitz's music, and all other facets are aligning for a terrific finish with all the gravity and captivating space-borne drama we could hope for. That's just it, though; it took nearly ninety minutes to operate on a level that grabbed my attention and seemed notably inspired. When all is said and done it's sadly flawed; it comes off that various aspects aren't given all due treatment, and this can be chalked up to a surfeit of notions, choppy and/or brisk pacing; Tom Cross' editing, Josh Singer's screenplay, and ultimately Chazelle's direction. I think the film is good, and outstanding at its best; I also think it's far from being as good as it could have been, and I can't help but feel disappointed in some measure. Am I being too critical? Am I not being critical enough?I'm glad for those who get more out of this picture than I do. I want to like it more than I do. The strength it boasts at its best is diminished by the clunky gawkiness of its weakest spots, however, and a momentous real-life story doesn't feel entirely as momentous in cinematic adaptation as it ought to. Watch, by all means, for this remains deserving on its own merits and is still a swell credit to all involved. One would be remiss not to further observe that, unsurprisingly, the absurd manufactured controversy that met the movie from some corners upon release - a laughable, contemptible word salad of performative, bloviating jingoism - is revealed to 100% be a non-issue as we view the sum total for ourselves. All the same, through to the end it's probably the least sure-footed of Chazelle's works to date, so just be aware that 'First man' isn't completely impeccable, and maybe that will help you to appreciate it more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

La La Lunar Landing.,"'First Man (2018)' all feels markedly real, with the flight sequences in particular being utterly visceral, nail-bitingly tense and yet incredibly intimate. Our perspective is nearly always the same as the protagonist's, right down to several gripping - and often insanely shaky - POV shots. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the flick eventually gets to the moon and, when it does, it all feels suitably majestic - operatic, even. This memorable finale is only ever-so-slightly dampened by the fact that the rocket trip to get there feels quite short and isn't treated with the same intensity as the ones that came before it. Still, the differing style makes for an almost transcendent scene that takes a very personal approach. It also doesn't necessarily need to be suspenseful, anyway, considering that we all know how it turns out. This is something that the piece understands remarkably well, putting its emphasis much more on the 'how' and 'why' rather than the 'what'; it's very much about the journey, internal and external, rather than the destination. The picture does feel a little long but it does have a lot to get through and it's bigger issue, perhaps, is the fact that it sort of floats through its ten year period, skipping out large chunks at a moment's notice. This does make it sort of difficult to care, at least on a deep level, about any of the characters except our lead. Even then, he's usually stoic and puts both us and everyone else at a bit of a distance. The feature is very much a character study, though, and it does a decent job at giving us an insight into the man behind the mission. The focus is always on the way that the events depicted effect him and those closest to him, ultimately making for a much more intimate film than you might expect. It's this that gives it its heart, which is constantly present through the surprisingly restrained - and all the more effective for it - spectacle. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Missed half the movie because actors were mumbling too much,"It was really annoying from the start that all the actors didn't seem to speak clearly and that made it harder to follow than it already was anyway.
I also advise that if you want to see this movie you read the Wikipedia article on Armstrong or the Gemini / Apollo missions first. I went into the movie with a vague understanding, but felt left way behind because they don't explain much in the movie. I didn't know the timeline of the Gemini and Apollo missions and they don't bother to explain, so I was left wondering where in the timeline they were and how many more missions there were to come before the Apollo 11.They use the shaky camera style a lot, which is okay since many parts of the movies are taking place in rockets or other fast and unsteady vehicles, but during the personal scenes there are also some weirdly fast cut scenes that didn't seem to serve a purpose. In addition, I also think they either used old camera equipment or some sort of filter to give the movie a vintage appeal. That is interesting in an artsy way, but for the viewing pleasure it was more bothering.
The sequence on the moon was quite beautifully executed and the highlight of the movie, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A superbly crafted drama that gives a fantastic insight to the lead up to the moon landing,"The film 'First Man', directed by Damien Chazelle, is a brilliantly shot and edited film depicting the life of Neil Armstrong up too the infamous moon landing. 
The film uses film grainy footage to give the film a nostalgic feel and is shot mostly in closeups of the characters, creating a claustrophobic feel. Chazelle does not resort to extreme long scenic shots of the space environment, instead choosing to use closeups and extreme-closeups to better understand Neil's perspective of the event. 
The actors all are outstanding in the film, particularly Claire Foy who brings a lot to the character. 
Overall the film was very entertaining, had great pacing and was very entertaining to watch as well as informative. I would highly recommend this film to any lovers of film, however it is very mucj different to the usual style of Chazelles films.

Could have been great,"Much has been said about how visually stunning this movie is so we chose the biggest screen in the country to view it on. It did not take long before we had regretted this choice. All but the sequence on the moon was unworthy of an IMAX screen while the entire rest of the movie was jittery, shaky, extreme and out of focus close ups, crazy pans and tilts, zooming in and out, etc all made doubly irritating because of the size of the screen. Totally ruined the movie for us with many non-action scenes totally unwatchable. It could have even been a 9 out of 10 but for us was barely watchable. One of us was even sick and I only didn't walk out because of the subject material and the hope that it would improve, which thankfully it did for the short moon sequence.I honestly don't understand the attraction to this type of cinematography. We humans simply do not see the world in this way and so this only reminds us that we are watching a movie, thus taking us out of the moment and putting us back in the seat in the cinema, especially so as we often preferred to look at objects in the cinema than at the screen much of the time!

I am still waiting for this movie to leave orbit.,"Straight off the bat, it IS a good movie. It just left me wanting more, so much more.The movie begins with a bang! You are thrown into the exciting and risky life of a test pilot, Neil Armstrong. It seems that the director had a very specific goal in mind. Make the audience feel as if they are riding alongside Armstrong and can sense the anxiety and stress in some of these situations. They did a great job helping you feel the adventure. The unfortunate problem with this; it never stops. The entire movie is made with a shakey camera to add to the thrill, and on top of that they film everything up close to the object and person.Between the shakey camera and up close shots, you will find yourself trying to figure out what is happening in the shot. Again, on top of this, you find yourself in the seat along with the astronauts in almost all the exciting shots. This means that you will only enjoy space and the scenery through the tiny windows on board the Apollo and other conveyances.The movie was well done. Great acting, great script, some amazing scenes, and decent storyline. For how HUGE this real life story is and all the amazing scenes that could have come from it, I feel it fell short of my expectations. The entire time the director wants us to feel the intensity inside the shuttle. This is great for some of the time, but while this is all happening, you are missing something wonderful. You are missing SPACE. This is the most amazing, beautiful, grand, mysterious place (or void) that we could ever discover. Yet, you will find yourself never truly getting to experience the joys and grandiosity of Armstrong's experiences, only the stressful moments.There were multiple shuttle launches during this movie and you will only see part of one. The one I am referring to is great, but it still cuts in and out of shots so quickly, you will find yourself lost. Or like me, you may find yourself wondering if they did up close and shakey shots because its cheaper than doing a realistic CGI launch. By the end of the movie I felt like I have somehow missed out on space exploration, which is literally the point of the movie. The movie should have been called Neil Armstrong, it was far more about the person (which is fine) than it was about landing on the moon or being in space.It is still worth a watch, easily. Just don't compare it to movies such as, "" Gravity"" or ""Interstellar"" which both do an AMAZING job explaining space and allowing you a way to slightly understand the insanely mysterious and deep vacuum that is space. After ""First Man,"" you will want to go home and search shuttle launches on youtube to fulfill an unsettled desire. Like going on a Grand Canyon tour, but you are only able to see it from within the canyon in a bus with a couple inch wide window and its hitting every bump in the trail and you are never allowed out.""First Man"" launched with spectacular glory towards the stars with you along for this intense ride of a lifetime. Then it got stuck in orbit and never reached what I know of which it was capable.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The Story you think you know.,"First Man, starring Ryan Gosling, and Claire Foy, with Damien Chazelle directing, he of La La Land, and Whiplash. This film was I think a progression of both styles.First Man, is the story of Neil Armstrong, first man on the Moon, and his journey not only in space, but of the NASA programme for the previous 10 years. However, rather than go the grand adventure route, which it most certainly does include in the film, its more of an introverted look at the life of the Armstrong family and what they went through. Opening with an early test flight of his as a civilian pilot and the death of his young daughter, slowly from cancer. This film actively avoids lingering on anything of the wider issues, Racism, Government policy, the Soviets vs America, or Kennedy's promise. it certainly doesn't ignore the politics behind the story, but it is always from the angle of NASA looking out at it, and swiftly returns to the man in the middle.Through the use of intimate handheld cameraing and very quiet, close moments at the beginning especially but used throughout, you are thrust straight into the life of this man, and feel transported along with him. The sound design is incredible and even when dealing with Space, they keep it very close and intimate, how these men actually felt in the tiny cramped modules and suits.Gosling gives a great performance, but it would be nothing without the natural presence of Foy, who utterly convinces as the quietly pained and suffering wife/mother. The superb support cast, littered with talent, again play well, but always remain bit parts to intense concentration on the Armstrongs, Neil in particular, of course. As in Whiplash, its an intense two hander between these two people, there just happens to be the most famous story in history happening at the same time. They marry these two challenging scales very well.The weight of history is almost inevitably where this film reaches issues. How to retell a story that everyone upon everyone knows, and worst, has their own version of what actually happened? You can never really lose the sense that you spend 2 hours just waiting to here that line! When it actually comes to this point, they handle it well, and predictably/cautiously give it over to a very human moment with Neil Armstrong remembering his lost daughter. But throughout the NASA parts of the film, they retain that sense of them taking a massive unknown risk, which for me was beautifully reflecting in Armstrong actually taking the first step, where he hesitated because no one actually knew if the surface was even solid!This film achieves big and small at the same time and at points is almost breathless in its intensity. A throughly good cinema experience and a film, that quietly asks a question of you and your place in it all. But how could the greatest story, not ask such question. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Poetry in Motion,"I was able to see this at a VIP preview showing tonight and I enjoyed it very much. It was very different from other space movies I've seen. It was much slower paced, very detail oriented with lots of emotion. Lots of ""behind the scenes"" moments at home with Neil Armstrong and his family. So many unspoken gestures and nuances between him and his wife. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy were able to show volumes of emotions with their eyes and facial expressions. It had a Super 8 home movie feel to it as well, more grainy like the films were in the 1960s. The sound effects were amazing. The metal-on-metal scraping, the way the spaceship was shaking violently and all the mechanical noises, the dials spinning, it was like you were almost there with him. The footage of Neil and Buzz landing on the moon was wonderful too. The detail was amazing. The film was like poetry in motion, compared to the typical action/adventure feel other space movies have. I enjoyed it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Very Disappointed,This movie is tedious and melodramatic. The audio quality of the radio chatter is unintelligible. The human relationships are one dimensional. The special effects feel like they were shot inside of a 1950s vintage tilt-a-whirl amusement park ride.

It's not even close. Sure, there are some visual elements and snippets of dialogue that mimic the facts, but it is, after all a movie for entertainment.I was entertained.

Don't expect From the Earth to the Moon.,"So the story of Neil Armstrong from test plot to being the first man on the moon and also the story of how his wife dealt with Neil after the death of there daughter which you find out right at the start. I like it to a point, for sound and the effects are amazing when your watching the few bits that show NASA, space and the spaceships. you felt like the astronauts was put into metal cans just glue together, which is basically true, but the bits with his family and wife bored me alittle bit, i understand why but from showing the lost a their daughter and that drive him to work, just felt long. 
I still say if your looking for a drama about a wife dealing with a man who can't deal with a daughter death whule bits of man working for nasa who lands on te moon, go for ir, this is your movie, if your looking the HBO series from the late 90s from the earth to the moon, this isnt your film and that series does a much better job much of tells the story of NASA mission to the moon and all the apollo missions and it's more enjoyable to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An amazing story in search of a motion picture home - The story's still searching.,"I was 12 when Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the Moon, and witnessing that moment in history was transformative for me. I spent the next 50 years writing professionally about, among other topics, space exploration and manned space flight for numerous publications. That's why I was so excited when I heard about this movie being made. I was hoping that, not since Tom Hanks' superlative HBO mini-series, ""From the Earth to the Moon,"" Hollywood would tell one of the most incredible stories of modern day bravery and scientific accomplishment in a manner and on a scale it deserves.I'm still waiting. ""First Man,"" is little more than a series of barely connected vignettes in Neil Armstrong's life. There is no dramatic narrative to speak of in the film, and nothing that conveys the daunting nature or shear human magnitude of the race to the Moon in the 1960s. As portrayed by Ryan Gosling, the part of Neil Armstrong is a virtually nonspeaking role. He's perpetually morose, and has a range of facial expressions running the gamete from blank to slightly frowny. If you walk into the movie theater with little or no foreknowledge about Neil Armstrong or the early space program, you will leave in virtually the same condition. You will have learned nothing about how or why the early astronauts were such unique individuals, let alone how they were required to meet nearly impossible standards of training, expertise and experience to even be allowed to apply for the job. Your ignorance will go undisturbed about the substantial sacrifices made by members of the astronaut corps and their families - and by the thousands of scientists, engineers and others who contributed the entirety of their personal and professional lives - to make real the dream of the, ""giant leap for mankind,"" given voice to by a martyred president in 1961.You will also gain scant, if any, insight into what it meant to nearly every American and billions of people around the world, that humans had set foot on another celestial body. The degree and nature of how it changed - and could have changed - both Neil Armstrong's life and individuals everywhere, also didn't make it into the movie, either. In short, ""First Man,"" is an empty spacesuit of a movie more notable for all of the elements of good storytelling and honest humanity that are absent from it.

"A half baked effort, attempt to focus on a narrow scope fails","Its an attempt at a character study, the usual personal tragedy drives the brooding, but there is no depth there. The massive scope of the project to put a man on the moon is barely hinted at, all you see is an attempt at a personal story and it still feels empty, you just see a man brood, as if mystery were enough. The lack of depth extends to the mission portions as well, lots of close up of faces, lots of quick cuts, but no clever illustration of what problems he faced and how he was solving them, you see quick cuts, his face, and random disorientation. Its the shortcut of a story teller who doesn't know how to tell a story and that pretty much sums up the movie.There are so many missed opportunities, in one scene Neil is in a class learning about his mission, but they show and say almost nothing. Simply showing the physics equations would have told the audience this was no ordinary man, he was aeronautical engineer who could understand such things. These are rudimentary techniques in story telling on film which is why its so perplexing.Just look at the first scene with the x15, compare it to the first scene of ""When we left the earth: The NASA Missions"" which covered the very same flight and compare the impact, this films version just pales in comparison to a documentary's edit from a decade ago. ""Neil Armstrong X15 - When we left earth."" on youtube contains the clip. That 1 minute segment evokes more emotion and understanding than this film does over 2 hours. You are better served watching that well made documentary series than this mess of a film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Bit boring but good story!,This is my opinion on the movie so if you like the movie don't get angry from what i say. This is my opinion so yeah. First man is a story about the people going to the moon. It has a really good story and got a Oscar award. But it was a bit boring. Most of the movie was just the people talking. When there was scenes when they go to the moon on a rocketship they weren't that exciting. I went to the cinemas to watch it and I just talked to my friends because it was boring. But it's good if you want to watch a movie about a true story. But to me I'm not that type of person. I like action movies and stuff as you see on the John wick reviews I did. But it still had a good story. It shows all the full details as Neil Armstrong prepares to go to the moon. It's a alright movie to watch.

Shake it all about,"This is certainly no Apollo 13Instead of special effects they just keep shaking the camera relentlessly.
There again they couldn't even film Janet Armstrong walking down her drive without shaking the camera a bit.

If Neil Armstrong really was so brooding then maybe they should of featured more of other characters like Buzz Aldrin who in his few scenes actually comes across as an enthusiastic guy.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Watchable space movie that falls shorts on the very aspects it's tried to innovate on.,"To a space enthusiast like me, you could just show 2 hrs of Apollo mission footage and I would consider that money and time well spent, which is why this movie managed to be kinda satisfying DESPITE all the efforts of the writer / director to make this exciting human achievement dark and depressing.There are many ways of injecting drama and emotion in a space movie, by showing the terror, the uncertainty, the camaraderie, or even a nuanced look at astronomers' relationships / friendships, but First Man chooses to just show unsympathetic glimpses of Neil Armstrong's life that are neither comprehensive enough to be biographical nor have the emotional heft to be engaging.1. Characterization:Neil Armstrong's family is perpetually depressed, he is always aloof and detached, has no screen chemistry with wife, who is icy, tight-lipped and always seems to be on the verge of tears / exhaustion. Watching their conversations make you feel like one trapped in a 2+ hour road trip with a passive-aggressive couple. We are to believe all this is because they lost their daughter to cancer 6 yrs ago at the age of 2. Whether it be scenes of him staring wistfully at the moon for the umpteenth time, or sulking most times he's shown in the vicinity of his family, it becomes progressively hard to care about the guy who needs a lecture from his wife before he'd talk to his sons on what could very well be his last night ever with them.2. Lighting and Camera:Their house is never well-lit and feels like an interrogation chamber half the time. Most of these scenes are grainy and shot handheld with a shaky camera, often getting into the faces of the characters which lends a dizzy, disconcerting feeling to already uncomfortable scenes. This perma-zoom means Claire Foy's freckled arms probably had more screen time and took more screen space than the moon's surface. The camera work and color grading make you feel like you're watching a horror film / tragedy rather than one of mankind's greatest triumphs. OTOH, the cockpit scenes and space scenes are quite well executed and realistic, but be prepared for a lot of shaking, vibrating and spinning. That being said, this is no Gravity / Interstellar in that department.This film has two slightly funny scenes, but such is the pall of all-pervasive gloom in the film that even those didn't manage to elicit more than careful chuckles from the audience.Thankfully, if you have any love for the space program, the movie offers plenty to watch. Lots of mission-related scenes, launch sequences, some technical terminology, and the moon landing scenes are brilliantly shot, managing to make you emotional in an otherwise sterile movie. The background score and sound editing are top notch and really put you in the situation, and Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong is passable. Claire Foy is quite underutilized as his wife and most of the other numerous characters are largely forgettable.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It all comes Down to Bad Direction,"I realize they wanted to make it dramatic and try to cover stuff that other movies covering this topic have yet to do. That being said they focused minutes on scenes that could have taken seconds and thinks that could have shown the real drama of the moment have been compressed into mere seconds.This director really shows that he has littler to no interest in the history of space and almost all interest in trying to impress the critics. Sadly the critics and the masses rarely agree. Now I am not going to lampoon the direction. It is a decent and emotional movie. The problem is there are two stories going on here. The personal life of Neil Armstrong and The Moon Landing. The Moon Landing scene was good the build up action scenes were not save a couple. Many scenes felt rushed or even sped up at times. That bugged me. There is little to no time to build anticipation. It falls flat.The Dramatic scenes fall short as well. I understand that Neil was described as a recluse at times and not an outgoing person but wow. They have taken it to the next level here. Most of the movies he shows little to no depth. He could literally be replaced by a mannequin in some scenes because the director relies on emotional music and light blooms to show the emotion. For a man who has so much written about him and justifies a whole movie made of him, it is hard to believe by the way he is portrayed in the movie that anyone got enough out of him to write anything useful.I could care less about the controversy. This is the result of a director coming off success that thought he had another award in the bag with this. Sadly he does not. That has been proven. This is a confused movie at best. Do they want to portray the climate of the 1960's racial tensions... Sure put it in the movie but how does it move the plot. It doesn't. It affects the story not one but. I get it, I'm a history buff but you dont have to throw this stuff in to appease people.Make something exciting and watchable and inspire a generation of people who are excited and interested to go out and read books on everything having to do with the topic and era. For me that was Apollo 13, The generation before me had the right stuff. This generation has this confused mess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Chazelle finally gives us new shots compared to the ones we have seen in the last 40 years about rockets and ships. The movie is good in the fact it chooses to tell more about a grief than a moon landing. Is good in that many things are told in a different way, such as the risks the astronauts were facing, the first-person shots, the cuts eliminating many obvious, well-known sequences. The ending is very good, and well-executed. The music is a masterpiece, one of the best themes ever heard, epic and tragic at the same time.But, we all know how it went, and all these new takes and angles can't overcome it.

Fantastic...,"First Man is a technical wonder. The first thing that stands out is the sound of this film. Justin Hurwitz again does a fantastic job creating a score that fits the mood and emotions of what is captured on screen. Not only is the score killer, but the sound design/editing is phenomenal. The sound (or lack of it) during some of the space scenes did a great job of heightening the suspense when something went wrong and exaggerating the sense of awe felt when viewing space. The sound is also paired with some breathtaking cinematography. It is obvious that a lot of time went into planning the shots for this film. Every shadow and reflection feels deliberate. Many have complained about the use of close-ups and shaky cam, and even though I can agree that they were used a little heavy-handedly, I think they were used deliberately to give a certain feeling of anxiety and uncomfortableness that Neil himself felt when piloting a rocket.The film also has some great performances. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy do a great job of displaying emotion, showing not telling how they feel. Claire Foy in particular does a fantastic job as Janet Shearon.As for the story, First Man tells Neil's untold personal side of going to the moon and his life around that time. The story was unique in that it humanized Neil Armstrong. When you think of Neil Armstrong, you think of a historical icon and not a father, a husband, a friend, a man. Throughout the film, you witness Neil being all of these things along with an iconic astronaut. This allows the viewer to put themselves into Neil's shoes. Neil feels anxious, sad, and scared just like any of us. Neil's relationship with his wife, his kids, and his co-workers are all explored to some degree, giving us the opportunity to see Neil in a different light. Of course, this is only a portion of the film; the other plot points that deal with the actual journey to the moon are very interesting as well. One thing that this portion of the film demonstrates well is the level of technology used to make the trip to the moon. In hindsight, the technology used to communicate and control the space shuttle wasn't advanced, and this film demonstrates many of the technical issues they had with completing this monumental task. This allowed for some great suspenseful scenes in space. With the combination of some great space sequences and the personal relationships of Neil Armstrong, the pacing of this film feels consistent. Overall, I would highly recommend this film.The GoodBeautiful cinematography-Fantastic sound design/editing

First Man (2018),"Directed by Damien Chazelle. Starring Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Kyle Chandler, Ciarán Hinds, Jason Clarke, Corey Stoll, Shea Whigham, Christopher Abbott, Lukas Haas, Patrick Fugit, Olivia Hamilton, Gavin Warren. (PG-13)Visually striking but curiously earthbound biopic/historical drama focusing on Neil Armstrong (Gosling) and NASA's efforts to put him on the moon during the 1960s. Film's brushstrokes are often painted in a detached, procedural fashion, aiming more for docudrama authenticity than stirring melodrama. While this pursuit seems appropriate given the enigmatic character of its hero, it misses out on opportunities to find the music and poetry in such a colossal endeavor, only occasionally finding its beating heart and expressive imagination. Nevertheless, the technical achievement on display cannot be overlooked (especially the sensational X-15 test pilot and lunar landing sequences) and the script and performances are solid across the board; Foy, as Armstrong's wife, Janet, stands out among the reliable cast. Could have been a nice companion piece to ""The Right Stuff"" (which focused on the Mercury program, while this one involved the Gemini and Apollo missions), but can't compete with the earlier masterpiece in scope, meaning, or entertainment value; still worth a look, though, especially to those interested in the space race.74/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Dizzying (not in a good way), slow and a bit boring","I am not a film critic or student of the arts, but I do appreciate a good movie and, in my opinion, this was not one. The movie moves at a snail's pace and Chazelle's decision to shoot the majority of the movie with shaky handhelds and extreme closeups led to some real dizzying feelings for me and my wife. I felt a sense of claustrophobia the entire film due to the extreme close up and jump cuts. Maybe I am a bit dense and this is what the filmmaker was going for, but it made it a very uncomfortable experience. I kept waiting for him to pan out!The actual story was a bit long and tedious and we never felt any real connection with the characters.

Emotions; more than anything,Get to know in detail about the life of Neil Armstrong more than from the readings through the Net. It's talk more about the personal ambiguities and concerns of Neil with his wife and children. But more over his passion he just abandon everything and went for the mission. Then the last silent portion at the quarantine makes us feel the taste of success. Film is completely gone in a compact mode were the characters expressions gave more importance than the visuals. At some point it is up to the mark but for a sci-fi like this visuals may have it's own importance. Anyway more than a space film I would like call it as a dramatic personification.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Dull, Dull, Dull","I couldn't wait to see this movie, having grown up in the fifties and sixties wanting to be an astronaut myself. It's how I wound up a cadet at West Point which is where I was when Apollo 11 made its miraculous journey to the moon. I remember the excitement when we marched from our barracks in the middle of the night to go watch the landing. I remember the awe as we sat in the North Auditorium transfixed on the largest tv screen I'd ever seen as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface. Unfortunately there was very little of that excitement or awe in this movie. I don't know where the filmmakers went wrong, but I suspect it's because they failed to capture the context. In the world of 1969 landing on the moon was an extraordinary reality altering event. It was beyond our collective imagination. There was nothing mundane, tedious or remotely boring about it or the amazing people who pulled it off. The same cannot be said of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Chazelle is 3 for 3...,"For my money Chazelle is the best young director working today and First Man is another smashing success. Mostly interested in the subjective feelings experienced by Armstrong during space travel on the one hand and the human cost to his family on the other this is a gripping portrayal of man who loses himself to impossible work to hide his grief. The story does de-empathizes the political aspects (most are mentioned in passing) of the history but it does so to focus on the personal. Through I love how the question of whether the social-political cost of the space program is worth its benefits is asked along side the question of with whether the human cost to Armstrong's family is worth it. It makes everything personal about this telling of the storyThe film is at its best when it is entirely visual. The various space flight sequences are shocking and fresh given the close up and subjective camera work Chazelle favors. And when the film does go wide for various shots of space travel they are striking and refreshing different from other films covering similar material. The film is interested in the juxtaposition of the the infinity of outer space against the infinity complexities of single human being. Chazelle keeps this juxtaposition throughout but its subtle and not over done.While the film isn't as personal as Whiplash or La La Land, Chazelle does manage to let his personality through. Several of the space travel scenes are scored with jazzy music and it feels like a modern update of 2001 in that regard while connecting to Whiplash and La La Land.The script is smart, the acting powerful and the direction sublime. All in all this is a fine film and should be in the running come award season.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

First Man lifts off as the perfect biographical leap for mankind.,"We've seen plenty of space exploration films, particularly those that attempt to traverse the Moon. 'Apollo 13' and 'Hidden Figures' to name a couple, where both the pressured astronauts and intense mission control have been equally portrayed. This film should be cataclysmically generic, sparking little to no ignition for a story that has been shown in film for decades. Yet, not only does Chazelle craft a thrilling biopic, but one that is masterfully astute. One that radiates wonderment and awe. It's one small step for biopics, but one giant leap for Chazelle. Cementing him as one of the best directors working today. First Man chronicles the career of Neil Armstrong and the race against the Soviets to conduct the first lunar landing. These mathematically complex calculations and trajectories are accompanied by Armstrong's personal life which is filled with loss, sorrow and fragility. Two juxtaposing environments exhuming differing emotions that inherently affect Armstrong as a person. The colossal pressure to succeed in opportunities that no one else has been presented with contrasts a different type of pressure. Family. Chazelle ensures that his personal life is just as important as his historical achievement. Balancing various thrilling rocket tests, from Gemini to Apollo 11, with the dramatic tension spawning between him and his remaining family. Both equally as intense, yet both consistently intertwining. It's an ecosystem of melancholy and grandeur. For every death, there is a funeral. For every groundbreaking milestone, there is a celebration. Each event that takes place manifests in Armstrong's mind, making his perilous journey personal and dangerous. The tragic loss of his daughter could've affected his working ability, however his focused demeanour reassured NASA that he was the correct choice to lead the space race. Chazelle presents this delicately, but never resorts to melodrama. Several scenes of Armstrong reminiscing or imagining his daughter's life ensures that she is a source that powers him through tough challenges.There is not a single scene that feels drawn out or unnecessary. Every action and line of dialogue acts as a star, slowly forming a glistening path to the Moon. Chazelle, much like Armstrong, was focused. Exploring several perspectives on how the space race was viewed during the 60s. From civilians believing it to be waste of tax payer's money to astronauts wanting to overtake the rivalling Soviet nation. He compacts a wide range of views in the film's 140 minute runtime, and yet it never once felt bloated. The wealthy runtime allows Chazelle to be patient with specific historical segments, and it works seamlessly. The heart-stopping opening sequence reassures us that this is an authentic biopic. Intense, powerful and exhilarating. He somehow manages to make the predictable Apollo 11 mission, which we all know was a success, a hyperventilating experience. As the fuel levels dramatically decrease, my heart rate increases. For a director to make a predictable story unpredictable is an achievement. His succinctly subtle long takes and technical prowess only heightens the high quality that is being produced. The Apollo 11 lift off sequence, accompanied by Hurwitz' euphoric score, was outstanding. The astonishing sound editing as the rocket pressurises, the gorgeous cinematography visualising the Moon's tranquility and the claustrophobic camera movements intently focussing on Gosling's eyes. It was a symphony of technical splendour. For the first time since 'Gravity', I experienced the feeling of awe. So much so, that I became emotional towards the film's conclusion. It reminded me why I love films so much, why we go to the cinema and why powerful stories that represent humanity need to be told time and time again.Gosling was the perfect choice to play Armstrong. He is able to portray the pressure, intent and emotional damage from just his eyes alone. It's a nuanced performance that stays with you hours after the credits roll. Foy embodies his wife perfectly by harnessing the fear of losing her husband. You can see the build up as the years pass by, to which she soon unleashes all of her thoughts upon Armstrong in a scene that should garner her some acclaim. However, there is one pivotal scene that sublimely illustrated Armstrong's position. As he says farewell to his children before departing, his youngest gives him a hug. The eldest however shakes his hand. And it's at that moment I knew this film was something special. The struggles of maintaining fatherhood with work was eloquently illustrated in that one scene. No dialogue. Just two actions. I could also discuss the bracelet scene on the Moon, but I would rather not become an emotional mess again. First Man truly surprised me. I was expecting Chazelle's weakest film, considering his perfect career thus far, but I received one of his strongest yet. It reassured me that film is not a dying art, but a universal medium that can transcend time itself. Suffice to say, First Man gets the perfect rating, and is quite simply the best film of the year so far. An absolutely incredible journey that should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Technically satisfying, but lacking the propulsion and energy I'd expect from a Chazelle movie","First Man doesn't do anything bad, but it takes few risks and feels like an overlong, by-the-numbers slog far more than it should. Chazelle employs slow takes and lots of close up, shaky shots to help put us in the mindset of an astronaut, but I don't think he succeeded in having the audience feel the tension and uncertainty. The launch scenes felt more simple and drawn out than tension raising, and didn't grip me at any point. The visuals, cinematography, and sound were all very good, Gosling was effective if very reserved, and Foy was great and got robbed of a supporting actress nomination. I would contrast First Man with Gravity and The Martian, which combine to form better versions of the elements First Man shoots for; Gravity in the impeccable space shot designs and visual effects, and The Martian in NASA mission proceedings. First Man didn't develop the personal connection either movie did, as while we respect Neil we are never closer than an arm's length to him. It's also much longer, slower moving, and outcomes are rarely ever in doubt and never culminate in exciting climactic sequences. I think the second half was better than the first, and it had some very good individual scenes (especially when Janet gets Neil to talk to the kids), but it felt much too predictable and free of intrigue to be enjoyable, whereas Gravity maintained uncertainty and tension throughout, and The Martian did it despite the outcome being obvious as it was in First Man. I remember watching the trailer months ago and feeling like it was the safest bet of 2018 - Chazelle only makes great movies, Gosling is very good, and it's an interesting topic. Like Vice, it ends up as a 6 star disappointment not because it's bad, but because it has so much potential that it has no business being as forgettable and mediocre as it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A film of visuals and determination with the power to land.,"Space movies are okay, and this one was a historical biopic which had me in as I like history and people. It's well done from director Damien Chazelle for it's telling of the life and times of 1961 thru 1969 of one Neil Armstrong(in a pretty good performance from Ryan Gosling). As it goes right up to Armstrong's landing on the moon. The scenes and close takes of aircraft and space images rival that of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"".Still the film is of inner mystery and life showing the cost and risk of space travel as it takes power, will, and determination to orbit a dangerous mission. Many scenes are intense and a struggle still the film is a journey of passion and desire. As the landing on the moon is the accomplishment and you the viewer feel some of the same joy that the central character feels after the landing which is a true accomplishment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not sure if we ever went to the moon but in the movie we always walk on it,"Midway through First Man, astronaut Neil Armstrong is asked by a reporter at a press conference how he feels about the fact that, should the Apollo 11 mission be successful and he lands on the moon, he'll go down in history.Armstrong can't answer the question. He impatiently snaps that NASA and the ship's crew plan to be successful. Buzz Aldrin, seated by his side, eventually has to step in to talk about the crew's great responsibility and excitement, while Armstrong stares intently into the middle distance.The stoicism that might have prevented a man like Armstrong, who was facing either death or a kind of immortality, from being able to articulate an answer in that moment is the heart and soul of First Man. The film is less concerned with delivering a triumphalist portrayal of the 1969 moon landing - which has been done before, we've all seen it - and more with probing what kind of person is able to white-knuckle through the physical, emotional, and psychological toll of this sort of mission and successfully pull it off.The answer is gratifyingly, understandably intricate. Like last year's Dunkirk, First Man funnels a historical moment through an intimate experience, reminding us that events that appear triumphant in history's rear-view mirror often come at the expense of pain and great personal sacrifice shouldered by real people. But the movie, first and foremost, tells Neil Armstrong's story. We're allowed to see it through his eyes, but in return, it asks us to respect what he went through - and that is not always easy.First Man is the story of Project Gemini and the moon landing through one man's eyes. At the distance of a half-century, the facts of the moon landing are well-known to most Americans: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, the culmination of a ""space race"" between the US and the USSR.All these elements are present in First Man, but the challenge with any movie based on epochal historical events is to find a fresh story in familiar facts. In this case, screenwriter Josh Singer (The Post, Spotlight) adapted James R. Hansen's authorized biography of Armstrong. (Armstrong was famously private, but he granted more than 50 hours of interviews to Hansen and gave him access to private documents and family sources.)The resulting film, directed by Damien Chazelle (who won the Best Director Oscar for La La Land in 2017) is laser-focused on Armstrong's life, beginning with the tragic cancer-related death of his 2-year-old daughter Karen in 1962, prior to him being chosen for Project Gemini. Like the book on which it's based, First Man paints a portrait of Armstrong as someone for whom heroism was never a motivator, and who viewed notoriety with deep reluctance.That the movie never really reaches a state of full-blown exhilaration is likely to frustrate viewers who are looking to have their sense of ownership in its historical events reinforced. But rather than focus on American achievement, First Man pays its deepest respects to Armstrong and to the men and women who risked and sacrificed their lives to get to the moon. The movie sees Armstrong's reserve as both a blessing and a curse, a gift and a problem, but it's unequivocal in its admiration of his humility. And in this way, it feels less like it's forcing a myth onto the man who made it clear to his biographer that he wasn't seeking renown - and more like a statement of gratitude.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Refreshingly real, deliberate take..","First Man is not a film that will endear itself to younger audiences. The film is slower-paced and centers more on the emotional toll of everything that led to the first small step for man.I wanted to watch this film because i am a fan of the directors' previous work. I think this film sits on near the top shelf, below ""Whiplash"", but not an eye-sore by any means.The film succeeds in some ways and fails in others. The film has a consistent, washed-out yet appropriate look for the time-period, and many(not all) of the visuals are spectacular. The music is solid(as to be expected from this director). The final 20-minutes is spine-tingling goodness. Each action sequence, while rare, is handled very well, and each of those moments is suspenseful and feels quite real. The aspect of creating danger and echoing that sentiment through the actions of the characters works here, but the film is far from perfect.Some visuals are a bit hacked - like the final rocket launch, and perhaps a bit too much unnecessarily over-used handheld camera-work.The film also fails to bring in emotion outside of the Armstrong household, and almost all the supporting characters feel like an oversight. To boot, the emotional weight of all of the Armstrong households' struggles, fail to hit the mark, perhaps due to a thin, under-written script. A private mans' home life seems as private and restrained as his media personality, and the film suffers because of it. It's not Gosling's fault, but realistic or not, when your lead character seemingly walks away speechless from every emotional moment, it doesn't help the impact nor the pacing of the film you're making. The ending suffers for it too.Overall, its still a good film, with solid visuals and really tense action sequences, great music, and solid-yet-restrained performances. I won't say I won't watch it again, bit I won't watch it again anytime soon.67/100You'll like it you liked(Thirteen Days - a touch below this), The Right Stuff(a clear notch above this), Indian Runner(a small notch above this), and Apollo 13(a small notch above this).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Combines grounded and moving drama with a jaw-dropping portrayal of space in truly spectacular fashion,"Not only is First Man an excellent biography that tells a riveting and often moving story, but, rather unusually for the genre, it's an incredible technical achievement, with stunning visual effects, brilliant directing, incredible cinematography, beautiful music and more adding to the emotion back on Earth, as we see an excellent lead performance from Ryan Gosling bring the story of Neil Armstrong to life in vivid fashion.For starters, one of the best things about this film is how well-balanced it is between the personal life of Armstrong, and his work on the space programme during the 1960s. In that, it has all the emotion and depth of the best biographical dramas, but with the added element of the thrills of the Space Race, in a story that's certain to satisfy both those looking for a great drama as well as a brilliant portrayal of the Apollo mission.Let's start on the personal side of things, which is arguably the harder side of the story to tell, given the legendary status of Armstrong's role in the space programme. Most will likely be going into this film waiting for the moment we see him step on the Moon, but what First Man does so brilliantly is give due focus and attention to the personal background of the whole story, which is what makes that final payoff all the more powerful.Although I can't say the movie starts in spectacular fashion, with an opening fifteen minutes or so that fails to live up to the dramatic power it's trying to push, that side of the story grows and grows in emotional intensity as the movie goes on, and given the rather long runtime of nearly two and a half hours, it reaches a stunning emotional peak as the story comes to a climax.And while you may want to see more of the space stuff, the screenplay creates such emotion around Armstrong's personal life and motivations as he finds himself closer and closer to that legendary mission. Whether it be his relationship with his wife, played excellently by Claire Foy, or the constant setbacks he suffers due to losses of family members and friends, there's so much emotional depth on display here, making for a thoroughly engrossing watch throughout.Ryan Gosling does a brilliant job in the lead role too, and with his understated but effortlessly likable and relatable performance, portraying Armstrong as a deeply dedicated and caring man, even though he may appear cold and introverted on the outside at times, it's so easy to believe in his story right the way through, and to be completely pulled into all of the ups and downs that he went through over the course of a tumultuous decade.Now, on the flipside, there's the story about the space programme. Without the personal side of things, this wouldn't have the same emotional punch as it does, and that's the film's greatest achievement. However, it also makes a fascinating watch out of telling the story of the Space Race, and in particular puts into perspective the reality of the programme beyond the legend of the Moon landing in 1969.In that, the film's main discourse focuses on assessing the cost of the space programme, with particular attention being drawn to the human cost of dangerous tests and mistakes that is somewhat glossed over when looking back with rose-tinted glasses. It's not a downbeat or overly critical look at the space programme, and rightly so, as it clearly identifies many of the immense benefits brought about by the historic work done by the brave and bright men and women of the era, but it does feature a fascinating degree of introspection that makes it thoroughly worth the watch.But then, there's the pure romance and wonder of space exploration, and that too is something that First Man brings to light in stunning fashion. Much like director Damien Chazelle did with his passionate love letter to the old movie musical in La La Land, there are moments in this film where he completely strips away all of the anxieties and problems associated with the space programme, and lets you sit back in wonderment and awe as you witness man going further than ever before.The sequences set in space are by far the film's most moving and awe-inspiring moments, and as I was watching some of these visually breathtaking moments above the Earth's atmosphere, I was taken back to that childlike wonder that was always associated with space travel, reminding me of that old feeling when being an astronaut was the coolest, most exciting job you could ever think of, something that absolutely blew me away at times here.Of course, none of that could have been achieved without the exceptional technical work on this film. More so than any other, I feel that First Man is a crowning achievement for how far visual effects have come, with CGI and immense ambition that used to be reserved for only the biggest blockbusters being combined with a down-to-earth and deep story, and making for some of the most powerful and awe-inspiring sequences you've seen in a very long time.Chazelle's direction is exceptional throughout, the cinematography brings both the claustrophobia of sitting in a rickety old rocket as well as the immense scale of space to life in stunning detail, the score is a beautiful and inspiring work, and those visual effects are jaw-dropping to witness, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved on screen further and further in electrifying fashion.Overall, I was hugely impressed with First Man. A riveting and moving personal story that's combined with a fascinating and grounded portrayal of the space race, as well as some of the most spectacular space vistas you've ever witnessed, it's a thoroughly engrossing and often even mind-blowing watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A giant leap for humanity, but not for cinema","We all know the story of ""First Man""... 1969 moon landing, Neil Armstrong, yada yada. It's an absolutely impressive story-after all, we flew to the freakin' moon! This is a massive feat of science and human accomplishment that truly needs to be celebrated, and what better way to do so with a stellar cast and a director of Whiplash fame!The movie starts off with a kick-ass nailbiter of a scene that rivals ""Gravity"" in its suspense. They totally got the 60's clunky technology vibes right with an amazing sound design and visual effects so good that you never question the time you're in. Also, I like the overall idea of focusing on the human story behind all the politics, especially as Claire Foy's performance as Janet Armstrong was very powerful.That said, I felt surprisingly unmoved by this pic. What did move me was the human accomplishment depicted by the movie, but not so much the movie itself. It's almost as the movie relies too much on the power of the source material. Story-wise, I felt that the movie hat some pacing issues and felt a little slow in the middle, and the final moon landing felt underwhelming.I think one big issue is Ryan Gosling's emotional deadpan performance. It doesn't matter whether this does or does not reflect Neil Armstrong's real character: If a movie has a protagonist that is unemotional, then chances are that the audience doesn't feel as much either.Another big issue I had with the movie was the whole backstory relating to the Armstrong's lost daughter and all that. This aspect of ""First Man"" reminded me quite a bit of ""Arrival"", and just as in that movie, this tragic backstory was supposed to somehow motivate or drive Neil Armstrong. However, this whole emotional dimension was mostly lost throughout the rest of the movie... and when it did come back, it felt contrived and somewhat cheesy.All in all, a good movie with some great camerawork and some excellent acting by Claire Foy... however, in the end, this doesn't give justice to the epic scope of this amazing part of human history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A technical marvel.,"Having been amazed by Damien Chazelle's previous two films, Whiplash and La La Land, there was an unavoidable sense of high expectation from me towards his latest film, First Man. One of mankind's greatest achievements gets the silver screen treatment and, with Chazelle at the helm, there was every chance it'd be out of this world.In 1969, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) became the first man to walk on the Moon. It's an iconic moment in history and Chazelle's film takes a look at both the life of Armstrong and the work that went into the dangerous mission, a number of years before it even happened.Damien Chazelle certainly has a sense of grandeur that can be found in all of his films, Whiplash having it in the phenomenal sequences of music and La La Land having it in spades serving as an ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals. When it comes to First Man, he achieves this with some quite stunning moments that places the central character, as well as the audience, amongst the stars. The space sequences are utterly breathtaking, Linus Sandgren's spacious cinematography and Tom Cross' editing capturing the wonder of such an achievement for mankind, the Moon landing sequence in IMAX up there as one of my favourites of the year.It's not just the visuals that work wonders in First Man either, the use of sound prominent once again in a Chazelle film. The sound department often go under the radar in a film's success however, Chazelle utilises them so well again in First Man that it's too hard to ignore the great work they carry out. Then there is the score from Justin Hurwitz, tense when needed but also balletic when we travelling through space.Josh Singer's screenplay does more than just tell the story of the Moon landing, it tells the story of a man driven by personal tragedy to succeed in his field and make this American dream become a reality. Singer's screenplay doesn't require a performance full of charisma and with Ryan Gosling as the lead, Chazelle's film is driven by a perfectly understated performance. Then there is Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife, Janet. Foy has made quite a name for herself as the Queen in The Crown and she doesn't do her growing reputation any harm here with a steely performance in First Man.It's a film that ultimately blew me away in the IMAX format and I'm sure I'll be as transfixed on repeat viewings. Damien Chazelle has earned a place as one of my favourite directors of all time in just three films and with First Man, it just further proves he has the filmmaking world at his feet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
They touched the moon but not our feelings !!!,"Actually I forced myself to rate this movie with 6, but I am not sure I may be unfare for the one's which really deserved 6. It looks like it should be 5.I think the problem is not with the actors, it is because of the director. In my opinion he wanted to emphasize the events rather than the feelings of the people. We cannot get any of the joy, sorrow, frustration that should have taken place after the success and failures all through the movie.The editing is really bad, conversations are unsatisfying. Although the movie is unnecessarily long, the feeling for the duration of their flight does not match with the scene that they have mentioned about the total time they are away from home. The vital needs of the crew is not given.If I were able to rate the movie in terms of

A healing journey through grief,"Damien Chazelle has created yet another masterpiece, only this time adding a new layer of emotional background and development to an otherwise well-known and reiterated story. I would like to try to be brief and avoid spoilers, therefore suffice it to say that, while yes, First Man is the story of a man, Neil Armstrong, and the way he made it to the moon over the previous years as well as the actual mission of Apollo 11, it is also a universal story that pretty much applies to all of mankind (to paraphrase his famous words).
A story that is universal in the way various perspectives are presented, in the way emotional (in)stability defines who you are, what you do, how you deal with your challenges, whether these are bringing up kids or actually landing a ship on the Moon. A story about grief, about expressing one's emotions, about shutting down and about healing and moving on.
At the end of the day, First Man is a point-of-view film. Even its camera angles highly emphasize this, escalating further and further as the film progresses, along with the emotional escalation that delivers jaw-dropping moments, both on Earth and in Space. Chazelle found a beautiful way to make technical aspects and choices a part of the narrative, that's not something you see every day. Can't wait for his next feature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Average movie execution of a legend's life.,"My Rating : 6/10This SHOULD have been SO much better.

Well Done but rather somber,"I think it played more like tragedy rather than triumph. I understand Neil Armstrong was a more introverted individual but I think they went overboard in this aspect of his portrayal. Kind of a downer movie overall for me.As a Space exploration enthusiast who actually saw many Apollo launches from Cape Kennedy and thoroughly enjoyed The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, First Man Seemed kind of dark and moody and emphasized the negatives much more than the positives about both his life as well as the space program.Technically speaking, the movie was produced at a very high level. I did however think the score seemed a little odd at times but the acting and other aspects of the film's production were good..In the long run I doubt this film will be re-run and sold on DVD to the level that the aforementioned space films have been as it seemed like to play like a smaller moody film about a hugely successful event.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Veronica Cartwright's performance as Betty Grissom in The Right Stuff effortlessly blows away all the domestic pseudo verite of this movie. I wanted to like this film, but it is disappointingly superfluous, adding nothing to the genre.

A great perspective,It's certainly different! From the perspective of the man himself. I enjoyed seeing something unlike any other movie. The acting is superb and you learn things never told anywhere else.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A disappointment,"It seems these days every great director wants to have a Kubrick moment. This usually translates to a space movie, and eventually to a couple of great cinematic moments of ultimate beauty, coupled with hallucinatory scenes where the viewer is lost in colors, visual effects and is meant to feel the ""grandeur of the last frontier"".
Unlike Nolan, Chazelle picks a different approach: in ""the first man"" he tries to tell the story of Neil Armstrong, whole combining it with his own 2001: A space Odyssey.
Though the movie is aptly shot, it is misdirected: it misses all the important moments of this man's life and accomplishments, replacing narrative cohesion with long takes, pace with artistic vision and, ultimately, life with art.
At the same time, the direction, music and editing, although undoubtedly the product of great artists, are also marked with bad choices: the overuse of the hand held camera drifts away from the goal of putting us ""in Armstrong's shoes"" and ends up not only destroying several scenes but also causing a certain dizziness. It also weakens the great cinematic moments of space travel, as the transition from constant camera movement to more camera movement seems only like natural progression.
Lastly, the closure ""mechanism"" chosen feels not only very mainstream but also somewhat unnecessary.
Overall, this is a long, somewhat slow, slightly incoherent, rather inconsistent movie that includes a few great moments and a few terrible ones.
But the great ones are real eye openers, so I would recommend that you watch it.
However, this is not as good as Chazelle's previous work.
It seems that good biopics have become a field of cinema where tv-quality direction and a straightforward script are overall more effective than the kind of cinema that Chazelle delivers.
I would rate it with a 7 because of the excellent performances, the wonderful music and those beautiful Kubrick moments.
However, 2.5 hours of hand held camera are a very poor choice, and equally poor was the omission to put this man's life in the proper historical, political and scientific context that he deserves.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Not an action movie. This is not a bad thing.,"From the tight POV of Neil Armstrong we experience the march to the moon. Despite the rah-rah we observers got from official news media, this movie focuses on the disorienting & often terrifying moments Armstrong endured during the run-up to the first moon landing.
This movie is about fear, persistence, the consequences of taking risks. To fault it for lack of thrills you had to have missed the very human drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This is why I go to the cinema,"An intense reflection on one man's journey to the moon. Existentialist, vertiginous, I felt like I was there with Armstrong in the rocket, looking down upon the earth. The shakiness served to simulate that environment.What makes a man fear nothing? What enables someone to go on a journey that may end in their own death?This is not one for space nerds, though it's definitely the most realistic, human portrayals of space travel. The nationalist rhetoric is set aside not for political reasons, but for a different focus. In the greater scheme of things, we will remember the journey to the moon not as an American accomplishment, but as mankind's--and an individual's--step into the unknown. Here Armstrong is not portrayed as a jock, as many would like to imagine hi, but as the intensely private, potentially emotional recluse he showed himself to be during his lifetime due to nature and circumstance.The soundtrack is beautiful. What is less human than the waltz, so alien in the moon landscape? Deserves the oscar for best picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

But it's a good movie...",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Better than I expected. Excellent film,"This was an EXCELLENT film. Disclaimer: Not everyone will feel this way about the movie. This isn't a ""Hollywood"" movie about Neil Armstrong. This isn't Apollo 13, or even The Right Stuff. The director chose to make a film that puts the viewer there, watching the story and events unfold as they were. The cinematographer did a wonderful job of recreating the authentic look and feel of the 60's. Much of the film was shot almost ""home movie"" style adding to the experience. If you grew up in the time period, you will really appreciate this. If you were fascinated by the early space program, you will like this. If not, maybe not so much, as it's a little technical and plodding. Again, this is a film about the story and events, and about the man. You are watching the events happen. That being said, it did give some nice insight into Armstrong, and his family life, and some events that helped shape the man. STELLAR cast, interesting music choices, not just a bunch of period songs thrown in to sell a soundtrack. Gosling deserves recognition for his performance. He embodied the man for this movie. My recommendation, if you enjoy good cinema, see it",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Original take on the space race and moon landing.,"The movie focuses on the sad and negative aspects of astronaut Neil Armstrongs life. I can not remember a single happy/fun moment in the entire film. It also lacks any kind of triumphant moments. Even the moon landing, and time directly after, is portrayed as a sad moments for Neil Armstrong.
Most factual things in the movie are accurate as far as I know, but they are cherry picked to display the most sad moments during the programme and in Neils life.This is very different from most other movies, and can be an interesting wath, as long as one is prepared to go away feeling a bit sad yourself.
However I am afraid that a 2+ hour long movie without a single positive moment can easily feel a bit dull, hence why I did not give it a higher score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Leave me on the moon,"Perhaps I'm just getting old but if you're going to make a movie based on a book, maybe read it first? This is without question one of the worst and most insulting movies ever produced about such an incredible story. As someone who witnessed the Apollo achievements firsthand, I was flabbergasted and infuriated at what I was watching. Is this what millennials think really happened? If so, future generations are doomed to a life of perpetual ignorance. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all cost and read the book instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The most tedious film I've seen in a while.,"When a film is not engaging me, I try to look for elements that I can underscore in order to find something of interest, or something I can highlight.
For this film, I had a very hard time doing that, because I felt it offered very little. The story, while a good one, felt dragged out a bit. The acting was lacklustre. I like Ryan Gosling but he was expressionless throughout the whole film. I couldn't capture any sort of emotion through his performance. And since we get to experience everything through his eyes as he is the sole focus, it completely diminishes the film in regards to its overall quality, its narrative, its pace and its emotional impact on the viewers, which it's real close to being none.The pace is too slow and unefficient, enough to make spectators repeatedly look at their watches, and so are the performances. They don't help at all. I'm sure we've all seen slow-paced films before but with such grand performances that could obviate that sense of tediousness.
I still think that La La Land is Chazelle's worst film, but First Man is second to that. He just wasn't able to recreate the success and unanimous praise he found with Whiplash.If I'm giving this a 6 rating, it's because of its technical aspects, which to me is the only part of this film that truly stands out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Dark Side of the Moon,"We have no idea what the Astronauts went through, but this film gives you first hand eye opening, riveting, heart stopping awareness of their experience.

The first lunar landing module looked like a lawn mower with long legs and wings and Neil rides it like a rodeo king. His goal/faith of someday of landing on the moon drives the entire film....Each actor must have been chosen with extreme care...They interpreted their characters honestly. Bordering on Documentary and Story telling one has a perspective of the Political and Human climate of those years.

Chazelle is at it again. Also please stop rating this a 1 if you haven't seen it.,"The cinematography could be best described as claustrophobic and it's the perfect way to convey this story. Damien Chazelle is something else. I rank this in between La La Land and Whiplash. It was phenomenal. Ryan Gosling managed to make a boring and the lowest of key hero seem so complex and compelling. I'm very glad I don't have to choose between him and Bradley Cooper, easily the two best male performances I've seen in a long time. Claire Foy..... this was the first work of hers I've seen and I understand why she's so beloved, an absolute talent. It was definitely a slow burn but that final act was probably the most beautifully intense finale I've ever seen. The entire film was just such a technical achievement. I have a weird feeling it's not going to get the full credit it deserves, but this is undeniably another masterpiece at the hand of Chazelle.

American Exceptionalism,"First Man is a compelling, emotional, riveting tale of how America, NASA, and a bunch of what would now be derided as 'privileged white men' created the singular event in human history: a human being on the moon.Neil Armstrong describing to the world, live on television and radio, that his was but one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.I would guess that practically everybody in the world, even now, knows what he said.Most have read of the controversy surrounding the conscious, politically motivated, decision to not show the American flag being planted on the moon by the Canadian (read citizen of the world) Director. But, as we saw this afternoon, there's now a lingering wide view of the LEM resting on the moon's surface with the newly planted American flag clearly in the picture...causing this viewer to wonder if it was newly planted 'post final cut' addition to stem the potential loss of audience the negative reaction that the omission caused?Otherwise, the movie is a rather straight forward, linear telling of how NASA's moon landing came to be: the barely mentioned Mercury program, followed by several two-man, Gemini launches to test the theoretical possibilities of using multiple vehicles requiring in-space rendezvous to make the mission viable with available technology. And, then, the audacious Apollo program which had to invent and test the largest rocket ever constructed to get humans to the moon and safely back...the gigantic, strangely beautiful, instantly recognizable, Saturn.Which had a test launch one night when I was home from college and lit up the Indian Harbour Beach sky like it was a man-made, sun. The rippling, guttural roar of the launch reaching us as the Saturn rose in a new day sky, shaking the windows of my parent's home, and pressing my shirt to my body, twenty miles from the Cape.In its retelling, First Man recounts the drama and tragedy of those years. Incidents now mostly forgotten: A T-38 crash that killed two of the Gemini astronauts during training; the disastrous fire that killed an entire Apollo crew while the capsule was being tested on the launch pad; the first attempt at a space rendezvous causing the Gemini capsule, piloted by Neil Armstrong, to careen out of control, tumbling wildly and dangerously, as the crew fought to stabilize it before they blacked out and the capsule was destroyed. Then, near the end of the movie, the mounting tension and drama played out live on television, as the LEM sought its landing location and not finding it until Neil Armstrong overrode the computers, taking manual control, and landing the LEM with no fuel remaining.Some of this, in First Man, is breathtaking. All of it is riveting.The human story that holds the movie together thankfully doesn't use the normal Hollywood stereotype of a complaining wife and a noble husband attempting to do heroic things. I wish that such unreal, unnatural, uninteresting, and demeaning depictions of women would be forever consigned to the dust heap of Hollywood tripe and a more natural male/female/husband/wife life become common in movies about uncommon people who do great things.Which happily and realistically occurs in First Man.A family tragedy becomes the moving subplot of this powerful recounting of one of the world's most historic events. Yet, even as a subplot, it is not a contrivance, and its emotional impact on the Armstrong's had me verklempt and more accepting of Neil Armstrong's almost off-putting stoicism in the face of all things. And, makes Ryan Gosling's laconic, strong, and silent portrayal convincing. Indeed, at some point in the movie, he becomes Neil Armstrong, something, I would guess, all actors act to achieve.First Man shows the astronauts and their families as human beings. Extraordinary, but recognizable human beings. Men, women and children, all with hopes and fears and frailties. All displaying courage, humanity, skill, and drive. Watching them, I thought of the children and families I grew up around on Army posts around the world. They were like the people in this movie. All of us are. We're Americans.The movie, though directed by a Canadian, and starring a Canadian, despite the kerfuffle about the flag, is a love story about what the meritocracy that is America can do, what humankind is capable of.John Kennedy promised that America would put a man on the moon within the decade.We did it in less than seven years.Fifty years on, it remains a universally shared example of human accomplishment.I watched the second moon landing in a bar in Athens...the Greek crowd cheered, pounded us on our backs in joy, wept and bought us glass after glass of retsina.We drank to America, to Greece, to Mickey Mouse, to John Wayne, to the world.First Man will remind you of those times, and make you hope for more like them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Good attention to small details that you don't necessarily think about when it comes to spaceflight. Sound, 1st person view shots and overall tension makes this movie a great watch, especially if you have an interest in the subject. A great addition to The Right Stuff.

Chazele does justice to the legend of Neil Armstrong,"Damien Chazele's follow up to his big film La La Land is a biography on one of the bona fide heroes of American culture-scape Neil Armstrong. Collaborating once again with Chazele is Ryan Gosling who plays the main lead. The film is good although expecting a straight forward larger than life biopic the kind Hollywood is known for is not what this film is. This is a personal take on the nature and character of a public figure who hated the attention and adulation. The scenes with Armstrong's family gives us an inside look at the legendary man's state of mind both before and after launching. Of course, the actual mission is given weight and some scenes are bound to bring goosebumps to space aficionados. I was impressed with this film even though there aren't many uplifting, resounding scenes and the pacing is more of a gentle flow than a typical three act script structure.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Effectively Captures the Essence of the 60's Space Program,"I liked it. But that's the thing, I only liked it. It wasn't a masterpiece or an extraordinary film. Some parts of the movie were unfathomably beautiful, whilst other parts had me bobbing my head prying my eyelids open. The movie balances many odd dichotomies of character, heavily influencing my review:IMAX is absolutely stunning, but only in the last 15 minutes of the film and dizzying the rest of the film.Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy well demonstrated N. Armstrong's family dynamic, but they didn't complement each other's acting ability.Damien Chazelle's vision to capture the feeling of the 60's with a grainy film texture is wonderful, yet lead to many out of focus and gross looking shots.The soundtrack was written poorly for an Apollo Space Program biopic, but on it's own accord was marvelous (sorry Justin Hurwitz).The cinematography and shot placement choices for a certain buildup scene were jaw-dropping, but the pacing and sound effects were lacking.All in all, First Man wasn't disappointing, but the many months of my over-excitement and impatience lead to a dissatisfied movie experience.6.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Could have been much better but sound/music was horrible,"The acting in the film was undeniably fantastic, with performances that brought depth and believability to the characters. There was some impressive cinematography that showcased creativity and an artistic approach. However, the heavy reliance on extreme close-ups and ultra-wide shots often detracted from the viewing experience, making it difficult to fully grasp what was happening onscreen. These choices may have been budget-driven, given the cost of elaborate sets, but they felt overused and at times disorienting for the audience. Despite the film's strong start, the storytelling faltered in the final act. The pacing became rushed, rushing the end of the mission and the entire approach back to Earth and landing.One of the movie's most glaring issues was its sound design and score, which could arguably be considered among the worst in decades. The music, instead of enhancing the scenes, was overwhelmingly loud and ill-suited to many of the emotional beats, particularly during the pivotal lunar landing sequence. What should have been the most touching and awe-inspiring moment in the film was marred by a combination of overbearing music, muffled dialogue due to ""helmet talk,"" and the actors' mumbling. This lack of balance in the audio made a critical moment frustrating rather than poignant, a misstep that lingered in the mind long after the credits rolled. Furthermore, the musical score seemed completely mismatched with the tone of the second half of the film, creating a sense of dissonance that pulled audiences out of the experience. While the movie had its strengths, the technical and storytelling flaws ultimately overshadowed its potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

But this movie puts the story of man going to the moon in another perspective.It's Neil Armstrong's experience of it, not as the flight nut he certainly was, but the father and man that a terrible gauntlet of loss and grief could have made him. And yet he finds catharsis and in a way, it's an important part of the miraculous achievement of these explorers who risked it all.It's Neil that has the right perspective, both of the importance of the mission, as of the dreadful cost to the people involved. Meanwhile, the world isn't exactly waiting breathlessly for the US to pull off its trick - there is opposition, competition and doubt. But when the moment is there, it is transformative.

In the movie, however LEM interior (even before landing on moon surface) has Millenium Falcon feel - tou can exactly see that some switches look like used/old or dirty. Huge mistake.

First Man - Cinema with CJ Review,"First Man reminds us how goddamn scary space travel is and that sheer bravery and heroism that fuels the impossible being possible.Damien Chazelle continues to be a director I very much have excitement for. From the universally acclaimed Whiplash to the divisive La La Land (I love it), Chazelle has put together a completely different beast. Music isn't the through-line for once - though don't think that means that Justin Hurwitz once again knocks it out of the park - but instead it's the claustrophobic, captivating journey and motivation of Neil Armstrong towards the one thing the world knows him for.Starting almost a decade prior to the event, whether you know the history or not, First Man highlights it's the work of many brave people and sharp minds to put man on the moon, and the cost therein. Film tends to paint a pretty picture of astronauts (unless things go wrong), but even when things are going right you're thrown into extreme closeups of men packed like sardines thrown about by the threat of burning rockets and technical hitches and sound design that keeps you rattled alongside them.In fact, the sound design is so on point, there's a particular moment that took my breath away. For best effect, go out and watch this movie in IMAX. You'll see what I'm talking about. Once again with space on film, bigger is better. So don't wait until you can see it at home or on the phone or heaven forbid, a boring-ass airplane.First Man is damn fine filmmaking, even if it does strip the glamour from it. Gosling powers through with a solid cast as Armstrong, and the film faults only really with some second and third act pacing (which is initially perfect) and how the breathtaking and powerful moments are few and far between. But maybe that's just because we know how it ends, and it costs a lot to get to that money shot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

""gush, what a shame"". A shame not for the fact that ""La la land"" did not win but for the entire Oscar thing and what it means. And it means a lot for many people. Moonlight was a great winner. Well... Damian had that face that says ""this is not happening"" as in a trauma thing. And indeed it would've been a trauma for anyone. A complete nightmare. Even so, I think the guys did manage to act as normal as possible. 
And now ""First man"" - Neil as a human. An extraterrestrial human. A lot of moments where feelings are trying to come to life but very few manage to reach a certain degree of life. And having children dying in a story would make anyone have some feelings - Damian thought of this. Of course. But I am talking about the other ones, not the obvious ones. And with this Nail fails to make me follow him in his trying to get on the moon. I was astonished by the amount of information that should've come to me as a viewer (to help me remain with the story)... did not do that in the end. In this regards, I felt that Damian is trying to defend a lie that he (himself) didn't find the strength to believe in. Or couldn't find it. I have a feeling many scenes were cut at the editing table. 
If the president of America can talk about an important moment in the movie and not realizing that he is not doing any favor for the movie then I can talk about it here as well: the flag moment. Or the absence of it. Having saying things about not having the strength to believe in a lie... the flag proves it clearly that... Damian couldn't defend himself from looking ridiculous in front of the people that understand what a possible truth means, if he would've inserted the moment. And there are many people like this out there - Americans or non-Americans. The presence of the absence of a moment like this made him credible in his trying to truly be sincere to his way of saying a story - the documentary style that he chose for the movie. But they made it clear when asked by the media what is the directorial reason behind the absence of a moment like it and the answer was more than reasonable - ""Armstrong did not say '....a giant leap for America'"" He said indeed humanity. And humanity it was indeed: the entire world was watching the way America was becoming great! 
So what is about this movie about the ""First man"" on the moon? Felt like I am watching lots of documentary stile shots, where a man doesn't have to try to look human at all because he is human by default. It's not the fact that I can't believe in the movie out of disrespect of what America became with Trump in office (and I am not saying Trump who is a Republican, I am saying Trump as someone who doesn't have the slightest idea how much harm he can do saying stuff that can hurt people and make people lose hope), I am not saying it from the angle of a reasonable human being that finds hard to believe we never been to the moon (it's not my job to question the reason of such a big lie[tho, the republicans that will read this will find hard to believe me not because they CAN'T but because they don't WANT)... I am saying it from the angle of a man who thinks Damian lost his genius, having as proof everything that happends on the screen, because of a moment like the Oscar moment. Not because he didn't win. But because the moment happened. That very wrong moment of two old people that couldn't understand how to read a piece of paper. 
Great acting, would've expect more from Hollywood in terms of music (especially for the fact that Spielberg is executive for this one), wanna-be-strong script. I am giving 7 stats out of respect for Damian.
I will continue to follow this great filmmaker in search of all the great emotions he brought doing Whiplash and of course... La la land. This means I will buy next time a cinema ticket as well. And yes. I went to see this movie in the cinema out of respect for Damian and his previous work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A personal, gripping, and realistic look at what got us to the moon.","I'll admit: I'm already a fan of Damien Chazelle. I'm not sure if it's because he's only a few months older than I am, or if it's how I can personally relate to the subjects of his films. I understand the obsession he covered in Whiplash (2014). I can relate to the dreams of creative individuals he brought to light in La La Land (2016). Now, Chazelle has used his filmmaking talent to cover another topic I have a great interest in: space. First Man (2018) feels like a film that's been waiting for the right director to come along, and Damien Chazelle hit it out of the park.Lying somewhere between The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), with a little bit of Interstellar (2014) thrown in as well for style, First Man does a fantastic job of showing how dangerous the missions that landed us on the moon really were. There seemed to be an adherence to realism in this film that helped to convey how claustrophobic, terrifying, and risky these few dozen missions were. The fact that we even successfully pulled off the ""moon shot"" is a testament to the engineers that made the program succeed.While the segments set in outer space help to define the film's three-act structure, following Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) from test pilot to Gemini VIII to Apollo 11, they are the breathtaking set pieces that give this movie its strength. Consequently, some of the moments on the ground seemed a little slow in comparison. Granted, these moments felt quite intimate as the audience is shown how private and introverted Armstrong was and how he dealt with the stress of work and family. After all, I think we often forget how the multiple deaths of astronaut co-workers can affect the rest of the team and their families.A personal, gripping, and realistic look at what got us to the moon, I give First Man 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not Bad, But Not Great","This is the type of subject I like for a movie. I really liked The Right Stuff. Same with Apollo 13. I've watched The Martian three times. You get the idea. I thought First Man was a cut below any of those I just named. A BIG cut, truth be known. First Man was a little slower moving but my biggest problem was the photography. The camera wobbled around all the way through the movie. There were close-ups that would have been better filmed from 10 feet away, 10 feet away with a steadier camera. Truth is, I am right now about 15 minutes from the end of the film, but I paused it because I had become sufficiently annoyed that to let off a little steam, I needed to write a critical review. You're reading it. Anyway, I'm done writing. I feel better now. I'll probably even go back and watch the movie to its conclusion... probably.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

First Man (2018),"Let's face it, Damien Chazelle is probably one of the best directors going around today. Add the fact that he is still really young as well as a filmmaker. Whiplash is absolutely excellent, and La La Land was an incredible musical. Thus naturally, First Man was a really anticipated film for me and add to that the fact that Ryan Gosling would be portraying Neil Armstrong. This just seemed like it would be an amazing feature, so naturally I wanted to catch this one in IMAX. I think the film is good technically, for its performances and content, and for the portrayal of the moon landing. However, the films length and pacing were problematic for me.The film is about the life of Neil Armstrong, the famed astronaut who became the first man to land on the moon in 1969. The film covers other preceding portions of Armstrong's life, including the loss of his young daughter, his relationship with his family, his early work and training with NASA, his general mindset and personality, and all the events going on leading up to his eventual moon landing. The film also stars Claire Foy as his wife, Kyle Chandler, and Jason Clarke.I felt like the pacing and length of the film were the real problems with the film. its a good film technically and hardly puts a foot wrong but its a slow build and takes its time to get to the Moon landing. Gosling plays his usual quiet natured sulky lead, I'm not sure if this was an accurate portrayal of how Armstrong was but I had no problem with it. The performances were good otherwise. The leads may not get end of the year nominations or wins but I think they did a very respectful job in their roles. I expect the film to get its technical nominations as its sound design and cinematography are as good as can be.The film has all the ingredients to make it great but doesn't connect with me quite like Chazelle's other works in Whiplash and La La Land. It doesn't have that emotional connectivity like those works did, much like Neil's emotional block with his wife and kids. Its worth a watch to see the incredible moon landing experience and learn about the life about an American pioneer otherwise. Its a film that's steeped in tragedy and loss and great wonder and achievement.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Too long and boring,"Gosling was terrible in his wooden acting. The director did a poor job in filming the flight scenes, all from the cockpit where you couldn't see what was going on.

Loved it to the moon and back!,"First Man: This movie was a masterpiece. It was beautifully written and executed. Damien Chazelle is killing it when it comes to directing these outstanding films. It's scientifically accurate, it could even be a documentary. Ryan Gosling truly captures Neil Armstrong's personality and demeanor. The whole movie is full of detail, you feel as though you're sitting in the cockpit yourself. The only complaint I have was the chemistry between Gosling and Claire Foy. Although, both of their performances were outstanding, I just didn't buy into their relationship in the movie. I highly recommend this fascinating story. One could even say it's OUT OF THIS WORLD (I had to !).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ok but that's about it,"Firstly I can see why Gosling was chosen for the role, after reading about Armstrong and seeing interviews or programs with him in he, like Gosling, had basically one expression. Gosling has one expression in every single role he plays, and although I personally dont rate his acting skills this is the type of role he can excel in.
The film is not anything like Apollo 13 and is in some ways more like a dramatised documentary in some ways than a film.
Visuals are good and shows a more grittier form of reality than, again, Apollo 13. My main gripe, other than Gosling, is the score which is at times good but others is very bizarre with strange seemingly unrelated noises occurring.
Worth a watch if you have an interest in the space race but don't think it's a some sort of action drama",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A stunning cinematic feat that is both intimate and grand,"His only 33 years of age but there's now further proof that Oscar winning director Damien Chazelle is one of the most competent, original and talented filmmaker's working today.Chazelle's third feature film First Man is a visually stunning, emotionally powerful and genuinely unique biopic, that coming hot off the heels of box office sensation La La Land and critical darling Whiplash, proves the director's skill as a visionary, a game breaker and a wonderful storyteller.Using the true life tale of renowned astronaut Neil Armstrong and America's quest to be the first nation to successfully explore the moon, Chazelle does what many would never have expected from a bio about such a pivotal moment and makes a film that's both humanly intimate and emotionally grand, as he turns his attention to the little things as well as the big, that in turn make First Man a more enthralling and white knuckle experience because of it.Not to be found here is any American grandstanding, no Oscar baiting speeches and no bio by the numbers plotlines as Chazelle instead brings us into the cockpit, the visor and home life of Armstrong that strips back the grand tale to something just as powerful as we become a fly on the wall of Armstrong's life and death defying missions.It's not to say there's not cinematic flourishes here as First Man features some of the year's most exciting and breathtaking feats of cinema delivered through a heart racing opening, a hold your breath docking test in the heart of space and of course the intense and captivating Apollo mission, all of which showcase Chazelle's abundant ability that works wonders alongside Linus Sandgren's virtuoso yet often gritty cinematography and regular Chazelle collaborator and composer Justin Hurwitz, who crafts a haunting and awards worthy score to compliment what's occurring on screen.Seeing these scenes on a large scale format such as IMAX or a sound-rich environment is a pure cinematic treat and by the time Chazelle arrives at the moon and the audience sits in silence, immersed and captivated by the gravitas and artistic brilliance on display, you understand that what you're apart of as an audience member is one of those rare movie going experiences that becomes something more than just entertainment, this is something truly special and an experience you won't soon forget.With no much craft and technical mastery it could be argued that many of the performances in the film feel like more nice additions than anything truly of note but the stoic presence of Gosling as Armstrong and the fine support of Claire Foy as Armstrong's faithful wife Janet are exactly what the film needed, with both performers operating at the top of their game, complimenting everything else perfectly to ensure First Man's overall accomplishments are all-round.Final Say -Some may be disappointed to find out that a film about Armstrong and the moon landing is a more intimate affair but seeing First Man on the biggest screen available is a transformative cinematic experience, as Chazelle's stunning cinematic spectacle is a grand and unforgettable example of movie magic.5 bracelets out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"The lead character is NOT interesting and Gosling's acting performance (as usual) is wooden, making this movie rather tedious to watch. Lacking in any new viewpoints.","Armstrong was simply not an interesting guy. Focussing an entire movie around his character WILL cause A problem:boredom. If one were to TRY to make such an introvert, flat character like Armstrong interesting one would need a much more subtle actor AND a more interesting screenplay. First Man is basically Gosling trying to do his thing, resulting in nothing much more than a barely acceptable (wooden) acting performance. Barely acceptable...It looks reasonably pretty, but not in such a way that I would advice anyone to go see it. I constantly was reminded of seeing ""Gravity"", when I watched this movie. Because ""Gravity"" truly was IMPRESSIVE to look at, while this movie simply seems to piggyback on those same impressive space photography looks and failing at it. Trying to copy someone else's brilliant photography style often merely results in disappointment. Even the music score reminded me in parts of the same score in ""Gravity"". Watch the brilliant ""Gravity"" instead of this Ryan Gosling humdrum, that would be my advice.This movie is definitely lacking in punch and spirit.

Better upon 2nd viewing,"I wasn't impressed by the movie initially. But I have it another chance and really enjoyed it. One must set aside the typical comments to realize that this was a story about men leaving Earth and setting foot on another celestial body for the first time in human history. This was an extraordinary accomplishment and remains just as incredible to this day. I was engaged not so much by Ryan Goesseling and the other actors as I was the thought that these individuals were part of human experience that transcends the ordinary. I was deeply moved by Armstrong's love for his daughter Karen. Whether he actually left her tiny bracelet on the Moon will never be known for sure but, like Charlie Duke's family picture he left on the lunar surface, it emphasizes his real and how human the astronauts were and are. Hansen's book is the definitive Armstrong biography and while lengthy, gives the reader a complete insight into who Armstrong, the man, was.You should watch the excellent documentary, ""Apollo 11,"" as a companion piece to "" First Man.

Space is cool...,"...there's just no way in getting around it. By rights no film about space expiration should ever be anything other than spectacular. This begins with a stellar opening scene and the story arc flows pretty well from there. True it's a bit by the numbers, with a solid dose of Hollywood tropes, but it's gripping and fun. Much more Apollo 13, than 2001, it's a biopic with the drama ramped up and stylised for a mass audience. Ryan Gosling does what he does best, zero emotion and to the film's credit, it's dirtier, more raw than the aforementioned Tom Hanks yeehaw America is great advert. It's not super in depth, but the loss of life in the space program is front and centre and this does give it a more realistic edge. The best thing though is the sound design. Not to take anything away from the lovingly recreated grim reality of 60s space travel, but there's a subtlety in the sound work that lifts this just that bit higher.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An excellent balance of humanity,"A frank, pull-no-punches look at the personal and professional life of the failed test pilot and famed astronaut, Neil Armstrong. His is a tale of grand success and global recognition, of course, but also one of frequent, intense tribulation. From routine near-death experiences at the office to a mortally sick young daughter at home, Neil's life seems like a constant source of tension and immense emotional pressure. A quiet, reserved man, he internalizes most of that pain, but it's still evident. Ryan Gosling does a remarkable job at conveying this inner trauma, roiling behind a stoney poker face and a collected physical presence, and the film backs him up by presenting several situations in which that strict sense of cool personal composition literally saves his life. First Man spends a lot of time gazing inwardly, but that's balanced by a series of riveting, high-pressure scenes inside the cockpit. These are utterly insane; barely-contained chaos set to the tune of a constant, deafening roar, all kept in check via a series of well-timed switch flips and a whole lot of white-knuckled prayers. Space movies need never want for great action scenes, particularly when they're inspecting this particular age of DIY floundering, and this one provides yet another impressive step forward in that department. An excellent balance of humanity, practical science and death-defying physical risk-taking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
quietly heroic,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" Every junior high student learns that Neil Armstrong spoke those words when he became the first person to walk on the moon's surface in 1969. So while his words are etched into our minds and the televised visuals of the historic event are seared into our corneas, most of us know little of the man who is renowned as an American hero. Director Damien Chazelle (LA LA LAND, WHIPLASH) finds a way to personalize a man's story without sacrificing the corresponding grandiose theatre and immense danger.Kicking off with one of the most intense cinematic sequences ever, the film puts us inside the LLRV (Lunar Landing Research Vehicle) with Armstrong in 1961 as he bounces off the atmosphere and rockets towards near certain death. This opening makes the statement that this is no ordinary man, and this is no ordinary movie ... and we are now prepared to hold on tight! Based on James R Hansen's book, the only biography Armstrong authorized, the script from Oscar winner Josh Singer (SPOTLIGHT) expertly balances the test pilot/astronaut portion with the character study/personality of the man.Intensity is on display throughout - whether in a capsule or during family time.
Ryan Gosling stars as Neil Armstrong, and the story tracks him from 1961 through that famous moment in 1969. What we see is a man who was first an engineer, and then a pilot. A man whose intellect and nerve allowed him to be part of the second group of pilots selected for NASA's astronaut program in 1962. The first group was the Mercury Seven. He was also a man emotionally devastated by the death of his young daughter Karen (from a brain tumor) and the numerous deaths of friends and associates in the space program. The film clearly shows how he was impacted.Proving true JFK's proclamation that the driving force wasn't that it was easy, but rather that it was quite hard (and dangerous), we glimpse some of the inner workings of NASA, and what becomes clear that the space program was high stakes gambling filled with huge risks - all for a space race against the Russians that was motivated by ego and national pride. Daily danger was part of the job, as was the claustrophobia that comes with sitting in tin can space capsules being monitored by computers far less powerful than the cell phone you are likely using to read this. Armstrong's claustrophobia somehow seemed less apparent during his flights than during press conferences or sitting at the kitchen table with his family - providing even more insight into the man.Claire Foy (""The Crown"") plays Janet Armstrong, the strong-for-the-kids while suffering-in- (mostly) silence homemaker wife. Ms. Foy does a nice job of conveying the emotional turmoil that goes with being an astronaut's wife, and having no one to share the uncertainty and worry with. Jason Clarke plays Ed White, the first American to walk in space (Gemini 4) and Armstrong's neighbor and close friend. Olivia Hamilton plays his wife Janet, while Kyle Chandler plays Deke Slayton, and Corey Stoll offers up a not so complimentary portrayal of Buzz Aldrin. Other familiar faces in the cast include Shea Whigham as Gus Grissom, Christopher Abbott as Dave Scott, Pablo Schreiber as Jim Lovell (played by Tom Hanks in APOLLO 13), Ethan Embry, Ciaran Hinds, Patrick Fugit, Lukas Haas, Cory Michael Smith, Brian D'Arcy James, and Leon Bridges.Meticulous attention to details of the era include kids that actually ask to go play outdoors (and aren't overly impressed with astronaut dads). The sound design and set designs are phenomenal and complement the outstanding cinematography of Linus Sandgren (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND). The abundance of close-ups allow for an intimacy that makes the awe-inspiring space sequences even more breath-taking. Actual historic space audio is used whenever possible, and director Chazelle doesn't shy away from showing us the ""other side"" of the space program: Gil Scott-Heron's ""Whitey's on the Moon"", writer Kurt Vonnegut publically questioning the program, and many citizens wondering why so much money is being spent on rockets while there were so many other areas (including Vietnam) in need of attention.The humor is often quite sly, including a scene where his competitive applicants shrug off Armstrong as only a ""Civilian"", unaware of his remarkable service and record in the Korean War as a Navy Fighter Pilot. Gosling's quietly intense portrayal of Armstrong could be termed constrained, but it's quite fitting given his subject. Composer Justin Hurwitz (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND) delivers and unusual but fitting score, and we can't help but realize this would make a terrific trilogy bookended by THE RIGHT STUFF (1983) and APOLLO 13 (1995). Chazelle presents a fitting bio of a true American hero (and yes, we can see the flag on the moon), while also giving us a look at the harrowing process of putting folks into space. It's on us to decide if it's worth it, but leaves no doubt that President Kennedy was right ... it is hard.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good ending doesn't always mean good movie,"Ryan Gosling is back! Fresh off of his great success last year with La La Land. Gosling came back with the same partnership in Damien Chazelle and delivered once again. Showing just how a great actor and director can produce many different kinds of movies if made correctly. Now was it perfect? Not at all, but it was one of the best performances, so far this year.
Showing a true story of a man that many knew at one time, but by now most have forgotten. Gosling embodied the weird, nerdy, and sometimes day-dreaming Armstrong with great success. He showed off on the screen infront of us. He can do it all. Serious. Sad. Passionate. Action.
Now this movie was more than just Gosling. It featured other heavy hitters in Claire Foy and Jason Clarke as well as Kyle Chandler.

In space you can't escape to hear an audience member snore. Even if it's a good film,"Talk about an inpatient crowd at the cinema. I heard snoring, people moving around, feet stomping on the floor and even saw some walk-outs. The guy on the row in front of me kept re-arranging how he was sitting. He was either unsure whether to put his feet up on the chair infront of him or to tap his fingers constantly as if he was listening to music the entire time. It's annoying to see crowds like this, especially when you get a slower moving dramatic film. Regardless of the distractions, I liked ""First Man"". A complaint I've seen is that the plot gets un-engaging by the middle act. And I can see what they are talking about, but it didn't bother me. It's a realistic approach. Ryan Gosling as Armstrong will of course be a quieter performance. He's got subtlety. Sadness is seen in his eyes and whenever Armstrong would show more emotion it landed a bigger mark in the story.It doesn't move very fast. Chazelle decides to spend a lot of time with the characters on the ground. They're at a house, conversing calmly and then occasionally you go back to Nasa's space research. So that's the aspect I can see not working so well on repeat viewings. People will probably wanna fast-forward to a training scene with the ships. It's shot on film which I adored. Although I would have preferred to skip the documentary like camerawork. It got shaky in a way that's not my taste. All the pictures in space or in the ships are stellar though. Claire Foy is here too and I remember that she was brilliant in ""Unsane"". I was hoping to not get distracted and see too many elements of her character from that film. But I ended up being surprised as she delivered a different performance to Gosling. They balance each other out. He keeps the emotions hidden, while she puts them front and center. The stand-out aspect is when she insists that Armstrong has to talk to their sons before he leaves to space. It's a difficult situation which makes you think. What would you say? Anything can go wrong considering it's a mission that's never been done before.Landing on the Moon was a giant leap for all of mankind, and this story makes you understand the hardships that go into achieving such a goal. It's a drama that tells the story of this man. The Nasa and Moon landing plots are integral, but remember that it's gonna be from the point of view of this character. Not a thrilling ride into space, but a nice film about one guy's journey which left a place in history. Not bad. Loved the opening scene which was riveting and the actual landing sequence makes you hold your breath. The biggest negative is that as soon as there's no sound in space, I only hear the snoring man (from two rows back) louder and clearer.

Technically marvelous,"So Damien Chazelle had Ryan Gosling dance amongst the stars in La La Land. What higher place is there to reach next but the Moon.Gosling is first man Neil Armstrong, a pilot picked for the Apollo 11 mission that had it's fair share of hiccups as well as triumphs.The movie itself is made up of mostly those tests- watching the pilots as they rattle and spin in high speed simulations and practice pod launches, sometimes at the mercy of technical equipment that does not hold up.To it's credit there is a dizzying effect here. I haven't felt this nauseous in a movie since Peter Berg's Mile 22, though here the effect makes way more sense.When the pilots wind up puking you understand where they're coming from and you have a new respect for their calm as well as ability to even remain conscious.By far Chazelle's best feat is the moon landing itself, something as nerve racking as everything else in the film but also done with meticulous detail and moments so triumphant it almost feels like you're watching them in slo-mo. I could not look away.There are references to the space race and to American Patriotism, it doesn't change the fact that they kind dropped the ball the iconic image of planting the flag on the moon. To me it kinda felt like following your favorite sports team only to see them not hoist a trophy.It's also hard to gauge the public's interest in all this. Chazelle briefly looks at that but mostly seems to make us think there were far greater interests in Vietnam and Civil Rights.Later, the public seems to can't get enough of it though. It's a movie that feels very verbatim about the mission, sometimes to the film's detriment.Gosling is very good here though. It's not a very showy performance, Armstrong was in actuality a very stable ordinary man, emotionally distant, but humble and loving in his own way.One thing the film does really well is show the amount of deaths he actually endured and the quiet, secret suffering he went through during those periods.Claire Foy is great here too as his wife, the only person who seems even moderately interested in asking the tough questions, like what if the mission completely goes to crap.And we don't get much of the relationship between Armstrong and Corey Stoll's Buzz Aldrin but what we do seems as stand-offish as what we've heard.Overall First Man is a chronicle. That means it can feel long, it can feel too concerned with the facts, but technically as well as performance wise, this hits on the trials and successes of space exploration really well.If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Is this really the biography film about the ""First Man"". Big dissapointment","Won't say much about the film cause I love Chazelle's work. The movie is confusing with unimportant details and scenes from his life, the thrilling factor the story should have been based on was almost zero in the film even when it came to the event of landing on the moon that the whole movie was setting up to was completely boring. I felt sleepy during the film and continued it only to see the ending to be disappointed. Good VFX and cinematography. Average direction by Chazelle trying to make masterpiece scenes and making a show in space. The music written for the film didn't suit the scenes and despite being good. Claire's character from the weakness points of the film along with several plots about Neil's life and his struggling with incidents that I didn't understand how It affected him while the story was jumping suddenly to different time of the story. Neil performed by Ryan was soooooo normal and didn't find anything attractive in the character or didn't get to me at all even his reaction but for the opening scene with his daughter issue. very boring and would rather not to see it again considering it one of the weakest biography films I have ever scene which should have become from the best. 5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What a ride!,"Loved this movie. From the nail-biting opening test flight sequence to the triumphant denouement, I was enthralled. While I imagine some artistic license was taken with a few of the Apollo mission's back room details, the movie provided an absorbing insight into why it was so important (spoiler alert - to get one up on the Russians); and how the focus and commitment of the astronauts affected their families. The film was long but felt short. The photography was breathtaking. The flight sequences tense and believable. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy were amazing together. 
Go see this and get a different slant on an event that changed the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

'It'll be an adventure',"One of the most memorable quotes in the past hundred years is the familiar 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' - the words we all heard when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. James' R. Hansen's book has been adapted for the screen by Josh Singer and the film is directed by Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash).The film covers the years 1961 - 1969 in the life of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), beginning with Armstrong's trials as a pilot and proceeds through his training for the Gemini mission and the famous moon landing. Along the way the psyche of the astronaut is explored by revealing his interactions with his wife Janet (Claire Foy) and terminally ill daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford), his friend and fellow astronaut Ed White (Jason Clarke) and his wife Pat (Olivia Hamilton) whose lives alter Neil's perception of his mission. Nods are given to Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and other very small cameos.Much of the film is very loud, with all the harrowing tension that accompanies the launching and flight of spacecraft extended to near the breaking point. The facts are there but what is missing is a storyline that allows the audience to accompany Armstrong's historic mission. It is a noisy adventure with rather flat performances by the main characters, but it does encourage recall of that momentous day in 1969 with reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Chazelle could be heading for his second Oscar,"In the opening moments of Damien Chazelle's new movie ""First Man"" we encounter Neil Armstrong on the periphery of space in a rocket that isn't doing what it's supposed to be doing. It's a terrific scene, genuinelly frightening, (even if we know Mr Armstrong is going to come out of it in one piece), shot up close and personal and superbly edited and directed by young Chazelle, (he's the youngest person ever to win the Oscar for Best Director). That's just the beginning of this brilliant film about the Gemini and Appolo Missions that saw Neil Armstrong become the first man to walk on the moon and there are several other heart-stopping moments to follow. This is the most authentic looking of all the manned space mission movies to date and Chazelle films it as if it were a documentary, which isn't to say he ignores the human side.Armstrong is played by that most taciturn of actors, Ryan Gosling, and here the silences, the 'meaningful' stares really work for him. A lot of the time Chazelle chooses to shoot him in close-up and in Gosling's face we can read everything the man is feeling. He is matched by the much more pragmatic performance of Claire Foy as his wife. There is also not a jot of sentimentality on display despite there being every opportunity to milk it, (early on Armstrong's young daughter dies, several of his colleagues are killed and then, of course, there is the triumphalism of the ending). Instead Chazelle gives us a level-headed view of those years, even going so far as to paint Buzz Aldrin as a somewhat vain individual and including, at one stage, the protest number 'Whitney on the Moon'. The quietude of the ending is also deeply affecting and if Chazelle were to win his second Oscar for this I certainly won't be complaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good, interesting but more for the history channel rather than the cinema","REVIEW - FIRST MANSince the moon landing there has been a lot of speculation if it actually happened or if it was staged.In essence this film tells the story of Neil Armstrong, through the process to become the first man on the moon.Regardless of what you believe to be true, if we did actually land on the moon or not, even if it were staged in the 60s this would have still been an achievement.The film itself is interesting in a historical perspective but for a box office hit it's, well boring and slow in places, but don't forget this is based on real events and isn't a made up fictional story.Because it's a real history film it's nice to see what happened but we've seen the moon landing before so feels it's just showing again what we already have seen before.If you're into the subject and like you're history then this is a must watch but if you're wanting to go to the cinema to be thrilled then give this one a miss.Good, interesting but more for the history channel rather than the cinema.Rating 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What happened!!!!!!!!!! No American Flag?????????,"I enjoyed the show until the end when I realized they had not placed an American flag on Moon's soil. I only gave it 6 stars because of that.

Ryan Gossling Dazzles on the Big Screen!!,"'Standing on the moon with nothing left to do. A lovely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you.'Since the dawn of man, we've gazed upon the moon with a curious existential wonder. But what if you were to look back upon the earth from the surface of the moon? Amidst the vast black canvas of space, you'd see a blue, green, and brown heavenly body with white swooshed across by the very hand of God. A transcendent awe inspired moment with a view of our fragile home embodying everything that ever was, is, and that will be. Leaving the chains of gravity and setting foot on the moon is (wo)mankind's best accomplishment, but the realization of what we left behind, is the true essence of the human condition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Welldone bipic,"All the main events of the Gemini and Apollo programs are (or should be) well know. We know how the story unfolded. What we don't know is how it was ived by the people who made it happen. This movie shows us that.
Armstrong was apparently one of those close-mouthed types unable to show grief or other ""weak"" emotions. But it's OK to show elation at winning, in his case by succeeding at difficult and very dangerous tasks. Armstrong's daughter died of a brain tumour. Anyone who's lost a child can identify with his grief, and anyone who's lost someone close knows that grief strikes repeatedly and without warning. The movie is based on a bio by James Hansen. I don't know how true to life Hansen' book is, but the movie convinced me. It's an odd thing, that although the moon program happened in the 1960s, the NASA world was firmly stuck in the 1950s.
So the movie's a good psycho-sociological study of NASA and the men who had the right stuff. It's also a hymn to work. The core of the story is the work of getting to the moon, and the personal and community sacrifices that this task entailed. I recall watching the landing on a large TV screen in the dorm in which I was staying while taking a summer course. But I didn't recall much of that while watching this movie. It was all about Armstrong, the NASA team, the moon shot, and the families. The music was occasionally intrusive, and some scenes teetered on the edge of sentimentality. The launches were impressively noisy and jittery: the astronauts are flying on top of a slowly exploding bomb. A movie worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A different approach!,"I like that Chazelle opted for a character-driven tale rather than moulding it like any other typical space exploration feature we have seen in contemporary times.Presentations like these, more often than not, get technicalities heavy, with numerous scientific jargon being thrown at us at random gaps, and they seldom put emphasis on character developments; Chazelle decided to do something different here and brought an insight look into the iconic figure, Neil Armstrong, the ""First Man"" to take a step on the Moon, on behalf of the entire humankind.The director wanted to inquire into the human side of him. Chazelle made an effort to look deeper into his psyche and tried to delve into the mental space of Mr Armstrong; with whatever transpiring in his life, his successes, his failures, through thick and thin, we stick to his perspective and slowly see his life evolving with family and colleagues.Now I don't know how accurate all this was; I have not read Armstrong's biography, so I can't comment on the credibility of the source material here; still, I believe, Chazelle had done a competent job and made the core drama work as intended.P. S. Ryan Gosling did great in his role; it was one of his finer performances, for sure!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A mostly stellar biopic.,"I once hear a person say they would love to visit Australia, except that everything there could kill them. The same could be said for outer space. The only difference is Australia was meant as a joke.This danger of space flight-and the fact that we, the audience, feel it so clearly-is just part of what makes First Man one of the best movies of 2018. Similar to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 in content, but closer to Interstellar in tone and pacing, the film is a winning synthesis of top-notch acting and bold, skillful direction. In its weak points it echoes another Christopher Nolan film, Dunkirk, perhaps slowing its tempo and extending its silence a little too much. But like that film, these shortcomings make it different, and thus, memorable. Which, these days, is its own triumph.Most of you know the story; many of you lived it. 1961 brings our first glimpse of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), testing a NASA plane as it climbs through the Earth's atmosphere into the lower reaches of space. Years pass. Friends are made, then-too often-lost at the hands of a crash or other malfunction.First Man features three main flight sequences, and two of them are absolute nailbiters. The movie puts us at the visceral center of an era in which a handful of men volunteered to harness limited technology and primitive design to reach beyond the world they knew. They pushed the envelope of existence. We sense their fear, experience their heartbreak, and are left to wonder why they continue after enduring such sacrifice. But then, maybe we know the reasons.Armstrong continues his rise through NASA as the decade progresses. The Gemini missions come and go, paving the way for Apollo. Soon the day nears when he'll begin a journey, and take a step, that no man ever has before. First Man accomplishes what every familiar, true story sets out to do: reveal to people the details they don't know and bring to life the headlines they do.It all begins with simulating reality. To this end, director Damian Chazelle goes a step further than most by draping every shot in a grainy, time-period texture. From the Armstrongs' clapboard house to the sterilized halls of NASA, First Man is a movie about the 1960's that looks like it was filmed in the 1960's. This approach is effective and, next to the flash and gloss of most of today's releases, simply refreshing.Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land), 33, has been called a wunderkind, and rightly so. But the label isn't so much due to his striking visuals or strong characters as it is his ability to make the audience feel. This is the hardest thing to do in movies. The right budget can buy brilliant special effects and pristine sound quality, but neither requires more than a surface response from those in the front row. How do you get them to care?It helps to have an able cast. Gosling starred in La La Land, and it's fair to question whether inviting him back for First Man was more about comfort than quality. But it's difficult to imagine anyone else bringing more authenticity to the role. He imbues Armstrong with bravery, fear, anger, generosity-all the shades of a real human being. As his wife Janet, Clair Foy is equally strong in an equally meaty role. Their relationship is the beating heart of the film and just as compelling as every flight into space.Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler and Cory Stoll lead a supporting crew so packed with talent that players like Shea Whigham, Ethan Embry and Brian d'Arcy James get mere seconds of screen time. Justin Hurwitz fills some of the void with a score that's separate parts tension, inspiration and emotion, but altogether original.First Man spends just as much time on Earth as it does in space. It never forgets that any ship, no matter how fast, still needs a pilot. For all the miles it covers, the movie is a human story. That may well be its greatest achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Understated like Neil Armstrong himself,It's a little hard to give spoilers away for First Man as most people on the planet will be aware of the history. In addition to the story behind the first man on the moon the movie focuses on the strains it puts on Armstrong's home life.Gosling and Foy are very believable in the roles of Neil and Janet Armstrong. It seems very strange in today's celebrity world that Neil Armstrong could be so anonymous after his exploits. The movie gives us an insight into the man and some of the events portrayed will cause me to go and check for accuracy. The pressure it put on his already difficult home life was immense. It is quite a comparison between achieving one of the most momentous things in history whilst doing the dishes.The movie also makes you realize just how amazing an achievement it was. The risks of failure must have been incredibly high and there is no doubt that all the astronauts were incredibly brave. Some of the launch sequences in particular are jaw dropping.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A subtle, slowly and beautifully crafted cinematic jewel","I wonder if there will ever come the time when finally the reviews of art cinema, or author cinema, art house or whatever defines high quality movies get separated from the average Hollywood entertainment. It is absolutely ridiculous that IMDB and other sites use the same rating system to evaluate such different cultural products. Wouldn't this separation solve, for instance. the problem with the fake reviews and the misleading subjective opinions that place the last superhero movie above a Bergman classic, for instance?Anyways, talking about First Man, here we have something that leaves the average movie goers frustrated. What a disappointment for those folks who can not appreciate the subtleness of the human soul and the aesthetical beauty that comes with the slow exposition of emotions, sensations and feelings. The slow dance that First man resembles will definitely put millions asleep. Instead of focusing on the external aspects of that historical moment that brought the United States (and mankind) to the moon the movie goes to the backstage and illuminates the darkest rooms, exposing the subtle and harrowing drama of the people closely involved in the events. I would even say that the dramatic role of Neil's wife is as significant as that of the protagonist in carrying the emotional load of the story.This is not new. We have seen this writing strategy before, and again, we've seen the final product thrown to the flames by the disappointed mob of spectators. Remember Last Days, by Gus Van Sant? That masterpiece has 5.8 points on IMDB. Had Van Sant made First Man it would probably be even more obscure, more silent, slower, and people would trash it mercilessly.So, if you are in the mood for a popcorn spectacle on a boring night skip this. Looking for a wonderful cinematic experience? First Man will satisfy your needs. And don't forget to express your appreciation to the fantastic group of actors, writers, the director and every one who participated in the making of this jewel, even if it is anonymously, subtly, silently, in the deepest and darkest room of your soul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Good and technically dazzling,"This is a good film, but not a great one which I was hoping for. I actually saw this when it was released and had no memory of it at all just six years later, not a good sign, but it made me anxious to see it again assuming I was having an off day on my first viewing. I wasn't. It's an extremely well crafted film about Neil Armstrong, his personal life and professional career. There are quite a few tense scenes, but the film's basic problem for me was that it's a true story that holds no surprises if you have a good memory of his historical accomplishments. Yes, we do learn more about his personal life, not what I came for, helped a lot by the always good Claire Foy as his wife. What we mostly learn though, if this is an accurate depiction, is that Armstrong is not the most interesting personality to spend nearly two & a half hours with. Besides Foy, the cast is a talented one indeed. Ryan Gosling in the lead does well, but he plays him as simply as possible, perhaps mirroring reality. Again, the cast is full of talent, but no one really shines in any special way. Foy comes closest. I'm a huge fan of indie darling Christopher Abbott, but there is little of interest for him to do in one of his very rare appearances in a huge Hollywood production. It's a very well made movie from the very talented Damian Chazelle, but it's lacking. It did deserve that visual effects Oscar though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Consider the perspective,"I want to meet the guy who invented the ""camera shake"" thing. The human head, in reality, is able to (and does) maintain stability, otherwise we would be seeing a shaken movie every time we walked. Photographers/Videographers sometimes use loupes in order to use their head as a strong stabilization point, because the head maintains stability remarkably better than the rest of the body.
Now, on the content: to clear the air, I say that I'm European. The pursuit to land on the moon was, in reality, not a random adventure, but a strictly political move by the US government, in its space competition with the USSR. It was NOT an international discovery adventure - it was a purely political move by only one country. (The following phrase is not a spoiler, because everyone knows this already:) Thus, to purposefully omit the flag from the moon site, for ""politically correct reasons"", classifies this omission as pure propaganda, by definition!
This would not be the case if the moon landing happened today as an international project - however, when it happened, it was not. It was a 100% political move by only 1 country.
The slow and washed out scenario makes things even worse. We all know that politically correct art is boring and only noises and special effects save it from being a sleeping pill. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film to anyone, especially to adults.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A movie does not have to be a ""great"" one for me to like it. If there is one thing I liked, a scene, an idea, a line of dialogue, a shot, that I hadn't seen before, that inspired me, shocked me, surprised me or a risk taken, something that has not been done before, or not that way,

The music from Hurwitz is brilliant, the overall attention to sound design is under appreciated.Some beautiful cinematography, although very simple and on point, sometimes too dark for my taste (and voluntarily shaky and claustrophobic at times) the result works for the story.Good actor performances overall.The moon landing and ""exploration"" scenes definitely are great Cinema scenes.I wasn't born when it happened but Chazelle made me feel I was watching history, live.I felt something very special.After the slow and long build up, that scene was cathartic.I don't know if i'll watch it again any time soon.But I don't regret watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

There are no attempts to put down one nation or another or to try to create an image of something that many Americans want to believe. No, this movie follows a man, the First Man, the man whose family life became a part of the story and it's a story that needed to be told.Armstrong's sons from what I understand approved of everything the movie was trying to tell and were very proud of the image that was created of their father. And in all honesty, no one else's opinion on the matter really matters. The movie was about their dad, it was a biopic more so than anything else and it did an incredible job of delivering the emotions of a grieving father with a tough mission ahead.I absolutely loved every moment and definitely thought that the portrayal of Buzz Aldrin was spot on as well. He's always been a controversial character (sued his own kids, what a great family) and honestly his miniscule role in the film was the right choice.This is a must see for anyone into space, into human drama or anyone who enjoys watching an incredible journey of a man in pain.

"Great story, Terrible movie, Should have gotten Ron Howard to do this movie.","I was really really disappointed and also puzzled as to why NASA and or whoever let someone do such a terrible job in making this movie. Firstly, they (NASA or whoever) should have gotten Ron Howard to make the movie for this great great moment of American history. Ron Howard did an excellent excellent job in making the movie Apollo 13, which we know consequently was great for NASA in terms of garnering renewed popularity and favorable public opinion and support for going back to the moon and other future space exploration endeavors. NASA desperately needs these movies to be blockbuster hits in order to ultimately gain sufficient government funding for their future projects and missions. This movie completely downplayed the excitement and triumph of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landing and stepping on the moon. Last thing, why did they make the inside of the of LEM and command modules appear so dirty and rusty. Hence it shows all the switches and everything with dirt, rust, or grease stains, which is far from reality. They did the same dirty appearance BS with the inside of the X-15 rocket Jet at the beginning of the movie. That's far from reality. Especially the inside of the LEM and command module, which were always brand new and used only once.

Armstrong was matter of fact and reserved, he certainly was in a contrast to Aldrin, but he was not the remote emotional cripple that Gosling delivers.Other than that egregious problem, I was also stunned at just how boring and drawn out this film was. This was the most dramatic and momentous achievement by mankind to date, and while yes, it was engineering and science, it was also spectacular high drama. One gets no sense of that with this film. None. Really ""shaky cam"" and bizarre close-ups on eyes, noses, mouths to simulate participation in Apollo project?",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very good,"First Man's director, Damien Chazelle, thought that Neil Armstrong's story would fit in well into the thriller genre, and I don't think he was wrong at all. But, there's something else that Chazelle brings to the film that heightens the experience in an unexpected way. The tangible sense of absolute terror at the vastness of space infuses the action with such an enhanced sense of extreme and existential fear that takes the sensation onto another sensory level.It's the story of a man so wholly dedicated to his career and the task of getting to the moon, filmed entirely in a way that feels like the audience is along for the ride. Armstrong is quiet, though. He's driven and seems to have receded into himself in the face of his daughter's death. It's this death that really frames the film, and I feel like it's the only real flaw. The movie seems to imply that the girl's death was the incentive and source of Neil's drive to reach the moon, capping with him dropping the girl's bracelet onto the lunar surface. It feels so facile as a motive for such a monumental personal task. The little girl's ghost appears in flashes of Neil's vision here and there throughout the film, and it does seem to be the source of his laser-like focus on the task at hand. Perhaps it's based on reality (I wouldn't know), but it just seems so reductive and implausible.However, moving on from that, the movie's really well assembled both from a character point of view and from a visceral perspective. I've read that the movie is the story of the exciting Neil and his boring wife Janet, but I would argue that it's just the story of Neil with Janet used as a contrasting device (a well built, rounded, character nonetheless) who demonstrates what Neil is leaving behind by going to the stars. They contrast really well. Neil is reserved and quiet, hardly showing any emotion and personifying the professional, and Janet has big, expressive eyes and is ready to speak her mind to whomever needs to hear it.The sequence that contrasts them best dramatically is what is probably the best part of the film, Neil's Gemini mission. The mission goes well, hitting its main objectives (the first connect between two vessels in orbit), but something goes wrong. There's a mechanical failure that sends the linked vessels into an uncontrollable spin. We see the sequence from two points of view, Neil's and Janet's. Neil is trapped in his small capsule with only small views of the outside world spinning, and we share that perspective, feeling the terror as things go wrong against the empty void of outer space. Against that, we see Janet, listening to the little white box that pipes in the chatter from NASA as things go wrong. She's trying to balance life with her children while taking some small part in her husband's life, but when things go wrong and the audio gets cut by NASA, she's powerless and frantic. She needs to know what's happening to Neil, and no one will tell her. They're truly separated at that moment, Neil alone and near death in space while Janet can't find out anything below. It's a great sequence that contrasts the two halves of Neil's life.The capstone of the film is the landing of Apollo 11 on the moon, of course, and it's handled with the same sense of tension as the Gemini sequence. The landing is terrifying, as alarms blare and everything moves faster than one might expect from the grainy footage we've lived with for decades. It's exciting and the culmination of the film's promise, both personal and in terms of plot, creating a fantastic finale that, I feel, gets slightly undermined by the dropping of the bracelet. I know it provides an emotional framework for the large task Armstrong put himself through, but I just can't get past the feeling that it's facile and too easy.The movie, by capturing everything so tightly from Armstrong's perspective, creates an incredible sense of tension. Combined with the super-realistic take on space travel, it lends a sense of real terror to the dangers of traveling through the void. Contrasting that is the emotional reality that grounds the film most exemplified by the use of Neil's wife, Janet. It's a very good entertainment with intensely gripping passages.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

That being said, I feel like they even showed more of the moon landing than I was expecting, which was nice.I just felt as much as it was, and should've centered around Armstrong, it was just lacking character development for the other characters. Specifically the other astronauts. It made it seem like Neil barely knew them. Or at least had very little interest in anything or anyone but himself.Hey..maybe that was the case. Maybe it was more accurate than it seemed.

This was the first time I had to walk out from the theatre hall due to a shortness of breath induced by the claustrophobic camerawork (darkness, closeups, fuzziness) combined with extreme, unbearable sounds. 
If the idea was to simulate an astronaut's experience and make the viewer physically and emotionally uncomfortable for the entire duration of the movie, then perhaps there should be some soft of a disclaimer that helps people decide whether or not they want to expose themselves to this kind of experience. The most annoying thing is that this is the style of the entire movie, not just of the few scenes in the outer space.

There is NO issue with the U.S. flag!,"My pedigree in the ""NASA Universe"" requires me to see this movie.Watching it on IMAX was a mistake. The huge screen and the movie full of close-ups is a bad combo. I barely survived it.As a teenager in 1969 I was a volunteer at a science museum in Florida. Our rocket nerd circle got regular trips to the Cape for launches, some lucky ones even got press credentials. Needless to say, we were, and still are rocket nerds.This film does a nice job telling the story of Neil Armstrong. His story would not have been noticed in an Apollo 13 style production. His story is small compared to the space program and the monster-sized flame throwing rockets. This film is about the man not the mission, perhaps a gutsy move by the director.NASA selected Neil Armstrong to be first man on the moon because of his modest and meticulous style. There were few modest personalities in the astronaut corps. The last thing NASA needed was blow-hard ""First Man"" on The Tonight Show. Neil was known for being a man of few words but, when he did speak he would say exactly the perfect words at exactly the perfect time. The movie over-did the quiet Neil a bit, which added about 5 minutes to the film. It's too bad because when Neil spoke in public the ""Hero First Man"" came out. This contrast would have been powerful in the movie.First Man mostly uses realistic in-camera effects techniques, as opposed to computer 3D models and green screen. Combining fresh new sound effects and extreme closeups these flight scenes are breathtaking.For the propeller heads, great cockpit stuff, launch stuff and I really liked the X-15 sequence.I'm glad I saw it.

A vertigo inducing Gemini-8 sequence and a harrowing final descent to the lunar surface are captivating and ground-breaking film material for a biopic.

A Masterpiece.,"A great film that doesn't show an untouchable hero, but a mourning husband and dad, who has lost his daughter.

So don't hate the film for not showing how they sticked the American Flag into the Moon surface because that's not what this film is about.
It simply isn't a patriotic hymn to the American technology, but a biography of a special person who had the privilege to be the first person to walk on the moon.

Shaky close-ups galore.,I love good acting and correct recreations of historic moments. First Man contains both but you only get glimpses of it. Every dialogue gets cut up in to a jumble of arranged pieces. Half of the movie is fuzzy and unsteady close-ups of the back of someone's head. Just because you have shot every scene from 15 angles doesn't mean you should use all the 15 angles in a 5 word conversation. What's the point of using talented actors when you completely nullify their flow of portraid emotions. The only scenes when the camera work and editing feels correct is when it's conveying the dangers of exploration and pushing the envelope.The mission is thankfully almost perfect. There's some run of the mill swoshing sci-fi sounds but there's also real silence and more restful editing. Non essential NASA chatter makes it feel real.I know that I should judge the camera work and editing as an artistic necessity but I don't. I think the actors should be trusted with the job of acting instead of the one's doing the editing.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The Vidiot Reviews...,"First ManThe best thing about being the first man on the moon is finally getting to take a dump in peace.Fortunately, this drama doesn't depict any astronauts popping squats in craters.Following the death of his daughter, test pilot Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) joins NASA's mission to put a man on the moon before the Russians. Along with Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), Neil trains his body for the suicide mission. Meanwhile his wife (Claire Foy) worries about her husband's coldhearted approach to never seeing his family again.Beautifully shot with a haunting score and stoic acting from Gosling, this meditation on the first man on the moon may be a fine character study of the no-nonsense astronaut but it is also a very slow moving one at that.Incidentally, Vladimir Putin wants to put the first women on the moon by imprisoning Pussy Riot there.

"Bad soundtrack, shaky handheld camera, no drama or suspense",I was hoping for a movie similar to Apollo-13 but First Man isn't even close. I just saw it at the Imax and was very disappointed. First Man isn't even about the science involved with putting a man on the moon but rather about the discontentment and difficulties between Armstrong and his wife. There is very little drama or suspense throughout the entire movie. The movie has zero humor and is basicly very dark portrayal of Armstrong. The camera is shaky throughout and always on extreme closeup shots. The worst thing was that the soundtrack was terrible which to me and makes the difference between a good or mediocre movie. First Man could easily have been a made for TV movie in my humble opinion.,5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
First Man,"Biopic of Neil Armstrong from the early Gemini projects to the historic space flight in 1969.The story focusses pretty much exclusively on Armstrong and his wife. He, who never recovered from the death of his only daughter is insular and stubborn and determined, despite the risks to get into space. His wife in turn has to live with his moods and the very real prospect of him not returning. Both Gosling and Foy and very good and should get nods at awards time if there is any justice. The real thrill of the movie though is through the space sequences, which demonstrate perhaps for the first time how terrifying and uncertain these mission were. Oddly enough this applies to earlier tests etc in the film more so than the final Apollo 11 mission, but given the outcome is so well known this is not surprising and filmed accordingly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Silly Camera work from the school of JJ Camera Shake,"Well, I saw this film for free because of having friends in the editing industry so that was a plus! However as films go this missed the mark. A bit slow paced, overly melodramatic mid section, poor acting and that dreadfully overused camera-shake that just did not work. Sorry but I really would of felt ripped off had a paid for this film. 
Now this film has apparently garnered some controversy because due to leaving out many important references to the nationalist aspect of the mission. We all know why it was left out and that is to wash away any sense of American nationalistic feeling. One of the big differences in films today vs 30+ years ago is the lack of nationalism in films. Nationalism is something the Hollywood elite seems to despise and as such this film is no exception. To leave out the placement of the US flag on the moon was absolutely ridiculous. Why...because anyone growing up in that time can tell you the sense of pride as a people and a nation we had. These guys were national and world heros in every sense of the word. Everything back then had the US flag on it! Every moon landing LEGO set ( I still have mine) has a US flag to set. Having grown up where the Grumman plants were many of our parents worked there. My uncle and a number of my friends fathers worked on the Lem project. I used to get stickers and models given to me these people and they all had US flags on it! This was a very American project and a competition with the Soviets to see who would be the leader in space technology, the USA won that and we were very proud!! To leave that aspect of the film is historically and emotionally inaccurate of the project and of the time. Clearly this was THOUGHTFULLY left out to espouse more globalism over nationalism but unfortunately the film was poor regardless. I wonder of the producer/director of this film knows that much of the technology and management of the Apollo missions, Russian space missions and general rocket propulsion came from Germany and that the Apollo project was in part headed by Wernher Von Braun. ""Apollo program director Sam Phillips was quoted as saying that he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all"" 
Hey Hollywood, many of us are really tired of the reboots, the poor casting, acting, silly CG, sequels and remakes. Modern films depict a dearth of creativity, perhaps due to lack of corporate risk taking or maybe constrained group thinking on the part of like minded politically correct drones.??

A movie about the social and psychological costs of the US manned space program,"This movie may not meet your expectations if you're expecting to see a rip roaring, feel good movie along the lines of ""The Right Stuff"" or ""Space Cowboys."" This movie is a tightly focused look at the psychology and the psychological costs of being an astronaut. In particular, being Neil Armstrong. As an engineer myself (but hardly an astronaut), I think Ryan Gosling captures the quiet introspection of the engineering (enginurd) type. He can focus his mind on trying to solve problems whether its his young daughter's brain tumor, finding a missing Agena docking target in orbit, or finding a safe place to land on the moon as the fuel runs dangerously low. Solving problems is the essence of engineering and Gosling captured this essence in a bottle. Claire Foy sheds every shred of British to become the quietly suffering astronaut's wife Jan, who is constantly left behind to deal with the home front as her husband flies into the skies, into space, and ultimately to the moon. This movie focuses almost entirely on these two people, their relationship, and their kids. The rest of the cast is there to support, from a considerable distance.You should know that my wife did not care for this movie. There are long scenes of being shaken (in a simulator, on the Lunar Lander Research Vehicle, in a Gemini Capsule, in an Apollo Capsule, and in the Lunar Module). There are long looks at the lunar landscape reminiscent of the glacial pace of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The movie tried her patience. For me, I've been mentally entangled with the space program starting with the earliest days of the Mercury 7 astronaut team. I watched every launch on black and white TV.

How humans went to Moon for the first time. Ryan Gosling is Neil Armstrong,"Cinematic wunderkind Damien Chazelle - best known for writing and directing ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" - is back with his true magnum opus, an overview of how the man first stepped on the Moon.We follow the development of the American space program from 1962 through 1969.The central character is astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) who has to balance his desire of perilous journey to unknown with being a family man.""First Man"" is based on a real events - both story-wise and in technical sense. Everything has been recreated as realistically as possible, using the old technology and filming with handycams, so the audience can directly relate to astronauts' experiences on both intellectual and physiological level.This means the viewer gets to live through the same chaotic, claustrophobic and disorientedness-inducing conditions that were the part and parcel of real job. And judging from the cinema seat, it feels amazingly authentic.Scenes like these form a major part of the movie, which is quite long at its 141 minutes, turning it into more than average exhaustive viewing - probably even more so IMAX.Near the end, by the time they really reach the Moon, I must admit I was already a bit worn down by all this visually shaky and messy directing style that Chazelle has chosen. I'd had my fill of the technical stuff and was longing for a chance to explore more the human side of the story.As Armstrong turns out to have been a rather closely guarded individual with no desire to be a star or American hero, we don't get to learn much about him.Which is positive in a way, because there's room for many other people who need to be on the screen (played by Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Pablo Schreiber, Ciarán Hinds, Patrick Fugit et al).Gosling has always been good with characters of private, secluded nature, so there's not much new to tell about his another exemplary performance. He's charismatic as always.The second most important performance belongs to Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife. Although her amount of screen time is moderate, she's the one that seems to impress the critics the most, leading already speculations about Oscars.I agree that astronaut's fiery and strong-willed wife is a perfect Supporting Actress award material, and Foy is very good at what she does here. But personally I didn't find her part so essential as to get really excited about it.It's not her fault. The story never concentrates that much on characters' inner lives anyway, so ""First Man"" is really not an actors' movie first.Still, I would like to have seen more of Armstrong's colleague astronaut Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) whose readiness to always speak out ""what everybody is thinking anyway"" adds some spicy bits of intrigue to space mission's everyday life.This is the unused chance to add some depth even without delving into anybody's heads and personal lives, but sadly the authors have not deemed it necessary.""First Man"" is a impressive movie but the technical side is more important than the human one here, which makes it difficult for me to love.All this shaky physically tormenting chaos on the screen does get a bit monotonous before the end.

Thoughts on First Man,"One of the most important events in human history told through the eyes of the first man to walk the moon. Very effective storytelling and film making from Damien Chazelle, the close up angles and shaky cam give the viewer a sense of intimacy. And that's what this film does the best; it really humanizes Neil Armstrong. First man shows the hardships and trials Neil faces in his pursuits and really gets you to empathize with him, which is a welcome change. Normally all we think about when it comes to the first moon landing is how much of hero Neil Armstrong is and how much of a triumphant accomplishment the moon landing is. All the character moments with Neil and his family are amazing. The space sequences are the only ones that I've seen that really show the helplessness of the astronauts. Up there all alone with barely any communication, barely any sight and in technology that really isn't even developed yet. Those sequences give a great feeling of fear, anxiety and isolation. The last positive note being the films score. Like all of Justin Hurwitz's scores; my god is it fantastic, it builds such a great atmosphere.There are large portions toward the middle of the film that do drag and are a bit dull but the total package is definitely worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A nice departure from Damien Chazelle's previous work,"Damien Chazelle has proven himself to be one of the best directors with Whiplash and La La Land. Whilst First Man isn't as good as those two, it's still pretty great.First Man shows us the life of Neil Armstrong and the space mission that made him become the first man to walk on the moon.So far Damien Chazelle has been making films about music so First Man is quite a departure from his normal work. I like how he's wanting to explore different genres and get out of his comfort zone. In terms of its technical aspects, First Man is absolutely incredible. The cinematography is way more shaky than Chazelle's previous films but it helped make the story and its world feel very grounded allowing the events that take place pack an emotional punch. I'm not a huge fan of shakycam and some of the shots here were not in focus but as a whole I found it to be a suitable choice. I also loved the use of sound. The sound design is fantastic especially during the scenes where we're inside the rocket. The continuous and loud rattling noise the ship makes had me on edge and adds a layer of tension that I don't often see in other space films. The visual effects are also outstanding. They're absolutely seamless and beautiful to look at.However, I wouldn't say this is really a space film as majority of the film focuses on Neil Armstrong and his personal life. The realistic approach to the story gives us an insight into the inner troubles Armstrong was facing. Chazelle doesn't include many loud scenes with outbursts but rather keeps it fairly quiet and subtle. Ryan Gosling is amazing as Neil Armstrong. He's one of the few actors that is able to communicate so many emotions through a stoic face. It's a very quiet performance that says a lot. Claire Foy is also terrific and has scenes that bring out a lot of emotion. Jason Clarke and Kyle Chandler are also great. The real problem I have with First Man is the level of connection the audience builds with Armstrong. This is clearly meant to be a very emotional film that makes us gravitate towards and care for Armstrong and there were moments where I truly cared about him and his family but I wasn't able to connect as much as I wanted to.First Man is Chazelle's weakest film so far but I liked it nonetheless. It's beautifully made and felt very personal with strong performances by Gosling and Foy. This film shows Chazelle's versatility as a director and I hope he continues to experiment with different genres in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mediocre at best,"It is striking that more and more films, which would probably have received little attention 20 years ago, are now being talked about solely because of their technical gimmicks. With ""First Man"" it is probably no different. And even a really always reliable actor like Ryan Gosling seems absolutely interchangeable here. Once again a film manages to make me not really interested in its characters. It may be that here you should avoid showing a hero who is actually not one, there is no pathos either, which I actually find very pleasant. On the other hand, I don't understand the relationship of the Armstrong couple, I have little insight into Neil's soul. The death of their daughter is not the key to everything and there is frighteningly little happening in Gosling's face. Of course the technical side is brilliant, but that's it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mostly accurate but with a definite slant from those too young to know,"Those of us who were kids at the time followed the space program like a kid in the thirties followed baseball. The director and producers of this film were not around then, so they put in a bit of revisionist slant. On the other hand, they did a good job of capturing Neil Armstrong's issues with what might have been Asperger's disease - the remoteness, fixed concentration, etc.Where I take exception is the very strong portrayal of those against the space program, including the overt racism expressed by one poet. All of the negatives were true but they represented about 10% of public opinion, The overwhelming majority of Americans were definitely for the space program.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
My guilty pain of the year,"I don't know if it is an official term, but since ""a work of art beloved by the observer but disliked by the masses"" is called a ""guilty pleasure"", I propose the word ""guilty pain"" for the opposite: a movie praised by people in general, but perceived as overrated by me. First Man is an unfortunate example of this: I love biopics and movies about space exploration, and I went in with reasonable expectations (I think), but despite finding some positive elements in it, I already know it is not going to make my Best Of 2018 list.I liked Damien Chazelle's previous movies, but I also think that all the Oscar-praise and IMDb Top 250 listings that were heaped upon them were way too much credit. Whiplash was a solid piece of breakthrough filmmaking, but it will be primarily remembered for the stellar role of J.K. Simmons and his interaction with Miles Teller, rather than a timeless piece of storytelling. Entire volumes and SNL sketches have been written about La La Land and how a group of its hardcore fans (let's call them Academy voters) made it one of the most successfully overhyped movies of all time. First Man is actually the film that makes me doubt Chazelle's status as wunderkind the most. Whiplash and La La Land, relatively overrated as they were, at least moved and entertained me, whereas First Man failed to actually engage me most of the time.At its best, FM is a fascinating history lesson about a nation's decade-long ambition to reach the Moon, and the willingness of a group of men (and one man in particular) to risk their lives in pursuit of fullfilling this dream. The film accurately shows the bold choices and sacrifices that these men made, going into a project that succeeded with equal amounts of craftmanship and blind luck. It also shows the human folly of spending (or wasting) resources and human lives out of a desire to beat their competitors. The movie isn't afraid to suggest at times that personal ego was a significant factor in the drive of some of the men, and it takes care not to slavishly portray its protagonists as heroes or saints. As a documentary, FM would have done an accurate job.However, as a drama, it falls short in several areas. One of them, sadly, is in the choice of its main subject. I have been told that the real Neil Armstrong was notoriously introverted, modest and media-shy, and the devestating loss of a child made him a tragic figure. Although Ryan Gosling accurately portrays him as such, this doesn't help from a storytelling point of view. We simply don't get to understand how this man thinks and why he does what he does. The way that he talks to his sons about the possibility of him not returning alive like he is giving a press conference suggests to me that he had real difficulties in connecting with people. As a consequence, the movie struggles to convey why his character would put himself and his family through such insecurities, given the absence of any noticeable enthusiasm in him. Some will undoubtedly say that this enigmatic man is a mystery best left intact, and part of the appeal of the movie, but I find that the film's inability to get under his skin seriously hampers my ability to identify with him.My second point of contention is director Chazelle's confined view on the subject. His restraint in re-enacting the events as unsensational as possible is commendable in principle. Stories like this do not necessarily need emotional embellishments, endless character analyses or bombastic enhancements to strike a chord with the audience. Keeping the story focussed on its characters with subtle music is an artistic choice that could have worked. However, in this film, it mostly amounts to a dry presentation of facts that lack a subjective feeling to it. Chazelle keeps the camera locked tight on his actors and inside the shuttles most of the time, and rarely ventures outside that narrow view. Even in the tense scenes, we experience plenty of discomforts and fears of spaceflight, but hardly any of the marvel that I assume makes astronauts want to go into space in the first place. Movies like Apollo 13 and Everest also dealt with people who risk their lives, but it also showed or explained their motivations and euphoria that made you understand and sympathize with them. What I miss is the childlike sense of wonder that would suit a movie about space exploration, which is very strange for a movie that has Steven Spielberg credited as a producer.The movie has assembled a fine cast, including Gosling, Jason Clarke and Claire Foy. Even the fact that some good actors (like Ciarán Hinds) have only very small parts isn't a problem. However, as stated above, I find it problematic that the film only incidentally succeeds in explaining what drives these characters. Certain scenes are even puzzling in their lack of purpose (like the final shot). It almost seems as if the makers tried to suggest more character depth by copious use of extreme close-ups, coupled with a constantly moving camera. I don't mind a few close-ups or a bit of shaky-cam at all, but when I start to notice it repeatedly (especially in quiet dialogue scenes) it becomes an annoying style trick. Some have praised the photography for its accurate 60s look, and I concur with that, but shaky-cam for the sake of shaky-cam kind of defeats its purpose.In all fairness, every now and then, Chazelle succeeds in getting the message accross. Claire Foy gets away with some of the best scenes as the more emotional counterpart of Neil. The dramatic beginning bridges nicely with the cinematic finale; both are quite effective without becoming overly sentimental, and convey the emotional weight of the events, as well as give us some insight into the characters. But there is still a large chunk of a 141-minute movie getting close to boredom by failing to engage me in its narrative or characters. I hear Oscar buzz all around, and I am fine with any of the actors winning it. But not the picture, not the director, and certainly not the photography. The movie has the elements, but it lacks the passion for its subject.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Understated with some elements missing from the recipe,"This movie was very polarizing, judging from the reviews, both here and on the outside. The reasons are both simple and complicated. Criticism of the movie has become well known. And, it is true, there is no actual scene of planting of the American flag on the lunar surface. The overall tone of the movie, to be fair, is a very understated feel of this American achievement. For the political Left, very, very little social change was displayed in the movie, of the turbulent 60's, with only one brief TV scene of the escalating Vietnam War. But, it could be argued, none of these things were the focus. Rather, our race to the moon and the personal story of Neil Armstrong. Accepting that, these criticisms were well, well overdone. It was a good movie, but fell short of great.It lacks the emotional and patriotic surge of the failed mission of Apollo 13 (1995), the uplifting cheering moments and humor of The Martian (2015). The cinematography bothered many, it was OK for me. The director's style was a put off to others, it has a feel like Whiplash (2014), in a strange way to me. But, one area I really fault the film was a poor script. Scriptwriter Josh Singer was praised for his work in 'The Post' (Ok by me) and 'Spotlight' (fantastic in my view), so he was capable enough. But, if this was to quietly celebrate the engineers rather than male bravado, where were the science discussions, dialogue and characters ? Sure, vehicles which blew up or failed were reasons it took us a decade to get up there, but give me some of the why. This would have also been a good time to develop characters with the principal players and for some humor. Even in earnest movies, this lacked almost all sense of anything but a very occasional chuckle.Ryan Gosling under acted and understated Armstrong to the extent it might be seen as the opposite reciprocal to say, what some critics said of Al Pacino's 'over acting' intensity of the 70's and 80's. It fell flat and uncomfortable for some. Corey Stoll's Buzz Aldrin was flippant and unlikable, how true to form it was, I don't know. Claire Foy's Janet Armstrong took a progressively uptight and disagreeable tone. In the last third of the movie pushed it to a bit anti-climatic. Perhaps a wink to modern feminist bravado.The movie lacks good scoring, both original and period music (outside a radical 60's song, 'Whity going to the moon'). No 'interludes' to walk you through events/ideas and time. While this is a certain style of movie making, the disadvantage is you don't get the economy of storytelling quickly and the movie tends to drag.It's sad, but the unfounded harsh criticism this movie brought will give those who've never seen it, an impression it is tainted with more anti-American flavor, which Hollywood has cranked out in the previous decade. It is not. It's also not escapist entertainment, which is why it drew the over 40 crowd...not the target of most movie makers and theaters. However, it may not bring the praise from such generations on the high end, who remember the events first hand. This was more than just going out to bring home the milk, 'matter of fact,' which is what younger generations might be left thinking.It is all together fitting that Neil Armstrong belonged to the so-called 'Silent Generation' (circa 1925-early 1940's). NASA was founded by GI Generation folk (1900-1925), heros of WWII becoming civil left brain leaning problem solving engineers. It was Armstrong and his peers who humanized the Moon Landing ('...giant leap for Mankind'). Much could be said about the social changes back on Earth. Not so much 1960's college students, but Silent Generational leaders such at Dr. King (together with Armstrong, considered great heros of their generation).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I'm not discussing how important (or completely not) her role was, I'm pointing out reason people call this film - boring. If all these scenes were used for actual science, action and fuss on the project, it would make it more interesting.

"Not Boring, Just Joyless","First Man must of course be compared to Apollo 13, the best movie that has ever been done about the space program. Unlike that movie, there is no joy here whatsoever. Neil Armstrong is portrayed as a man forever haunted by the death of his little girl. As my wife noted, both he and his wife need grief counseling. There are some excellent set pieces such as the near disasters in the LEM trainer and Gemini 8 as well as the almost disastrous moon landing. But after this great achievement we are left with Neil Armstrong in quarantine, still with a flat affect, unable to even say hello to his wife.Technically, the film effectively recreates the feeling of 1960s culture and the space program. But unlike Apollo 13, Mission Control looks pretty stripped down. The other astronauts, like Neil Armstrong himself, have no personality and are hardly identified. Those with even bit parts in Apollo 13 are clearly identified and memorable. The only exception is Neil's close friend Ed White who dies in the Apollo 1 fire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Definitely, this is a film made in honor of human lives that have been thrown into a geopolitics game. Landing on the moon in 1969 has been since then a great theater to highlight how human endurance can take us ahead of ourselves wherever it is.

First Man Perpective,"Overall this is a good movie, mostly I give it plus for direction and atmosphere. The gritty, visceral scenes of being in the craft I think portrays really what it was like unlike most, comparatively sanitized versions - being strapped in a shaking tin can time-bomb.The recreations of the flights are spot on based on real clips/pics. Another example of putting you there in the action.Acting: I liked the casting (good seeing Lucas, Pablo in some roles). Gosling - I have only seen him in 2 movies, this and Blade Runner 2049, in both cases he plays an emotionally stifled character - is it him - or is he acting - however he still pulls it off.Claire Foy - IMHO she steals the show as far as acting chops.

And it did not show the backup crew for Apollo 11, which consisted of James Lovell, William Anders and Fred Haise training either. Lastly, though there was a small hint about the political pressure as to why send humans into Space, very little of it is really mentioned and it failed to explain why Armstrong was sent to ""The White House."" A lot of other aspects of the Apollo 11 Mission could have been explained but were not. It could have shown how close-knit Astronaut community was at that time. But it did not capture that.

hard to understand some of the criticism. Page after page re: camera shaking, and the seriousness of the crew.

Not the time to be bouncing off the walls with excitement and joy of a teenage girl at a slumber party. This was serious business, which might have caused these astronauts their lives. Additionally, the makers of the film weren't interested in making a movie with lots of modern style computer animation and sound effects. An attempt was made to make the picture using methods that might have been utilized back THEN. And they did just exactly that. The film was very consistent with the way it would have been portrayed in those days. Furthermore, since events in those days didn't rely heavily on politically correct ideals, I'm sure many of the reviewers didn't care for the portrayal of so many white, male, heterosexual gentiles in the picture; people who in those times tended to be stoic.

Slow as a snail and yet wins the race somehow,"Here's my review of First man. So 'First man' is directed by Damien Chazelle known for Whiplash and La La land and I loved whiplash which made me look forward to this movie. The movie is a biopic of Neil Armstrong and before watching this I knew very little about him . Cause every other person whose biopic has been made is either a musicisan , an actor or a politician who had eccentric personalities of their own from Howard Hughes to Steve Jobs to Tommy Wiseau. Now Ryan gosling was great as Neil Armstrong and that's how I will remember him from now on. Claire foy as Janet Armstrong was really good too. This movie is a drama more than anything , it's not about mankinds first step , it's not about creating history , it's just about Neil Armstrong . This is a gorgeous , beautiful , amazing ( I've run out of synonymns for good looking ) movie. But despite that it's phasing is very slow , like super slow ! But there are some very intense as well as claustrophobic scenes and the only way to do them well was to do them slow. This movie is shot on film , so even while watching it on imax it has grains on it making it look like how it would be if the current era shot old movies. I thought that was pretty cool. Remember how in the dark Knight rises you couldn't understand a word out of Bane's mouth cause he was wearing a muzzle. In this movie there's a lot of stuff you can't hear over the scattered comms but that didn't really matter cause I wouldn't have understood the rocket science stuff anyway. There are also some scenes where a whole event is shown , like remember how in breaking bad season 2 they would show a whole breakfast table routine right from cutting the egg , adding pepper and eating it without cuts and we went along with it till we got to season 3 ? Well you have to sit through those scenes just like that to get to the good parts in this movie. There are some scenes where it's brilliant acting but no music to top it up . Like honestly I don't think I would've cried to musafa dying in lion king if it wasn't for the music. I don't understand why people only call movies set in the medieval era as epic cause I feel that anything inspiring is an epic and that's why First man is an Epic . In the end it was a great movie with phasing flaws and a lack of an emotional drive unlike whiplash and you'll have a great time unless you're Russian . I don't usually type this much but I felt if I hadn't people would have concluded this as a good / bad movie. But if you did read this much . Thank you . Much appreciated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A deeply personal take behind the moon mission,"First Man is a deeply personal and grounded story behind the landing of Neil Armstrong on Moon in 1969.It tells about the story, the politics the struggles, the journey, the failures behind the Apollo mission.It tells the story behind the failures of 10 missions prior to success of Apollo 11 mission.It also doesn't shy away of the criticism and protest behind spending so much public money on the missions.Neil Armstrong is shown as motivated & busy man who has set his goals straight, how much he sacrificed for the mission.The losing of his daughter, the environment in his family, the relationships.He is seeing the moon mission as an escape from Earth & that's where is becomes a personal story.
The film is slow in it's narrative, and the lead character doesn't speak much.The shaky camera scenes were odd.But the film lands successfully for the penultimate moment which is the moon landing.And that is the obviously the best moment.I liked the film, but it could have been better.The pace and narrative is the issue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

First Man,"The first opening film of Venice. Like Armstrong's own feat, the film's word-of-mouth may fall into polarization, and the strong national spirit permeated is worth pondering, but it is still one of the most important biopic films this year. Chazelei slightly lost the aura of the first two parts, and the patience of hard shooting led commander Gao to show enough restraint, but some of the bridge sections can still feel the burst and romance in our memory.

"The humane story, rather than ""The Human Story"".","Curb your expectations accordingly.Before I dissect my minute qualms, let me preface now that ""First Man"" is a quality movie - and that said - I'm not going to concentrate on any of its virtues here. Because I do have some rather glaring reservations;Aside from the always welcome addition of Kyle Chandler, I kinda feel most of the film is miscast. Ryan Gosling is one of his generations finest leading actors, but here he is quite blank and doesn't remind me of the real Neil Armstrong at all. In fact, none of the astronaut characterizations seemed like their true-life counterparts. Although I am hard pressed to site better replacements, so perhaps it's more a fault in the writing and direction of those characters.Another element I take issue with is the constant roaming hand-held camera stuff - especially in the Armstrong home. It was a distractingly curious choice at times, because it gives the actual cameraman a very intrusive participating presence in some of those intimate scenes (for me at least) - echoing the worst tendencies of recent Terrence Malick. Damien Chazelle apparently wanted to underplay everything, yet he overplayed the verite camera work trying so desperately to feel authentic yet calling attention to its artifice through its behind the lens searching, probing, and lurking.The music score had interesting instrumentations and some impactful moments of tenseness, but to my mind was all too often too subdued and simply tonal wallpaper - and there was never any sense of idealism, which just seems disingenuous as representetive of a story about driven people inspired to do audaciously bold things. It's very obvious they deliberately chose to eschew trumpets and drumlines to avoid the cliche - to once again underplay the events - but I think it's at the cost of undermining the significance of such a momentous accomplishment and undercutting the aspirational emotions involved by being a little too revisionist toward the true stirring spirit of that literally flag-planting era (which was certainly jingoistic in propulsion).I understand Chazelle is intentionally demystfying the iconism which has become mythicly cliche, and that's a smart place to start from, but at some point in telling a story it will demand when it wants to be fetishized for the purpose of granting perspective on the broader impact. Here we're never really treated to a cinematic rendering of just how profoundly the nation and the world was affected by placing our own footprints onto that big glowing orb in the night sky that has beguiled and beckoned mankind's oneiric romanticisms for our entire tenure as conscious entities on this earth. So even though I appreciated the intimate subtext it told within the pretext, in the respect of the wider context ""First Man"" fell short for me.""Apollo 13"" is still the best film about a NASA mission. I prefer HBO's excellent mini-series ""From The Earth To The Moon"" as well. ""The Right Stuff"" is also superior.""First Man"" is worth a watch, but not likely a rewatch any time soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Serious Man,"Those of you expecting the high octane All-American space cowboys as portrayed by the 'Mercury Seven' astronauts in 'The Right Stuff' (1983) will be slightly dismayed by the less jingoistic 'First Man' which wants us to believe that, amidst all the excitement and anticipation of landing on the moon, the astronauts of the Mercury and Apollo Programs were just regular rocket scientists who, after a day of being stuffed into flying rockets like sardines would come home to the regular suburban angst of 1960's middle America. While this in and of itself is fair comment, it does make for a less than exciting movie. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy do a tremendous job playing the iconic Armstrongs as more sobering, poignant and complex characters. (Gosling showing particular adeptness at not revealing any jarring Canadianisms. Whew!) The avoidance of the typical themes of American exceptionalism, frontierism and flag waving are refreshing and commendable enough but the movie focuses on Armstrong's inner psyche at the expense of much needed narrative, stronger supporting characters and special effects that are so unspectacular that one might even suspect that the conspiracy nuts are right - and this all could have been done on a sound stage.

Good mainly for the domestic scenes,"Based on the book by James Hansen: the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is highlighted from 1961 - 1969 culminating in the famous landing on the moon in the Apollo 11 mission.""First Man"" succeeds in mixing Armstrong's well-known work-life with his family and social life. Its greatest credit can be given to its recall of the 1960s in look and feel. Much detail is placed in the sets including such forgotten objects as bean-bag ashtrays (during an era of rampant smoking) and the unique designs of hospital bracelets. Most importantly, the era is excellently re-captured in its portrayal of the widely accepted stoicism and emotional restraint despite occasional lapses of emotion that follow tragedies. As Armstrong's wife Janet, Claire Foy is superb in a scene of the night before the great mission.The film would have been better if the aircraft scenes were at least as good as the family/friendship scenes. Many people are familiar with the saying ""it's not rocket science"". In ""First Man"", a lot of real rocket science talk tends to dumbfound the average viewer. Also, some aircraft scenes were too internal and stagnant to be exciting which is a disappointment as director Damien Chazelle did such brilliant work on ""La La Land"" a couple of years ago.

"First Man is a good film that, in addition to the correct story of the first man on the moon, offers strong emotions related to the conquest of space, and it personally helped","Damien Chazelle, after creating a musical drama and a musical, this time, at least at first glance, changes the subject by reaching for the biography of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon. The role is played by a good friend of the director - Ryan Gosling, who also played the main role in his previous film.After last year's success of La La Land, Chazelle took on a material that, in the right hands, has a great chance of causing a stir in the Oscar competition. How did he cope?First Man is not a typical biography in which we follow the hero from the beginning of his chosen path. The camera enters the protagonist's life in 1961, when he is already a NASA test pilot. This is a time when the Armstrong family is struck by a great tragedy, leaving its mark on their life and the hero's actions. Shortly thereafter, Armstrong joins Project Gemini, a prelude to the now famous Apollo program, which aimed to send men to the moon.It would seem that this time the director is moving away from his chosen trend in favor of a reliable biographical study, but once again his work features the theme of uncompromising pursuit of goals, fulfilling dreams and expectations towards oneself. From the moment we meet Armstrong, he is an impenetrable man, it is not really clear what leads him on the chosen path, it is difficult to find specific motivations in his attitude. Perhaps this should be explained by the above-mentioned family event, perhaps there is a lack of deeper character development, which, combined with Gosling's sparse wooden approach, dehumanizes him a bit. Chazelle often chose to depict characters in a documentary way, using hand-held shots, and frequent close-ups of faces, which worked well in space, but several hundred thousand kilometers below, there was sometimes an obvious lack of distance.Therefore, after watching the film, the answer to the question: What was Neil Armstrong really like?, stripped of obvious clichés, may cause some problems.Of course, there are also some good plot moves, such as the brilliant scene of Armstrong saying goodbye to his family, shown right after the press conference with the astronauts. The analogy between the scenes is obvious and perfectly illustrates Neil's detachment from reality, who does not know how to behave in this situation.The issue of the sense of investing in NASA's space program and the social mood related to it is also an important issue that runs in the background of the film's elements. An undoubted advantage is the fact that its issuance is determined by the court's own ruling in this matter.The biographical aspect of the film is only good, the story is told honestly, the best thing about Chazelle's acting is the overwhelming impressions of astronauts in large tin cans. Already from the first scenes, when Armstrong loses control of the X-15 rocket and is affected by atmospheric conditions, the viewer feels his own consequences of every aspect of this organ, every shock, all the tremors of the cameras that never leave the cockpit for a moment, which has the limits of claustrophobia and strain. Chazelle only masters the experience of being in space later, in a scene that shows the Gemini Internet broadcast. Thanks to the mastery of using images and sounds, which becomes one of the two culminating points of the picture, an extremely suggestive display of the destructive forces prevailing in space.Technical refinement to the function that Chazelle is already available during your stay. First Man, thanks to perfection in this unique matter, such as ultimate sacrifices, work, luck and the combination of many other factors, required landing a man on the moon. Thanks to this moment, when Armstrong sets foot on an extraterrestrial land, in a human, there is a ton of movement and disarming that works, that works during the show. And all this, even though the history itself and its conclusions are known.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Pretty good. Regardless of the execution, it tries to know and humanize a private man.","Some of the family scenes felt a little too much like a Terrence Malick movie. Arguably the family stuff and the wife (the proverbial woman behind the man) are given too much screen time in general for a movie about space travel. These were professionals that compartmentalize in order to focus. I can sort of see the filmmakers' viewpoint that the family knew some aspects of him more than maybe his colleagues, particularly for someone this private, and since he's the protagonist here that should be a primary source, but it feels forced and weird.I liked how they did more POVs & close-ups in the craft and from within the craft and fewer gods-eye-views. That's a big pet peeve of mine of lamely providing prospectives no one had and they did it well here; also makes it more suitably claustrophobic and violent.I didn't like how brooding they made Armstrong and how Aldrin almost seemed to have a social disorder. The former was more smiley and affable in footage I've seen though he was clearly shy and not the most comfortable in the spotlight, and Aldrin's personality seems exaggerated here to act as an obvious character contrast.Liked the dangerous, uncertain, mysterious, spooky tone it had compared to the boys choir romanticized shlock of Apollo 13. Might improve rewatchability if you can get past the morose Armstrong and excessive focus on family. The film's overall somberness does sort of lend itself I guess to the being-close-to-certain-death aspect that permeates it, like hanging out in an ER for a night.Launch times still too short and still not fully showing trajectory, but are more accurate in this than prior movies like showing vibrating eyeballs. The Gemini 8 scene has a little homage early to the film Contact, which also brought to mind some similarities elsewhere in First Man to Interstellar. The Gemini 8 boarding and launch scene alone will probably get this nominated for Best Sound this year.I would have liked to see some of the living, shaving, pooping, whatever everyday annoying stuff of life in a tin can for a couple days on transit to the moon... constant mind-numbing checklists, cleaning sweat off stuff, complaining about the smell, etc. They're just, boom, all the way to the moon and getting ready for landing. Could have also been an opportunity for the Armstrong and Aldrin thing to have more of an arc beyond just the awe-inspiring and hairy landing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Outstanding!,"A nice fit among 'The Right Stuff', 'Apollo 13', & 'From The Earth To The Moon'. It doesn't attempt to compete, but rather augments them on a more personal experience level. You feel the sense of loss, risks, and even dread involved in the moment, before the outcome is decided and known. You meet Armstrong before the glow of triumph and mission success, when everything was still unproven and in doubt. Also, it captures the home-front extraordinarily well. More melancholy than I expected, but life for any 'hero' is not all roses and well lit paths. Armstrong is an engineer/pilot and compartmentalized personal and professional events at an extraordinary level, as one in his profession should. Gosling executes well, making the viewer feel the weight of the story and events instead of the actor merely displaying the emotions, which would've been a discredit to Armstrong's understated personality and quiet exercise of character.

Spend long lingering moments gazing in very close up shots at the two leads, that way you don't have to bother with any dialogue.2. Instead of bothering with special effects just jiggle the camera around inside what purports to be a tiny manned capsule, keep jiggling it and add some roaring noises and flashing lights, then keep jiggling it uncontrollably, then yes, that's rights, do it all over again ... and again. Whatever you do, don't look out the window or show any external shots. The side benefit is that jiggling a camera is a great way to save money.3. Use that old shakey handheld camera technique and keep shaking it around to pretend everything is authentic - if you like, you can add lots of out of focus shots because of course, that's how the human eye and our perception works doesn't it?This is an awful film, badly made and badly scripted. Worst thing is it is very uninformative. It is so boring you will want to leave half way through, but feel duty bound by the weighty, humourless, seriousness of it all to stay and see it through to the turgid end ..... do yourself a favour and don't bother.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good movie, hated the way it was filmed (zoom, shackines)","The movie was good, the actors were great, and the way it was filmed was terrible. That zoom in all the time was bad, and the shackines of the camera on most of the scenes was not necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Evocative poignant,Saw lots of complaints about claustrophobia and close ups...that is why the film is great it conveys the claustrophobic nature of everything in society at that time the nature of grief and duty and resolve that is as suffocating and inescapable as being locked into a rocket ship launched. Incredible to think this happened half a century ago liked being taken back in time to this truly extraordinary achievement on a day i see tweets coming from the Mars probe just landed...space travel gonna be a long haul... if only we had the Spice!! RG beautifully controlled as usual with the emotional goods delivered in spades when required. And I will seriously never complain about an MRI again.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It's Good,"Rarely do I like a movie about space, because most of the time the movie is boring and there is nothing new and there are not many events, but this movie was not only about space or the moon, I liked it because the movie was autobiographical, so it wasn't all in space and there were poetic events and moments we lived with the character ..As soon as you think about this task, a thousand questions come to your mind and what made him want to do this experiment and what is his goal and personal motives, but what everyone knows is that this man has immortalized his name in history and that this experience is worth all the trouble ..I am used to seeing director Damien's style in his musical films, but his directing has impressed me even here, This talented director is able to put you in the heart of the event, visual and audio enjoyment as soon as you put on the headset and live the atmosphere on its origins, the movie that he saw in the cinema, oh luck ..Let's take a look at his personal life and his family, always behind every great man is a woman, his wife Janet is understanding and patient, steadfast and strong, maybe if a second girl would not accept that her husband is risking his life just because of a difficult experience and process that takes a huge amount of risks, but Janet was supportive despite The features of sadness were present in her eyes, and this is a normal thing for his wife and she is afraid of him because he may go and not return and the risk is high, and also for his two children, the young boy is always more emotional and bears the characteristics of the mother, As for the firstborn son, he is often understanding and bears the characteristics of his father and treats him as if he were his owner, not his father ..Actor Ryan Gosling is a brilliant actor and always gives each role its due from the characters he represents, his nominations for the Oscars were not in vain, and he will take the award in the coming years if he chooses a strong role and masters it to the fullest ..The film is flawed by some exaggerated and repetitive scenes that make you feel bored, but the repetition of the scene of Neil remembering his daughter is the only repetition that was necessary because the girl always has a special place with the father, not with the mother ..My Rating : (7.5/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
10s and 1s,"It's funny how every action and high paced movie fan gave 1 to this movie, while every cinema and acting enjoyer gives it a 10. Literally, there is no between. If you want action and a joke or like a rocket flight in like every 10 minutes you'll not love this movie. But if you want masterpiece cinematography, high technology effects and good storytelling you will love it. Recommend you to read some, about Apollo and gemini missions, it's much better if you can tell what's happening in the film by yourself instead of a side character explaining it in a very complex level that you can't even understand the words of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Beautifully shot with some stellar performances, the only thing that lets 'First Man' down is a few pacing issues","Silence is the first thing that sticks out at me when thinking about 'First Man'. The emotion silence conveys whether during the space scenes or the interactions on Earth, is felt every second. The performances from Gosling and Foy add to this, the sense of dread and the risks associated with the launching of Apollo 11 and it's predecessors is made clear. Although we know they are eventually successful, we still hold our breath in suspense throughout. Gosling's portrayal of Neil Armstrong as a man desperate to succeed despite his personal tragedies resonates, it gives a much deeper look into an aspect of his life that the general audience would have no idea about. It is however, the passage of time that lets this film down slightly. As the 8 or so year period is covered, there are times when certain scenes are much longer than they need to be, as a result the film seems to drag in places. Then at the other end of the spectrum, there are some events and relationships which are brushed over, I would have liked to have seen the family dynamic explored further, as well as the character of Buzz Aldrin. Overall though, 'First Man' boasts exceptional cinematography and packs an emotional punch, succeeding in shining a new light on the life of a hero.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

7.2/10,"I had high expectations for Gosling, and I must say he did deliver.

"Somehow triggered my Agoraphobia, but wowed me","This movie is quite tense at some point, but it's very, very slow at other points.Ryan Gosling played a very good role for Neil Armstrong, and bring his presence to the screen in a big way. If you are looking for a movie to make your kids now want to go to space, have them watch the first half of this movie. If you want them to actually want to space, have them watch the second half. Every time he went into space, I would tense up just because of how the movie portrayed him almost dying a lot.Overall the film was visually beautiful, I would imagine seeing it in IMAX or a similar experience. The only qualms I could find with the cinematography was the shaky camera perspectives in the film. There is very few solid, fluid shots in the film and it gets a little nauseous sometimes",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Sea Of Tranquility,"For every one else it was a mision to the moon for Neil it was a place where he could contemplate the life and loss of his daughter and colleagues. This movie shows the determination and focus needed to not only go to the moon almost did not happen and i think it was 8 people died in those preceding years, but Amstrong still had faith and it might not have been possible without Armstrong. At every stage one small fault could stop this achievement. The people who say it did not happen can't explain why every step taken was tried and tested. The major hurdle to overcome was docking in space and this was achieved. ""They went to the moon and found earth"". The movie was snubbed at oscars for best picture and slatted because it did not show Amstrong planting the American flag but does have the flag on spacesuits. I would have liked to see the flag being planted on surface but we all know thats the original film and this movies is more about Amstronge and he had 10 minutes by himself on the surface and this movie was about his time it does not focus on the story of the other astronauts too much. The movie was a great story and for that alone should have been included in best picture.

Stanley Kubricks version is better,"""First Man"" feels like a heartfelt tribute to Stanley Kubrick-if Kubrick had directed ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with the instruction, ""Make it slower, and add more staring contests with the moon."" You almost expect Ryan Gosling to whip out a camera and start filming the moon landing himself, just to keep the conspiracy theorists happy. It's like Kubrick's ghost whispered in Damien Chazelle's ear, ""Make it epic, but also make it feel like a documentary about watching paint dry in space."" By the end, you're not sure if Armstrong is going to land on the moon or challenge it to a staring contest. Also did Ryan Gosling just forget to act?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A very slow and quiet movie about a very private man.,A very slow and quiet movie about a very private man. Great performances from Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy. The technical aspects of this movie were the standout elements - very worthy of the 4 Oscar nods. My guess is that it will pick up a Sound Award.

You've got to be into the subject,"I'm torn. What do you say about a well made, well directed, and well acted movie that bored the tar out of you? That was bad? It WASN'T bad! That it was unrealistic? But.....it WASN'T unrealistic! What one has when it is rendered down to the basic elements is that if a person is interested in the spacerace or into Ryan Gosling, it's a good one to see. Gosling never seems to disappoint and here is yet another example. He makes it look effortless, and he is so handsome again I just want to hire a Batman villain to invent something to swap faces with him! Let's see you mop up at the box office with MY face Gosling! I digress. Claire Foy nails the understated calm of her screen persona as does really the rest of the cast. The special effects were on point, and i will say that a couple of the action scenes, for example the opening one, were truly riveting. There's another scene wherein Armstrong and another astronaut (I wont say who) are in trouble and need a solution, and I had to pinch myself lest I start believing I was there in person! But this is where I start struggling to dish out accolades. Not because there are no more deserved, but because despite all the above I found myself fast-forwarding. I didn't get invested in this movie like I did in Apollo 13, the movie to which everyone on earth to a person knew that this movie would be compared. Or Damon's movie the Martian, where the leading man's vulnerability and believable self deprecating humor were so endearing. So that's I guess why this one isn't resonating as the others did, and I don't think anyone can really blame anyone for that. As I said before: you've really got to be ""into"" the subject matter because despite getting good grades in direction, plot, screenplay, cinematography, and acting, it just lacked that extra something. And that's why I opened with the question that I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Superb acting. Poor camera work and rushed in places,Who can disagree that the moon landing of 69 is a very interesting topic to cover and it does translate on film. You have got to hand it to the actors as they were superb but for me the shaky camera work was a major distraction. There were also some pacing issues throughout the film where it was a little slow without building on the story or characters. Then we get some overly quick timing between being in space and landing on earth without the fear that those astronauts must've felt during re-entry.Don't get me wrong. I am being critical but I did enjoy the film but it could've been so much more in my opinion. A solid 6/10 7 at a push.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Absorbing,"Film about Apollo 11.

Could have been better if......,Decent casts but I would have changed a few of the actors. Script was good enough. My only real complaint was the background music. Have we lost all of the great people who in the past kept you interested in the movie instead of distracted with how bad it was? I kept turning the volume down only to lose hearing the dialog. This is the second movie this week who failed totally with this. Sad day for the movie industry & viewers. Better music it would have had a higher rating.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Boring,"Ryan Gosling's monoface strikes again... his character was so boring and unsympathetic.It almost looks like the space mission is just a background that gives way to grievings and family drama.

Mankind's Victory,"Man is a creature of the earth. He first found his wings in 1903, leaving the grounds shackles near Kitty Hawk. And only 63 years later, he left his home and set his feet on virgin soil. First Man details the 8 years leading up to Neil Armstrong's historic steps on the moon. The plot prefers the emotional aspects of Armstrong's life, centering on the crater left in his life after his daughter Karen died. Writer Josh Singer uses these poignant moments to peel back Armstrong who was generally stoic during his life. The greater majority of the film is shot without any tripod or stabilizing device, just as unsteady as NASA during the space race.Some might say Ryan Gosling is statuesque in his portrayal of Armstrong. But history remembers a media unfriendly astronaut who maintained calmness under pressure, far from a dramatic character. To offset Goslings stillness, Claire Foy is a hurricane. She is the looking glass into Armstrong's soul, mirroring his torment in her words and action. First Man departs from the static progression of the eight years leading to Apollo 11's touchdown. The editing conveys the time exponentially. It speeds towards the finale and only pauses to let you savor mankind's accomplishment.Be wary not to miss First Man's the theatrical run. The film's potent sound and visuals, pioneered by the same artists who championed Interstellar, are best enjoyed in theatre. A living room TV will not live up to the challenge.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
