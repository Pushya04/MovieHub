One of the greatest action films ever made,"John Woo knows, if anybody, how to make good, stylish action. And that's exactly what this film is; good, cool, stylish action. The plot is great; fairly psychological and quite interesting. It has a fast(and remarkably even) pace, I don't think more than 30 minutes passes at any point in the movie without a giant action scene. All in all, I'd guess there are about four or five major shootouts, and two chase scenes which are each several minutes long(without getting repetitive, fortunately). The acting is excellent; every single major part is well-played. John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain... all give great, entirely believable performances. The best are definitely Travolta and Cage, though; fantastic, truly stellar performances. The characters are all well-written and credible, right down to the most minor one. The action is cool and very stylish, in every single action-scene. The theme of the film is great; of course, the story is completely unlikely, with the face-switching and all, but once you get past that, once you suspend disbelief, you'll most likely enjoy the film thoroughly. The script is excellent, plenty of action, drama, and thriller parts. Also, you gotta love the sharp contrast 3/4's into the movie, with the kid listening to sugary pop-music, while people are shooting intensely at each other. Great film. I recommend it to any fan of John Woo, Nicholas Cage, John Travolta and action films. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Woo's US breakthrough: A triumph!,"FACE/OFFAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSThis magnificent thriller represents director John Woo's triumphant return to the kind of hyperkinetic, emotionally charged film-making which made him such a hot property in the first place. Following the artistic bankruptcy of his first two Hollywood projects, this one is a marriage of high-octane movie-making and mind-twisting narrative complexities. It's also one of the few American action movies which manages to strike a balance between crowd-pleasing set-pieces and domestic interludes, and renders them equally important. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are perfectly matched as hero/villain (and vice versa!), whilst heavyweight theatre actress Joan Allen provides the narrative with much of its dramatic backbone in the role of Travolta's wife (the scene in which she is first confronted with her husband in Cage's body is almost identical to a similar scene in Terence Fisher's FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED [1969]).Technically, the film is a blast, and Woo stages the action highlights with a visual grace and dexterity that is often breathtaking to behold. The climactic speedboat battle is probably the finest set-piece of Woo's career to date, and the script is overflowing with visual and thematic ironies that underscore the action highlights. In fact, the production has arguably more dramatic resonance than any other Hollywood blockbuster of the 1990s, but the dictates of American commercialism mean that Woo is only able to skate over the emotional surface of his characters and their moral dilemmas. The two main protagonists are much too cold and heartless to fully engage the audience's sympathies, and there's nothing here that matches the scorching human drama of, say, BULLET IN THE HEAD (1990). But for all that, FACE/OFF dares to go deeper than your average Hollywood action picture. It's clever, witty and thrilling, and it manages to accomplish the difficult task of feeding the brain whilst entertaining the eye.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
a great action experience,"From director John Woo comes this exhilarating action movie that takes a deadly cat-and-mouse game to the next level! A tortured federal agent, haunted by a painful tragedy and obsessed with catching the slick sociopathic terrorist who's eluded him for years and years, is forced to take the face of his mortal enemy in order to acquire vital information. The daring plan quickly goes awry when he loses his own identity in the process, and discovers his arch-enemy is cohabiting with his family. Film's enjoyment depends on the viewer: you'll either condemn the story as absurd and far-fetched, or you'll buy into it and go along for this supercharged, over-the-top action extravaganza. Travolta and Cage are both extraordinarily good, and with Woo at the helm you know that you'd better hang on for dear life! Occasionally silly, with a plot that tosses credibility out the window, but still a helluva lot of fun. ***",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Corny. Crazy. Cool.,"Face/Off is amazing because it mixes an outrageously cornball plot with some of the best acting in an action movie.  How John Woo pulled it off is beyond me.  His visual imagery is flamboyant and decorative, yet never fails to deliver the goods.  There is always a flurry of images to grasp our attention.  Granted, his typical trademarks are here, but never does the script suffer from the same problems as in his other works.Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are phenomenal in their dual roles each.  The rest of the cast isn't very deep and is more filler than anything else.  The editing job feels underdone, particularly when the action sequences get to the ""overcooked"" staged.  Still, how many speedboat chases or airplane crashes are you going to see in a slow-motion?Overall, a summer action movie that delivers in acting, directing, and most other departments.  4 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
As dumb as they come but twice as fun.,"I guess this is what people mean when they say ""so bad, it's good"". In reality, the phrase simply means ""dumb but fun"" because if the film is good, then it, inherently, can't be bad. I suppose the phrase could also refer to a bad film that one enjoys regardless of its sub-par nature, but even this is slightly flawed logic: art is subjective and if you think a film is good, then it is good (there are no 'guilty pleasures'). In any case, John Woo's 'Face/Off (1997)' is an expertly-made piece of 'B-movie' entertainment, one with a well-written script that may be silly but is only smartly so. It's as 'schlocky' as it is precise. That is to say that it's as dumb as they come but it's twice as fun. Every moment feels hand-crafted to be just as over-the-top as it needs to, sublimely toeing the line between self-serious and almost satirical, and the overall result is undeniably a blast. From the extended, smoky set-pieces to the balls-to-the-wall but emotive performances to Woo's ostentatious auteur signatures, the picture just flies by and keeps you smiling, essentially, every step of the way. Travolta as Cage and Cage as Travolta is as iconic and complex a cinematic pairing as there has ever been and it is pulled off impeccably. I'd even go so far as to say this is Cage's best performance, as he excels in both of his roles. Travolta is fine, but he stands out far more when he's in his villainous position. Still, the characters, quite remarkably, always come before the actors (the protagonist always seems like the protagonist, no matter who is playing him and vice versa). Indeed, there are actually some pretty intelligent ideas at play here and the way in which the narrative undercuts itself at certain points really is inspired. At the same time, though, the plot itself doesn't necessarily hold up to all that much scrutiny outside of its basic beats and requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief even within its own world. At the end of the day, I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a surprisingly good feature that takes the best elements of its disparate aspects and mashes them together rather successfully. It's entertaining. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
John and Nicholas make quite a pair in Face/Off,"""Face/Off"" is an excellent movie that will never get out of your head, it's that memorable. I saw this movie probably 6 or 7 years ago and I still think about it and finally bought it the other day.The performances, this is it, folks. We have two of the finest and very popular actors: John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. These two are amazing, to transfer back and forth. John had to go from this kind, loving, and very sensitive man to a looney, cold-blooded, heartless maniac. Nicholas went from being the scary and perverted psycho to a helpless and struggling man trapped in this killer's body. My kudos to Nicholas, that was a tough performance to capture. I felt his pain, no one would believe that he was Sean Archer, who would after all? His body has been kidnapped from Castor Troy who is now playing around with his job, his daughter, and his wife. I felt so scarred for him, because I cannot imagine in a million years what that must feel like, the isolation, the abuse, and the feeling of utter helplessness. In my opinion, these are one of the best performances in 1997. The supporting cast of: Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, and Alessandro Nivola add so much, you get into the film entirely.This is a very scary movie. This is identity theft gone terribly wrong and beyond any borders. I loved this movie and any other film fanatic will definitely enjoy it as well. It has great action, drama, romance, and dark comedy that bring together a terrific film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Woo Never Saw An Explosion He Didn't Like,"Yes, make no mistake: this is a very entertaining, very stylish film, done by Hong Kong action guru John Wood and featuring two fine actors. However, its almost too much to watch in one viewing. It just wears you out! If this film was cut from 140 minutes to 120 it would have been much easier to watch.Woo's action scenes includes tons of explosions and breaking glass. This director just can't get enough of those explosion scenes. Some of those segments are excellent but many of them go on too long, particularly at the end of the film where it went on what seemed like forever.The best part of the film are the two lead actors and the interchangeable characters they play. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage are extremely entertaining in here. If they kept the story more about those guys and their switched identities and didn't have eight thousand explosions, this could have a super movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Face/Off, a master piece of the 90's, is a must watch film","Face/Off, a master piece of the 90's, is a must watch film. This sweeping drama stars two paragons of Hollywood, Oscar Winner, Nicolas Cage, and John Travolta, of Michael fame. Nicolas Cage knows no bounds when playing a cheeky, but unsettling, Castor Troy, yet is able to capture family man Sean Archer with a profound execution. Not to be outdone, John Travolta's daring portrayal of Caster brings out this family man's inner demons. When one hoodwinks the other, the game is afoot. All in all, Cage and Travolta deliver a performance that dances into our souls that would make Curious George and The Man With The Yellow Hat proud. However, John Travolta's actual dancing is sorely missed from this film. Despite this sole flaw, this IS a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

getting philosophical about an action film,"First of all, this is an action film; if anyone wants to see a movie challenging intelectualy, please watch something else. As an action film, this should be viewed and judged among its so to say 'species' - and as for me - it gets 5/5.Why?I'm pondering on it myself. I'm a girl; I should hate action movies and go watch romantic comedies instead (yuck!). I should search the screen for handsome hunks with bare torso and do other crazy, girlish things like that. 'Face/Off' doesn't have handsome men (come on! Travolta in his 40's and the ever sad, puppy-eyed Cage? No fun!). So what is in this film, that makes me watch it whenever I have a chance?Let's see. The plot - no big deal. Good guy, bad guy, tragedy in the past, revenge, remorse etc. Been there, done that, in dozens of movies before. So what is there left?Actors. Travolta playing Cage and vice versa. Fun to watch, especially Travolta the good bad guy (or the other way round, the bad good guy). Gershon - liked her in 'Bound', now she's straight. Too bad there's so little of her.Directing. It's Johny Woo. It was the first film by him I saw, it stayed with me a long way. Why other directors can't stage a simple scene the way he does it - beats me. It's pure poetry; the music, the motion - at one time You forget the people are shooting there, because it all looks like a ballet... Yet, it's 'just' an action film; there's no need in getting too philosophical about it...Or is there?The split personality. The fact that your worst enemy knows you better than you know yourself... Oh, stop it. It's just an action film.I wish more action films were like that. Wishful thinking?...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
In my top 3 best Movies.,"What can I say?! One of the best movies I have ever seen. The Storyline is superb, and the acting is of the finest actors there is. Cage and Travolta deserve Oscars for their performances; how Cage changed from a murdering criminal to a determined good cop in the way he did, I will never know.Another great element of this film is the action: Guns, knives, grenade launchers, AK-47s and so on! Some of the greatest gun fights I have ever seen in any movie take place here, specifically the the cop vs criminal fight in the mansion, is it? Anyway, these are just a few things I have mentioned that put this in my top 3 movies.

The Cinema of John Woo.,"Face Off (1997) would mark the last time John Woo would show flashes of his former self in a mainstream Action film (I don't care what people say, Black Jack was quite interesting). The movie reunites John Travolta and John Woo in another action flick. This time he acts opposite of Nicolas Cage (Coppola) in a tale about dopplegangers, hidden sides and secrets. The action scenes are filmed quite well but they lack something that I can't explain and the stunt work is too obvious. John Woo also digs deep into his past work to re-use a lot of his older action set pieces. But is the film watchable?Two rivals ,one an Fedeal Agent(John Travolta) and the other a Worldwide wanted criminal(Nicolas Cage) have a blood feud that has reached it's limits. When the two finally have it out in a high impact fire fight outside an airport, one is captured whilst the is showered with praises. But it doesn't end just there. What happens next has to be seen to be believed.Not a true classic like his earlier films, but this will be the best it'll ever get for mainstream John Woo. Without an action director to direct the scenes, Woo's films are nothing more than a shell of his former self. Maybe he should spend a few shekels and hire him for future film projects. Until then we'll just have to settle for rehashed action scenes from a director who just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Maybe he should go back to making comedies or learned more form his mentor Chang Cheh.Recommended for fans of John Woo's Hollywood work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"This aged terribly, but it's fun","Growing up in the 90s, I had heard this movie mentioned by a lot of average joes as being an awesome movie, commonly revered in conversation. The core of my formative movie-viewing experience comes from this time period (late-90s to early-2000s). But I missed this one.I often watch old movies and have no problem adjusting my expectations to the time period, almost all movies are timeless to me.However, I first watched this in 2012 and...my goodness...the action is severely dated and so over-the-top and awful it comes off as campy. The single-sample-non-variant gunfire audio alone is enough to make me laugh; they should update these sounds if/when they make a 4K transfer. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. The above doesn't help when the main plot is already trying to walk a fine line between acceptable and ridiculous, and there are enough plot holes to drive a boat chase through. Throw in Nicholas Cage and John Travolta, who at the time were not both widely panned by critics (personally I like them sometimes), and you have something...epic. Not ""epic"" as in a great movie, but ""epic"" in an entertaining and different way.I assume Hollywood will probably reboot this movie in the coming decade. Could be good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant. High Class Action.,"Possibly John Woo's greatest American film yet. Watching it brings out my emotions from start to finish and the action scenes were done with the style of a master director known as John Woo. Even though he has made some movies that are not that impressive, it seems that he uses the style of A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2, the emotions of The Killer and the action of Hard Boiled, and incorporates all of this to make one awesome blockbuster featuring top actors such as John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. These two actors make the movie work and if Woo used different actors it would not have worked. Travolta and Cage changing roles from good to bad and bad to good is superb as both actors change their emotions as the characters change their identities. A must see for all John Woo and action fans and definitely the movie to have as a collectors item.

Quite possibly the best action movie ever made!,"I had high expectations for the movie ""Face/0ff"" directed by John Woo. Woo's previous movies like Broken Arrow and Hard Boiled were fast-paced, action packed movies. I expected Face/Off to maintain the same standard that Woo's previous movies had. After watching Face/Off, I was convinced that it had surpassed his earlier movies by far. Not only are the action sequences and special effects literally spectacular and breath-taking, but the story-line is also entertaining.I will not spoil the contents of the movie, unlike other reviews, but I will praise John Woo for making one of the best(if not the best) action flick of the 90's. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage display their talent beautifully, and supporting actors like Gina Gershon and Alessandro Nivola also contribute to making this is a highly enjoyable movie experience.Face/Off is A MUST for all action lovers as well as all other movie lovers.

A very nice action movie with plenty of breathtaking moments,"It's been a while since I've had some good fun with an action movie that didn't annoy me too much for I don't know what reasons. And I have to admit: even though it didn't have the strongest start, ""Face/Off"" gave me a very good time thanks to the very good acting from John Travolta and Nicholas Cage and the interesting directing and camera work by John Woo.Sean Archer (Travolta) is an FBI agent who has been chasing Caster Troy (Cage) for six years. He has been chasing Troy for six years, because Troy tried to shoot Archer and was able to hit him, but ended up killing Archer's son instead. When Archer finally succeeds in apprehending Troy, Troy tells him that, even though Archer arrests him, he has lost anyway, because Troy has planted a bomb somewhere. First they are convinced that he's bluffing, but when they arrest Troy's brother Pollux, they find out he was telling the truth and that there is a biological bomb somewhere. To find out where exactly, Archer will have to do something that has never been done before. Because Caster got in a deep coma and his fellows (who are all in jail now) think he's dead, Archer will take over his face. Thanks to some experimental cosmetic surgery, doctors are able to peel of Troy's face and put it on Archer's head. Archer, who now looks like Troy, goes to the jail, tries to find out everything about the bomb by questioning ""his"" accomplices, but of course something goes wrong. Troy awakes from his coma, takes over Archer's face (which was being preserved for the duration of the mission) and takes over Archer's life...In the beginning, the movie isn't all that excellent. Only when both men have switched faces and identity, the real fun starts, reaching a climax during the last 45 minutes. Then there is plenty of action in the movie and often John Woo has portrayed it in a very original and spectacular way. But the real stars of this movie are Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. In the beginning of the movie I thought they weren't exactly casted perfectly. I thought it would be better for Cage to play the FBI agent and Travolta the terrorist (I didn't know yet what was to come), and was very pleased to see them play each other afterwards. It's very clear that they had a lot of fun doing that, which is very positive for the movie.All in all this was one of the best action movies I've seen lately. And despite the fact that the beginning wasn't the strongest, I still had some great fun with it. That's why I give it a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

90s favorites ain't what they used to be...,"In 1997, at the cinema, I remember thinking this was the coolest and most awesome movie ever made... 16-year-old me thought the plot was phenomenal, the excessive violence and grotesque stunts were amazing, and the hostile chemistry between two of the contemporary most popular action heroes was exhilarating.Almost 30 years later, and although still regarded as a genuine 90s classic, I have very mixed feelings towards ""Face/Off"". The only thing I still truly enjoyed were the performances of Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, but it might actually be more related to the fact that both men have made a full-time career out of starring in trashy R-rated popcorn action movies nowadays. ""Face/Off"" is considered a highlight in both their careers, but apart from the higher budget and acclaimed director, there isn't much difference with titles like ""I Am Wrath"", ""The Fanatic"" (both Travolta), ""Primal"" or ""A Score to Settle"" (both Nic Cage).The plot I once thought was awesome doesn't make a lick of sense, really. If set in a dystopian future, like originally intended, it would be more acceptable. Facial transplants in the 1990s, however, are downright absurd. Luckily this film was blessed with the leadership of visionary director John Woo, who was a) intelligent enough to leave out all the surgical improbabilities and continuity lapses, b) experienced enough to overcompensate the massive plot holes with explosive action footage, and c) rational enough to never allow the story aspects to dominate over the fun parts.Repeating myself, the most entertaining quality of ""Face/Off"" was - and still is - the sight of Hollywood's two most flamboyant, eccentric, and unscrupulous actors playing each other. Seeing John Travolta as Nicolas Cage, and vice versa, almost makes this film a parody. An extremely violent & stylishly directed parody, but a parody, nevertheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Wow....this one is good,"This one has a tough job of convincing the audience that the main characters, Travolta and Cage, could swap faces via plastic surgery and still be convincing as one another. It works! Woo has a certain style down-the long flowing robes, slow mo shootouts, orchestral hype in the background, furious shoot outs, explosions, etc.  Essentially a more stylish Bruckheimer movie if ya think about it.I have always liked the Bald guy and Gina Gershon here the most from the supporting cast, and enjoyed the way both the leads got to 'understand' the others' family, way of life, friends, etc.  You have to like how Castor gets Travolta's girl to learn knife fighting, for example, or seeing the camaraderie of Cage's group.Good shootouts and action, sometimes the conceits here are quite far flung, but you can live with that as an audience.

Really Freaky Friday,"It may lack the skills at times to bring its larger than life story to the big screen, but ultimately Face/Off is an interesting action/sci-fi/thriller that uses its cast to the best of its ability despite some noticeable flaws. For the most part, I really enjoyed Travolta and Cage in this. Cage is excellent in both parts, both pre-surgery and after, while Travolta lacks the ability to harness his characters dramatic arches to a more believable level. Some of the action scenes can be a bit tedious, especially because they are so many of them, but the ones toward the end are rather entertaining to watch unfold and quite a spectacle at times. I enjoy a lot of the themes it plays around with, especially the psychological ideas of being in each characters situation and how we get to see the film from their point of view. It's an interesting piece, and it certainly doesn't hit the mark right every time, but its concept (although maybe better than the film itself) does carry the film to some interesting heights that not many films of this type would dare to achieve- especially in such a subtle manner. It has some predictable moments, some formulaic tendencies, but in the end I enjoyed it for what it was- flaws and all.

"""Face/Off"" - Identity crisis?","A movie about a hockey match, this isn't.1997's ""Face/Off,"" the third (and to this date, most successful) American feature from Hong Kong action director John Woo, is everything a fan of Woo's Asian work could possibly hope for. It's a loud, fast-paced, and spectacularly violent epic helmed by a master craftsman. And even with this ambitious third American feature, it is vastly on par with the director's Hong Kong work and is very easily one of the best films of his career.Woo made a name for himself back in Asia as the director of hyper-stylized, hard-hitting pot-boiler action films like ""The Killer"" (1989) and ""Hard Boiled"" (1992), where he made an art form of dual-pistol-wielding gun-play and action shoot-'em-up. You want action? John Woo is your man to go to. He made his first American feature with Jean-Claude Van Damme in ""Hard Target"" (1993) and followed it up with ""Broken Arrow"" in 1996. Now we're at ""Face/Off.""""Face/Off"" stars a daring and intrepid Los Angeles F.B.I. agent named Sean Archer (John Travolta), who for the last six years has been on the trail of psycho freelance terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) after he killed Archer's young son. So when Archer finally captures Troy (who's put into a coma as a result) within the film's opening 20 minutes, Archer thinks it's the last of his arch-nemesis.But of course it's not over, not by a long shot. The screenplay by writers Mike Webb and Michael Colleary throws us a curve-ball in the form of something write out of a sci-fi medical novel: to save L.A. from biological annihilation, Archer must become his enemy and learn the location of said biological payload. Archer trades physical identities with Troy bu undergoing a radical surgical procedure to get Troy's sociopath younger brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) to give up the goods.However, Troy comes out of his coma and assumes Archer's identity as an F.B.I. man, a job he comes to love and abuses with joyful glee, and even gets cozy with Archer's neglected wife Eve (Joan Allen) and daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain). His first move is to destroy all the evidence that proves each man's true identity and seemingly leaves no way to reverse the procedures when he kills everyone involved in the mission (how sick and twisted is he, anyway?). His next plan is to systematically eliminate his old allies to afford protection for himself and his brother. In the meantime, Archer (as Castor) is left to rot in a federal prison that the Geneva Convention doesn't know exists and has to find a way to get out to defeat his nemesis once and for all, even if it means actually ""becoming"" him, and using Troy's old buddies to his advantage. You want to talk about identity crisis?10 years after its release, this movie is still as balletic and energetic, action-packed and exciting as it was all those years ago. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were perfectly cast as the perfect hero and perfect villain in what was one of the hottest action movies of that year. The only problem is, though, both actors enjoy switching their roles and playing off each other in a vicious blood feud, although it seems that Travolta was having the most fun here, leaving Cage a little hard-pressed to remain on the sidelines as the hero. Hot off their success in movies such as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995), Travolta revels in Cage's bad guy performance (even if Cage is Cage and Travolta is Travolta - for only about 20 minutes each). Coldly sadistic and over-the-edge/brave and determined, you can tell who likes things best.The film's action scenes, which there are plenty of, is where ""Face/Off"" chiefly excels at. Woo brings much of the gusto and gun-play loved by so many in his native land to a place that's foreign. Perhaps this is why his two earlier efforts may have been failures here in the U.S. (Yet, third time's a charm, right?) As if crises of identity weren't enough, Woo seemed to be going through a transformation himself, adjusting his craft for American audiences.But with ""Face/Off,"" Woo proves to be at the top of his game, since he has the right actors, the right action and special effects, and the right stuff to pull it all off.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The perfect action movie.,"This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more.

"A fast paced, high octane, action thriller.","Face/Off, a great action movie was what I first looked for. Then I realized that this movie offers so much more. This is definately one of those invasion of privacy thrillers where even though its completely absurd about the face switching thing ( maybe its in the future or something) you still question the fact that maybe all isn't what it seems. Probably the most intriguing thing about the movie is how Cage and Travolta's characters not only switch faces but also how the lives around them are invaded and corrupted. The movie offers some great shoot-outs, which is why I love the movie, but the boat chase at the end seems out of place in an intelligent movie like this. Its not a movie where just because its the end, everything has to blow up( thats what the middle of the movie is for). I believe that the movie was great and it holds very high in my books.

Best action film Ever!!!,"Out of all the action films I have ever seen this has to be the best of the lot.  The action scenes are amazing especially playing 'chicken' with the plane and the speed boat scene towards the end.

"In order to catch him, he must become him.","FBI Special Agent Sean Archer tries to find a biological weapon placed in Los Angeles by a sadistic terrorist-for-hire and criminal mastermind named Castor Troy. Archer has hunted Troy for the last 8 years, and is consumed by revenge because Troy is responsible for the death of Archer's son. To do this, Archer must ""borrow"" Troy's face using a surgical procedure to go undercover as Troy, but things go wrong when Troy assumes the identity of Archer.Having already seen other John Woo's film than ""Face/Off,"" I was expecting a big, popcorn blockbuster to forget about at the end of the credits. Well, I was wrong. In fact, this movie surprised me. In fact, this is John Woo's best film to date.This film surprised me by how shocking it is. Some of the things that happen in this movie is indescribable. Other things that happen in this movie never even happened in any other action movies I've ever seen. The ideas used in this film is ingenious. What I would add to that is that this is one of the most emotionally-charged action film I've ever seen in my life.And no, this is no joke. This film is depressing from the scene in the beginning. It gets even more depressing and even more depressing. How does it end? Of course, I won't tell you. You'll have to see it for yourself. The action scenes, for all the love I have for them, are just too much in here. It's pretty much overkill during the last scenes in this film.However, it's not sad to say the action scenes in here are fantastic. Now going to the performances: Have you ever seen a film where two characters switch each other's places and have them act as their other character, yet you don't believe the authenticity in there? Well, in this film, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage won me over. They played their other characters so well, that you find yourself thinking if they're really the other character. I know, it gets confusing. But this is an accomplishment.""Face/Off"" isn't just a popcorn, summer, action flick. It's a darn good one. The characters are diverse.

"Has great moments, and some not as great moments too","First off, let me say that this is a good movie. The direction from John Woo is awesome, the action scenes are well filmed, the acting is good, and this is a one of a kind movie.The problem is that the action scenes are drawn out to the point where they can become way too long. With movies like this, it doesn't matter how much action there is, it just has to end at some point in time. One scene that everyone says is great is the boat chase at the end. There is a lot of shooting and explosions in the boat chase, but there is another movie that I saw a similar boat chase in. That movie is called Patriot Games. I think Patriot Games is a great, but highly underrated movie. The speed boat chase in the end of that movie was dark, intense, and action packed. The speed boat chase in this movie was intense and action packed, but seemed like too much of a cliché. The only other bad thing about this movie is that at times, the script isn't very well written and the conversations can become unrealistic.Those were the so so parts that I mentioned above, now I will mention the good parts. The action scenes are intense and they are awesome. This is a creative movie, especially with the way that a maniac terrorist and a secret agent swap identities. I haven't seen any other movies that are based around that premise. In one of John Woo's other films called Mission: Impossible 2, there is a scene involving masks to hide identities, but in that movie, it gets very confusing.Nicholas Cage is great as a maniac terrorist, and John Travolta is great as a secret agent, but they are even better when they are both on the screen at the same time.This is worth watching, and there is plenty of action. Despite a few of those not very good parts that I mentioned, this has plenty to like, and I'm sure you'll like it too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The most overrated film of '97.,"How is it possible that a film containing one of the most incredibly STUPID plot holes, logic leap, dumb trick - call it what you like - can be so popular?

And then this film becomes really lousy.Yeah yeah, great action - I've seen better. Great performance? NOOOOOO, just have a look at the scene where Cage says ""I'm going to take his face ... off"", that's AWFUL!There is only one part that I fully enjoyed. That's when Cage's character discovers just what the prison he is placed in is... That's great. I just wish I had seen it in another movie.

"Preposterous fun  big, loud and exciting with a master at the helm","Sean Archer is the head of a special unit set up to hunt down master criminal Caster Troy.  In an airport shootout Archer puts Troy in a coma and captures his brother Pollux.  Archer then discovers that Troy has planted a bomb in LA, yet Pollux refuses to reveal where it is.  With time running out Archer is offered a terrible option - to switch faces with Troy and have surgery to alter his body shape.  After the surgery Archer goes undercover in prison to learn the location of the bomb.  However when in prison, Troy awakes from his coma, forces the doctors to give him Archer's face, kills everyone who knows about the mission and assumes Archer's life.  Trapped in prison, Archer is forced to escape from prison and join with Troy's gang to expose Troy - mayhem ensues.This was Woo's third American film and it was the one he finally struck gold with.  The story is simply daft - don't try to pick holes in it because it's far too easy to do.  What makes the film is that the plot is glossed over by sheer spectacle and great action - you barely have a moment to catch your breath, never mind pick holes in the plot.  The action is fantastic throughout - plenty of trademark slow-mo, diving with two guns etc and all given such style.  In his other US films it all felt like Woo-lite, however here he is allowed to do just what he wants.  OK - the plot may not stand up in repeated viewing, but the action is superb!Travolta and Cage both have great fun playing each other - they mange to swap roles really well.  Travolta has the most fun as he gets to ham it up as Troy for most of the time, but Cage has the better role as he plays the `good guy' for most of it.  Allen and Gershon are both good as the protagonist's partners but have little to do in this man's world.  Really it's all about Cage and Travolta and Woo - nobody else really matters.Overall this may not be a great film due to the weakness of it's plot, but it is still a superb action movie.  Most action movies have poor plots - but not all can provide the huge amount of action and fun that Face/Off does. Fantastic!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Would have been better...,"Great performances by Travolta and Cage.  Good premise pulled off neatly in a new, original way.  But all the gunfire and explosions kind of got in the way of the story.

Actually, it's a bit of a shame, because Cage has such a good time as Castor Troy in the opening few minutes that you kind of wish he didn't have to relinquish the part.

Nice Suit,"""Face/Off"" is the tale of Shawn Archer (John Travolta) hunting down the killer of his son Michael six years after the fact. But when Travolta finally catches the killer (Nicolas Cage), he learns about a bomb that will destroy Los Angeles. The only way to find and defuse the bomb is to surgically steal the face of Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) and infiltrate his den of murderers.The effects of this film are great, first of all. Whoever designed the removed faces made them so lifelike I was quite shocked. In the same part of the film where a laser is creating a new ear for a man, I was very impressed. The explosions were also nice, though nothing you won't see in every other action film. Some things required suspended disbelief, because I find it hard to believe that Cage's character could have stolen Travolta's face, body and voice without anyone stopping him and then afterwards without Travolta's wife and kids catching on. And the fact their body types are so dissimilar. But whatever.John Travolta can't act as usual (although when he is supposed to be Cage in Travolta's body he does pretty well)... but Nicolas Cage picks up his slack. Cage in a porno mustache? Yes! Cage as a sexually deviant, dancing priest? Yes! Cage with a bomb that has a big glowing Jolly Roger on it? Yes! Cage being crazy delicious? Oh yes, yes, yes! Why is Dominique Swain wearing crimped hair? But besides that, good choice to play the teenage daughter (especially with ""Lolita"" coming out the same year). I'm sure more than a few people paused or rewatched her key scenes a few times.Two cool scenes: shooting the mirrors, where each must confront themselves as the other to destroy the other as themselves. And the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" montage... so beautifully out of place! While the ending is incredibly sick in my opinion (some would call it heartwarming), overall this delivers everything an action picture should. Maybe it needed less Travolta and more Dominique Swain, but the Cage made the bitter pill go down like a peach.Everything you are going to want from a John Yoo film.

Which it was originally written as a Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller. But director Woo and screenwriters changed the premise sightly to be in modern today instead. Travolta and Cage are extremely good in their roles by giving heart and soul to this excellent action movie. These two actors are also having an great time playing these characters Over the Top as well. Woo is an expert for creating memorable dynamic action sequences and as well making these characters human as well. There's one stand-out sequence, when the point of view of a little boy (David McCurley) is listening to ""Over the Raindow"" while watching People getting killed all over him is unexpectedly touching and beautiful in a dark way.The DVD is a 10th anniversary edition, which this DVD is a 2-Disc Set. Disc One has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an aggressively loud DTS 6.1 Expanded Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 Ex). Disc one includes an running commentary by the director and the two screenwriters Mike Werb (Darkman 3:Die Darkman Die, Curious George, The Mask) & Michael Colleary (Firehouse Dog, Lara Croft:Tomb Raider). Disc 1 also has an other commentary track by the screenwriters and as well Deleted Scenes with optional commentary by the filmmakers. Disc 2 includes an fascinating one-hour documentary of the film with many new interviews with the cast & crew (expect for Travolta and Cage, sadly ""although vintage interviews was used in the DVD""), 25 minute documentary of the films of John Woo and the original theatrical trailer. This film certainly made an impact, once it was release in the summer of 1997 and it went on to have an huge following. Once it released on Video and DVD. This film is still John Woo's best American film to date. I think it's one of those films that Woo will have an hard time to top this one. Because this is an extraordinary picture. Don't miss it. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit parts, including an young Thomas Jane as a prisoner, John Bloom (Better known as Joe Bob Briggs) and Danny Masterson as a Would-Be Rapist.

Best of Cage and Travolta,"This is one of the early Nicholas Cage movie that I like. Him and John Travolta swaps position by swapping faces of each other, but the evil Travolta has hard time convincing his daughter that he's still the same dad that she knows.Cage has a problem convincing that he's actually the good guy. Movie features good plot, suspense, and great acting by Cage and Travolta.Usually when two strong actors gets together, the plot gets murky because focus of the story goes between them. Nicholas Cage is one actor that seems to be able to work his way around the personalities of any actor he co-stars with. The story flows seamlessly between this rather confusing exchange of faces and characters in my opinion due to the flexibility of his style.

Fantastic Sci-Fi Thriller.,"First, bravo with the concept. Even my dreams couldn't fathom an exchange of faces as such. Agreed that it explains my plebeian stature, but the point is that this sci-fi thriller had the one most important thing of all sci-fi thrillers, the Sci-Fi, bang on target. This is my second favourite action movie after ""The Rock"". I'm a huge fan of Nicolas Cage. And Cage perfectly redeems that faith inside me. Every Cage movie for me seems to have the smartest punch-lines. This one again was no less.Cage and Travolta do an exchange of faces(literally!) after the former, a high profile con-man falls prey to a super cop's(Travolta) vengeance who seeks to unveil the con-mans diabolical machinations. How they exchange faces is something that the movie alone can enunciate ! Both Cage and Travolta do an immensely pleasing job with their respective characters and even with the exchanged boots. One of the greatest action movie directors of our time, John Woo certainly needs no more labels. From the Learjet to the Oil Steamer, its quality action all way long.

"Behind the shots, explosions and its lunatic concept, ""Face Off"" explores its characters and their rivalry, giving emotional charge and tension to each exchanged lead","Directed by John Woo and written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, ""Face Off"" follows federal agent Sean Archer's (Travolta) hunt for terrorist Castor Troy (Cage). When the criminal is left in a coma after finally being captured, Archer must find out where he planted a bomb in Los Angeles. For that, the plan is dangerous, daring and... absurd: through a surgical procedure, Archer literally uses Troy's face to impersonate him and get the information.When Woo presented his new ""style"" of action with long and very well-choreographed shooting sequences that was titled ""gun fu"" and a use of a dramatic and poetic slow motion - it was a great sensation in the then ""Hong Kong cinema"". "". He made famous films in China, such as ""O Matador"" (1989) and ""Fervura Máxima"" (1992), which made Woo famous and turned actor Chow Yun-Fat into a star. It wasn't long before Woo made his way to the US, which he did in 1993 to film ""The Target"" with Belgian star Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, the success of both public and critics, only came with his third feature filmed in foreign lands: ""Face Off"" (1997) with stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. It's easy to look at this production and classify the film as a ridiculous story full of crazy ideas, after all, we're talking about a work where the two main characters literally exchange faces. But the feature deserves more appreciation than the ""absurd premise action movie"" of the 1990s, because ""Face Off"" is much deeper and insightful than ""just"" fun and brainless features like ""A Rocha"" and ""Con Air - The Escape Route"" (interestingly, all starring Cage).John Woo is at full throttle at the helm of the production, bringing his trademark slow motion with flying pigeons, dual-weapon dives, big stunts and snappy shots. His direction is extremely stylized and hyperkinetic, but the director is also more restrained and organized in his decoupage compared to his oriental films, also having the well-ordered composition of the montage that accompanies the choreographies with great geographical sense and stimulating sensations. The director also takes advantage of Hollywood's large budget to include extremely creative and outsized set-pieces, such as a helicopter chasing a plane or the climatic crash of speedboats, where Woo has complete control of the chaos. There are also improbable and imaginative scenarios, such as a high-security prison where inmates wear magnetized boots.Every directorial excess and exaggeration is well thought out for a language of entertainment and fun, and the same goes for the script and character arcs. In the first instance, the exchange of faces works as a great subversive element in narratives of this order, giving a different flavor to your typical cat and mouse game between police and criminal. Forget the absurdity of the premise, and think about its narrative effect, how it inverts the roles of the characters and presents the spectator with unthinkable scenarios for the villain and the hero, how it creates torturous and tense situations like that of the villain kissing the woman who's murdered the son. It's a pretty nerve-racking thriller when you stop to reflect on the screen unfolding and how Archer is trapped for a large portion of the story.The director turns violence into a dance. It is noticed that all the scenes are more than studied and calculated in all the possible details. The pursuits, by land, air and sea, seem to obey Maestro Woo's command as if they understood grace and harmony. The director's competence for these sequences is already known and it is in this film that he creates yet another anthological scene for the history of cinema. Amidst a hail of gunfire, a boy hears ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on his Walkman. The detail is that, at a given moment, we have the vision, and the hearing, of the boy for that whole scene. One notes, then, the power of seduction of the music which, in this case, makes the choreography of violence beautiful. For what it sets out to do, distract, amuse, entertain, ""Face Off"" is competent, but the viewer is left with the feeling of deception when one sees the adventures of high-tech medicine at the FBI.It's at this point that ""Face Off"" becomes a dramatically intelligent film. The science is ridiculous and the story isn't complex, but there's certainly depth. Archer's transformation into his archenemy is practically an allegory for his feelings of obsession and revenge, something very well explored in the work from the murder of his son to the final scene of family reconciliation. In this dialogue, Troy literally says the phrase to Archer, but the villain's face had already been chasing him for years like a ghost, giving the work its metaphorical charge about mirroring and the feud between opposing men, in a story essentially about mourning, guilt and overcoming. Archer truly defeats Troy when he overcomes his remorse (the scar scene) and when he shows compassion (raising Troy's son).For all this mosaic of flashy action, melodramas and suspense, the performances of Cage and Travolta are fundamental, for better or for worse. Both actors play the antagonist in a cartoonish, over-the-top way with lots of bizarre looks and facial expressions (especially Cage's histrionics), which partly works for the 007 drug villainy aspect of the story, but which also brings something comically ridiculous. And embarrassing (which is unknown if it is completely intentional). It is in the dramatic scenes that the stars do better, in Archer's melancholy and distress, with special emphasis on Cage in the most heartbreaking moments of the feature (and also in the most absurd ones, like his block waking up from the faceless coma).The film, at the end of the day, is a premise that lends itself to a renaissance with similar star power, like Andy Lau and Tony Leung in ""Internal Conflicts"", and then Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Departed"". In each example, men on opposite sides of the law try to disguise themselves, generating tension with high stakes. However, only one of these films is truly about anything more than that: the fable ""Inner Conflicts"". It's also a dark crime drama, and ""The Departed"" and ""Face Off"" are more fun. This comes close to the main criterion by which every film should be judged: how well do they follow their premise? How well are they themselves? In the case of ""The Departed,"" its awards buzz was heavily influenced by the long-awaited Best Picture Martin Scorsese. His film lacks the same theological musings as the original (ironic, for the director), but it is an effectively suspenseful thriller. ""Face Off"" trades suspense for spectacle, but it also works as an action movie that makes you think - not smart. Are the performances good? Technically, they are exaggerated. So, the question is whether they're the right performances, whether they're fun. That's all that really matters, and the answer is, of course it does.The script written by the duo Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, as you can see, is forced and has many holes: Troy's companions do not suspect that it is not him, in fact there is even a logic, since Archer hunted Troy for six years and must have a psychological profile on the terrorist, but Archer's family and colleagues not suspecting the change in behavior of a melancholy figure like Archer, it makes no sense. Not to mention the ""revolutionary technique"" that transplants a face in a millimetric ally perfect way, without any scars and in just a few minutes... What about the scene in which Castor Troy gets up from the stretcher without the skin on his face in the hospital? It's a movie to watch with an open mind to all its absurdities, otherwise you won't be able to get into the story.This is a special action movie. There is an emblematic scene in the production, when the opponents shoot from behind a mirror, a moment that encapsulates John Woo's visual narrative and the frantic poetry of the work around the dramatic reflections of the story on totally opposite characters - even the curiosity of their blood is indicative of their personalities, with Archer being O negative (universal donor) and Troy being AB positive (universal recipient). Between sacrifice and psychopathy, we witness a family drama that borders on terror, surrounded by an extremely fun direction in its choreographic megalomanias and cinematographic spectacles. Behind the shots, explosions and its lunatic concept, ""Face Off"" explores its characters and their rivalry, giving emotional charge and tension to each exchanged lead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
An Insult to Intelligence,"What a crap movie ! One flaw after the other. I wonder what the makers of such movies think about us.This movie is an insult to our intelligence.. Of course it would be a feast to the eyes who love the bombs exploding, planes crashing, buildings blowing and other kinds of unimaginable dross stuff. I don't really mind these if there is a semblance of reality in all the action scenes. But unfortunately that is not the case here. It appalls me that the makers dint realize the quality of their movie while making it. They invest millions of dollars in such BS stuff.As far the acting is concerned, the lesser i say the better. Cage cannot act to save his life.Clearly he remains the most unimpressive mainstream actor in Hollywood to me. Travolta is no better either. Overall this is really a pathetic movie..And it is so so so overrated in IMDB...7.3 r u kidding ?it deserves a 3.7 !1/10..I regret having watched this movie..I simply couldn't wait it to end..Thankgod i watched it in TV with the usual commercial breaks which gave me some respite.Well Face Off--------""Beep"" Off",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Face The Music,"I have, of course, watched ""Face/Off"" multiple times before, but I decided to watch it last night as the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast rereleased their episode on the film. It's very stupid, of course it is, but it remains a lot of fun.Sean Archer (John Travolta) finally captures international terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), who killed his son six years previously in an attempt on Archer's life. The capture saw Troy end up in a coma, but the FBI learn from materials taken from him that there is a dirty bomb somewhere in L. A. To find the location, Archer undergoes experimental surgery to swap faces with Troy and trick Castor's brother Pollox (Alessandro Nivola) into revealing the location to him. However, Troy recovers from his coma, forces the doctors to give him Archer's face and then kills everyone that knows about the switch. With the real Archer now locked up in an off the books prison, the real Troy enjoys his new life.It's a fascinating study in acting choices, Cage makes Troy a raging wild psychopath in his early scenes, so that Travolta has something to aim at. Then though there are scenes of Cage, as Archer, pretending to be Troy that's another level of meta-performance. I'm not sure I'd describe either of them as being ""good"" but they're both putting a lot into it.The premise is, of course, very daft and doesn't stand up too much scrutiny. Why, for example, do they keep Troy alive once his face is off, if there's no intention to put him back together? Why don't they tell everyone else the plan, the second that Archer is in the prison, and presumably no one can leak the information to Pollox? It's just an excuse though for some fun action scenes, of which John Woo is the king. We're in full ""gun in each hand diving out of plane whilst birds fly around ""mode here.It's a fun, silly action movie with a strong and deep cast and I still enjoy it after all these years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
A milestone in the history of action movies,"I have always loved action movies, but I hardly remember any that entertained me, thrilled me and kept me on the edge of the seat so much like this one. I tend to overrate movies, but it is for sure not the case here.I have first seen Face/Off with my father, I was like 14 or so. When we started watching it, I didn't know that two hours later I would finish one of the best films ever. Seriously: even the basic idea is so unusual, interesting and exciting that seldom does a movie has a potential like this one. And John Woo, his team, and of course the actors, especially the two major characters succeed on every level.The action scenes are very well-choreographed, colorful, brutal and quite realistic. Yes, there are a lot of bloody scenes, and I salute John Woo for daring to show all that is included in this film. Because it has a lot from everything that makes a movie great: so much action, so much emotion, so much pace, so much background.Is this one of the best movies ever made? Yes it is. Could it have been any better? Probably, but that wouldn't have been an easy job for sure. And I seriously don't understand those who are whining about it being unrealistic etc. It only shows that they do not even try to enjoy this masterpiece.10/10, enough said.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
One of Woo's better American efforts...,"John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are on the opposite sides of the law. Travolta is Sean Archer an FBI agent who is trying to bring down Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) while succeeding in almost killing Troy, Archer is faced with the position of having to get surgery that involves trading faces. So Archer does so and becomes Castor Troy to find out the location of a nerve gas bomb however when Troy awakens without a face he forces the doctors to give him Archer's face and now Archer with Troy's face on must not only fight off Castor Troy but also his former allies who think he is the terrorist they are after. Did you get the plot? Suffice to say Face-Off is ridiculous and of course has gaping plot holes. (Isn't Cage and Travolta different heights and different in body structure?) Also the movie is way too long and could have been edited down by thirty minutes. That being said Face Off works fairly well and the action sequences are exciting if a bit too ludicrous. Also what makes this enjoyable is that Woo has managed to craft a movie that works because the characters sell it, Cage is very good as the good guy and provides some excellent acting in the quieter scenes where Travolta is even more impressive in his good guy role and villainous role. It also has it's share of some exceptionally brutal moments which Woo seems to be employing again after the noticeably tame Broken Arrow. Here Woo seems willing to go over the top and in the end gives us a product which feels the closest to his hometown charm that made him one of the best filmmakers in his country. Some people have balked at it's ludicrous story but really this is Woo operating at almost maximum velocity.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
A mostly great movie with some garbage thrown in.,"Face/Off is good movie with an original plot. Unfortunately, there is also the standard garbage to endure. First there is the obligatory Christian bashing. In this movie they have Nicholas Cage dress as a priest, then while posing as a priest, he molests a girl singing in a church choir, then gyrates, swears and talks like a pervert. I wonder if the Jews running Hollywood would have permitted Cage to dress up like a Rabbi, walk into a synagogue, molest children, and talk like a pervert? This is why many people no longer go to the movies. Then, we are told to believe that the head of the FBI office where John Travolta's character works is a black man. Also, the top special ops person working with the FBI is portrayed by a black woman. In real life, there would be thousands of better qualified white men for each position. But Hollywood is forcing the myth of the Superior Black down our throats, no matter how much it clashes with reality. If you can stomach the above garbage, the movie is otherwise very good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Thrilling, action-packed movie has frenetic movement, violent fights , pursuits , twists and turns.","Big budgeted and energetic thriller with a lot of rousing, breathtaking scenes and visuallly stunning set pieces. The picture displays suspense, tension, thriller and non-stop action for 138 minutes. Nail-biting set pieces action well staged by John Woo with bound and leaps while are shooting. It begins in a flashback, FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is taking his six year old son Michael for a ride on the Griffith Park carousel in downtown Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael's face and smiles. Later on, to foil a terrorist plot, the FBI agent assumes the identity of the criminal who murdered his son through facial transplant surgery, but the crook wakes up prematurely and vows vendetta. But Cage and his now-imprisoned brother (Alessandro Nivola) have planned a massive bomb. In order to catch him, he must become him. To destroy your enemy, you must find him, face him, and then... become him!. It's like looking in a mirror - only not !. Only one will survive !. In order to trap him, he must become him!.Cage and Travolta both get play the villain and hero in this utterly ridiculous but consistingly thrilling film about two men swapping faces as well as identities until an overlong and incredible final duel. What follows is a balletic bloodbath typical of the director of¨A bullet in the head¨ and ¨Hard-boiled¨with men flying while leaping through the air, or turning somersaults to avoid bullets. With two of Hollywood's most flamboyant actors playing each other, the film becomes a kind of pop ¨Heat¨, an elabotate self-parody and quasi-serious examination of the art of film acting. They're excessive maniacal, exaggerated villains, they're the best of the film, too. This is a nice picture with tight , mind-bogging twists and turns , alongside moving musical score by John Powell and colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood. Well made high-tech hinkins and with plenty of impressive set pieces along with a flamboyant treatment and gorgeous images. Filmmaker John Woo brings his trademark ballets style to the action with a lot of plot twists. The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Woo , who originally did not want to do his trademark ""Mexican Standoff"" in this film , but Nicolas Cage begged Woo to include the scene having been a great aficionado of Woo's films as Better tomorrow (1988) , The Killer (1989) , Bullet in head (1990) and Hard Boiled (1992). Woo's poetic-kinetic style has evolved, if not to the point of abstraction, then to delirium: he makes a virtue of incredulity. And an ending speedboat duel knocks spots off anything in ¨Speed 2¨. Starring duo: John Travolta, Nicolas Cage give sympathetic but exaggerated interpretations, their overacting are silly but enjoyable. Yet there's a real subversive as Travolta as Troy sizes up his rebellious teenage daughter, puts the sizzle back into a stale marriage, and generally carries on with the air of a sociopath getting the most out of life. They are well accompanied by a notorious support cast with plenty of familiar faces, such as: Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain, Nick Cassavetes, Harve Presnell, Colm Feore, John Carroll Lynch, CCH Pounder, Robert Wisdom , Matt Ross, James Denton, Chris Bauer , Robert Wisdom, Margaret Cho.John Woo direction is good, he moves well the camera with spectacular scenes ,but doesn't match with his Hong Kong vehicles (Bullet in the head, The Killer, A better tomorrow I and II), John Woo followed with a successful American career(Hard Target, Broken arrow, Face off, Mission impossible II, Windtalkers). Rating: 6.5/10 . Pity it's quite so silly and embarrassing, but then action enthusiasts can't have everything.

worst film ever? i think so...,"Oh dear. F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that 'character IS action'. I wonder what he may have said on seeing this film? My suspicions were first aroused within the first 7 seconds of the film in which John Travolta is simpering on a fairground ride with a child with a haircut so bad that he simply had to be American. When the poor 'bowl cut' blighter was blown away by Nicholas Cage (with seemingly an enormous caterpillar on his upper lip), I began to think that I was in trouble. To say that these characters were one dimensional would be to insult, well, one dimension. They blunder around talking lines that truly no-one in the whole world would ever say outside of an action movie.To think that John Woo has come to this, he made superlative action movies in Hong Kong but the rubbish that he makes in the US is in danger of making us forget all that. There are many of the trademark Woo incidents, people leaping diagonally through the air with a gun in each hand (and always in each hand, I wonder if it is a John Woo fantasy for us to discover a species which has 3 arms, my my, we would have a veritable arms race then!), gunfights in churches etc etc. The subtleties that do appear in his HK films are simply lost here under a welter of bullets, bad acting and a simply woeful script. Yes, some of the stunts are very good, but how many times can you see a stunt and be amazed, by and large they are merely variations on the same theme. Remove them and what are you left with? Really, really bad acting by John Travolta and a performance by Nicholas Cage that makes me think that he felt like buying a new swimming pool when this script turned up. I was little surprised by Travolta ('Battlefield Earth' anyone?) but could this really be the same Cage from 'Leaving Las Vegas'?.Luckily the picture failed on my copy for the last 3 minutes so I was spared Travolta getting his own face back, re-uniting with his lovely (Doctor) wife, connecting with his once wild daughter and now taking over the upbringing of Cage's son (who incidentally also had a very bad, bowl type american brat haircut). If only i had lost the sound as well then maybe I wouldn't have been left wincing with utter agony as much as I did.I only wish that I could give this utter trash -1000000000000000 let alone only 1.

Travolta and Cage are two of the more charismatic actors out there, and having them play off each other in this fashion makes for a darn good movie. The opportunity for the actors to play both personalities helps you really get into each character's life and discover what drives him and where his flaws lie. As far as the cinematography is concerned, I felt it was up-to-par, nothing spectacular, but certainly not a below-average effort for the kind of films John Woo has given us in the past. This is also the kind of movie where you have all these other great supporting actors. At the time, they weren't A-List celebs, but now that you've seen them in other projects (Thomas Jane, Dominique Swain, Colm Feore) you suddenly have that moment of recognition - ""Hey, its that guy, from that other movie! I totally forgot he was in this!"" As for Nic Cage, it was totally his movie. Travolta is cool, no doubt, but this was way more a Nic Cage movie.

And I Don't Even Like Action Movies...,"Admittedly, I have never been a fan of action/adventure films. I don't know why...the genre has never appealed to me that much, so an endorsement from me regarding an action/adventure film is a big thing. And there are few action films that have totally riveted me from start to finish like FACE/OFF. This thoroughly original and truly exciting film is one the finest examples of this genre, mounted by proved action genius John Woo, who has become sort of the Sam Peckinpaugh of this generation. The movie centers a long standing cat-and-mouse game between a veteran FBI agent (John Travolta) and a demented career criminal (Nicolas Cage), who, many years ago, in an attempt to murder Travolta, murdered his son instead. Cage's Castor Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and is then assumed to be dead. Travolta's Sean Archer can only learn where the bomb is from Castor's brother and the only way he can get the information from him is to become Castor Troy which involves a highly technical surgical procedure where Troy's face is removed from his comatose body and placed on Travolta's face. However, the story gets ugly when Castor awakens from his coma, has Travolta's face put on himself, and then murders everyone who knows about the plan. It's such an interesting story that the viewer can't help but become emotionally involved in and what a great acting challenge for these two actors, who, at times, must adapt each other's speech patterns and mannerisms in order to make this ruse work. Travolta and Cage do some of the best work of their respective careers here, almost to the point that you can forget who is who at what time. Joan Allen, one of the best actresses in the business, offers solid support, as Sean Archer's confused wife, caught in the middle of this deadly game and Gina Gershon makes a strong impression as Troy's girl and mother of his son, but this is Cage and Travolta's show all the way, and with the help of an intelligent screenplay and masterful direction, bring us one of the great action/adventure epics of the last 20 years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Ridiculous, over the top & clichéd","""Face/Off"" stands as John Woo's best received Hollywood film and a minor action classic. The story concerns an FBI agent (John Travolta) who undergoes a surgical procedure to impersonate a notorious criminal (Nicolas Cage) in the hopes of thwarting a terror plot. Unfortunately for him, the tables are turned when said criminal then impersonates him and kills all who are aware of his transformation.The far-fetched premise is an easy target for detractors of the movie but I don't think it's too bad in and of itself. For me, the thing that sinks the movie is that this is only one in a long series of unlikely and sometimes logic-defying situations cooked up by the screenwriters. Fans say that the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously but I disagree; the movie sometimes tries to be serious and is all the more laughable because of it.When it comes to the leads, Travolta & Cage let loose with some of the most over the top acting of their careers (which is saying something). While this can be entertaining to a certain degree, it's overdone to such an extent that the characters quickly become cartoonish. The supporting cast is actually pretty decent but, unfortunately, the script saddles everyone with hackneyed material.Being a John Woo film, I was expecting at least some quality in the action scenes but even those seemed to be uninspired. His trademarks are in evidence throughout but the set-pieces are ultimately more style than substance. Woo's direction of the dramatic scenes is likewise glossy, sometimes distractingly so.In the end, I expect that ""Face/Off"" is one of those 'love it or hate it' movies. I can't say that I absolutely hate it but I definitely don't think that it deserves the amount of praise that it gets. If you can look past (or embrace) the movie's many nonsensical elements and the rampant overacting you may well enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Awesome film,"I think the first time I came across Face/Off was when I was about 8 or 9 years old, and had walked in on my parents watching it.

After watching it for the second time, I was completely hooked. I had never been much of a fan of action movies, but this film really stuck in my mind. The plot is captivating and the characters themselves are intriguing, and brilliantly played, especially by Nicolas Cage. I think this movie did him a lot of justice, considering he isn't one of the most liked actors around, to say the least (yet I can't seem to understand why). Unfortunately, not many people remember his role in Face/Off as it is quite old. I think the film was brilliantly produced, considering that it was made over 10 years ago, and will always be one of my favourites.

Horrible,"I rank this movie as one of the most awful things I have ever seen. Not only is it totally unbelievable, but the situations are so unpleasent, so cloying, so awful, that its more like a nightmare that just won't end. And when I say ""won't end,"" I mean it. This movie drags on way past the comfort level. It keeps going from one improbable situation to another, linked by flashy chase scenes, until you're begging for some kind of resolution.The acting of Nick Cage and John Travolta are just about what you would expect -- that is to say totally over-the-top. Chewing on the scenery is a polite term for what they do.As for the talents of John Woo, well I've heard all about his ""violence as opera"" philosophy of film-making, but I just don't buy it. Every movie I've seen of his isn't scary, or exciting, or shocking -- its uncomfortable, like sitting on a sharp spike.I saw this movie years ago in the theatre, but it still sticks with me -- I guess that should say something about its power, but years ago, I saw a dead deer sitting by the side of the road. It was rotting in the heat, its muscles had contracted, it smelled awful and it looked alot like a mummy -- that experience stuck with me too.

A most entertaining movie.,"John Woo directs his best action movie to date starring John Travolta (Pulp Fiction, Saturday Night Fever) and Nicholas Cage (Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock). Cage's character Castor Troy is a terrorist and has hidden a bomb inside a large skyscraper, Travolta's Archer tracks Castor down in a show-off in an airfield while Castor is trying to escape. Archer knocks Castor unconscience during the fight, therefor he cannot interrogate Castor as to the location of the skyscraper bomb. Castor's brother Prevlux is the only other person who knows the location of the bomb. To retrieve the information Travolta unwillingly accepts the surgical procedure that replaces faces between Archer and Troy. Troy is left in his coma like sleepness at the lab with Archer's face and meanwhile Archer looks like Troy and infiltrates a prison where Prevlux is being held. Prevlux soon finds out Archer is a fake, but not before he gives him the location of the bomb. Troy wakes up, kills the science crew and destroys all information about the surgical procedure, now he has basically illegally assumed the full identity of Archer, and has access to Archer's work and family. Archer must fight back, being noticed always as Troy, he must win his friends and his family back, and must kill Troy.Action packed from start to finish, literally. More entertaining than Titantic which was released the same year. This movie remains on most people's top 10 action movie lists, and for good reason. Action isn't all that this movie has to offer.

However, trouble ensues when Castor Troy takes on the look of Sean Archer.Let me start off with the acting as that is the most credible part of the movie. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are solid throughout. It's not easy to play two very contrasting personalities but both of them make it look extremely simple. Without Travolta and Cage, this film wouldn't be as entertaining. All the other supporting actors do justice to their roles as well.John Woo's direction is good but it could definitely be better. Majority of the time, Woo's direction is really good but the area where he falters is the shootout scenes. During the shootout segments you can tell something is going on but you don't what since you don't directly see the action taking place. There is just a lot of quick cutting and shots of guns being fired. In the final action sequence you can tell where a stunt double has been used instead of the actors. There were some errors as well during the action scenes. In one scene where Castor shoots an agent, you can see the wire being used to move the agent backwards. A lot of films have errors like this but they aren't as visible as the ones in Face/Off.The actual storyline of this film is very creative and unique but parts of it doesn't make sense. Both actors have a very different physique so how do they change their body structure so quickly after the surgery? The surgical procedure itself would take a long time to recover from but the film shows an instant recovery. Like this, there are quite a lot of plot holes within the script.Face/Off isn't a perfect film. In fact it's nowhere near one. The entire premise has a lot of areas that aren't patched up but what sells this movie is the ridiculous action scenes and impeccible acting from Travolta and Cage.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Willing suspension of disbelief,"Every once in a while, you just have to sit down with a big bowl of popcorn and watch an action flick. The trick is finding one that is both fun and intelligent.Face/Off falls under this category. Unlike brainless shoot-em-up movies, this flick is enhanced by the theatrical talents of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. Cage's performance reflects similar tones and faces from Con Air, and Travolta's in the same mold as his movie Swordfish.The key to enjoying this movie, however, is to engage in a willing suspension of disbelief. If you look at this movie with a critical eye and say to yourself 'this is so unreal' before disgustedly turning off the TV, then you're missing out. Once you get past the surreal premise of the film, it becomes exciting and intriguing, and a thrill ride through two great performances by Cage and Travolta.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
An All Action Movie that's a Winner,"FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) desperate to avenge the death of his son; uses radical new surgery to become his arch enemy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), but when Castor wakes from his coma and becomes Sean, he finds himself trapped in the life of of his nemesis and unable to protect his family.With relentless John Woo style action sequences, cutting edge stunts and special effects, thrilling storyline and great performances from Cage and Travolta, Face Off is a cut above most of the action movies out there.

Preposterous but spectacular,"Best you check your credulity at the door before watching ""Face/Off"" the John Travolta/Nicolas Cage vehicle helmed by the master of slow-motion gunplay, John Woo.The movie starts out regularly, with Travolta's FBI agent Sean Archer on the hunt for Cage's terrorist Castor Troy - the two have personal history - then heads to an unexpected and wonderfully ridiculous place, swapping faces, voices, crime for law enforcement (and vice versa), family, the works - as you might expect from the title.Both lead actors are effective as good guys and bad guy.

Kicks Butt,"This movie kicks serious butt.  John Woo is a fantabulous director.  John Travolta is wonderful and Nicholas Cage is outstanding.  I loved it!  The action sequences were great.  John Woo is a master of his art.  He makes you sit on the edge of your seat, while you silently root for the good guy, but in the back of your mind you kinda want the bad guy to win, just because you know that the good guy is the bad guy.

Excelent idea wasted,"I usually get a bit annoyed when a movie with a scenario full of potential wastes it.I almost roared from anger when I saw this.It has an interesting character if there ever was any.Castor Troy.At first he is the brother of Pollux.That is a reference to greek myth.Castor was a demigod who's twin brother was mortal.Castor Troy could be a demigod.He is full of charisma.As a terrorist he seems to be the best there is.As a brother he always took care of his geeky bro.He seems to be a lady's man too.It's been ages since I saw a movie character enjoying life so much.When he takes his rivals persona he proves to be a caring husband,saving a doomed marriage,a protective father,who's going to teach his ""Daughter""self-defense instead of having to protect her all the time.As an agent nobody,no matter which side of the law,can face him and win.Watching him adjusting to his new role is the best part of this movie.Sean""the Loser""Archer is dull to begin with.My favorite scene him staring is during his stay in the prison.He beats that guy,letting out his frustration(held for how long?)acting as Troy would.His association with Castor's family and friends makes him care a bit for them.His adjustment to his new role is interesting.Each of the two gets to adopt some traits of the other.I was thriled.But then the film turns to a standard adventure film using such ideas such as ""a battle of good versus evil""and other such overused stuff.Castor try's to kill his new family,and Sean gets to be a purging avenge angel.I hated it.We are supposed to believe their new experiences haven't changed them a bit.The ending is most disappointing.Talk about leting the viewer down.How could John Woo do this?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Probably the best 90s police/cop action movie of all time,"The film itself was a gem of the 90s, a decade that was rich in groundbreaking cinema. The plot was innovative for its time, setting it apart from other films in the genre. It was not just another run-of-the-mill action flick; it was a film that dared to be different, and it succeeded.The supporting cast also delivered stellar performances, adding depth and dimension to the film. Their performances complemented Cage's, creating a cohesive and compelling narrative that kept audiences on the edge of their seats.The action sequences were nothing short of spectacular. They were meticulously choreographed and executed with precision, making for some truly thrilling moments. The film didn't just have good action; it had some of the best action sequences of the decade, setting a high bar for future films in the genre.In conclusion, this film is a shining example of 90s cinema, with Nicolas Cage delivering one of his finest performances. It's a film that stands the test of time, remaining as captivating and engaging today as it was when it first hit the big screen. It's not just a film; it's a cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
It's a ten,I think that Face/Off is possibly the best movie in a awhile. Mostly because it's original! It's been a long time since I've seen a truly original movie. This movie get's a ten for origionality,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
untrustworthy,"The face off thing doesn't work if you take a mesomorph build guy and an ectomorph build one. The whole face is shaped following the bone structure which is completely different for Cage and Travolta. Even if you would assume they have made some magic technique to make the face fit, you still have the body that is completely different.This may sound like unimportant, but it really made the complete film untrustworthy. they should have chosen two guys with very similar body types.If you ignore this problem a 7/10 would probably OK for this movie, but since I couldn't ignore such an obvious fact i wouldn't give it more than a 6.5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Another action film that tries something different and succeeds,"Face/Off is a film with such a bizarre story that you might think you won't enjoy it. However, once you get past the very far-fetched plot, you'll find a really good film lurking in the background. It does have a complex story, but is told in a straightforward manner that makes it easy to follow.While the film contains some very good action scenes, and an equally good amount of drama, the most entertaining aspect is watching John Travolta and Nicolas Cage play each other; the performances from the two are excellent, you genuinely believe they are in each other's skin.A must watch for anyone who likes action films that try something a little bit different.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

One of the dumbest films of the year,"Between the over-acting of Cage and the completely over done action scenes that seem to be a Woo standard, I think this film would have sold better as a comedy. I mean come on, we are supposed to believe that a face can be taken off one person and put on to another with out even leaving a scar? So let's say we can overlook that, now we shouldn't notice that they also must have switched hair lines and bodies. How stupid are we? Apparently stupid enough to believe that once again, the central people in this John Woo film can stand in front of a machine gun for as long as they like, and only come away with a few nicks and cuts. There is a line between good action and just plain dumb. Woo blows past that line and never looks back. The only good thing I can say about this film is that Travolta blows Cage's one dimensional butt off the screen. John does a very good job of creating two different people. Cage does not.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Travolta and Cage really did a good job on this movie and think this movie should be remembered like Die Hard.

Silly fun,"If you're younger and are watching this in the 2020's then I can see why you may deride this film. I was a teenager when it came out and during the 80s/90s, we were fed whatever stories were conjured up. We had no way of challenging it's premise. No way of cross-referencing it's plausibility. A movie with Cage and Travolta came out, we paid money to go see it, we discussed if we liked/disliked it. That's it.So as far as 90s action movies go, it's an absolute cracker. Is it ridiculous? Of course it is. Back then if we wanted realism, we'd seek out documantries.Visually, the movie is sort of a stop-gap measure where real special effects were present but being phased out and CGI was in its crude infancy.It must be difficult for the younger generation to appreciate this film because they have boundless access to information and other exciting things that we did not.If you're one of them, try to imagine watching it knowing there is no social media. No hand held Oracle's of information in our pockets etc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
A Greek Tragedy,"John Woo has never been one to let reality get in the way of a good story. Nor will he waste time with character development when simply labelling each of his cast with a signature trait or two will give them each enough drive to propel the plot through its twists, turns and face-offs. This is a Greek tragedy on steroids - arch enemies being trapped in the bodies of their Nemesis, each experiencing life through the eyes (literally) of their persecutor. Even the names of the criminal brothers tips off the classical tale - Castor and Pollux. (Castor and Pollux Troy no less!) Woo's breathless direction, rip roaring stunts, and superb performances from the tough guys earns this ""guy flick"" a big thumbs up. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Too many sheep in these reviews,"John Woo is well known for his action films. Some are good, some aren't. Face/Off could have been among his best and also among one of the best action films ever made. But Woo insisted on one major drawback throughout the entire film. His ridiculous and continuous use of slow motion during virtually every single action scene, and there are probably dozens.
 If Woo had a scene where a bicycle flew off a cliff he'd have it explode. There's no such scene in this movie thank goodness, but I wouldn't put it past him. Explosions can be highly entertaining but only if they fit the scene. Blowing up everything in sight just because you can is lazy. Apparently the majority of reviewers here fell for Woo's lame tricks where instead of him saying watch my movie he's screaming look at me. Oh well, what can you expect in a world filled with sheep?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Good concept that deserved this movie.,"It's fascinating to think about two people, who are not just enemies but complete foes, swapping faces. What a promising concept! With Cage and Travolta taking the lead as these rivals, they delivered an absolutely suspenseful film, full of twists and moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.A true classic that will never lose its charm, no matter how old it gets. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Absurdly entertaining,"Face/Off really has to be seen to be believed because the central conceit is so outlandish.In the hands of any other actors this film would have been woeful, but Cage and Travolta ham it up in glorious fashion which makes the whole thing work.Disbelief must be well and truly suspended, but if you are happy to throw yourself into the ludicrous premise then you'll find a very original, engaging, and often quite disturbing film to get stuck into.I do think a lot of the action scenes are unnecessarily bloated. The final showdown is excruciatingly drawn out and had some of these sequences been trimmed the runtime could have been cut to a more well judged two hours.There's no denying that Face/Off is very of its time, but that time happens to be the time of outrageously entertaining blockbusters. Fans of Cage, action films, and 90s movies, will find lots to enjoy with this, even if it is a little rough around the edges.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Brainless but Entertaining Action Movie,"While trying to kill the FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) with a sniper rifle, the terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) hits him on the chest but accidentally kills his little son Mike. The relentless Archer hunts down Troy and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola) and he learns that Troy has planted a bomb in Los Angeles that will provoke destruction and several killings. Archer and his team chase Castor and Pollux in the airport, and he kills Castor, but Pollux survives. He is the only person who knows where the bomb is, but he refuses to tell. FBI Agents Hollis Miller (CCH Pounder) and Tito Biondi (Robert Wisdom) propose an alternative secret solution to find the location of the bomb. The surgeon Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore) would remove the face of Castor Troy, who is alive in coma in a hospital, and replace Sean Archer's face by his. Then he would go to the prison where Pollux is to learn the location of the bomb. Archer accepts the arrangements and finds where the bomb is. But the problem is that Castor has woken up from the coma, forced Dr. Walsh to put Sean Archer's face on him and killed everybody that knows the operation, burning the hospital do the ashes. Now, how can the real Archer prove his identity?""Face/Off"" (1997) is a brainless but entertaining action movie directed by John Woo, with many action scenes. The film cannot be taken seriously but is funny to watch. Sean Archer is a skilled agent but misses all the shots fired to Castor Troy. This is an irritating situation since Castor is never hit. The cast is a constellation of stars and all of them have a good job. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Outra Face"" (""The Other Face"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Awesome action film.,"Face/Off tells the story of an FBI agent named Sean Archer who is in charge of taking down a dangerous terrorist named Castor Troy. Troy is also responsible for the death of Archer's son 6 years earlier. When Archer puts Troy into a coma, he discovers that there is a bomb ticking somewhere, and only Troy's brother knows where it is. Archer decides to undergo a new surgery that transforms him into Castor Troy by taking Troy's face and putting it on his head so he can find out the location of the bomb. Unfortunately, Castor wakes from his coma and forces the doctors to turn him into Sean Archer. Now Castor Troy is living with Archer's family while Archer sits in jail. He must now figure out a way to escape and convince everybody that his is who he says he is, as well as take Castor Troy down once and for all. This is an amazing action movie that's loads of fun to watch.First off, the plot of this movie is pretty cool. Originally it was meant to be set in the future, but I think the story would have been way to generic if it was. Thankfully they set it in the present day, and I think it really does the movie justice. Apart from having a really cool original story, the movie features some really awesome action sequences that for the most part are pretty believable, and for me, believable action sequences make an action movie so much better. I think there was a really good balance between actual story and the action, which is good.The acting is very good in this film. This is a perfect film to show acting range. When it starts out John Travolta is the good cop and Nicholas Cage is the sadistic maniac, and then they suddenly switch roles, and it goes off perfectly. John Travolta plays Nicholas Cage playing a psycho really well, and Nicholas Cage does a good job of playing John Travolta playing a good cop. Truthfully, I liked Nicholas Cage better in the role of Sean Archer than John Travolta, and I'm happy that was the way it was through the majority of the movie rather than vice versa.Overall, this is a great piece of work from John Woo, a really fun and entertaining action film, actually a good film all around.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The 90's Does It Again!,"John Woo and Jerry Bruckheimer owned the 90's action genre and Face/Off (Woo) adds to the mix of excellent films.Of the bunch, this seems the most ridiculous in plot (because it is) but somehow it offers enough distraction through snappy dialogue and mega action to keep you from noticing the story.The leads are perfect, especially Cage, with Travolta still riding his Pulp Fiction wave.Crank up the volume, get nice and close to the tv and enjoy :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Unforgettable,"Face/Off is an action picture in every sense of the word. Too many over the top chase sequences? Check. Too-long running time? Check. Nicolas Cage? Check. Bad? No possible way. It's a seasoned original action picture with surprisingly great performance, excellent sound, editing, and visuals, and nail-biting thrills.Nicolas Cage, possibly the king of action pictures shares the stage with john Travolta and together they have more chemistry than 3/4 of the romantic comedies today. It's a Clairice Starling/Hannibal Lecter pair. Can you imagine if Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins did what Travolta and Cage do here, switch faces? That would've been interesting.Both deliver to my surprise, terrific performances. Travolta pretty much amazed me here. He has emotional depth for both characters he portrays. It's Oscar nomination work that never gets considered because of the nature of his film (i.e. Matt Damon in Bourne). Both men could've stolen the show in the Nicolas Cage role, and they both are sublime in it. But it is the John Ttravolta character that was the challenge. When Travolta is actually in his original character he's just as solid and great as he is in the Cage character. Cage falls a little behind with Travolta's character, but picks himself up when he confronts Joan Allen. From there on he's on Travolta's level.Joan Allen, I fell like I talk about her in every review, delivers yet another fantastic performance. How does she do it?Face/Off is features incredible tech stuff, fine acting, a very original (not always believable) script, and the action may carry on for a while, but it very well-done; 8.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Two Great Performances From Travolta And Cage,"John Woo certainly knows how to deliver an action movie.Plot In A Paragraph: FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is still grieving for his dead son Michael. His son's killer is a powerful master criminal, Castor Troy (Nic Cage) When Archer finally captures Castor, (in a battle that leaves Troy in a coma) he finds out that Troy has planted a bomb that will destroy the entire city of Los Angeles. Unfortunately the only other person who knows its location is Castor's brother Pollux, and he refuses to talk. So Archer undergoes a special operation by a doctor that can cut off people's faces, and can place a person's face onto another person. However, Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge.Both Nic Cage (his fourth good movie in a row, following ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"") and and John Travolta (Still riding high after ""Pulp Fiction) have put in some awful performances over the years, but both of them are in top form here. Dominique Swain is fine as Jamie, Travolta's daughter as is Gina Gershon and Thomas Jane in his small role.The plot is ridiculous, but when has that ever mattered in an action movie?? It's a fun ride all the same. Thanks mainly to the performances of the two leads. My bug bearer of policemen and killers never being able to hit the target when it actually matters, is here and sadly in great supply.Interestingly Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were originally in mind to play the lead roles, but when John Woo was brought in to direct, he decided to go with John Travolta and Nic Cage.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
only criticism anyone can level is superficial,"That Face/Off achieves what it does with the plot it has only makes its achievement all the more impressive.  The plot is certifiably ridiculous.

Pretty good 7/10,"Face/Off has literally two meanings: another name for ""stand off"" when two people face each other in a combat. The other meaning means face off as seen in the film where both characters take their faces off, which is pretty ironic for the movie to have two meanings. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are great actors in this film and are perfect mostly when they play each other. John Travolta is the kind of actor who is perfect for the role of the villain and so seeing him portray a villain is completely natural while Cage acts natural as well playing the protagonist. Any way it's complicated. What I mostly liked about the film was it's original story, by bringing two enemies face to face and having them live each other lives.

Deranged action dust-up where Cage and Travolta swop places,"So, Travolta's the cop and Cage is the crazy crim. Then, Travolta's the maniac and Cage gets to be his nemesis for a while. Both actors get to be the goodie and the baddie, and all with the triumphantly, flamboyantly, audaciously, ludicrously, preposterously, over the top (and with a pole vault) stylings of director daredevil, John Woohoo!Face/Off is an example of the Tarantino Effect, back in the days when QT was a hot property. Lots of slo-mo. Lots of grandstanding. Lots of violence, ultra-nasty, and made to seem like it's part of a commercial for aftershave. As an example, aside from the appearance of Travolta (Quentin relaunched his career with Pulp Fiction), there's a scene where people are tied-up and doused with gasoline. Tarantino, to his credit, made his version (in Reservoir Dogs) horrifying, as it should be. Woo directs it with music to cover the screams, with a repulsive panache. Repulsive Panache, a new scent, by John Woo. Get at your local chop shop.Needless to say, the whole idea of a sociopath and a detective swopping faces again and again, and voices of course, is stupid as can be. Nowadays it actually happens, but only on video, as part of deep fakery. We're supposed to believe a cop would go so far as to physically become the person he detests most, and ditto for the crook. I expect if Face/Off was remade today there'd be more focus on the price paid by the cop's wife when her husband's enemy breezes in through the front door, wearing her husband's look.Best line in the movie:'Lies. Half truths. Mixed messages. This is turning into a real marriage.'The surprising thing about this movie is how much it can turn one off the two leading men. Both were highly bankable stars in the 1990s, but not for much longer. Cage was soon to give us his risible remake of Wings of Desire, alongside the fading Meg Ryan. Travolta got the new millennium off to a bad bang with his much derided Battlefield Earth. In this movie both go from under the speed limit to total write off in the space of a few minutes.Strictly for groups of silly teenage boys, though even when I was a boy I found the slo-mo corny as corn-on-the-cob, and I hate sweetcorn.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"Too Long, Too Much Plot","Woo can make choreographed action and he can do drama. He is not all that great at plot. In this movie, the plot stands in the way of the action and melodrama. And what was he thinking when he included several minutes of boring boat chase at the end? All involved have made much better movies than this one. That said, it is still Woo, it is still Travolta and Cage, and it is still worth seeing - it is just not one of the best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The best action film of all time!----10/10,"Action movies are one of my very favorite genres. The excitement in them is unmatched, and the heroes and villains at the heart of them are so darn cool. Well, this goes for the great action movies anyway, most of which came out between 1987 and 1997, a ten year period i like to call, ""The Action Movie Revolution"". It started with Lethal Weapon. It went on to include such classics as Die Hard, Bad Boys, the Rock, and Con Air. And it ended with Face/Off.John Woo's Face/Off has to be, in my opinion, the best action movie ever made. The action is non-stop, cool and original. The story line is one of a kind, with a hint of science fiction, but true to it's action origins. And the two leads, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage pull of some incredible movie magic by transforming from good to evil and back again with amazing convincement.When the movie starts, John Travolta plays Sean Archer, an FBI agent who is trailing the terrorist that killed his son. Nicolas Cage plays said terrorist, Castor Troy, a diabolical killer with a taste for women and Chicklets. But after supposedly killing Troy, Archer goes under a cutting edge surgery (no pun intended) to transform into Troy (even putting in a phony voicebox that produces his rival's voice) to infiltrate his organization and take down his buddies in crime. But soon afterward, the real Troy, who was being kept alive long enough to preserve his face, awakens and forces the doctors to turn him into Archer. So now it's Travolta playing Troy playing Archer, and Cage playing Archer playing Troy.If this sounds like a horrible, convoluted storyline, it's because it is. But when it is on screen, it makes more sense. Not to mention it is surrounded by a tons of awesome shootouts directed by action master Woo, a wicked speedboat chase, an amazing cast of top-notch actors, and a great soundtrack. This is the last great action movie and nothing after it has come close. That's why we should give the CGI a rest and get back to blowing s**t up the right way. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Awesome action, weak premise-but good movie","Despite a barely plausible premise, the film works for the most part. The credit goes to Travolta and Cage who pull off a rather complicated acting challenge with skill. Also to the director who somehow makes a convoluted story work. Without a doubt these are the most amazing stylish action sequences I have ever seen. It's an OK film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
90s completed it mate!,"This may be the pinnacle of 90s action cinema! Before the onslaught of CGI and reliance on reboots, adaptations and comic book films relegated the best of the genre to independent circuits, direct to DVD or philosophical contemplation, this gave us one last hurrah!Cage off the back of his Oscar win and Travalota shortly after the behemoth that was Pulp Fiction, both had nothing to prove, yet somehow they not only pulled off and made us believe the most preposterous premise but they slam dunked a glorious delight in performance for this modern media age. John Woo and the team (cinematographer of the Bourne trilogy I noted upon research) knew the remit, entertainment and they damn well brought it. Woo with his excellent history of Hong Kong action, was never quite enough for stars/producers in previous Hollywood efforts but here he feels untamed, let lose and ready to show us the art of the possible, well with guns n' explosions n' shiz anyway.It's hard to imagine this being pitched and produced now for large scale cinematic release, without either a reduced budget or a Netflix 'throw a load of money at that popular director' approach. This is perhaps an example of an art form elevated by an attempt at mass appeal, without dulling the impact by doing it 'family friendly'. This is all out entertainment with the blood, the guts, the inappropriate conduct, kept in and indeed encouraged. Its not smart, its not got a message and for all I know it may not even have had a script, but I ruddy love it.I do just hope Travolta and Woo were big Uncle Buck fans and the boyfriend scene was a loving tribute!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Shameless entertainment,"Face/Off is shameless entertainment. The story of rivals switching faces is a ridiculous yet captivating premise. Shrewdly, Face/Off pushes past the science to the thrills. Once audiences do the same, they'll enjoy the ride. Like most cheesy action movies, the story is less about practicality and more about opening fun doors. Face/Off exemplifies this because its role reversals are compelling and novel. Plus, seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta switch personas halfway through the film is interesting. Neither character is deep, but they're different enough for an engaging gimmick. Furthermore, there's plenty of gratuitous action to make the film worthwhile.Technically, Face/Off is good. The cinematography is superficial, yet active and clear. The editing has awkwardness and pacing issues, but maintains energetic and coherent action. The sound is complex and emotional. The soundtrack is dated, but has a reoccurring melody that shifts tones. Also, the effects deserve credit for extreme 90s explosions and stunts. That tangible action is sorely missed today. Lastly, the casting of Cage and Travolta makes the movie. Face/Off probably wouldn't have its enduring following if not for such notable leads. Therefore, while Face/Off is clearly a cheesy flick, it accomplishes its goals well.Writing: 5/10

That's laughable. I rate movies on how enjoyable they were to watch vs how well the movie is made via cinematography and acting. A 5/10 I would watch again but this movie does not deserve an 82 from critics. Suspension of disbelief the entire way through. Gunfights and explosions and bad science.

"For action junkies, but too, too much graphic violence.","Ok, I know it is hard to make this kind of movie without all the shooting and killing.  But director John Woo seems to revel more in the killing than he does in the story.  Still, I must give it 6 of 10, if you can ignore the fact that virtually everything depicted is impossible.I rented the DVD because I heard it had great action and a real kick-ass surround-track.  And it wins on both counts.  Want to test your subwoofer? The explosions will do that. However, this is an example of the type of movie that trivializes killing, and will be responsible for some crazy person acting out and killing a few people in real life.

"Bullets, birds, and Galactican Standoffs (several, in fact)","In the first 10 minutes I was reminded how much I hate Director John Woo's trademark scenes. Almost all of them done right up front. The slow-mo. Millions of bullets and the main characters don't get hit. Sliding across the floor or through the air horizontally, firing away, often with two guns. The Galactican Standoff (so-called by me because of how often they did it in the Battlestar Galactica reboot). And this is done a couple times, the last one with five or six people. I was nearly through it and thought ""I haven't seen anyone walking through birds yet."" Then that showed up.Cage at his Cagiest. Travolta taking lessons from Cage for his soon-to-be-filmed Battlefield Earth. Easily could have been 20 minutes shorter.I did like the premise.

"Despite several credibility issues, this is still an exciting watch.","'Face/Off' has a premise that sounds utterly ridiculous, yet the execution is quite brilliant. Thanks to a well motivated theory, and excellent visual effects, the film is (for most part) very believable.And I say ""for most part"" because a premise like this is bound to have flaws. It's one thing for a man to look - and even sound -like another, but there are issues like mannerisms, personality and memory that can't possibly be justified. For a woman to live with another man and not notice the difference despite him looking the same, is not plausible. The daughter and father relationship was more believable since she ""hardly ever sees him"" anyway.Despite too many improbabilities, the film was still thrilling and exciting, and it was fun seeing John Travolta trying to act like Nicolas Cage, and vice versa. The action sequences - and visuals during these scenes - are stunningly well done! Being a John Woo film, you can, off course, expect a lot of firepower, and he certainly dishes it up in generous portions! There's too much killing of innocent people, though (yes, the prison guards are also considered innocent, yet the film expects us not to care about them since they're trying to stop the film's hero, but keep in mind to their knowledge, these are hardened criminals.) Even our hero shoots - and kills - these innocent bystanders. Not cool.My other criticism is the fact the film is a bit too long. Towards the end one does get a sense of deja vu. It should have been at least 20 minutes shorter. At least the film's climax is fantastic and more than compensates for this. 'Face/Off' is an interesting concept, and delivers lots of thrills and chills, and action galore. It should satisfy action junkies. I certainly was entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Best John Woo action,"Sean Archer (John Travolta) is an FBI agent who is tracking down super villain Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage).

The story is ridiculous. The science is ridiculous. And most of all, it doesn't matter. John Woo is about big action, lots of gun, and pointing guns at each other without firing.

"A lot of action, very interesting plot and strong characters","Face/off is definitely one of the most interesting films I have watched. The film is of course an Action Film, but it also managed to occupy the viewer's feelings and filled us with great agony about whether Sean Archer (John Travolta) will manage to get his life back from Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). It is not only about shooting and fighting, there seems to be a lot of emotion and compassion here. The plot begins with an idea, that of Travolta using Castor Troy's face to penetrate his crew, which creates a lot of anguish about whether Travolta will be discovered. At the same time, we see his family and his past and we start to empathize with Sean Archer. Later, when Cage wakes from his coma, the plot gets really thrilling and empathizing, especially when Troy tries to approach Archer's family. Till the very last frame, the emotional part of the script is obvious. As for the leading actors, few can be said about Travolta and Cage of course. The way they play each other, the way they change their behavior, but also keep the original character's habits and manners, is unique.The film is undoubtedly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Ain't it cool ...to have your face ripped off?,"Sean Archer is a covert anti-terrorism big shot who doesn't fool around. Caster Troy is a terrorist for hire who doesn't fool around either. Wait! Actually he does fool around. In fact, he's the horniest wild-eyed evil-doer you will see in any story whether it be on page or on screen. All the dude needs to do is cup an ass and he has a mangasm. Imagine the Joker lost his make-up and injected himself with Charlie Sheen's tiger blood. Top it off with a Caesar hairdo and the result is a man who is not quite charming or funny but thinks he's both. When Cage trades the Castor character for Archer with Castor face, the mangasms are replaced by sappy uber-emoting. But Cage's performance is a study in subtlety. There's a few nervous breakdowns and a few emotional outbursts but it's all with a measure of restraint. It's a wonder that the other characters don't drown in man tears but it's still remarkably poised. Goons and gunsmiths shoot and miss each other over and over again. But it's okay because they look soooo cool doing it. And a John Woo film wouldn't be Wooey without Woo birds – aka doves, or are they pigeons?

"Not/Terrible, but Not/Great either.","I'm not sure what happened when this film came out.  It was like the John Woo Fan Club decided this was in fact the best action film ever, and those fans who could spell went on to hail it as an allegory of our times, a social commentary, a fundamental battle of good vs evil, best special effects ever, yadda yadda yadda.I watched it and thought ""Hmm.  That's 2 hours of my life I won't get back.""Don't misunderstand me - I'm not some hairless, vegan excuse for a man, nor am I someone who only watches impenetrable European angst dramas.  I love action movies, and I really like Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, but I thought this film was put together as some sort of showcase for the pyrotechnic stunt coordinators, and they completely forgot to plot the movie beyond a few scribblings on the back of a napkin.I gave the movie 7/10, so I didn't hate it.  I thought the leads were charismatic (in a ridiculously over-the-top way), I thought Gina Gershon did a great job of looking amazing and had a few good lines, and although obvious within the plot - I enjoyed the scenes where 'Castor Troy' proves himself to be a more protective and passionate husband than 'Sean Archer', particularly the 'Al Bundy-esque' scenes with the daughter's boyfriend.That said, I remember the PR interviews at the time going on and on about how Cage & Travolta spent ages studying each other's mannerisms to 'pretend' to be the other one under his skin.  Well, I've seen more restrained subtlety on Saturday morning kids TV, and that whole touchy-face thing Archer does is ridiculous to the point of comedy - even a particularly touchy-feely blind person wouldn't stroke everybody's face every time he sees them!  And although I feel a little guilty about saying it, I don't think Joan Allen was a very convincing casting (and that's not a comment on her acting) - just on the fact that she could almost have played Travolta's mother.  With the notable exception of Gershon, Troy's gang were a forgettable bunch of characatured misfits, and his brother (Pillox?) was an unsympathetic nuisance.On the action itself - the 'stopping the plane taking off' was silly, the gunfight in the hanger was silly (reminded me of the A-Team's shooting accuracy, only without the humour), the very notion of an FBI agent secretly undergoing a radical (and speedy) complete face-lift was laughable (Darkman was more convincing), the magnetic-boots prison was straight out of a Christopher Lambert movie, I couldn't concentrate anyway because Archer's boss and the prison bully-guard were both in Fargo, the prison scenes were cliched and dumb, the moments where Archer turns to Troy's friends were predictable and not very well acted, the FBI raid was another triumph of OTT destruction (and that mirror face-off, well - silly).. ..I did like the scenes where Troy plays Archer's father/husband role.. ..then we're back to a cliched shootout in a chapel (John Woo - your white doves just look like a spoof-joke now..  and (c)Reservoir Dogs for the stand-off - I don't care where it may have been done before), the speedboat chase which was WAY below James Bond standard (pretty poor actually), and then the mega-obvious harpoon gun setup, leading to a convenient happy ending.I watched Face/Off on TV again (it's about the third time now), because I wanted to consider it again, and you know what - it was still silly rubbish. Entertaining rubbish, but still rubbish.PS. I really liked Mission Impossible 2, so I'm not totally against Woo either.  Still, if I want to see top-notch action, I'll choose Dobermann or Leon anyday.PPS.

Face/Off wreaks of his signature and classy action: explosions, more explosions, broken glass, more broken glass, etc. But beyond the action, it was more emotional than I expected. I really rooted for Sean Archer more than most protagonists of movies I like more.

An ambitious movie,As a pretty big John Woo fan I have to say this is far from his best.On the other hand it has a great depth of character development actually devolution.Only spoiler if you have not seen this every major part is over acted.Most Woo movies have odd pace and wild intense acting but this one takes the cake.Both John and Nic do well just.

Trading 'Faces'.,"My Take: The mindless action movie for smart people.FACE/OFF is Hong Kong action director John Woo's 3rd Hollywood action effort, and it is in this one that he finally hits the stride. Woo deliver one heck of a punch and delivers one action scene after another...with style. FACE/OFF is action filmdom as an art form. There are many moments of violence and shootouts, but thanks to th very talented Woo, the action is in a style of his own. Slow-motion shots and all, FACE/OFF is not just a non-stop thrill machine that one quit for a second (from the opening credits to the seat-gripping climax, it hardly has time for small talk), it's also Woo's perfect ballet of style and violence. And if you think those to things don't go together, then you haven't seen FACE/OFF.Perhaps one of the two best actors at work in action films is John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, and they prove the pride of their work in this movie. During the film's gloomy prologue, nice-guy family man cop Sean Archer (Travolta) is on a carousel with his little boy, while on top of the hill is eccentric terrorist Castor Troy (Cage), aiming his sniper at Archer but misses, and hits his son instead. Since then, Archer has devoted himself on bringing Castor down. After two years or so, he's still at it. ""We'll take a break, when the case breaks!"" Archer says angrily. When Archer does corner Castor in hi private plane (in one of the film's earliest action scenes), Archer brings Castor drop dead in a coma. Just when he thought it was over, secretly Castor and his brother Pullox (Alessandro Nivola) has already set up a bomb and Castor's brother, captured for interrogation, just won't talk. What does he do? Well, here it goes. Archer has to switch faces with the comatose Castor, go to prison with Pullox and make him talk. Oh! And he also must remain undercover. No one knows, even his wife Eve (Joan Allen), of the operation. Things get worse when Castor wakes up (!) from his comatose and asks for Archer's face. Silly plot as it is, but who cares. This give us a chance to see the good guy Travolta and bad guy Cage switch personalities for most of the film.What else is good about FACE/OFF is how the characters are well-developed. Archer is a nice cop, but isn't the same as a husband and a father, as he is unable to handle his relationship with his wife and rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swann). Castor Troy is what he is, a real villain everyone loves to hate. The supporting characters are surprisingly well-developed and interesting. We care about these batch of characters, more or less it's the action we want, and it's more than we get. The action scenes here, including the opening action fireworks and the boat chase climax is a seat-gripper. Then there's a number of shoot-outs and fist-fights that, under the style of Woo, is like a ballad... with guns and punches. FACE/OFF is action movies of the best order. It's one of the best action movies in years.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Mandatory action movie,"This movie is too good for words. See this by all means if you have not already done so. I saw this movie thrice and would not mind doing so again. John Travolta makes a very good come-back into movies with this film. Far better than Broken Arrow. And Nicholas Cage compliments him very well. The fact that the y act so well is apparent from the fact that your sympathies keep changing on who the current gooodie and baddie are. Initially, Travolta is the goodie but halfway through Cage takes over the role and you begin to dislike Travolta.(That is if you like goodies). John Woo has kept this movie stretched nice and tight. There is not a scene that you feel could have been done better. Please see this movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Interesting Idea, Mediocore Implementation","The idea for the movie was interesting. They could've done a lot with it. I found the writing to be somewhat nonbelievable. The best movies are the ones where you forget about the actor and all you see is the character. This is why Heath Ledger was amazing as the Joker. This movie does not accomplish that. All I saw was John Travolta and Nick Cage acting; I was never engrossed in the actual characters. The action scenes are so over the top as well that I couldn't buy into it. Cheap entertainment, I watched it because it was on Netflix. It's worth watching if you can't find anything else, but don't expect to be blown away.

"Guns, Guts, and a Freaky Face Swap!","""Face/Off"" (1997) is an over-the-top, high-octane action thriller that takes the concept of identity swapping to a whole new level. Directed by John Woo, this film is a rollercoaster ride of outrageous stunts, mind-bending twists, and two powerhouse performances from John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.The premise is deliciously absurd: FBI agent Sean Archer (Travolta) becomes obsessed with catching the elusive terrorist Castor Troy (Cage), to the point where he undergoes a cutting-edge face transplant surgery to take on Troy's appearance and infiltrate his inner circle. However, the tables turn when Troy awakens from a coma and assumes Archer's identity, forcing Archer to navigate Troy's criminal world while trying to stop his nemesis from unleashing a devastating biological attack.What makes ""Face/Off"" truly shine is the sheer commitment of Travolta and Cage to their respective roles. Travolta embraces Troy's unhinged and flamboyant persona with gusto, delivering a delightfully over-the-top performance that borders on camp. Cage, on the other hand, brings a brooding intensity to his portrayal of Archer, seamlessly transitioning between the straight-laced agent and the unraveling impersonator.The action sequences are a hallmark of Woo's stylistic flair, with exhilarating shootouts, gravity-defying stunts, and a jaw-dropping boat chase that showcases the director's penchant for balletic violence. The film's climactic showdown between the two adversaries, each inhabiting the other's body, is a masterclass in choreographed mayhem and suspense.While the plot may strain credulity at times, ""Face/Off"" never takes itself too seriously, reveling in its own absurdity and embracing the sheer spectacle of its premise. It's a testament to the talents of Travolta and Cage that they manage to ground the film's outlandish premise with their committed performances, making the audience invest in the high stakes and emotional turmoil of their characters.In the end, ""Face/Off"" is a wildly entertaining ride that defies conventions and embraces its own over-the-top sensibilities. It's a must-watch for fans of action movies, Nicolas Cage, and John Travolta's uncanny ability to chew scenery like no other.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Excellent!,"""Face/Off"" is a classic action/thriller film.

This is also something that makes this film special.The story is also good.

I think I would have bought the premise more if they didn't show the procedure. Showing the procedure just proved how stupid the premise was. It was more believable BEFORE I saw the movie.Then the action sequences are just all so long and drawn out, that by the end of everything you're saying to yourself, just get it over with.I guess if you like gunshots, explosions and completely mindless action, you will likely like this movie, because it has lots. The story is obviously lame, and the action sequences are all prolonged to annoying lengths.All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Face/Off Review,"John Travolta and Nicholas Cage star in this action-filled drama about an obsessed government agent who needs to change his face to his greatest enemy if he is to shine like the hero he is. Sean Archer (Travolta) surgically puts his nemesis, Castor Troy (Cage)'s face on and infiltrates Troy's brother's prison to get information about a bomb that is about to blow up LA.While the acting is enticing -specifically on Cage's part, surprisingly- the majority of this film is filled with shooting and quick wit one-liners. Travolta plays a bad guy for 85% of the film, even at the beginning of the film he is still a bad person. Cage switches roles from clinically insane and nefarious to a sane, caring person and above all -- a hero.Special effects are great and the cinematography is superb. You get a bunch of laughs, mainly from Travolta, and there is a touch of romance. For the most part, they use up tons of bullets and create explosions as much as they can. It's mainly all they have for the two and a half hour run time.Aside from all that, it's really nothing special. It's another Travolta/Cage saves the day type movies with no lasting appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Im very glad they used John Travolta and Nicolas Cage for this and not Arnie or Van Damme as the acting quality throughout the movie is superb.

Only the basic scheme saves the film.,"Concerning John Woo, I fell in love with his work, back in the late eighties, with THE KILLER.

But then something strange happened to me, I suddenly got rapidly tired of all the John Woo trade marks, such as slow motion violent scenes, always doves in gunfights, with character never reloading their magasines.... Such things annoyed me so much that it sometimes interfered with the pleasure of the film itself. Here, in FACE OFF, I repeat, only the changing faces is thrilling, exciting for the audiences. Besides Nick Cage and John Travolta overplay for my taste and those eternal Jack Woo tade marks, those never ending gunfights and explosions.... I know that he was a Hollywood slave, but I think my favorite from him will remain WIND TALKERS for his USpart and A BULLET IN THE HEAD for the HK one.

"Imperfect, Yet Fun, and Great SciFi and Actioner","I can't give this movie a 10, as so many here have, because it's not a perfect film (though it is perfectly enjoyable). But it's far from a 1, as many others have rated it. (If you want to see what rates a 1, try 2 hours of Battlefield Earth.)All science fiction requires us to 'willingly suspend disbelief' for at least one thing we know to be untrue. Star Trek cannot exist if we insist that spaceships cannot move faster than the speed of light. (Warp 9, Scotty!) This movie asks us to accept not only that face transplants are possible, but that that alone is sufficient to assume another's identity. Complete brain transplants might make this story more plausible.So the viewer must grant that absurdity for the movie to work at all, but once you do, what a ride it is! Cage and Travolta not only draw distinctive portraits of their respective characters, but it mid~film, trade them with one another. I thought their ability to do that was magnificent when I first saw the move twenty plus years ago, and it's no less impressive now. If you watch what they do, and how they do it, one can only shake one's head in admiration.Now add John Woo action sequences, sense of pacing, and first-rate actors in the non-lead roles, and you're looking at a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours.I'd give routine action movies, e.g. The Transporter (or about 50 others that come to mind) a 6 or less often a 7. This movie may not be perfect, but it's head and shoulders ahead of so many routine and even good movies in the genre, hence my rating of 9. Movies in this genre I'd rank ahead of this are few and far between. (Leon, the Professional, comes to mind.)Relax, put your logic on hold, and the actors and action will give you a great time; they certainly gave me one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Enjoyable movie!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Near brilliant,"Wow! This could have been such a bad movie! The story is ridiculous, and in the hands of someone less talented than John Woo, it could make no sense. More importantly, had the two leads been less talented, the premise would have been impossible to buy. Yet ""Face/Off"" is done so well that it is a near masterpiece.Sean Archer (John Travolta) is an FBI agent who has spent his career tracking the terrorist Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage). When Archer finally catches Troy, he discovers that the terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere, and in order to find it, Archer has to (quite literally) switch faces with Troy to interrogate his paranoid-schizophrenic brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). Of course, complications arise when Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face for himself. So now Archer is Troy and Troy is Archer! Like I said, the story is beyond ridiculous. But the script is written intelligently enough that the characters act realistically. But that is beside the point. There are two things that make this film great: an outstanding cast, and John Woo.There was a time when movie stars were stars because of their acting ability, not because of how well they sold themselves to the tabloids and the celebrity gossip magazines. It shows here. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage have fun with their roles. They clearly studied each other's mannerisms and mimic them, so it's always clear that they are ACTING like their counterpart, not because the story says so.But Cage and Travolta are not the only ones with memorable performances. The supporting actors are played by skilled thespians as well, all of whom care about the film enough to flesh out their parts. The villains are fleshed out enough that they cease to become really villains. We gain sympathy for them because they act like real people. Nick Cassavetes and especially the always wonderful Gina Gershon are prime examples. And it's also great to see Colm Feore and the always terrific CCH Pounder.Then there is John Woo. Instead of taking the easy, safe way out and making it dumb, campy fun, he's got the guts and the skill to make it an full-out action movie. And it works. Of course, there are times when his little flourishes are too much, but that's just nit-picking.""Face/Off"" comes so close to being a ten, SO CLOSE! It comes so close that I nearly gave it that rating, but after thinking it over I can't in good conscience do so. The reason? The ending. The main problem is Travolta. For 90% of the movie, he holds his own and does brilliant work. But in the film's last scenes he goes over the top and goes into ""Broken Arrow"" mode (ironically also a John Woo film), and it casts a pall over the last action sequence. So close, but no cigar.Still, this is a great film, and a wild ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Trading Faces,"This was just an adrenaline rush. Nearly non-stop heart pumping action from beginning to end.

I don't do to well with such action nowadays, but when I was 19 this was dopeness.I'm sure Agent Archer (originally John Travolta then Nicolas Cage) didn't take the decision lightly to swap faces with arch-villain, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage then John Travolta). So many things could go wrong with that, but thousands of lives were at stake, so what are you gonna do? Archer had to find the location of a bomb in Los Angeles and the only one who truly knew was Castor Troy and his younger brother, Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola). Castor was in a coma and Pollux wasn't giving up any information. If somehow Archer could fool Pollux into believing he was his brother, then maybe he'd give up the intel. Let's trade faces.Things would've worked except Castor woke up out of his coma, faceless, then proceeded to take Archer's face.

"Travolta manages both faces, Cage none","For an actor, this must be great fun - to play the ultimate bad guy, and the good one, too. The former is easier than the latter, since good guys usually are pretty blank. Maybe that is evidence of good just not being natural, or at least not exciting.Anyway, Travolta manages both roles, doing the good guy with small means and great care, and letting the bad guy stand out like fireworks, but still imply ambiguity, short moments on the verge of regret. Cage, though, has trouble with both. The good guy he makes a bit too sweet, and the bad guy superficial, like a parody.I wonder why. Acting is a complicated art, having emotions and instinct as its sources. Probably, what an actor needs most of all is the ability to sympathize with the role, find that facet in oneself which somehow correlates to the character. It might be, then, that Travolta has more facets within himself to utilize, or more readily searches them out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

A must for any and all action fans,"Face/Off is a stunning achievement by acclamied Hong Hong director John Woo. Unlike many of Woo's past efforts, this movie has an awesome storyline to go along with a number of amazing action sequences and a very talented cast, which includes John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, and Gina Gershon.In Face/Off,  John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are both great actors. In the movie, they do what few actors before them have done: they get to play each other. They do it so convincingly that the only way to tell which one is which is to watch Dominique Swain and Joan Allen react to a given situation. (Swain and Allen play the daughter and wife of John Travolta's character, respectively).From the first shot fired at the beginning of the movie to the final fight between Travolta and Cage, Face/Off is nothing short of spectacular. Woo uses violence as an art form to tell a very emotional and very powerful story. The violence in the movie is absolutely necessary in telling the story, just as it is in ""The Matrix"". Without Woo's over-the-top action sequences, Face/Off would be just another sci-fi drama, and the futuristic world the screenplay originally intended for the movie would be absolutely necessary.Rating: 4 stars out of 4",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
John Woo proves his worth.,"A brave cop and a despicable criminal swapping faces to assume each other's identity has got to be one of the most far-fetched ideas for an action flick ever; but as patently silly and flawed as the premise for Face/Off is, it still proves to be an extremely entertaining film, it's brilliance being down to the sheer audacity of cast and director, who never allow the ridiculous nature of the story to get in the way of the fun.After the rather lukewarm reception that critics gave his first two US movies (Hard Target and Broken Arrow), director John Woo was clearly determined to restore his reputation as a master of action cinema and went all out to impress: Face/Off is bursting at the seams with brilliantly choreographed mayhem, explosive action set-pieces, and Woo's unmistakable movie-trademarks—endless shooting (including the obligatory two-handed gun-play and Mexican stand-offs), doves, churches, gratuitous slo-mo, and inner turmoil and emotional strife for goodies and baddies alike (Sean Archer's identity crisis, Castor's grief at his brother's death, Sasha Hassler's fear for her child).This ultra-stylish, uber-kinetic direction from a director out to prove his worth, combined with hilariously unrestrained performances from Travolta and Cage, more than compensates for the movie's more questionable aspects (such as Archer's lack of remorse at maiming and killing umpteen guards during his prison break) and goes to make Face/Off an absolute blast from start to finish.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Over the top silly but enjoyable,"Starring both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage in this seemingly 1997 ""classic"" from director John Woo. After a slow start as an introduction then once the face switch occurs, the level of intrigue and engagement does take into place and becomes more enjoyable. Many seem to describe Face/Off more as a action film but it feels seemingly more like a drama crime thriller with several lengthy action scenes.Although slightly confusing at first, the film's pace and story kicks in and the action does feel over the top and silly but it works. Due to the actors and the way it is filmed. The action scenes are fast and crisp and also doesn't take itself too serious. What is most bizarre is that fans of the film seem to disregard is that both characters only get their faces switch (meaning their faces get placed onto different bodies- they have slightly different body sizes. Cage slightly thinner. Travolta is lesser good shape) yet the character of Joan Allen (Travolta's wife) doesn't notice or question. Other than that, the film is seemingly enjoyable and the its long runtime moves quite quickly.With an ending that was needed although predictable, perhaps a twist could have made it better but we knew it wasn't going to happen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
A spectacular action film with a silly plot but great execution...,"All action films should be as utterly exhilarating as ""Face/Off."" Alas, the majority of them (I'd say 99%) are nothing but worthless retreads of iconic films such as ""Alien,"" ""The Terminator,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Speed,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. Originality isn't one of Hollywood's strongest traits these days.I'm the guy who's seen it all: Big explosions, car chases, over-exaggerated slow-motion stunts done with poorly-conceived visual effects. In short, I've seen just about everything there is to see in an action film.But here's a movie that made me sit back in my seat and stare in awe. It's hard to explain why, exactly, ""Face/Off"" works so very well. With a less talented director than John Woo behind the project, this could have turned into an undistinct, boring action flick with a poor idea and poor execution.Woo makes the silly idea seem quite convincing. In fact, the plot reminds me of an Andrew Niccol movie--original, fun, and seriously flawed. But the flaws aren't explained and it's better that way. Nothing in ""Face/Off"" could ever be done with a few surgical incisions--but the movie doesn't care about that, and neither do we.The movie is about two archenemies who switch faces. There's Sean Archer (John Travolta), an FBI agent/family man, and Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage). Archer is gruff and strict when it comes to his job; co-workers cower as they see him enter the room. When he is delivered a bottle of champagne after capturing Troy, he sends it away. The job isn't finished yet, so why should there be any celebrations?Years ago, Troy tried to assassinate Archer but ended up killing his son, instead. For years, Archer has had a personal vendetta to bring down Troy--but it's been hard. Troy is a sly devil, and in the opening sequence, he is finally knocked out by Archer and sent to a maximum security hospital.The problem is that prior to his capture, Troy planted a devastatingly powerful bomb inside a building somewhere in the city. The FBI can't figure out where it was hidden, and so Archer volunteers to follow through with a top-secret plan: He switches faces with Troy, so that he can be put in jail with Troy's brother, who helped him plant the bomb. After figuring out where it is, he can then return to his old face.The switching of the faces is done with the type of cosmetic surgery that aging Hollywood beauties would love to have: The doctor and his team make incisions, pull off the two guys' faces, and then sow them onto each other. Then they take away body fat and put in some hair implants--everything to make the two guys look like each other.Archer--with Troy's face--is sent to prison and collects the information from Troy's brother. But trouble arises, because before Archer can switch faces again, he finds out that tragedy struck the lab where everything was performed: The doctor is dead, and so are all the people who knew about the operation. The only person alive is Caster Troy--wearing Archer's face.Left stranded in prison, with Troy posing as himself back on the outside (living with his family, playing FBI man), Archer (with Troy's face) escapes from prison and tries to warn his family about who is playing daddy. But it's hard to do, since his own wife thinks he's someone who killed their only son.That's where the film really succeeds; it has some great ideas, and the very thought of becoming the man you hate and then being stuck in prison for your whole life, living out his life sentence, is gut-wrenching. When you first see Troy enter the prison with Archer's face and parade around in front of a chained Archer, it really makes you feel queasy.This is an extravagant and amazing action film, and the last great John Woo movie ever made before he became a commercialized Hollywood hack (no offense, Woo, but ""Windtalkers"" sucked).Cage and Travolta are great at playing each other--Travolta turns on the charm factor when he's imitating Cage, and Cage turns on the overwhelmed everyman as he's playing Travolta. Bad acting really could have harmed a film like ""Face/Off."" Here, it only makes an already excellent action movie even better.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

The plot is insane, but the execution is gripping, filled with explosive action, emotional tension, and dramatic character moments. The film maintains a high-energy pace, balancing stylish shootouts with deep personal stakes. Some scenes are edgy, and the over-the-top acting adds to the film's almost surreal quality. While the premise is ridiculous, it works because of the commitment from the cast and the bold direction. The tension between the two characters keeps the film engaging, and the emotional weight makes the conflict feel real despite the absurdity. There are moments where it feels excessive, but that's part of the fun. It's an entertaining and unforgettable movie that doesn't hold back. I enjoyed it and would give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Very strong story,"The premise here is fantastic and I'm surprised had never been utilized in action film before. Add in Travolta and Cage hamming it up for ultimate fun and you have a very solid action movie. The stunts are highly entertaining and filmed with a keen eye from action maestro John Woo. All in all, this is an action classic that still holds up well based on its intriguing story and great execution.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Good old action...,"""Face/Off"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch an FBI agent changes face with a terrorist who killed his son in order to find out where is a bomb in Los Angeles and defuse it. The terrorist wakes up from a coma and seeks revenge.I liked this movie because I found its plot very interesting and different from what I have watched in other action movies. The direction which was made by John Woo was good despite some mistakes he made with revealing the faces of his stuntmen and not his actors in some scenes. The interpretations of both John Travolta who played as Sean Archer and Nicolas Cage who played as Castor Troy were good and their combination worked well. Finally, I have to say that ""Face/Off"" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend it to every action movie fan because I am sure that you will have a great time watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Nice Action Flick...,"In the 1997 action hit ""Face/Off,"" John Travolta plays Sean Archer: a cop hot on the trail of criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), who has just planted a bomb somewhere. Basically, after catching Troy at an aircraft hanger, Archer decides to have surgery and take on Castor's face so he can meet up with Troy's brother and ask him where they hid the bomb.The plot premise may be ridiculous, but the rest of the film makes up for it. I'm not a big fan of John Travolta, but he was good in this. I like Nicolas Cage in action films and he didn't let me down in ""Face/Off"".John Woo beautifully directs this action flick, using surroundings to bring out the characters feelings and emotions. When they're angry, the background becomes dark. When a character is happy, it's bright(er).If you like John Woo's work, see this film. If you don't like John Woo's work, see this film. It's a surprisingly gritty and tough action flick with emotion. Sometimes the film gets dragged out at certain scenes. Sometimes scenes the editors should have cut ended up in the film. Either way, ""Face/Off"" is overall a surprisingly good action film.4/5 stars --John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Delirious, Overblown Fun","I watched this more than once in the cinema on its first release, and several times on video in the following couple of years. I'd more or less forgotten about it since until this revisit. It's still overblown. The sexualisation of the daughter has not aged at all well. It's still a delirious kind of fun, that could only work with the full-blooded committed performances of Cage and Travolta. It doesn't quite seem to be the game-changer we all thought it would be, and Woo's Hollywood career never took off in the way it was meant to. But it's still a silly sort of blast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"I never bothered seeing this movie, because I could tell by the previews it was horrible.  I just saw it tonight, though, because it was on somewhere I was forced to be.  It lived up to my pre-judgement of it and more.  I thought the plot idea was ridiculous to an unvelievable degree, but it was actually outdone and rendered rather tame by the absolutely-no, obscenely-farcical `action' scenes.  There's really no need to go into specifics.  The movie started out horribly-with a ridiculous fight scene-and just got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.  No redeeming qualities what-so-ever.I've seen worse moviesbut for star-power and big-budget, major studio films, I think this has got to be the worst.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
This is what action was meant to be!,"John Woo is a very talented man.  why have we not seen some of his work in America earlier than this?  Once combined with the marvellous acting of john Travolta and Nicolas Cage we have a perfect action blockbuster.  John Travolta is meant to play the villian.  He is perfectly evil, cunning, and sarcastic.  This film goes above and beyond your normal expectations for a action packed thriller.  It is full of tear jerking, emotion moments, humor, and enough plot to support an entire television series.  You'll love this movie no matter what your preference.  It's drama, comedy, romance, and action!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"It's like looking in a mirror, only, not.","There's a tendency to undervalue the action movie. Certainly there's a wide expanse of land in cinema world where film fans reside, where the thought of praising an action film for being ""classic"" cinema is considered treason against the very word. Yet some of the artistry involved in the genre's leading lights is purely sublime, regardless of how bizarre and unlikely the plot is. Enter John Woo's berserker, ear splitting, high octane actioner, Face/Off. Rightly sitting along side the likes of Die Hard and Predator as genre pieces that showcase how good things can be when it all comes together, Woo's movie is as much fun as you could wish to have for over two hours of explosive, fantastical, unadulterated cinema.The plot sees John Travolta's serious family man cop, Sean Archer, devote his life to catching unbalanced maniacal bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). There's some bad history between the two and when Archer manages to capture both Troy and his equally vile brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), it would seem to be closure for Archer and his family. However, it's found that the Troy's have left a ticking bomb somewhere in Los Angeles, and if undetected it will flatten L.A. and kill practically everyone. So, Archer undergoes a revolutionary face-swapping procedure with the now comatose Castor and sets about getting the information from the incarcerated Pollux. But wait!, Castor wakes up and turns the tables by assuming Archer's identity, setting the wheels in motion for each man to live the others life until the Face/Off between the pair will decide their respective fate.Unbelievable? Of course. Who cares? Well nobody should really, because surely going into a film like this one is expecting the ludicrous. Both Cage and Travolta are superbly realising the spectacular nature of the script, and being mesmerising in the duality of the roles into the bargain. Make no bones about it, Woo and his team have crafted a benchmark action movie. There's a trail of thought that suggests that Woo basically keeps making the same movie, that's a fair enough point, sure enough, all of his staple action sequences and traits are evident in Face/Off. Yet Woo has delved into his characters, given them some flesh on their action bones, and then upped the anti in action set pieces to cloak them in chaotic beauty. From the opening Jet escape/pursuit set up, to the outrageous speed boat finale, the film is one long exhilarating breath taker. Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain & Nick Cassavetes all file into the background playing important characters who are rightly secondary to the protagonists, while a ream of extras come and go as each are dispatched in a hail of Woo inspired carnage. The pace never sags and the eyes and ears are treated to a vibrancy that is often sadly missing from many other big budgeted action blockbusters.This is a masterpiece of action cinema, so even as a Orson Welles crane shot is a magnificent thing, so it be with the sight of two stunt men flailing thru the air in a spray of exploding water. Oh yes sir, this is a classic alright. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The film's title says it all!,"FACE/OFF isn't really your same old action guy film, but it's original in terms of John Woo's style of directing. This is the first movie I've seen from the guy who gave us HARD-BOILED, and obviously, Hollywood needs him more than B.B.B.B. (Big Budget Block Busters, to be exact). What I have learned is that his films have a distinctive trademark: the guy holding two guns at one time. The question of the hour is: will it appeal to everybody? Pretty much to say, yes, thanks to the familiar ""faces"" of John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, who swap skins in beating the living hell out of each other. Some more face-to-face action would've been appreciated for this ultra-lengthy feature that has you wondering when it's going to be over, but both are truly incredible in the well-crafted action bits given. I felt Cage fared better overall, but Travolta, still showing off his grinny expression, proves that a Hollywood comeback requires a much needed and much stronger level of momentum. There's so much here that it has you shrouded in mystery about what's going to happen later on, and who will win at the end? FACE/OFF is unusually strange in its storyline, so maybe a few more viewings would help gain some better understanding (please, I've seen enough of 140 minutes already!). Comedianne Margaret Cho is an unexpected surprise here, trading her stand-up comedy routines for dramatic roles. John Woo could be a driving force behind Hollywood action / intrigue movies in the coming years, and is he making anymore lately? Let's hope so!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Not like wine...,"I saw this movie when it just got out in '97 and I thought it was awesome. At 17 it was the bomb! I write this fresh from a second view and I must say (older and wiser) that Face/Off has lost some of its appeal. As a pure no-brainer-action flick it is easily on par with everything Hollywood can throw at it today and it is surely as a such it should be viewed. The action is insanely over the top as is to be expected from Woo, John T and Nicolas C's acting does small wonders with the often cheesy script and the plot, while ingenious in its concept, suffers from numerous, obviously dumb, flaws. I often found myself laughing at the turn of events (of course he wakes up without face, alone and unguarded only to sum the prior events up within 30 seconds and with a phone within grasp:-). The buildup to the epic conclusion seems strained and uninspired and the ending itself wallows in cheese.To sum it up: great as a Saturday hangover movie with loads of cola and crisps or with a sixpack and a couple of buddies.

An Energy Like No Other Action Film,"When Sean Archer (as Castor Troy) carefully put the walkman head set over little Adam's ears and the roars of gunfire, violence and death were overcome by ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", my emotion for ""Face/Off"" was confirmed.  It was the single greatest action film ever made mainly because it was so much more.  Its drama within its action is more compelling than any other action film.The film is driven by two strong performances by Travolta and Cage and helmed by the best action director in the business, John Woo.  The originality of the story goes way beyond the usual bad vs. good storyline. The premise of good becoming bad and vise versa is thought-provoking and has incredible possibilities, all of which are exploited beautifully within this film.  Imagine the repercussions of taking on the identity of your greatest nemesis and your son's murderer.  Looking in the mirror and seeing everything you have come to hate.  Knowing that your worst enemy in sleeping with your wife and comforting your daughter.  Everyone you trust wants you dead and everyone you hate wants to help.  A story with elements such as these has already gone well beyond all action films to date by examining the nature of good and evil and there co-existence rather than showing them. What comes next meets the all expectations of the story.With action sequences that leave you breathless and always move the story forward, with characters that you really come to care for or really come to hate, and with a level of entertainment which is off the existing charts.

A cracking over the top action/thriller that is still enjoyable almost 20 years later.,"Face/Off utilizes a very original story that is made even more enjoyable with over the top action and crackling one liners. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage make a great pairing as the respective hero and villain who both share the role throughout the movie. Director John Woo who is well known for his non-stop kinetic action sequences has done an excellent job with one of the biggest mega blockbusters of 1997.The movie starts with freelance terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) attempting to assassinate FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta). Though Sean survives the gunshot, his son Michael is accidentally killed. Six years later, the grief stricken Sean Archer has dedicated everything to take down his sworn enemy Castor Troy. Following a breakthrough in which the FBI and the LAPD converge on the Los Angeles International Airport to intercept Castor Troy and his brother Pollux, a gunfight ensues which sees a number of FBI agents killed, Pollux arrested, and Castor knocked into a coma but not before taunting Sean that he has a bomb somewhere that will wipe out all of Los Angeles. At the urging of his partner Tito Biondi (Robert Wisdom), Archer secretly undergoes a highly experimental face transplant procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore) and Dr. Miller (C.C.H Pounder) to take on Castor's face and appearance including a special voice box to sound like his arch enemy. Sean/Castor is taken undercover to a maximum security prison to obtain the location of the whereabouts of the bomb from his brother Pollux who is also in the same prison. The mission appears to go smoothly until Castor Troy awakens from his coma and adopts Sean Archer's face and appearance. Unbeknownst to Sean's long suffering wife Eve (Joan Allen) and his rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain), Castor/Sean integrates himself into their lives and his FBI colleagues who now see him as a public hero are none the wiser. Sean/Castor must fight his way to take down Castor/Sean once and for all and to regain his own identity back.John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are both brilliantly cast as the hero and villain who both adopt each other's identities. You can tell the difference between the intense Sean Archer and the flamboyant Castor Troy and when the roles are reversed.John Woo who made his mark in Hong Kong with action classics such as The Killer (1989) and Hard Boiled (1992) and exploded onto the Hollywood scene with Hard Target (1993) continues to trail blaze through Hollywood with this mega hit.It's hard to believe that Face/Off is almost 20 years old but like a fine wine, this over the top action/thriller is still an enjoyable classic over time and to this day is still recognised as one of the finest action movies of the 90's.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Despite the philosophical questions raised by its scientific assumptions (based on Descartes' dualistic teachings), ""Face/Off"" never pretends to be anything but a thrill ride! Travolta and Cage make a marvelous team. They give their characters (who are in very unique and sometimes unbelievable situations) great dramatic flair. Cage's performance is yet another showcasing of his Oscar-caliber talent.With an adrenaline-injected and haunting musical score from Hans Zimmer protege, John Powell, and action sequences that have John Woo written all over them, you really can't go wrong. From the disturbing beginning, to the reconciliatory end, the movie carried me along at a break-neck pace. Yet, it was always willing to pause momentarily, to appreciate the artistic beauty and color of a scene, or to relish the drama of a slow-motion shot.""Face/Off"" is simply the best film I've seen in a long time.

The Ultimate Face Off,"Most people have this overall idea that action films involving shootouts and violence are generally for guys only; however, as a female, I do enjoy a good action film every now and then. Face/Off is an awesome example of a good action film that is sure to amaze. With the use of two dynamic Hollywood actors, intense shootout scenes, and visuals that appear to be realistic; it was sure to capture my attention. In the movie, John Travolta plays the well-loved, good FBI Agent, Sean Archer, that is bound-determined to put the evil, vindictive Nicholas Cage's character, Castor Troy, behind bars for the murder of his son. However, in order for him to accomplish this, Archer must find a way to get inside Troy's head and figure out what he can do to stop him. The only, what seemed to be reasonable solution at the time, was for him to trade physical features (more specifically faces) with Castor Troy. This gives Archer an open view into the deadly secrets of Troy; however, what would happen if Castor got a hold of Archer's face? Absolute chaos, and that's exactly what happens. Sean Archer with Troy's face, and Castor Troy with Archer's face. So what makes this movie so great? The John Travolta and Nicholas Cage character switch-up. Travolta as the evil, vindictive character, Troy, was humorously interesting. He gave the character a little bit of flare through his evil charm to take over good-cop Archer's family and gave the audience a laugh when he covered up his face-change to Archer's daughter by telling her ""Papa's gotta a brand new bag. Ow!"" as he left her room. In comparison, Nicholas Cage, the now defenseless Archer eager to get his life back, plays the character with a more exposure of emotion as he struggles to get his life back to the way it was.As most people know this is an action film, but what they don't know is how intense and suspenseful the shoot-outs are. There are many parts of the movie that are pretty intense, like when Castor Troy (as John Travolta) is on one side of a mirror and Sean Archer (as Nicholas Cage) is on the other side. They're both aware of each other's being as they communicate back and forth. Then, when Troy states ""Plan B, let's just kill each other"". They both turn to look into the mirror and fire their guns; this penetrates to an extreme shootout that ends with someone falling through a ceiling window. Throughout the whole scene, and movie, you're on the end of your seat wondering what's going to happen next, which is very exciting!Have you ever been in an operating room and witnessed a surgery? If not, here's your chance. The graphics and visuals of the face transfer scene when John Travolta's face is lasered off and put on Nicholas Cage's body seems so real that it's hard to believe that it's not. The use of taking the measurements of their faces and using computer software makes it work. Not to mention they even level out the hair length and color to make it look the same. Realistically you know it didn't happen; however, it's hard to not believe because of how legit it actually looks. All in all, this is a great movie that will leave you on the end of your seat. If you like intensity, realistic graphics and visuals, and a twist to the common good guy verse bad guy storyline; this is the movie for you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

The acting by John Travolta as Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage as Castor Troy, Joan Allen as Eve Archer, Alessandro Nivola as Pollux Troy, Gina Gershon as Sasha Hassler and Dominique Swain as Jamie Archer was absolutely brilliant. I haven't seen many John Travolta films and only have 2 of his films on DVD, 1) Grease, 2) Face/Off, but besides Grease this film was awesome and Travoltas acting as Sean Archer was absolutely brilliant. Nicolas Cages acting as Castor Troy was also absolutely brilliant and I loved watching the controversy between Sean Archer and Castor Troy. Face/Off really had lots of great things about it and was a tense psychological thriller which involved Sean Archer having to go through facial surgery to become Castor Troy and for Castor Troy to become Sean Archer which caused confusion and tension amongst others including Sean Archers wife and daughter. The real Sean Archer who was Castor Troy was a more calmer man towards Eve and Jamie Archer, but the real Castor Troy was a more evil and too over the top man towards Eve and Jamie and had to be killed by the real Sean Archer.

"What outrageous over the top excess, without apology. See it!","Face/Off (1997)An overcharged, comicbook flavored kind of doomsday scenario with a huge twist and more action than two hours can handle. Terrific to watch, even if it's preposterous and filled with superficial glitz. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are both terrific as themselves—and as each other!No doubt this kind of trading places story could have really interesting psychological depths—and that movie is waiting to be made—but here they choose to play up the sensational aspects (sleeping with the other's wife, etc.). And that's exactly what this movie demands. It's all about excess.And fun. If you take it too seriously, you're too serious. It's seriously funny and almost joyous, even as lots of people get unceremoniously killed. Even the ridiculous first scene, which goes on a very very very long time, is all about outdoing James Bond in outrageous chase and shoot-em-up scenes.If the movie lacks class, or wants some subtle aspects here and there, or even needs strong female roles, there is a kind of deliberate pedal to the floor aspect here that is perfect. Perfect. Chinese born director John Woo isn't known for subtlety, though I haven't seen his Chinese films. But he melds well with Hollywood's larger style, and here is the result, a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, this is fun!","Looking back at the time period from 1996 to 2001, we had a lot of bad movies come out, but the ones that were good and really do hold up are all the more awesome. This is one of the greatest action movies I've ever seen. It's my favorite Nicolas Cage movie and my favorite John Travolta movie. I just love this film for how utterly entertaining it is in every way imaginable. It has tons of explosions and great action scene after great action scene. I guess the movie itself isn't very intelligent, but the thing is, there's so much effort put into it!I love these actors and characters. Travolta and Cage seem to be going absolutely bonkers in this movie with exaggerated facial expressions and yells everywhere. In a lesser film, that would be annoying but here it's just icing on the cake for the great scenery, camera angles, original ideas, and great backstories. I really do sincerely sympathize with these characters and I wanted them to get out okay! The pacing is just incredible. It's pretty long, but it's worth it just to see all this cool stuff go on and on.The emotions are amazingly strong in this. Every single actor is right there in the moment. They're doing everything they can to understand not just their characters, but each other's characters. The scene with the face transplant is seriously one of the most intense I have ever seen in any movie. Then there's the scene where Cage awakens with no face and we finally get to see him in the reflection. It's such a haunting scene. There's so much variety in all the action and I found myself rooting for these fun and wacky characters. True, a lot of it doesn't make sense, but it's enjoyable popcorn fun from start to finish. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
violent and dull,"'Face/Off' is a film about a secret agent who has had his face swapped with another man's: a terrorist/criminal. Now, based on that information, you pretty much know what is going to happen in the film. The only thing that this movie has going for it is violence and an attempt to come up with a new idea. I will admit, the idea of swapping identies is kind of cool. However, this film does not get anymore original than that. It is all about the violence and people getting killed and things blowing up and major showdowns between characters. That's really all there is to it. If you're of the male gender, then you may go for this sort of film. If you prefer films that make you think, then I suggest looking elsewhere because there is little to be gained in this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Face/Off!,"One of the most thrilling and exciting action films ever in My opinion is Face/Off! The movie stars John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Colm Feore, Harve Presnell, John Carroll Lynch, CCH Pounder, Margaret Cho, Thomas Jane, Tommy Flanagan, Kirk Baltz, Robert 'Bobby Z' Zajonc, John Bloom AKA Joe Bob Briggs, and Thomas Rosales Jr. All of these actors acted very well. Both Travolta and cage have a great performances as their characters and these performances are arguably their best! Nivola also has a good performance as a villain. All of the characters are really good. The action is really incredible. I was amazed by the chase scenes! The music by Media Venture John Powell is great and its arguably his greatest score to date! The film is directed excellently by John Woo and this maybe the best film that he has directed in My opinion! Woo is one of My new favorite directors! If you like John Travolta and Nicolas Cage and want to see them in greats performances and want to see an exciting action Sci-Fi film then I strongly recommend that you see Face/Off today!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Action movies don't get any better then this.,"Is ""Face/Off"" the best action movie ever made? In my opinion it is.There are lot's of elements that make ""Face/Off"" different and better from other action movies. The Woo-ism is most definitely one of those elements. With Woo-ism I mean the special style John Woo always uses in his movies. Trademark John Woo style is the use of slow motion. The use of it is perfect and never overused, it certainly adds to the atmosphere and contributes to the perfectionism of the movie.The story itself is just too ridiculous for words (even though face transplants have recently become possible) but somehow the story becomes believable. Maybe it's because of the directing or maybe it's because of the acting or maybe it's because of both. That another thing that's different from other action action movies: The acting. The cast is perfect and not just some 2nd class action star Rambo-Wannabee actors. The cast is full with big names, but the ones that steal the show are John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, they imitate each other perfect. It's certainly Nicolas Cage's best role till date.Another great element is of course the action itself. The actions is superb and very cool! There are some really memorable scene's with of course the famous mirror scene as one of them. (Even though John Woo used it before in one of his lesser known movies; ""Hard Target"" with Jean-Claude Van Damme)John Powell's musical score also adds to the movie and so does the cinematography from Oliver Wood and the editing from Steven Kemper and Christian Wagner.I can't really name one bad thing about this movie. Everything is simply perfect, the directing, the acting, the story the sub-plots, the characters the dialog. Everything feels right!Not just an average action movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
They don't make them like this anymore,"Frankly I just reviewed a recent movie by Nick cage that was really bad. It reminded me that in the past, Cage had talent for choosing great movies. I mean his roles were still crazy but it worked well. I think its because the creativity has left Hollywood 15-20 years ago. Today its mostly reboots, boring comics and woke agenda.I watched this movie almost 20 years ago when I was a teen. What an original action movie with great acting by Cage and Travolta. This one is a must watch along with Cage's other movies from the 90's and beginning of the 2000's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
John Woo's best American film...and nearly on par with his Hong Kong work,"Representing the first (and possibly last) time that an American studio left Woo alone and let him do what he does, ""Face/Off"" is the most thrilling and original American action film since ""Die Hard"".  It's ironic that the talent had to be brought in from Hong Kong.The best of Woo's Hong Kong work reflects a fascination with duality; two men who become so close (either through hatred OR friendship) that they are almost two sides of the same person.  Here that concept is taken to extremes in a science fiction device which forces two mortal enemies to trade physical likenesses.  It's a daring idea for a serious action film, and Woo may be one of the very few directors who could pull it off.The action sequences are, of course, stunning, but that's only half of the Woo formula.  His tragic-opera approach to melodrama is here as well, starting right from the opening scene that creates a permanent and intense connection between the two characters.  And while neither Travolta nor Cage could replace Chow Yun-Fat, they are worthy substitutes under Woo's direction.  They look credible in the both-guns-blazing shootouts, and they seem to be having a great time playing each other's acting styles against one another.While the final scene may be a bit over-the-top, and it may run a bit long, this still joins the ranks of the best of American action alongside ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Face Off doesn't disappoint.,"Face Off is a great action film by every right. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage give great performances.

Like looking in the mirror...,"Well, let's face it, for all its (over)use of cases, shootouts and stunts as spectacular as they're formulaic, ""Face/Off"" is more than your average show-off action-packed thriller. The film stands off above all its peers thanks to one simple but genius premise, so creative and incongruous, you've got to wonder how come they waited till Cinema was 100 years to think about having the hero and the villain switching their faces, and see where this is getting, not that it would have required many special effects, right?I can imagine, not without excitement, the brainstorm that lead to the plot genesis: the two guys have to hate each other, the villain isn't just the antagonist, he's the hero's nemesis, so a cop and a criminal isn't enough, how about making it personal like say, the bad guy accidentally kills the hero's son, the hero's got a reason to hate him and apparently the villain seems to hold some serious grieves against him, that's for the reciprocity. What next? Well, how about the big question, why would they switch the faces? Well, because the hero will have to pass as the bad guy to know a secret, what kind of secret, the kind of emergency life-and-death secrets, a code of some sort bingo, a bomb.Now, we need someone the bad guy trusts blindly, let's give him a brother and while you're at it, give them some kind of legendary pairing names, Achilles and Ajax, Romulus and Remus or Castor and Pollux we progress. So, suppose they take Castor's face and implant it on the hero, let's call him Sean (like John but more original), everyone would know? No, it has to be a secret mission to ensure its success. Wait; will Castor remain face-less? Of course not, this is where it's getting tricky. Suppose he wakes up, he discovers the plan and ask the doctors to implant Sean's face on his before getting rid of them. Wow, talk about the perfect set-up, I can only imagine the first face-to-face between the two guys. Now, we've got our first 'great and memorable moment'.And the creative implications of the film are countless, the immersion of the criminal within the very family he dispossessed from one son, his luscious looks on 'his' own daughter, or the bad guy having to team up with criminals. But wait, how about the initial motive, the bomb and all that stuff? Well this is the icing on the cake, Castor tells his brother who he is, he discards the bomb and he's the town hero. Now I'm sure it didn't take more than an hour to get the spine of the film and this is not to diminish its merit, but to highlight the positive effects of inventiveness. All it takes is one hell of an idea and the rest is only coverage, the writing, the spectacular effects, all the most significant departments of film-making are involved, on the top of them: acting.It goes without saying that the film couldn't have existed if Castor was played by Danny De Vito and Sean by Arnold Schwarzenegger, although the premise of a spoof-remake would be hilarious. So they needed two actors of the same size shape and caliber, well, I guess they got it right with John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, two of the most bankable actors of the 90's, fittingly blue-eyed, hairy-chested and equally tall and strong. Well, of course, the suspension of disbelief asks more from us. Many persons would point out the possibility of the cop's wife to notice some differences in some specific parts of their husbands' anatomy. Although, it's not improbable that in the heat of the passion, a woman wouldn't notice, but then how about the hands, feet, well, it asks a lot but let's not to be too technical.Indeed, one of the film's strengths is not to focus too much on the scientific material, ""Face/Off"" could easily be labeled as Sci-fi movie, but it focuses more on the change of personalities and the way too men who hate each other, learn to live in another skin. It's an insightful examination of the eternal correlation between what we are and how we look, and that the whole 'don't look at me' can't work in real life. I have one scene in mind right now, when the daughter helps Castor because she simply can't believe he is not her father. But I got so carried away by those details that I forgot I had to talk about the acting, which is the little spice the film provided, for our greatest delight, and for both Travolta and Cage who certainly took it as an extraordinary challenge.I recently suggested a poll asking which of the two actors gave the better performance as the other's character. Now, I realize it's an unfair question, because the two actors didn't try to impersonate each other, not quite. They played their personal version of good guys and villains, and made them match. Nicholas Cage has a unique way to make his eye bulge and look demonically frightening while Travolta puts it all in that devilish smile and menacing eyes, obviously with Travolta's face, you can't mimic expression made possible with Cage's. But Cage has also an extraordinary capacity to look sad and sensitive, it's all in the eyes again  and Travolta's puts it in the smile, and it works again. I rooted for Cage as a good guy equally as for Travolta and thought they were charismatic as bad guys.""Face-Off"" might be labeled as an action pop-corn movie but its power and awesomeness lies on the fact that it didn't take Woo's directing skills (indeed, it's spectacular from A to Z) for granted but involve everything that makes movies worth to watch, and naturally, it didn't make the unforgivable mistake to deprive us from a mirror-scene.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

When the theme kicks in just as Cage's boat jumps through the police boat, I still get chills. Some may complain that it is too drawn out, but the movie has to build to an ending that is this oversized. It is the battle between the ultimate villain and the ultimate cop, almost like the chase between Frankenstein and his monster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The first American Woo film not to insult the genius of the man!,"John Woo's best film in Hollywood and probably will sadly never be surpassed. He has been wasted post Hong Kong but this was a genuinely class action movie. The plot itself is about as logical as flushing the toilet and then crapping, but the convoluted story takes a back seat to interesting character development. Its Sci-Fi elements don't take too much focus which is good, and unlike Woo to do so anyway. The film has John Travolta and Nic Cage both playing opposite characters, Travolta playing a more refined and less showy role than usual and Cage playing his usual extravagant role, then the two roles are traded as their characters get their faces swapped. There is an interesting dynamic as both actors play both to their usual types (very theatrical) and against type (more refined). Not to mention the psychological elements of the character with both having to wear the face of their Nemesis who they despise. It is particularly interesting from Archers point of view because he begins to hate himself and almost can't take what is happening to him. Of course as you expect with Woo the action is first rate, albeit with mucho doubling for Cage and Travolta. What is amazing now though is that face transplants are possible, so who knows perhaps one day soon we could take on someones whole identity. ****1/2",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Travolta incestuously lusting after his own daughter was not only repulsive but must have given the red-light to many a sicko.

Both Cage and Travolta are brilliant as they play the roles of good and evil, with Nicholas Cage giving his best career performance as psychopathic 'Castor Troy'. The film has great action, which in itself is never enough, what it also has is drama, emotion and interesting female characters.

Face/Off: Sensational action with a fragile storyline,"Stylized and chaotic action sequences are an indispensible ingredient of John Woo films, and Face/Off is no different in that aspect.With an ensemble star-studded cast comprising Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, and the implementation of the in-vogue conceptualization of plastic surgery as the central idea in order to apprehend a nefarious criminal, the film maybe deemed inconceivable all the same as it departs from the traditional realm of scientific knowledge(as is evident in the process of plastic surgery portrayed in the movie).
Sean Archer(FBI Detective) embarks on a hunt to intercept his arch-rival Castor Troy, with personal scores to settle.Archer's vendetta against Castor culminates years later in an ambush wherein Castor and his slow-witted accomplice Pollux are ensnared and Castor concedes the knowledge of a bomb ticking away in a specific location of the city, but fails to digress into it's location, as he slips into a coma.Archer, in order for Pollux to reveal the bomb location undergoes plastic surgery, swapping his face with his nemesis, Troy.
In an unexpected turn of events, which may seem as an erratic misconception, intricately woven in the exquisite acting performances of both Travolta and Cage and sketchy action sequences.
The plot may appear to be quite weak and illusionary, but the movie rides on the coattails of scintillating action sequences and adept acting.With Troy scheming to wreck Archer while Archer striving to apprehend Troy, the film all the same, proves to be a perfect entertainer with barely a moment available to catch your breath.

The gun battles are great, and the actors really came into character.

John Woo in the USA,"I didn't really know what to expect when I decided to see Face/Off. I love all the movies John Woo made back in Hong Kong, they are all fantastic. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some of his Hollywood endeavors such as the sadly mediocre M-I:2 . I was afraid, but I decided to give Face/Off a chance.I wasn't disappointed. Though the basic science-fiction-esquire premise is kinda sorta very silly, it is ultimately a small nitpick in the face of the main performances and the action.Indeed, Nick Cage and John Travolta do a good job at exchanging faces, roles, personalities, whatever and it makes for some entertaining situations. The rest of the cast, however, is pretty boring and I was most disappointed to see how Joan Allen just seems to stand around with big, wide eyes...Then there are the big, fat, juicy John Woo action scenes. At first it was kind of strange seeing Cage and Travolta diving into the air, Matrix-style, like Chow-Yun Fat, but I quickly got used to it. The action scenes didn't disappoint, with gun-blazing, slow-mo extravaganzas and a final explosive chase which actually made me giggle with glee. And I have seen a lot of good action movies--including most of John Woo's.So, in the end, I was glad to have seen Face/Off, as it made me see a John Woo movie I hadn't yet. Despite a pretty silly premise, this is a good action movie... Have fun !",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
The Woo Meister strikes,"Well this is a good movie, the action is good, the story is OK (a wee bit unbelievable you may say, but this is an action flick and not a Spike Lee movie), the actors are good, from the lovely Dominique Swain, to Nicolas Cage (VERY GOOD, I like him a LOT, in almost every movie, due to his appearance) as both Troy and Archer and Travolta was good too, though not as good as Cage (Travolta is better in other roles, I didn't like his Archer, but the Castor he played rocked (such a cool father type)). The direction is well, if you know the name John Woo, you know what I mean. There are of course a few bad things here, a bit too much drama, crying and so on you sometimes feeling you have rented a Meryl Streep film. A little few action scenes but something really outstanding is shown here also, characters in an action film!!! The opening scenes are the best in this one, from the first kill, to where Troy is captured. HALLELUJAH!8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Cliche, explosion, cliche","I can't argue with the action sequences, which considering the genre of movie perhaps should make me rate it higher.However, our society has evolved too much to allow ridiculous  story lines like this to exist.  The majority of reviewers gave this high marks, and I suspect a conspiracy.  Either that or everyone else drank a gallon of cough syrup before seeing the film.The acting was horrible, the plot twists could be seen a mile away, and the ending dragged on for an eternity.  Getting beaten in the head while driving a speed boat is a little far fetched, only to leap back into action after a much-needed four seconds of rest.Someone hits you in the head, you typically fall down.

'Bag guys' roles are more suitable for Cage and Travolta,"There are actors who can play both bad and good guys. There are also those who can play just bad guys but they're sometimes offered to play good ones. Both Cage and Travolta are rather 'bad guys' actors. It was fun for me to see a good guy (initially Travolta, FBI agent and a good father and husband) getting Cage's face and gazing at himself at the mirror in an innocent astonishment (it's just after you saw Cage as a bandit in the beginning of the movie). Vice versa, initial Travolta looks not natural until he gets into the gangster's skin. Maybe it's a matter of habits, but I would really prefer to see these two actors playing bad guys. All the other movies where they were peaceful and good (or just such scenes) didn't grip me at all.Nevertheless, the action itself is great, I did enjoy the movie in general. It's the action which is more important than the credibility of technical achievements. But the drama was not the best thing to include in the movie. Without it, I would have given 8.

ridiculous,"Whenever you see a typical movie made 20-25 years ago, you wonder how most films today have sunk into noisy, stupidly designed action death moans such as Face/Off.  Near the beginning of the film, a jet is taking off a noisy runway with people yelling and shooting at each other with a boisterous music score to boot.  If you add in a incoherent plot, far-fetched scenes that baffle medical description, what you have is a perfect example of the so-called action film of the 90's.I'm not just criticizing this film, but the whole action/thriller genre which has forgotten how to use silence as a mood enhancer, forgotten how to develop believable characters who are well rounded(around the hips too), forgotten how to use loud sound effects effectively.  Its like a bunch of bombs going off all at once-giving no impact to their devastation since we've grown so insensitive to the constant harrassment to our ears.  I can save eight or nine bucs by just going to the nearest noisy arcade around the corner to get the same result.This is the rule of thumb for most films in this genre and wouldn't want to discredit some films that have not forgotten how to do it right.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Hey, what's wrong with being over the top?","Face Off is one of the greatest films ever made. Beneath its exaggerated characters and ridiculously unrealistic plot is a film that recreates classic Buddhist literature and builds bridges between eastern and western storytelling. The result is an intelligent, high-action film about duality, identity, morality, and how far one will go for vengeance, even if it means losing one's family, and oneself.Or maybe it's a fun action movie, I don't know.What makes Face Off so great is that John Woo treats the film with respect. The over the top style makes sense because John Woo directs with so much confidence, he makes you suspend your disbelief and become immersed in the story. Action never feels out of place next to the dramatic character moments.Gunfights are really well paced and creative. The opening scene builds perfectly to an awesome plane crash, then carefully slows the action down to a shootout to build the story while remaining entertaining.A truly fantastic film. Smart yet unpretentious, John Woo earns legendary status in cinema to me for this and Hard Boiled.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"In order to catch him, he must become him.","I remember the first time I watched Face/Off, and boy did it blow me away. I have always had a lot respect for John Travolta as an actor, but this movie made me sit up and take notice not only of Travolta, but Nicolas Cage and the director, John Woo. Face/Off is undoubtedly one of Hollywood's greatest action movies ever made.Face/Off  the ultimate game of cat and mouse. To avenge the senseless murder of his son, FBI agent Sean Archer undergoes radical new surgery allowing him to switch faces with the comatose terrorist Castor Troy and assume his identity. But when Castor awakes and assumes Sean's identity, the real Sean is thrust into an unimaginable nightmare, fighting not only for his life but also those of his wife and daughter!Well what do you say about this movie? It is a blast. Action from start to finish. I disagree that the storyline is silly, considering the way the audience is taken on such a great ride with both Castor Troy and Sean Archer. I thought the script was very well written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. Then you have the touches put in by director John Woo. Woo is a fine director, with this being one of his best films. His other movies include Broken Arrow,  Hard Target and Blackjack. He also directed a very disappointing sequel, that being Mission: Impossible II. That film was rather boring for the most part and only started to heat up at the end. Anyway Woo did a brilliant job on Face/Off.The main stars are Hollywood legends. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage take on both roles as Sean Archer/Castor Troy. Both make the most of being two different characters. The way they act in this movie, they make you believe that the two have really traded places. It is difficult to say who was the better of the two in this film, because they both did a great job.Cage has had a great career. Of course winning an Oscar for his terrific role in the film Leaving Los Vegas, in addition to the big hits like The Rock, Con Air, City Of Angels, Gone In Sixty Seconds and The Family Man. These were all great movies. Travolta is probably Hollywood's most well-known actor. A strong member of the church of scientology, he has done some great films as well. These include Grease (who will ever forget that film?), The Look Whose Talking series, the popular Pulp Fiction, which put him back on the movie map, Broken Arrow and his latest hit Swordfish, alongside Hollywood's newest star Hugh Jackman. Travolta has done some bad films, none more bad than the science-fiction movie, Battlefield Earth, which was a real flop.There are some other good cast members in Face/Off. They include Gina Gershon, who plays Castor's partner of sorts, Sasha Hassler. Then you have Joan Allen who plays Sean Archer's wife, Dr Eve Archer. Dominique Swain is good in her role as the rebellious teenage daughter of the Archer's, Jamie. Finally the role of Castor's brother, Pollax Troy, was well performed by Alessandro Nivola. He was great in the movie, Best Laid Plans.There are some powerful scenes in this movie. None more so, than the scene where we see the two arch enemies looking at themselves in the mirror, about to try and shoot each other to death. Then of course you have the surgery scene where we see them actually taking off the character's faces. This scene looks so real, that you would believe the surgery really did take place. The action scenes in Face/Off are all great, with the final boat chase, breathless.It is known that they are starting to perform surgery like what was acted in this movie, for real, which is amazing. I am going to stick my neck out here and say that Face/Off is my favourite film of all-time. Now some people might think that is weird, but this film is terrific. If you like a bit of action, thrown in with a bit of intrigue and suspense then this film is for you. Face/Off is summed up beautifully by Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle who wrote:`In ``Face/Off,'' a principled FBI agent and a psychotic terrorist switch faces. Switching faces means the two actors -- John Travolta and Nicolas Cage -- have to switch roles. But more than switch roles, they switch styles. Travolta adopts Cage's abrupt gestures and crazy laugh; Cage amazingly embodies Travolta's soulfulness'.That is spot on. So if you want to see one great action films of our time, sit back, relax and watch Face/Off.  It's like looking in a mirror. Only... not!Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"""Power With""","Obviously, the key to enjoying the movie is getting past the absurdity it is based on. After you get over it, it's a good action movie to watch for its pretty slow motion scenes and boat chase and so on.However, I do suggest, if you're watching this for your first time, or for the 4892307234th... look out for symbolism and the like. Face/Off may come off as your classic, fake, cliché action flick, but if you take a minute to look deeper into portions of the movie, you'll find symbolisms, commentary, parallelisms, and irony that will knock your socks off; the story is woven thick.Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this movie was the recurring concept of the dominant vs the subordinant (Archer is dominant, Troy is subordinant), conveying the idea that the oppressor can learn just as much from the oppressed as the oppressed is supposed to learn from the oppressor. The idea of Castor and Sean switching places gives the film an incredible angle to get at things like this. But that's just one tiny aspect of everything.

Finally an action movie with BRAINS,"Face/Off is a very interesting film.  There are obviously films with more intelligence, and there are also films with more interesting action sequences.  What makes Face/Off so special is the balance between the two. Face/Off has a few spectacular action scenes (even that much-maligned boat chase is better than anything I've seen a Jerry Bruckheimer movie), which are beautifully choreographed.  It also mixes in a nice touch of emotion and melodrama, and has a few brilliant, Hitchcock-esque moments (the bullet-in-the-mirror scene, for one).

Best American action movie ever,"The reason why I like John Woo's Chinese films(what I've seen, anyway; ""The Killer"", ""Once a Thief"", ""Hard-Boiled"") and dislike most American action films by comparison (or even not by comparison) is they feel like they were made by a human being, while American action films feel like they were ground out by a machine.  Woo films have plots which, while they may be implausible, are worth following, characters to care about, actors who get involved, and oh yes, spellbinding action.  Whereas American action films, except the few good ones, have stupid plots, monoliths as heroes, terrible dialogue, cardboard characters, and just one blowup scene after another.In ""Hard Target"" and ""Broken Arrow"", Woo had moments, but you could sense him being hemmed in by Hollywood.  With ""Face/Off"", he finally gets to cut loose. Sure the story is implausible, but you don't think about it while you're watching it, because you're so caught up in it.  And unlike Hollywood action films, where you don't care about who gets killed because neither do the characters, here you do care.  Woo has said in interviews how much he liked old Hollywood musicals, and he choreographs his films like them.  ""Hard Target"" and Broken Arrow"" didn't feel like that, but this one does.  And in Travolta and Cage, he has actors perfectly suited not only to his action flair, but also the operatic storyline.Travolta was flat as the bad guy in ""Broken Arrow"", but here he gets to bring out his gift for parody, and he's quite enjoyable (and gets the film's best line; ""Lies, mistrust, mixed messages; this is turning into a real marriage"").  He's also good as Archer.  The real story here, though, is Cage.  He's great as the bad guy, but when he's called on to provide the emotional heart of the film, he does it in spades, especially in the scene where he's Archer wearing Castor Troy's face for the first time.  The other actors are all good as well.  I hope American action filmmakers learn from this film and make more movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"could be preposterous... actually, it is, but Woo,Travolta/Cage make it astounding and entertaining","John Woo hit a high-point in his US film career in Face/Off, where he took the method of filming action scenes like mad operas (or the other way around) that he did in a film like Hard Target and put it in the context of an actually strong script. This doesn't mean that the concept that's presented - that a terrorist who knows where a gigantic bomb in LA will detonate, and is now in a coma, and whose face is ripped off and put on the secret agent who was tracking him for years so the agent can find out the bomb's whereabouts and then the terrorist wakes up from the coma and puts on the agent's face - is entirely plausible. Not for a second. The film was originally set in the future, which is easy to see, and in other hands (less capable ones) it could be a stupid sci-fi channel original movie.In John Woo he sees that the character set-ups and relationships are way too strong to ignore, and the line drawn between supposed good and bad can be blurred in the face of such an outrageous/clever premise. He hits new heights in filming his action sequences, from the gun battles (and boy there's a lot) to the big motor-boat chase that happens as the climax, to little but wild things like putting 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' for just a half a minute in a blazing gun battle scene. The action has that thrilling sensation of movement and dazzle that Woo had in his HK flicks; if any film comes closest to the relentless intensity of something like Hard Boiled, it's this one (and you know it's just shamelessly by its maker in that church scene, with the doves and the church and the guns and the Mexican stand-off and so on).I haven't mentioned the stars yet? This is a must to understand the appeal of Face/Off (or, for some, the lack thereof). Nicolas Cage and John Travolta get to have their cake and eat it, play the good but conflicted hero agent Archer (Travolta-cum-Cage) and the overly dastardly villain who just likes to have FUN in big capital letters (Cage-cum-Travolta). While the writing creates some subtext as to deeper levels of interpretation- I'm sure the film could easily be a Jungian thesis project- the actors just enjoy trying (and succeeding) to catch up to Woo's level of high-voltage action and mayhem. Both actors eat up scenery, or sometimes just let the double-level of meaning in the scene take over. When Cage dances in the Priest-frock and sings with the chorus, we know he's going to town, and when Travolta (as that character) smokes a cigarette the first time around his daughter (""Papa's got a brand new bag"") we can feel the gleeful horror in the room.Sure, eventually the characters are put into a matter of just fists-on-fists, which seems to diminish what other variables of outcome these characters could get into. But then again, it's also a not-guilty pleasure of Hollywood popcorn movie-making, smart and effective in drawing out the characters' conflicts and what those around them have to come to realize (or not, as they may be dead sooner rather than later), and, more often than not, it's cheerfully funny in itself. It's like a comic-book concept brought to life and pumped with Woo-stylized bullets and octane - or, in another way, it's like what Michael Bay films try so hard to be and fall flat on their faces in chaos.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Utter class, a scorching masterpiece","Nicolas Cage Week: Day 6There's action movies, and there's action movies... and then there's Face/Off. For me it's the snowy peak of hyper real, larger than life spectacles of sound, fury and music, composed by none other than Chinese maestro John Woo, whose first few films with Chow Yun Fat (The Killer, Hard Boiled and A Better Tomorrow are classics and textbooks for anyone looking to step into the genre) were a major success both back home and overseas, before making his first venture into American cinema with this solid gold masterpiece. From beginning to end it fires on all cylinders, never missing a beat or churning out an awkward moment, just a continuous ballet of bullets, largely drawn characters and set pieces all revolving together in perfect synergy, so that the two and a half hour running time feels slight. John Travolta and Nic Cage are simmering in the lead roles, each getting to showcase their rugged, hangdog hero elements as well as the playful boiling points of their violent, psychotic sides as well. They also get to parody each other splendidly, and let's be honest, who better than these two infinitely eccentric titans of twitchy, idiosyncratic work? Travolta plays gruff, world weary FBI Agent Sean Archer, on a relentless, revenge fuelled warpath against heinous, evil terrorist Castor Troy (Cage). When a kamikaze raid on his forces at an airport (the opening sequence will have your heart bouncing) leads to his capture and unfortunate coma, Archer races to find a solution before a bomb hidden somewhere in the LA area goes off. He is introduced to a hilarious, cutting edge medical science program in which faces can be transplanted onto other bodies, effectively transforming someone into... Nicolas Cage. He goes for it, and is implanted into the severely maximum security prison where Castor's creepy brother (Alessandro Nivola) is held, attempting to learn the whereabouts of aforementioned explosive device. Troy wakes from his slumber though, and forces the medical team to put Archer's face on him, and viola, suddenly Cage is Travolta and Travolta is Cage. They launch an all out war of insane proportions on each other, dragging each of their families and associates into one of the most jaw dropping, satisfying series of set pieces and battles I've ever seen in a film. The climactic shoot out in the church, the chaotic prison break and iconic stunt jump into the ocean, the boat chase that makes The Fast And The Furious look like a hotwheels commercial, the opening airport explosion, the incendiary raid on Troy's dockside safe house; all absolute stunners that will rock any sound system and inject the genre with a giddy love of mayhem for years to come. Cage and Travolta are at times so over the top we feel like they wandered in from a David Lynch film, but therein lies the fun of both their work: they're two mustangs cutting loose, trying to one up each other in both the deranged and the emotional departments, and their efforts carry the movie along on a thunderous, dizzying high of histrionics both introverted and screamingly extroverted. The supporting cast is dotted with old familiar faces too. Standouts include Joan Allen as poor Archer's confused, vulnerable wife, sexy Gina Gershon as Troy's tough old flame Sasha and Nick Cassavetes steals the show as his associate and partner in scumbuggery Dietrich (""Hey man, we had some laughs""), but there's also awesome work from Colm Feore, Robert Wisdom, Margaret Cho, Harve Presnell, CCH Pounder, John Carroll Lynch, Dominique Swain, Thomas Jane and Tommy Flanagan too. John Powell's raging, operatic score resonates uncannily with the events unfolding on screen with grace and fluidity of an expert making magic, as does Woo's flawless direction, and the talents of every person involved. It's in a word, epic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Characters wonder aloud at how insane the plot is... and yet it all works,"Master Hong Kong action director John Woo hits Hollywood in 1997 and delivers in every way possible. The script is so ridiculous but the execution is so close to being perfect that I wouldn't change anything about it. Cage and Travolta are peak here. They fully flesh out these characters beyond what most scriptwriters could probably dream of. Some of the Cagiest Cage to ever Cage. Travolta is so much fun and he looks like he's always having fun too. Joan Allen is also brilliant and brings a lot of heart to the story. And what a story it is. Tons of setup, foreshadowing, payoff, humor, layers, nuances and little details that give the experience so much personality. Chiclets in with the drug stash... why not?All that is just the icing on the cake that is this monstrous action extravaganza. Wonderful physical stuntwork. Shootouts are visceral and electrifying. Eye-popping real explosions and real speed felt in the chase sequences. Ridiculous fireworks going off everywhere. Camerawork is world class. Editing I will say is almost perfect, particularly in the overall structure of the film, but there's a couple of hiccups in maybe one action scene. And that scene is not the final boat chase which is in my opinion one of the best chase scenes ever put to film :)""Can someone please tell me what planet I'm on?"" a character laments near the end of the film.

Butchered Handel and facial tissue,"Early on the villain utters the line, ""You even make that HACK composer Handel sound good.""Well OF COURSE Handel will seem like a hack, if you judge him by this edited-to-within-an-inch-of-its-life version of the Hallelujah chorus plucked from some thirty-second Mitsubishi ad.  What is this - the Good Bits Messiah for Cretins?  But then, all of ""Face/Off"" is similarly mangled and over-edited.The basic conceit is silly, not that it's the silliness I object to - Sean Archer (played by John Travolta and Nicholas Cage) swaps faces with Castor Troy (played by Nicholas Cage and John Travolta).  I mean, literally. Archer and Troy don't just disguise themselves as one another; they literally SWAP FACES.  Imagine a film predating heart transplants, in which the hero and villain (again, literally) swap hearts.  Is that gross, or what?  Well, this is grosser.  I wouldn't have minded in the least if the face-swapping had been non-literal, and accomplished by supernatural means, but it isn't: we actually SEE the gruesome medical procedure, and thereafter it's hard to look at either actor's face without shuddering.Ugh.I find it hard to believe that Woo believed in what he was doing in this film - while the almost-as-silly ""Mission: Impossible 2"" had visual poetry, ""Face/Off"" just has visual gimmickry, and, I swear, twice as many edits. (Should I see Woo's earlier, Hong Kong work?  No doubt I should.  I'm ashamed to admit I haven't.)  -But bear in mind that, although I'm usually a fairly charitable viewer, I sat through most of ""Face/Off"" in a sour mood.

Best Film I ever saw in my life,You people should this films like Face/Off because it's a greatest action film that I ever saw in my life. John Woo's direction was great because the way he handled the film's action sequence like featuring slow motion in several scenes and mexican standoff at the climax.The story and its screenplay was great like the sworn enemity between the Characters of John Travolta and Nicholas Cage and also their face changingIt was a great Film and I loved it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"John and Nic from USA, John from HK ..... ACTION FROM HELL !","Castor Troy and Sean Archer. The ultimate enemies. Face/Off is about relationship between those two men. That´s a VERY rare thing to see in an action movie. It doesnt concentrate on the action itself, it's more about Castor and Sean. John Woo, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. These three people bring you the best action movie of 1997 (well....actually Face/Off, The Rock and The Matrix are the best action movies of all times...in my opinion, that is). While John Travolta makes Sean (who really is Castor...are you lost ? well....you have to see it, to understand it) really evil, Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performance in his career. Face/Off features the ultimately best ACTING in an action movie. That's not all.....where is the action  ??? ......well...the answer is ...EVERYWHERE. John Woo manages to surpass Michael Bay´s masterpiece The Rock with his TERRIFIC action sequences. If you had a chance to see John´s previous movies (Hard Boiled, The Killer, A better tomorrow 1, 2 or his US debut Hard target) you know what I mean.

Titanic!  So what?,"""Face/Off"" is easily my favorite action movie of all time.  It has all of the elements necessary for a good movie- 1.) A good (not all believable) plot, 2.) Convincing acting, 3.) John Travolta and Nicholas Cage doing some of their best work, and 4.) John Woo directing it.  If you add all four of those things together, you will get a hit movie.  I knew that my friends would like the movie, but I was amazed at how much the critics enjoyed it as well.This movie should be seen for the action and comedy.  I would not recommend that little kids see this due to some images at the start of the movie. (those that have seen it know what I am talking about)Travolta and Cage were great together.  They complimented each others acting abilities very well.  Joan Allen and Dominique Swain were also very good in there respected roles.I have seen this movie at least 40 times.  Seriously 40 times.  I still do not get board watching it.  It was 10 times more enjoyable than ""Titanic"", which won for best picture of 1997 at the Academy Awards.  At least ""Face/Off"" was nominated for the MTV Movie Awards for best picture.  It's an honor just being nominated.  I personally feel that it should have won, but the nomination was nice.If you are an action fan, you probably will like this movie.  If you are a drama fan, you probably will like parts of this movie.  If you have a pulse, you probably will like this movie. That is my personal opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
An exciting action/sci-fi thriller!,"This is an exciting action thriller starring John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, where an FBI agent undergoes a face-transplant and takes on the the identity and physical appearance of a ruthless terrorist to foul an extortion scheme. But, the terrorist does the same thing and takes on the identity of the agent. What follows is a suspense-filled ride as people are perplexed at the sudden personality change change of the two men.The director did a great job in keeping the tension of the action and the unfolding drama built up, grabbing the audience's attention, and keeping the plot lines flow naturally. Travolta and Cage each gave an incredible performance essentially playing two characters each, and the subplot about avenging the agent's young son's death adds onto the intense drama of the movie. Travolta, though, went overboard with his anger and being overly emotions a number of times, which I thought made his character less likable at times.Overall, it's one of the better action movies I've seen and one of the few with a touching subplot.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Perfect mix,"John Woo has always been one of my favorite action directors. And this is somewhat of his crowning achievement. The perfect mix between Hollywood and Hong Kong you might say.The terrorist and criminal Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) has placed a dirty bomb somewhere. Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has been chasing Troy for a long time and now he is close to catching him. But things go out of control and Troy falls into a coma. Now the only person who knows the location of the bomb is Troys brother Pollux. Now Archer has to go undercover looking like Troy to get his brother to reveal the location of the bomb.This movie has a story that stretches reality quite a bit. But in the end that doesn't really matter. Because this might be the ultimate action movie. Why? Simply because John Woo here manages to mix his Hong Kong-brand of action sequences with the plot and acting of Hollywood. Both Travolta and Cage are majestic as the two enemies. And this is bullet ballet as it's best. Woo uses every trick in the book. Slow-motion, dual pistols and a pace that never lets you up for air.Unlike Woo's Hong Kong outings (most notably The Killer and Hard-boiled) this movie has a story that holds together though, and the actors to pull it off. The disturbing elements of confusing plot turns that are almost always present in Hong Kong are also gone. Allt this combines in making this one of my top-three action movies of all time.I rate this 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

The most fun watching an action movie you'll have!,"At its worst, action is crammed in just to showcase some special effects and extensive car chases. But at its best, we have a crazy wild ride to invest ourselves in! This is the latter case.The opening is the darkest part of the movie. We have a happy father going on the carnival with his son, and suddenly his boy is shot... Castor Troy, the killer, unfortunately gets away. Until one day, when Sean Archer finally catches him! But there is one problem left: Troy planted a bomb which will destroy Los Angeles and Archer is the only one who can stop it! The best way to do it though? Going undercover as Troy by undergoing a surgery where Archer's face is cut off and replaced by Troy. And even getting a voice box so he can talk like him. However, more trouble stirs up when the real Castor wakes up and forces the doctor to give him Archer's face as well. And what we have are two faces with the wrong personalities...The plot sounds ludicrous, doesn't it? But that's also part of the charm! It's so impossibly complicated, yet the movie manages to make it work. And it's all thanks to the hilarious dialogue throughout, which is a mix of delicate wit, flat-out bizarreness and dark humor. In fact, this movie has so many laughs that it's a mystery why it's never listed as a comedy. John Travolta gets to go completely nuts with this movie as he for one of the few times in his career plays a villain. Equally, maybe even more, great is Nicolas Cage as his counterpart. He has shown that he can both be a great, great actor and someone who is just very entertaining to watch. Here, he is both! He is WAY over-the-top, and still you completely buy it. He hands out one of the greatest performances of his life.There are a few other side characters I really like too, such as Pollux Troy, Jamie Archer and Dietrich, who by the way has one of the best lines in the movie (""Hey Sean, how's your dead son?""). Almost every single character is exaggerated and sometimes you are not sure if the movie is self-aware or takes itself very seriously. Either way, it's a wonderful movie!The one weak aspect I guess would be that the ending is not very good, as it's very cheesy and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. Thankfully, there's an alternate ending, which I thought was far better. So I guess the movie is as awesome as it could be after all!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

John Woo is the King of Action!!!!!!!,"John Woo is the best actiondirector in the world. Face/Off(has nothing to do with the sport called ice-hockey)is his third American film after he arrived from Hong-Kong. John Travolta plays Sean Archer, who is a FBI-agent.  Nicolas Cage plays Castor Troy, a psychotic terrorist. While the opening credits are still running, Archers son is killed at a theme park.  The murderer is Troy, and this is how Archers obsession of killing Troy starts. 6 years later, Archer and his FBI buddies traps Troy at an airport.  Troy reveals that he has hidden a bomb somewhere in L.A., just before Archer blows him away with a jet engine, and Troy falls into a coma. Troy`s brother is the only one who knows where the bomb is hidden, so Archer must take on Troy`s face and body, in order to know where the bomb is. While Archer is undercover in prison, Troy wakes from his coma, takes on Archers face and VOILA`!  The two characters have know changed identity.The fact that John Woo is on board as director is visible in every shot. The action scenes are gorgeous to look at, but not as violent as some people believe.  Face/Off is indeed a very violent film, but it is kindergarten when compared to John Woo`s Hong-Kong movies like Hard Boiled and The Killer.

The special effects for the surgery were very realistic, considering the fact that the surgery is impossible as described.

Apparently at least one can, but it sure takes a whole lot of effort.I never laughed so hard at the movies. I literally fell out of my seat laughing at this film. Boy, was the floor dirty. The unintentional humor of this movie is the only redeeming quality. Cage and Travolta are the two worst actors out there, so it was enjoyable to watch them out-unact each other.

"The best ""summer movie"" of 97","Face/Off does a great job at utilizing the possibilities of thier premise.If this premise were in lesser hands it would simply have been a race against time movie. They would've had the bad guy(looking like the good guy)hiding the danger (the bomb he installed)he created. Then the good guy (looking like the bad guy)would've been faced with having to defuse the danger while being thought to be the bad guy.Fortunataly, John Woo and company decide to go further with the concept. The villian sees the value in dismantling his own bomb and the power he could really have. The good guy hangs out with the buddies of the villian and develops empathy for them. The villian enjoys the family life of the good guy he's imitating.Of course, there are some remarkable action sequences that work well (although the final one on the boat is a little overkill). John Woo has a balletic, rythmic style and visual style for these scenes and they are terrific.John Travolta and Nick Cage have fun with thier duel roles and we have fun watching them.Great cinematography, especially in the funeral scenes. The cinematography is augmented by great use of sound and music.The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is put to rip roaring use, it takes your breath away.The common objection to this movie is lack of realism and they do have a point.

The terrorist is knocked into a coma during a chase.  The FBI know the terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere, but can't get this info out of the terroists' captured associates.  So, Travolta has to have Cage's face grafted on, take on Cage's characterisitics, and try to stop this attack.

Action at Another Level,"John Woo normally avoids profoundity and exercising the brain with his films. Yet with ""Face/Off"" I found his best film and his most deep and intelligent one! Seems that identity crisis is a must, where Cage and Travolta (classic good and evil clash) switch their faces in a constant hunt between them, one to avenge his early son's death and the other to suppress his chaser, to profit on his schemes without being followed.Both Cage and Travolta are surprising, although both of them play great the part of being Castor Troy. But wait, are u asking me exteriorly or interiorly? Isn't Cage Travolta and the other way? Well, Face/Off requires your patience and holding to the movie's plot. Miss a second, miss the movie. Besides having a fantastic, well thought script, John Woo misses not his straight roots and delivers great shooting scenes, gripping chase scenes and delivers a sense of tension and impotence for wanting to tell everyone in the movie the truth and how real things go.The scene where both of them are only separated from a mirror is paradoxical, yet enormously symbolic and perfect for the movie. Watch it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
A clever trade-off of action and emotion that still feels relevant,"Sean Archer (John Travolta), a senior FBI agent, has been tracking Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) for years. Besides wanting to take him down for his terrorist crimes, Archer also has revenge in mind, as Troy accidentally murdered Archer's son years earlier in a botched assassination attempt. But shortly after finally capturing him in a comatose, he learns of a bomb that has been planted within Los Angeles, and only Troy knows where it is. So, with the aid of brilliant science, Archer trades faces with Troy, and goes undercover in prison to try and find out how to stop the bomb from Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). But things take a turn for the worst when Troy shows up with Archer's face.Yes, this synopsis may sound a bit convoluted and murky, but the film makes it work at almost every hairpin turn. In fact, that is half the fun of the film. I watched this film when I was a kid, and loved it. And nothing has changed in ten years. Through every suspense filled moment, the film packs on one hell of a wallop, both through its clever trade-off of action and emotion. Yes, it has its moments where things happen that clearly never can, but the rest of this dead serious romp is very much based heavily in the real (and the predicted real). Indeed some of the thrilling stunts are right in tune with the usual crap spoon fed by Michael Bay (who actually directed Cage in his best work to date, The Rock, just before this film), but the majority of the actions that these characters do are based quite blatantly in the real world.The stunts and action set pieces are all brilliantly constructed from head to toe, and never once does anything look fake. It has all the trimmings of a John Woo film, from the pigeons to the double handed gun fights to the grand explosions to even the elevated use of slow motion, and never once does it take itself for granted. Right from the scene in the chase/shootout scene in the airport hanger that begins right after the credits conclude, you know you are in the hands of a master action storyteller. Woo takes great pride in how he envisions and creates his sequences, and every single scene action-packed or not, has that aura about it. Unlike the aforementioned Bay or even The Wachowskis, every detail looks perfectly thought out and even more perfectly directed. It is hard to spot blemishes in everything that is going on, and even harder to pick out the fabricated from the realistic (considering how little an amount of CGI is actually used in the film).But the real drive of the film is in the acting, and it is fairly well done across the board. Both Travolta and Cage are clearly above the material, but they do a wonderful job conveying most of the absolutely devastating emotions shown throughout the film. Both play off of each other well, and both do an even better job aping the other's performance. While I did really enjoy Cage here (more so as the good guy), it is Travolta who gives the better performance. He just brings such an evil zest to the Troy role that we never really get to see as an audience. Yeah, he was over-the-top in Broken Arrow, fabulously poignant in Pulp Fiction, and at one of his all-time highs in Swordfish, but his deliciously evil turn here is what really shows off his talent and range. The otherwise all around good guy playing someone who is the quintessentially evil bad-ass. His every delivery just has that solid, methodical brilliance to it, and seeing it again was a real treat.Supporting turns from Joan Allen as Archer's wife, Dominique Swain as Archer's daughter, Gina Gershon as Troy's moll and Nivola are all particularly well acted. Yes, they are overshadowed by the two main characters, but they put in some fine performances all on their own.What kills the movie a little are some of the blatant plot-holes, inconsistencies and some really goofy dialogue (that stupid hand thing still bothers me too). I understand some of the movie should be tongue-in-cheek, but some of the scenes just got a little out of control. Just the sheer idea of swapping faces is a frightening idea all in itself. But then why does no one quite grasp the changes that these characters are clearly going through? Why do we not even know more than just a slight backstory on neither Archer nor Troy? Questions like these bothered me ever since I first saw the film so many years ago, and they only continue to echo. I understand the whole movie hinges on the idea of revenge for Archer's son's murder and everyone not knowing the truth except Archer and Troy, but some of their actions are just far too bizarre for someone to not notice. This may be a problem having changed the script so vastly from its original science-fiction form, but it just never quite jives as easy as it should.I must admit, even though it is quite obviously an action film, Face/Off will always so much more than that. The undertones that run throughout the film are so heavily dramatic, that if you take away the action scenes, you still could have a taut and calculating character drama. The painstaking work done by Woo and his crew to make this film so much more original than it could have been is crystal clear throughout the film. Its sheer predictions of a dystopic face swapping ability is enough to make the film valid and not dated in the current year, but at the same time, shows just how imaginative movies used to be. Problems or not, I can only hope that Face/Off continues to stand the test of time.8/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

You also have fascinating performances from the two leads.Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are awesome in this. I won't spoil the plot, but all I will say is that those two bring it to life brilliantly - it felt, at least to me, very believable; which is impressive. Across the opening portion I thought it was going to be Cage stealing the show, but as things progress Travolta really comes up big to match Cage.Away from NC and JT, there isn't really anything to scream about cast-wise; although, I gotta give shoutouts to Mike Delfino and Gavin Harris; if you know, you know.Nothing much more to note, to be honest.

I've never experienced anything like this before,"I first saw this film when I was 15 when it first came out on DVD and I watched it at a friend's house. It was an experience I will never forget! First of all John Travolta is absolutely brilliant as Castor Troy, when he is Castor Troy. I always like it when he plays a bad guy for he always has that factor which makes the character extremely likable. Some scenes are pretty intense but I won't spoil them for you but I do warn you this film is not for the faint-hearted in some scenes. Pollux in the film is incredibly disturbing as Castor's close brother, who is mentally unstable. The film's climax is the adrenaline junkie's dream in film as an incredibly quick boat chase. It is even quite surprising how exciting it is.This film was incredible and completely exceeded expectations.

Truly risible,"This takes a notion that has been used in movies before - that it is possible for someone someone to take on the form of another through various forms of mutilation (e.g. Silence of the Lambs or LA Confidential), but elevates it to the central premise.The CIA, their wonders to behold, have developed a level of technology capable of transforming John Travolta into the perfect image of Nicholas Cage. This may seem just a tad far-fetched to those of us who recall that the same organisation thought that the best way of deposing Castro was to offer him an exploding cigar (perhaps they were getting Karl Marx muddled up with Groucho).Anyway, with this huge hole in the middle of the plot this turkey could never hope to get off the ground.If you believe that it really was Santa who bought you that pair of funky snowman socks for Xmas, that aliens supplied the blueprints to Rameses I or that Jim Carey is a comic genius - you'll love this one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Travolta and Cage shine together,John Travolta plays an FBI agent called Sean Archer.He has been chasing a terrorist called Castor Troy for several years.Castor is responsible for the death of his son and Sean wants to have his revenge.Archer finds out there's a bomb somewhere in LA.To find out where the bomb is Archer has to borrow Troy's face and go to jail as Castor Troy.Meanwhile Troy wakes up from coma wondering what has happened to his face.And Castor has to go with Sean's face.This makes Sean's wife Eve (Joan Allen) and his daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain) wondering how Sean has changed so much. I know the plot sounds ridiculous and believe me; it is.But don't mind that.Just enjoy the movie with lots of unbelievable action scenes.John Woo is a great Hong Kong director and Face/Off from 1997 is an amazing American feature from the master. Woo likes to use doves flying around in action scenes and slow motion scenes are also his trade mark.There are some breath taking scenes in this movie where the characters shoot in slow motion with powerful music hearing.John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are fine actors and together they are amazing.I recommend Face/Off for every action freak out there.,,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"John Woo brings his gun fu and heroic bloodshed to Hollywood, with a perfect action film starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage in memorable roles","Face/Off is a film full of high octane action directed by the maestro John Woo, doing what he's best at, the genres gun fu and heroic bloodshed in the action genre which he pioneered. There are stylized action sequences and dramatic themes such as duty, honor, redemption and violence. The film is also a great thriller film, with the more quiet and character driven scenes contributing to the film and its themes, especially of redemption and loss. Oliver Wood is also to thank for the look of the film, whilst John Woo is hugely thank for it with the aesthetics and perfect mise-en-scene, Wood's cinematography is excellent. The screenplay was written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, truly excellent writing. Since its release, the film gained a strong cult following and it is considered by many as one of John Woo's best films.To foil a terrorist plot, FBI agent Sean Archer assumes the identity of the criminal Castor Troy who murdered his son through facial transplant surgery, but the crook wakes up prematurely and vows revenge.There are a bunch of action sequences that stand out, especially the speedboat chase scene which the film won an MTV award for, along with an award for best On-Screen Duo for Travolta and Cage. I think the prison escape is brilliantly executed, from direction and acting to the editing, but I think the writing could have been better and more build up as it felt too easy. The penthouse shootout is also top notch action, among the best. The same climax action sequence which begins in a church and continues with a speedboat chase. John Woo uses slow motion correctly and sparsely, making the action scenes more epic and entertaining. Face/Off won Saturn Awards for Best Director and Best Writing, it was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing. The sound design in the film is really great, with each punch and gunshot felt by us in the audience, like how it's supposed to be.What's interesting with Face/Off, other than what an incredible action film it is, it's the script and the vision John Woo had for it. The emotional impact at the end shows how these people succeeded in creating a film with characters you care for, how the theme of loss was handled, truly perfect storytelling. Nicolas Cage and John Travolta were truly incredible in this film, in certain ways it contained some over-acting but it fits the character of Castor Troy (the terrorist and criminal) perfectly. Sean Archer was the FBI agent and what is the main character, it was interesting seeing Nicholas Cage play that part as well with an edge of craziness to it. Equipping the face of the man who killed your son and injured oneself, it would probably make anyone kind of psychologically on the edge. Some words by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film three out of four, ""Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the 'other' character is 'really' playing it."" Face/Off might be among the best action films I've seen, with its stylized and violent sequences which makes you want more. The good thing is there is more where this came from, John Woo is one of the greatest action directors, and this might even be his best film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

One of the best movies of its kind,"I'm not a big fan of action thrillers but I've got to hand it out to this one. The plot is not really original; in many fantasy movies the villain appears in the form of the good guy and wreaks havoc -- but this is an action movie, nothing supernatural, it's all done by a surgical operation, and this is what makes this movie original: it's an action movie that moves on the grounds of what was fantasy up to now.Moreover the performances of the two stars are stunning. Both actors can assume both the twisted persona that is Troy and the conscious cop that is Archer -- and they're both eerily convincing. Of course, this is what you would except from two excellent actors such as Travolta and Cage, but this film gives you the opportunity to see how two entirely different characters can be played by the same person in the same movie.On the downside, I found that the final showdown was a bit too lengthy for my taste.

Escapist entertainment at its purist.,"Out of all the movie genres available today, none please me more when pulled off correctly than the too often lame and castrated action movie. Face/Off, a feature that knows action and pulls it off eloquently, does more to get the adrenaline pumping than most of the genre's more standard fare, and while it certainly doesn't do much if anything- remarkably new, there's enough done extremely well to satisfy anyone's thirst for stylised, balls-to-the-wall action. It also represents peaks in both lead stars careers, which both have arguably failed to revisit upon subsequent tours of the genre; sure it's not Shakespeare and it's not Oscar nominee material, but that's all part of Woo's otherworldly charm here. Face/Off is more science-fiction than drama, but with a healthy dose of intellectually informed subtext and some brilliant character dynamics, the movie manages to grip from beginning to end, providing a healthy dose of escapist entertainment at its purist.Telling the undeniably hammy story of Sean Archer and Caster Troy two arch nemesis types on the opposite ends of the law- where both end up swapping faces and in turn identities, Face/Off at base level is certainly cut from the same cloth as The Wizard of Oz in terms of its fantastic nature, but that doesn't mean that it loses its value as entertainment; rather, it reinforces it. Of course this is a story that seems perfect for your average sixties Star Trek episode, but again, that is all part of the charm. Not only is the premise an interesting one in itself, but Woo and his writers capitalise fully on the setup consistently, playing out the dynamics of the two characters' convoluted predicament with some juicy focus on character and the dualism of good and evil. It's the kind of movie that has to be taken further through the mind than face value, because, while Woo does well to give his movie a nice, comfortable balance between fantasy and reality, it's the ideas and nuances of this shift in character and themes that gives the movie its edge.To say that Face/Off exists as a fine testament to both Travolta and Cage's skills as actors would be something of an understatement. To be sure, both play as Woo's puppets in his exaggerated, over the top world where people accentuate their shadings of black or white, but they do it so well that the caricature style becomes one with the movie itself. Furthermore, the dynamics that are involved here, from switching between personalities and in effect playing each other, the actors are given work here that extents far beyond the asking price of your average action thriller. As a duo, the two work well together as well as on their own; from the snarly façade of Castor Troy to the tormented psyche of Sean Archer, both actors embody both personalities as best as they can and often give life to moments that would easy to be glossed over if not played through Woo's absurdly glamorized and in turn engrossing style.But let's not fall under any pretence here; Face/Off is first and foremost, an action movie. Yes, there are some great characters, touching drama and intellectually rewarding themes on dualism and metaphysical questions on personality and psychology, but all of this is given the bench to what Woo has arguably always been best at. This direct focus on huge, ridiculously potent action full to the brim with explosions, gunfire, violence and people flying through the air, forms what is quite possibly all that is best about the Hollywood action movie. With a distinct lack of shaky-cam syndrome and a larger desire to show how grand his images are, Woo delivers a visual and aural spectacle which is best to be taken on pure entertainment terms. One can easily point holes in nearly every aspect of the movie's plot, character and action, but it's hard to be so cynical when you're given masterfully executed shots that put so many other so-called action movies to shame.When it comes to speaking for the action genre, one can't remain positive without thinking of how bloated and derivative it has become over the recent years. Yet looking back almost decade and watching Face/Off, it's somewhat uplifting to see that many years after its inception, there's still people out there capable of delivering the no-frills, no-nonsense excitement that made the genre such a formidable audience pleaser in the first place. Yes, this is by no means a cinematic classic, but its one of those movies that will likely be kept alongside such movies as Die Hard and Con Air, ready to be watched time and time again just for the sheer fun of it. Cinema, as much as it would like to deceive us, rarely does manage to deliver the true essence of fun; Face/Off is an excellent reminder that such movies don't always have to end up being mundane and formulaic.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

One of the best action films ever!!!,"Basically, this is a Hollywood version of a hong kong action film. John Woo is a great action film director and he made the classic Hard Boiled with Chow Yun Fatt. With this film, there are all the stylized gun fights that characterizes a John Woo film. Its just amazing. Its like John Travolta said, the way John Woo makes his film, is like a dance. Its not a Die Hard nor is it a Matrix. But i feel it has the best of both. The story is pretty far fetched. Sean Archer played by Travolta, is the cop out for revenge against Castor Troy played by Cage who tried to assassinate him but ended up killing his son instead. Troy is captured after an amazing gun battle. They end up swapping faces and lives. Some of the parts are hard to believe but in the end, its a movie and its not meant to be taken so seriously.You can expect at least 40 minutes of just pure action scenes. Explosions, gun battles and the likes. One thing i admire about this film is that the action scenes are raw and hardcore yet at the same time smooth and stylish. They took the best from the east and the west put them together. Its like a predecessor to the matrix but without the bullet time. When you actually see how they shoot their guns, their movements, the jumping out shots, its just amazing. There isn't a minute that bores you. The characters are interesting as well. Castor Troy is a flamboyant and ruthless character. Abit like the joker from batman. He's likable as a villain but detestable as well. Sean Archer you can relate to him. He's lost his son and his relationship with his family is deteriorating but he wants to put an end to all this and you're just rooting for him.Thats the thing about action films. Its not just about the action. You need a good story and good characters. This movie has both and damn good action. That's why i gave it a 9. Just go along for the ride. Pretty ridiculous story but a good one nonetheless.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Slo-Mo Madness,"When Face/Off hit the cinema back in 1997 the concept seemed absurd, fast forward 27 years and with today's advances in medical science and plastic surgery it's almost believable.It's an 80's action flick made in the 90's with two Hollywood stars literally out doing one another in every scene. Did John Woo make a better film in America than this? With a few tweaks to the story this probably should've been Mission:Impossible 2 which he went on to direct most like off the success of this.I can't think of two better actors for these roles, it's hard to imagine that it was originally planned as a Stallone/Schwarzenegger project if that rumour is indeed true.Fast forward to 2024 and there's plans for a sequel... as good as I think Face/Off is, I think bringing Travolta and Cage back now in their 60's would be a huge mistake.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
One of the most over-the-top films ever made (and great fun too),"'Face/Off' is a kind of simple film for simple people (and I'm including myself in that demographic). Take one bad guy (Nicholas Cage – cranked up to 11) and then, through a series of bizarre and totally implausible events, he finds himself with his face – literally – swapped with the good guy/cop (John Travolta –also doing his best to crank his performance up to 11) who's out to catch him. Now, no one believes which one is which and the two of them start trying to take over each other's lives (while trying to murder each other, obviously).If that brief plot summary hasn't made you ask more than a few questions regarding the hows and whys of it all, then you really are an expert at suspending your disbelief. Most people would already be picking holes in the story. So, if you're looking for a watertight plot with no holes in it, you probably should really skip this one.Luckily, Face/Off his just so much fun that you'll find it easy to gloss over the general absurdities of it all, sit back, break open the popcorn and just roll with it. It is one of the most obviously over-the-top films ever made and, if the plot wasn't over-the-top enough, then the two leads – Cage and Travolta – spend the film constantly trying to outdo each other as to how extreme they can make their performances. So, take the over-the-top film, add the completely over-the-top performances then, just to finish it off, add the completely unrealistic gunfights and those weird 'Hollywood-type' explosions where fireworks seem to shoot out of the flames.What you effectively have here is a B-movie with a decent cast and budget. It carries the film through and will always elevate it over the general mediocre action flicks that go straight to DVD. Basically, it's a classic – not in the same way as the 'Godfather' or 'Empire Strikes Back,' but it is a classic for what it is – and what it is is big, dumb, stupid fun. So, if you can appreciate that sort of film, you should definitely get something out of this.Best bit: Nicholas Cage dressed as a priest 'headbanging' in a chorus. I will remember that until the day I die.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

It really is a first class action film from the legend that is John Woo, and I recommend it to everybody (who's 18+ of course, lol).

"""No more drugs for that man!""","Aside from giving that classic quote to our vocabulary, this remains John Woo's best American film.

As the FBI man slides into drug-addled depravity and the life of a hunted man, the terrorist learns what it's like to be a family man who has to help his new ""wife"" bear the tragedies that were created by his own hand. Yes, the ending is over the top with heavy borrowing from other boat- chase flicks (""Live and Let Die,"" ""Patriot Games"") but by the time this movie gets to its slam-bang finish, it's all anticlimax.

Woo's First American Triumph,"Throughout the 80's John Woo along with others like Sam Raimi and Tery Gilliam was the cult fans favourite and known to them as the best action movie maker in the world.  It took the rest of the film world a while though to notice, maybe the hand-over of Hong Kong to Communist China (openly loathed by Woo) forced him to make his way to Hollywood before the studios were really willing to have him.  The result of this the disappointing Hard Target and unrecognisable Broken Arrow but somehow Woo was given another chance and took it with great relish.Face/Off is Woo at his over the top, furiously paced finest, the story might be highly implausable and its hadling hysterical but it serves to give the film the playground that both Woo and his actors thrive in.  The action scenes are tremendous, staged as only Woo really can and strangely for this usually vacuous genre there is a strange kind of social commentary about the importance of family and marriage that has been overlooked by many.  Up there definitely as one of the best action/adventure films ever 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Travolta + Cage + Woo = Dynamite action drama,"FACE/OFF (1997)  ****  John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Harve Presnell, Dominique Swain, Nick Cassavetes, CCH Pounder, Margaret Cho.  Excellent breakneck actioner/psychological thriller with obsessed FBI agent Travolta out to infiltrate looney tune killing master criminal Cage's operation of setting off a bomb in LA by state-of-the-art surgery grafting Cage's face onto Travolta (and then vice versea as the plot thickens).  Sounds dumb but with a crackling screenplay by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, the film takes hold with some unexpected humor (and for that matter humanity), deft action sequences and acting tour-de-forces from its leads (both getting to be Good and Evil); think of it as `Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde' meets James Bond with a touch of Greek tragedy.  High octane violence underscored masterfully by auteur impresario John Woo who choreographs the coolest gunfights with a balletic, operatic grace and the elan of Travolta and Cage results in one helluva film.

Everyone gave him a bad rap after this, saying he was the bad guy, when in reality, he was only so for ten minutes or so. And I must admit, the Travolta wasn't too bad.

You'll Enjoy Taking His Face...Off...,I haven't seen this one in far too long and it's still pretty much a classic. Sure there's some questionable plot elements and pretty horrendous cover ups when it comes to making it not obvious during the action sequences that it's clearly not John Travolta and Nic Cage but rather their stunt doubles. What it does well though is a combination of great acting from both Travolta and Cage in tandem with an engaging and interesting story and very cool action scenes complete with director John Woo staples such as slow motion bullet time and doves galore. I also found Travolta really transcending his acting skills to range himself to act like Nic Cage so much fo an extent where you almost believe it really was Noc Cage behind of Travolta's dimpled chin face.

* * * * OUT OF FIVE,John Travolta stars as Sean Archer an FBI Agent who goes undercover by literly borrowing the face of his arch-nemesis' Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) however things take a turn for the worst when Castor Troy takes Archer's face and assumes his identity in this top notch and superb actioner which benefits from John Woo's camera angles that underline the action rather then over powering it. Excellent action through out make this one of the best actioners of the 90's.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

"A Unique, Original, Classy and Stylish Gem","This film kicks ass! It's definitely the most original and unique films that have come around in a long, long, time. However, there are some things I didn't like about the film... ... For example: the genesis of the plot for one. There were only a handful of cops who urge Travolta to undergo a face-lift with Cage in the first place, and in case something goes terribly wrong, they decide that they're the only ones qualified to know about the operation. Exactly, where they going to get clearance for that kind of a bold move? Realistically, it would involve a lot of red-tape to do something like that, and would leave more than a handful of people who know about it, if the government would even go for it. So of course, when Cage wakes up with his face torn off, he kills the surgeon, the rest of those who know about it, leaving him without any proof of his real identity. It's highly doubtful that someone who's been knocked into a coma, sedated in order to be put through a face-lift, is suddenly going to snap out of it, all of the sudden.However, Travolta and Cage's performances make up for this entirely. The rest of the story seems to work out fine, and is a high octane ride the rest of the way. The only other thing I can nitpick about, is Travolta's conduct as a cop, and the fact that during this time no one becomes suspicious - not noticing any behavior changes or something of the sort, until his own wife works up the nerve to take a blood sample.Though it's not too terribly realistic, IMHO, it's still entertaining as hell, and anyone who likes an actioner should get this one.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

An Emotional Juggernaut,"Even though this is not a beleivable tale, once you start to watch it you are gripped with the emotional hooks created very intellegently by the Director. Soon one starts to realize that this is not about it being real or unreal but about the feeling of good's truimph over bad. This is a perfect example of a Director using film making, hard core action and total fiction for pure entertainment.

Cage/Travolta switch roles........brilliant.,"John Woo is the so called master of action films, where he puts heavy on the action and light on the characters, he does this again with FACE/Off, but what makes this film different is the fact that the characters actually switch roles in it, which makes it more interesting then his previous ""american films"".We see the actors brilliantly display hate/love and imitate each other. Without this element, this film would probably fall flat on it's face in the action genre and become a fading memory, instead of making it's mark in film Other then the fact that they switch roles, what makes this film different from it's other rivals? Not that much, it's your typical gun fights here, explosions there, chase scene here, but does that mean that it makes it not enjoyable? Certainly not.There are tons of scenes where the bullets fly for those action hounds and of course the movie has the signature double gun from hard boiled and Woo's birds flying away. Woo has a talented eye for action, but not very much for characters, does that harm this film, a little, but again with the fact that the actors in it, portray different personalities, you don't really get a sense of that, you feel for the character of Archer and his dead son. CAGE, who is a personal fav, gives a great performance, but it's TRAVOLTA, the ""bad guy' who gets the glory in this film for having a fun time.The story is laughable, but fun and that's what this movie is, pure fun. It does have emotional parts of it, but it does little for people who go to see this movie, unless your a sappy person who cries at the death of everybody. The ending is a little inane, but forgivable in this film. It could have had a better ending, which would have made the film go down in history as a great action film, instead of a fun action film, which is what so many action films are like today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite action film,"There is no better action film out there than the one that this duo (Travolta and Cage) dug up in Face/Off, with heavy budget being put down for the intense action scenes depicted in this movie, director John Woo won the Saturn Awards for Best Directing as he leads us down a path where we discover the repercussion of a life without forgiveness.The movie's high point is the speedboat chase towards the ending of the film, the scene got a MTV Movie Awards for Best Action Scene and the movie duo won Best Duo (in the MTV Movie Awards) for Travolta and Cage.The movie tries to show the effects of personal feuds and how if not well contained can ruin lives of those we love and nothing sets off to show us this lesson than this classic that has its tales drawn from Greek mythological feud between Hector and Achilles. The names Castor and Pollux also come from a pair of brothers in Greek mythology. The wonderful face off scene at the end between the two leads that had doves flying around is similar to Woo's classic 1989 Hong Kong film The Killer.The movie plot is about Sean Archer (John Travolta) an FBI Agent who has been chasing down a criminal crime Lord Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) for years. Their feud led to the death of Archer's son Michael and Archer strongly believes that his son's killer is his sworn enemy Castor Troy.Archer finally cornered Castor one day and a fight broke out and Troy got knocked out cold. But Archer later finds out that Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and the only other person who knows the bomb location is Castor's brother Pollux, who refuses to talk.To get Pollux to talk a special operation doctor provided a solution that will require cutting off the face of Troy and placing it on Archer, Archer undergoes the surgery with the knowledge of limited people, so as to keep the operation hidden and takes the face of Troy to go undercover.But things go wrong when Castor Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge on Archer for taking his face and the first thing Troy does is to kill everybody who knows about the operation.Face/Off was highly hyped before its release which happened to be same year that Titanic (1997) was released, Face/Off lived up to the hype, making you the audience wanting to watch the film over and over again because one ride is not enough; It was also a commercial success making thrice its worth in the box office. Face/Off Holds a 94 percent ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes the only thing that separates this movie from old time classics like Mad Max is the intense use of action set pieces.The acting by this two is one I will not forget soon, when watching the movie on its release I wanted to be an action hero like one of them. Face/Off to me is a classic and one of the best action films I have seen till date.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"""ConAir"" had more brains than this garbage. It was funnier too.","I hate John Travolta and Nic Cage(Please don't e-mail me with your hate mail). They have both been in good movies(""Look Who's Talking"", ""ConAir"", ""Get Shorty"", and even ""Phenomenon"" and ""Guarding Tess"") but Cage turned in the worst performance ever by an actor in the little-seen Coppola project ""Deadfall"", and was also awful in the remake of ""Kiss of Death""(Sam Jackson rules!). He goes over-the-top as a baddie, and came across as slightly irritating as a good guy in OK films like ""Honeymoon in Vegas""(Love that Sarah Jessica Parker"")and lesser ones like ""It Could Happen to You"", ""Trapped in Paradise"" et al. Travolta was in the godawful, unintentionally funny ""Saturday Night Fever"", he was overrated in the overrated, unnecessarily yucky ""Pulp Fiction""(Sam Jackson still rules!), was pathetic as a baddie in ""Broken Arrow"", and he dances too much.I can't believe the critics love this so much.

It's too flashy(I like standard ""Commando"" or ""T-2"" actioners)and stylish(The next time I see slow motion, or a guy holding two guns in a John Woo movie, I am going to shoot myself!!!) and the actors are awful when playing baddies(they swap faces or something). It's true, they're not too bad when they are playing the John Travolta federal agent character, and the ending is nice, but this flick is too long, too over-the-top, too dumb, and I HATE Nic Cage and John Travolta!(They seem nice in real life, though).

An action masterpiece,"To begin, I must state that this film is not for people who can't take unrealistic and over the top action, or accept medically scientifically impossible medical procedures.  If you can't take in a moive and realize that it is taking place removed from reality, this film is not for you.  In my opinion, action movies should not be realistic.  I watch them to escape from the real world, not to go over and over and point out what couldn't or wouldn't happen in real life.If you can accept that, then you will love Face Off.  Action maestro John Woo, best known by his ardent followers for his over the top and incredibly kinetic Hong Kong action films such as A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, The Killer and Hard Boiled, and most famous in the US for his box office smash Mission Impossible 2, delivers a film that, while not quite on the level of his best work from Hong Kong, is clearly his best American film to date.  And beyond that, a film that blows most other American action films out of the water.Woo has the inate ability to make almost anything look good from a purely visual standpoint.  He takes a simple thing like Nicholas Cage exiting a car and makes it look incredibly stylish and cool.  Give him this kind of budget and R-rating, and look out.  The action scenes in this movie are dazzling, replete with Woo's trademark slow motion shootouts and his one on one stand offs between enemies with guns pointed at each other at point blank range. This is bolstered by the resources he had at hand for this project, and he spares no expense in massive explosions.  And the final boat chase is one of the best staged action sequences in years.He also does a nice job handling the more dramatic moments in the film, aided by the very strong performances of both lead actors.  Travolta and Cage both play the roles of the narcissistic, sadistic, over the top Castor Troy and the depressed, work obsessed family man Sean Archer very well.  And while the script certainly has a few corny moments, especially the final scene, but it also includes some very funny dialogue and one liners, and provides the viewers with characters that are interesting and sympathetic.This movie is not perfect from an overall standpoint, but as a major studio action movie it is about as close as you're going to get.  Watching it just reminds us the massive impact that John Woo has had on action cinema worldwide, and his style has perhaps lost some of its impact now because of the host of imitators he has, most notably Michael Bay who directed The Rock and Bad Boys 1 and 2, and The Wachowski Brothers, famous for The Matrix trilogy.  Unfortunately John Woo's career has been sidetracked by studio execs unwilling to compromise and allow him to make the types of movies he really wants to make, and Face Off remains the only great action film he's made in America.  But it is a great one.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
brilliant film that serves as a showcase for acting talents,"i loved this movie as it not only has brilliant action moments but it also gives John Travolta and Nicholas Cage a chance to display their fantastic acting talents.Travolta plays Sean Archer,a member of the FBI who has been trying to take down Castor Troy(Cage)in revenge for the unintentional murder of his son.After catching up with Castor,Sean does enough to put him into a coma.However,Castor left a few surprises and Sean is forced to take Castor's face in order to infiltrate a prison and to retrieve codes from Castor's brother Pollux(Alessandro Nivola)in order to stop a bomb going off.(sorry if I've lost you I'm near the end of the summary)when Castor snaps out of his coma,he realises what has happened to his face and forces the medical team to graft Seans' face onto his.He then destroys the evidence.What follows is a lot of action set pieces as Cage battles to get his face,and his life back off TravoltaFirstly,John Woo has done an amazing job directing this.The way that he can make something so ugly like a gunfight seem so beautiful(see shootout in Castor's pad).Also the camera angles are not too hectic and all over the place like in most action movies but always give you the best view and this makes the action scenes a joy to watch.secondly,Both leads are amazing in this film and in my opinion this film mainly serves as a showcase for Travolta and cages' acting talents.they play both(or should that be all four) parts brilliantly.Travolta i think succeeds more in playing the bad guy he so much relishes than the family man and cage plays both family man and cold blooded killer amazingly.the supporting cast are all strong too and do great jobs.i give this movie a 10/10 as it is a joy to watch and also has a lot of memorable quotes ""Y'know,i could eat a peach for hours.""

Ideal film for anyone whose IQ is <80.,"Utterly unrealistic. The premise is as contrived as they get, making it impossible to suspend disbelief even if you have a 15-story crane. The actors hammed it up full-time, but not nearly as much as director Woo did. He must have laughed all the way to the bank with the money the (possbily drunk) producers shelled out. It's too bad that it was handled as it was. If Woo had realized that the story was comic-book material and had elevated the premise to the level of Batman or Spiderman or the like, it could have been acceptable-level tongue-in-cheek entertainment.

"sin A Special Agent, determined to take revenge on a freewheeling terrorist and slayer of his son, changes faces with his worst enemy in order to save the day.","This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good ""entry-level"" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer –through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time ""I'm going to take his face Off!"" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role – which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries – they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final ""face-off"" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines (""It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT""). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
An edge of your seat thriller!,"This movie ranks up there with the best. Travolta and Cage must take on each others identity, and they really pull it off. Cage, as Castor Troy is a totally fanatical killer. He shows this in the beginning of the movie when Travolta catches up to him, and they have guns on each other. Travolta hates the idea of taking on Cages' identity to find out where he has hidden a bomb. The idea of ""transplanting"" faces is not too far-fetched in this day and age. Travolta gives a great performance as Archer. He must deal with the murder of his son, and face the man who did it. It is great to see how these characters face off against each other. Troy's character really surfaces when he goes to the prison to visit Archer and says, ""You'll be here for the next hundred years.""

One of the best 90's action movies...,"Face Off is one of the popular 90's action flicks of that decade. It is directed by a well-known Hong Kong director and who legitimately majorly influenced action films or sequences nowadays, known for chaotic action sequences, Mexican Standoffs, and frequent usage of slow motion. This film contains all of these aspects, as well as the addition of the two famous actions stars, John Travolta, and Nicolas Cage.As the film title states, the film starts with a soul of an FBI agent named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and his very young son getting shot and nearly assassinated by one of the mob terrorists named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Sean Archer's son persists dead from the gunfire. After a few years later, Castor and some of his mob crews are captured from the FBI operation group led by Sean Archer. However, in order to foil an extortion plot, Sean, the FBI agent goes into a facial transplant surgery and exchanges with Castor for 7 days. He has assumed an identical identity of the Castor as he looks exactly similar with his plantation and whirls to obtain the location and the codes of a massive bomb that can wipe out several and tons of lives. However, everything goes perversely when the real Castor Troy wakes up from a coma before expected and gets the same facial transplant surgery for Sean's face.This is such a different and an original concept that has never been taken before. In the film, it illustrates this very brief shortly as it is supposedly more shed into a genre of Sci-Fi. This could be mistaken as for the most preponderance of the film continues for a period of time of events happening between the accidentally switched life of Sean and Castor as they both premiere experience and endure the risks and faith of their new lives. John Travolta first plays an FBI agent who is desperate for revenge and his family's conditions but as the facial transplant surgery befalls to him, we see the face of a terrorist implanted to the main hero and faithful FBI agent who secretly needs to extract information about a bomb terror in a city. John Travolta is wickedly entertaining to watch his presence and his physical and mental change of a person, he acts smoothly and quiet, but later performances wicked, frightening yet hilarious and a person who has a heavy sexual desire. He outtakes the personal yet wonderfully disorganized life of the original Sean and makes the outcome of running it and changing the course to his desire of style. Nicolas Cage first plays the after the character of John Travolta the boss of a terror organization but later transfigures to a vulnerable hero who gets yanked into a thoroughly unexpected harsh situation. Nicolas Cage is the best aspect that could be supplemented to this film, as he is at his prime best, courageous and peddles the likability of his character.As this is an action flick, it executes the action as expected from a 90's action film. The action here is remarkably entertaining. Additionally, audiences can assert that the stunts are somewhat dangerous and when an action sequence ensues, a stunt double has been replaced with the actors. Like all cheesy 90's action flicks, the action is competitively identical yet entertaining as usual. John Woo's direction makes the normal average 90's action flick, more upscale and procreates some of the revolutionary action sequences and styles that are continued throughout until nowadays. Additionally, he definitely borrows the elements from his previous foreign action films making this action fresh at the time of period. Aside from the entertaining and cool action sequences, this film frequently has a heavy-handed dramatic weight as the two opposite characters change. We have an empathy to Nicolas Cage's character Sean as we want his accomplishment of rejoining with his wife and family to obtain the joy-ness and true laughter.Overall, Face Off is one of the better 90's action flicks. It consists of cool and utterly entertaining 90's John Woo's action sequences, an original idea, and sometimes a heavy dramatic weight to the vulnerability of the hero. It could be diverted into a dumb-fun 90's action flick or a well-wrought Sci-Fi and action film.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Best onscreen duo for an action film,"John Woo is one of my favorite directors. He has style and knows what he wants, and what to expect, from his movies. Here, he uses his good old sense and makes it into a great film. The only problem I had was some of the forced scenes and plot holes (believe me, there are some), but it was done so well you tend to forget about analyzing a film and just watch it for what it is.The biggest congrats go out to Travolta and Cage for crossing characters and talking on each other's habits/flaws.

"Great action movie with many ""cool"" scenes","I have seen Face/Off several times. I've just realized why this movie is so great compared with most action flicks: it has a *story* to tell. It's not just explosions and blood and heroes and villains; it is so much more. However, a few things separate this action film from action masterpieces such as ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"": a few totally unnecessary scenes: such as the last (very boring) fight on board some boats. That bit always irritates me.Few movies boasts as many ""cool"" scenes as this one though. How about Castor Troy (Cage) walking to his private jet with his coat flapping in the wind? Or the mirror-scene in which Archer and Troy are looking in the mirrors and still aiming at their enemies face (complicated I know). Or the scene in the church where everybody is pointing a gun at each other and the doves are flying about?Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are both great, as almost always.One thing that I really don't like: the ending!

oozes awesomeness,"AMAZING! watched it for the first time in more than 10 years. was wondering if it would hold up to how much I used to love it or if it would be filled with OMA (old movie attributes). not only did it hold up, it exceeded. I picked up on so much more than when I was a kid and a less-experienced movie watcher. such an awesome idea for a story that may have seemed ridiculous at the time but not any more with today's technology. they definitely took some liberties with the science, but shut up. lolJust a great idea that was taken in all the right places. the characters were awesome. the acting was intense, especially by cage. the movie was smart. great directing and action sequences. INCREDIBLE musical score that kind of made the movie. there was a little bit of unrealistic and some over-the-top, but I don't mind. this is probably the best action flick of the pre-CGI era (about 8 viewings, 11/20/2020)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
not you're average make-over!,"Travolta plays this FBI top agent whose sole purpose in life for 10 years has been to catch the terrorist Castor Troy (Cage) because he, by mistake, shot and killed Travolta's son. In a bloodbath which leads to Castor's capture he falls into a coma but is kept alive. At this point the story becomes original by doing the unimaginable when Travolta becomes Cage and vice versa. The rest of the story is simply them getting at each other and screwing up each others lives, Travolta's in particular.John Woo with his first Hollywood hit and it is a big one and will be followed by Mission: impossible 2 this year. Travolta with another great movie (ever since Pulp Fiction he has been flawless) but Cage is more convincing as the family man.When one looks at this movie one sees two great and popular actors and Hong Kong's finest action director, one cannot miss and one does not. It has an original plot-line and action scenes you've never seen before (or at least not as well done). Basically it's just a fun movie and a sure winner if you're looking for a video rental.

Really, besides watching American movies what does he know about American culture? It's John Woo's interpretation of American Culture and that's what makes this movie so special. Is it over the top? You're bet your ass it is. Why? Because it's a parody of American culture. John Woo watched Die Hard and said to himself, ""Wow, Americans are crazy ass mother *******"".Did we fool the world into thinking we're all super hero Rambo 'Roid crazed guerrilla fighters from hell? You bet your ass we did, World, and John Woo's on board for the ride.This movie is so 1990's that it makes any other attempt to define the 90's a complete and utter sham.

ONE OF THE GREATEST !!!,"Ok, Speaking of this magnificent movie, we can say that it is by far, one of the best movies you'll ever see.* Stars: Splendid and Outrageous acting by both legends : John Travolta (Sean Archer) and Nicolas Cage (Castor Troy). They make you believe them in both roles (Good and Evil). It takes a lot of effort to act as a good-guy and as a bad-guy in the same movie and yet be perfect and convincing at both roles.* Story: A wonderful story that implements the inner most feelings of good and evil. You can see that when you see how Sean Archer treats Castor Troy's son. And how Castor Troy feels towards his younger brother.* Directing: The film was directed by the talented director : John Woo (director of Broken Arrow. also            starring John Travolta). It seems that Travolta & John Woo form a very good team.* Best Shots:                 1- When Sean Archer wakes up after the face-switching operation and finds that he has the face of his enemy Castor Troy, and he asks them to burn it after the missions ends.2- The other best shot was after they switched faces. When they both meet , where each one of them is looking in the mirror seeing the face of the other. This part reveals the deep hatred that each one of them feels towards the other.Ok That is all , This movie is a must see and it deserves 10 out of 10 . I never get tired of watching it on video.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"This is the single, most brilliant action movie ever made!","Quite seriously, some people really having a problem with suspending belief in these kinds of movies.Of COURSE you can't swap peoples faces over and expect the bodies to accept the changes, and it's pretty obvious that you can't fool family members into thinking you are who you are. It is equally impossible to shoot a bullet-proof windscreen thirty times and have all the bullets bounce off without making a scratch. But that happens in ALL the Bond movies and no one EVER complains about that. And do you think it is possible to create a uranium-powered car with today's technology that can go back and forward through time when it hits eighty eight miles an hour? NO! But it happens in Back to the Future. But that is not AT ALL what the movie is about. It's about one thing and one thing only ACTION!It contains some stunning special effects, outstanding acting, and some of the best action scenes EVER put onto the screen. John Woo is great as an action director, and that is what he did.So if you are in half minds about this film, watch it, because it is an excellent action movie as long as you don't read into it.

Identity Play,"In my assessment and experience of the genre, it is possibly the best action movie ever made.

This, in my opinion, is about the most you can expect from an action film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
F*c*/Off,"I remember watching this in the cinema in November 1997 with 698 other people (a full house) and only me and my pal hated it. Which is weird because I expected it to be great. The original script for the film had it set in the future but Woo insisted it be written in present day to not distract the audience. But the only thing that distracted me was how dull the film was.Since coming to Hollywood John Woo has done little to impress. He mad a very strong debut with Hard Target but the film was cut to shreds and the impact severely muted. Broken Arrow was thoroughly unexciting and Face/Off is not much better.The bulk of the blame lies not with Woo but with Travolta. As Sean Archer he's fine. But as soon as he becomes Castor Troy he turns the camp all the way up to 11. Face/Off eventually becomes an unashamed pantomime. Cage, as both characters, is very good. But Travolta takes Troy to the same place he took Vic Deakins in Broken Arrow. It's like he assumes that no matter what he does, it's automatically cool because IT'S A JOHN WOO FILM. Sorry, but that logic doesn't work out in real life.The plot, while being crafty, doesn't really do much. Exactly what does Troy plan after becoming Archer? To look like his enemy for the rest of his life? If not it was a bad idea burning down the Plastic Surgery Joint then. Some interesting imagery is used and the subtext gives the movie a sharper edge despite its superficial appearance. All the 'gun ballet' stuff does is glamorise guns. And that's becoming real old hat.Weird tho, when you think that this film is written by the folks that gave us The Mask and Death Wish V: The Face of Death. And John Woo would also dabble in face swapping later on with Mission: Impossible 2.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The only extra is a trailer.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
"Oh John Woo, don't ever change","If you can watch a John Woo film without being on the edge of your seat, I'm pretty sure you have no pulse. ""Face/Off"" is such an inventive movie when it comes to style, the techniques are just dazzling and all the action scenes are well above classic shoot-em-ups. I especially love that scene where hero and villain are standing back to back, Woo already sorta did that in ""Hard Target"" but somehow it's even better here. ""Face/Off"" is not all action scenes though. The plot, though completely nonsensical, is very compelling as well. It relies heavily on John Travolta and Nicholas Cage being able to switch characters without effort, and I'm glad to say neither actor disappoints. The way they pick up each other's traits is just brilliant. Even the family subplot of this movie is good, and family subplots in action movies are NEVER any good. Usually they're tacked on at the last minute in a desperate attempt to give characters depth, but in ""Face/Off"" it's an essential part of the story. ""Face/Off"" may be a dumb action flick to some, but it's a dumb action flick with one hell of a heart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

a miraculous achievement.,"so many of the comments here focus on this movie as an action movie. and while i don't want to disillusion you about the amount of action in the movie, it is not just an action movie. it *doesn't* feature the silly one-liners of movies mixing comedy into action because there's really no plot. it *does* have an excellent story about identity, responsibility, relationships, morality and more. you *do* have to accept the idea of the surgical procedure switching their faces in order to enjoy the movie; movies are supposed to involve *some* suspension of disbelief. once you allow that (sci-fi?) element, the superb acting draws you into the excellent story. what this movie has that puts it so far above the rest is style. from the clothes the characters wear to the comments they make, everything is cool (original, refreshing and inspiring). the use of music is excellent throughout. john woo's direction and the cinematography is simply amazing, and not just the action scenes which he is known for and which are among the best on film. the movie's pacing is excellent. if you didn't like die hard x, but loved twelve monkeys, give this one a shot.it is simply one of the best movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
If you gotta watch one action-movie..,"John Woo's ""Face off"" is not an art-film or in any way important. It's just old-fashioned entertainment, fine-tuned to the singular art of pleasing you, while at the same time throwing a couple of home-truths in your general direction... The non-stop action leave your senses stunned and satiated, and sends you out of the cinema in the warm and enjoyable knowledge of money well spent. In my case, that doesn't happen very often. ""Face off"", utter rubbish really, triumphs in its manic insistence on justice being served, no matter what. The ""Count of Monte Christo""- theme (very old hat!) is served up like it was piping hot, and the action seems fresh and inventive. John Woo is also one of the few action-directors who remain true to the rules of the genre. That is, although the editor goes wild, the camera flies off in every direction, the bombs explode all over the place: You never experience vertigo or dizzy spells (like in that,""Armageddon""-horror!). In a John Woo action-scene you know where you are.You know where the actors are positioned. And you know where the danger is coming from.Simple, really.

The family tie-in is sublimely performed by Joan Allen and Gina Gershon's lead, and the reversal of roles shows the mettle of the two main actors. Travolta's performance as the troubled family man in the services of the FBI was equaled only by Nic Cage's performance as Castor Troy who, if developed into a full movie, could have been one of the best ""bad guys"" of Hollywood.

Pass the Popcorn review,"Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers – both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers.Face/Off is a story about two men – one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma – but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola) – and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse.The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed.Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

So unbelievibly 90s its glorious,"Face/Off is definitely the movie that feels the most like Woo's earlier works and yet the exact opposite simultaneously, sick, slick and sensational, Face/Off was my introduction to Woo so it will always hold a special place in my heart, finally giving him the control and freedom he wanted from Hollywood. It's egregiously over the top but equally poetic in its carnage, more than just pure spectacle, Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another. Its plot, hysterical in its implausibility is ripe for Woo's unparalleled sense of bravura often utilising his stars to great effect. Watching Travolta and Cage take on each other's mannerisms while desperately trying to outham one another remains the movie's most outlandishly enjoyable aspect in what is undoubtedly career highs for them both, with Cage channelling his inner Chow Yun-fat, which often takes comic and psychic measures of their characters and their careers. Woo and company expertly embrace the camp nature of Face/Off's premise remaining a truly engaging and at times sophisticated story of identity and behaviour while wearing the leering face of a farcical action cartoon filled to the brim with an abundance of wit, barbaric energy, indefensibly violent blood spatters and hard-hitting firepower.

"It's a case of ""third time lucky"" as John Woo finally makes his Hollywood breakthrough.","After two false-starts in his Hollywood career, namely ""Hard Target"" and ""Broken Arrow"", John Woo has finally made the successful transition from Hong Kong to Tinseltown.  Fans of the legendary director's many Oriental ""urban thrillers"" should lap up this stylishly realised thrill-ride involving swapped identites, jaw-dropping visuals and guns galore.The plot sees F.B.I. agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) out to seek revenge on arch-criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) after the senseless murder of his young son.  After a bullet-riddled opening shoot-out Troy is left comatosed and his gun-toting brother Pollux (Alissandro Nivola) is locked up, but their reign of terror is far from over.  Aware of the fact that Troy has left a bomb capable of taking out the entire city ticking somewhere in LA, Archer is unable to extract the location of said explosive device from either Pollux or Troy's entire gang. It seems that all hope is lost until Archer is convinced to undergo radical surgery to effectively ""become"" his rival; his face is removed from his skull and replaced with that of Troy.  A little haircut here, a touch of lypo-suction there and abracadabra!  Archer is now the spitting image of his foe and can be placed behind bars in order to extrapolate the exact location of the bomb from ""brother"" Pollux. However, things get a little out-of-hand when Troy awakens from his coma, steals Archer's face, destroys all evidence of the mission and escapes.  On hearing this, Archer (Cage) manages to break-out of jail and resume his deadly game of cat-and-mouse with his nemisis Troy (Travolta).Confused?  Believe me, it's a lot easier to comprehend when you're viewing it.  ""Face/Off"" is possibly the first action film since ""Die Hard"" to combine edge-of-the-seat thrills with a riveting plot.  The script is bursting with energy, emotion, witty dialogue and dark humour.  Shoot-outs aside, the finer points of the film involve the Archer-faced Troy romancing his vegence-seeking enemy's wife.Travolta and Cage are adpet at playing both good and bad guys; Travolta's villain is super-cool, whilst Cage brings a nervously dark edge to the hero. Superb support is offered from Joan Allen (Man Hunter) as Archer's lonely wife, Dominique Swain (Lolita) as his estranged daughter, and Alissandro Nivola (I Want You) as Castor's paranoid young brother.Holding the entire movie together is Woo's outstanding direction, including slow-motion shoot-outs, double pistol action and Mexican stand-offs.

Well maybe.  Anyway enough gibber gabber let's get to the plot. Well John Travolta plays an F.B.I agent who's mission is to bring in one of the world's most deadliest terrorists (Nicholas Cage).  Cage was hired ten years earlier at the start of the film to take out Travolta, but missed and hit is son, who died.  Travolta is angry at this as you can imagine and he works day and night trying to figure out cage's next move.  To try and find out where cage has hidden a bomb in New York, the story becomes complicated as Travolta is asked to do something by his superiors which well without giving anymore of the story away, let's just say most people, wouldn't do. Anyway go and hire the film out, you'll enjoy it, guaranteed.  I gave this film an Eight out of ten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Fantastic action film,"What a great film... I am an action-film fan, and this film was a great way to entertain the audience with our favorite stars from ""The Rock"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and many more... together!!! In the film, John Travolta plays an FBI agent who is hunting down arch-terrorist Nicholas Cage. Cage is in control of a very violent group of thugs and he is accused by the FBI of many violent acts of terrorism. He is not Osama bin Laden or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi supporting global jihad and personally beheading innocent hostages with a dull knife, but he is still quite a vicious man. After Cage is captured by Travolta and his crew, he is obviously facing a lengthy prison term... The only problem is that the rest of Cage's organization has not yet been infiltrated by the bureau! What better way for Travolta to get ""on the inside"" than by coming Cage himself?So doctors perform a complicated surgical operation during which Travolta receives the face of Cage and his body is surgically operated on so as to appear quite similar and pass off as Cage himself. Travolta has so ""become"" his enemy Cage that he even fools Cage's closest family members and ""friends"" and even has to serve part of Cage's prison term before he breaks out. Once out of prison, Travolta (now wearing Cage's face) has to not only find the real Cage (who has stolen Travolta's face as well and escaped from the hospital where the operation took place) and take him down but also get closer with Cage's group for important information and convince his own family that HE is the real Travolta, not Nicholas Cage the murderous terrorist whose face he is wearing.This film is an slam-bang thriller from start to finish that should be seen by all film fans whether you really like action as I do, or not.

General Statement,"As a young filmmaker myself, this movie not only catches me with the suspense and action but the overall plot is pretty good. Yeah there were a few goofs but if you're trying to keep up with the story and enjoy the sequences rather than spot and bash them you wont really notice. John Woo has a particular habit of bringing these wicked action scenes but needs to keep in mind the overall ""realism"" of them. Sure its just a movie, and maybe his flaws are deliberate but we don't want to be reminded of those two facts. I haven't just seen this movie recently, nor have i just seen it once, in my opinion this is probably one the best action films ever made. Considering that two years later ""The Matrix"" and well lets face it. It was pretty action packed with those subtle biblical references. But the problem with that movie...almost everything was CG, and in a movie like Face/Off we see those eye popping thrills that make this film a great. In the end, its a good movie, a little cliché but hey, that's Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

John Woo is the man,"Michael Bay should take notes on how to make an emotionally driven action film. Who knew that you could make a very well paced Hollywood heroic bloodshed film.John Woo films are an acquired taste. Somehow you can easily suspend your disbelief. The firefights in where everybody is diving, the slow motion, the marksmen who are bad shots, the dramatic Mexican standoffs, the use of doves, just the general over the top sequences are not mean't to portray realism but rather the intensity of the situation. And it works.This also has to be the best body swap film. Freaky Friday and a whole bunch of other works are just... played out. This is much more refreshing, seeing it being done through medical technology instead of some contrived magic spell. Not only that but its not meant to be quirky, that is not to say the movie is without some laughs.However there are some things that are sort of cheesy, the maniacal laughter, the whole peaches thing and the face caress. Those are minor however.John Woo is the man. There should be to an extent more Hong Kong directors in Hollywood with a lot of creative control. And I'm sorry Bollywood fans, your directors are inept to this task (I'm only saying this because I'm of Indian descent). It's only a matter of time we see another heroic bloodshed Hollywood film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
John Woo's breakout masterpiece,"John Travolta, Sean Archer, is riding a carousel with his young son when a shot rings out and hits his son instead of him. The shooter Nicholas Cage, Castor Troy, is the villain shooter in this high octane non-stop thriller.
Detective Archer vows revenge for the death of his son. Troy is stopped and going to prison, but he has bombs set to go off somewhere. Archer and Troy trade faces and Archer goes to jail to discover where the bombs are. Troy goes home to Archer's wife, Eve Archer, played by Joan Allen. Dominique Swain plays the daughter, Jamie Archer.
The two biggest events are first the prison breakout which goes inside and then outside off the roof into water. The second biggest scenes are the motor boats which collide, run over another craft, then explode. This film tops most other action films, because it also includes tender loving moments with the Archers, but also Gina Gershon, Sasha Haskell and her young son by Castor Troy. Nick Casavetes also gives a top performance.
The magic in this film comes from the double of Travolta and Cage. When they are verbally or physically sparring, there is magic on the screen. Everything works on every level.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

Topping it off with an intelligent storyline, this is a 5-star performance!John Travolta and Nic Cage are just the best good guy/bad guy combination you could think of.

Action movie of 1997,"Face/Off is one of the most original, interesting movies that I have ever seen.  The action sequences are all outstanding and brilliantly directed by John Woo, who also directed Broken Arrow with John Travolta.  The plot is the same ""Saint vs. Sinner"" as found in many movies, but this movie shows just how far the ""saint"" will go to catch the ""sinner"".  John Woo's use of slow-motion is amazing.  The part of the story that I enjoyed the most was how the characters were all given very different and unique personalities in such a short time.  This is in my view the best action movie of 1997.  The finale is a breathtaking action sequence.  I gave it 10 out of 10.  I hope that you all go out and rush to your video stores to rent Face/Off.

Inventive action-packed John Woo thrill ride,"Hong Kong action film Director John Woo brings stellar action and thrills in this action-packed popcorn flick, starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who compete in one of the most exhilarating and inventive games of Cat-and-Mouse ever brought together on film. John Travolta plays Sean Archer, a FBI agent and devoted father and husband who is devastated by the cold murder of his son Michael by a ruthless terrorist Castor Troy (played by Nicolas Cage). Six years pass, Troy is still alive and hatches a diabolical plan to use a powerful bomb to blow a city. After seemingly killing Troy in a violent shootout, Archer is assigned on a mission to acquire the information from on the bomb's location from Troy's evil goons, and this plan involves Archer undergoing a medical surgery that removes his facial identity and replaces it with Troy's. While Archer is sent on the island where Troy's henchman are incarcerated, Troy wakes up and undergoes the same surgery to steal Archer's facial identity. It is up Archer is escape the prison and go after Troy who begins using his identity.John Woo packs a punch with some intense, stylized action sequences and elegant action set pieces, along with an abnormal plot that work surprisingly well. This movie follows a stylish story of two men who are literally put into each other's shoes and begin experiencing each other's life and appearance, and John Woo does some amazing experimenting with this concept; switching back and forth from John Travolta's character posing as Nicolas Cage's character to outwit his goons with some intense gunfights and interrogations, to Nicolas Cage's character posing as John Travolta to commit a flirtatious life with his wife and teenage daughter and sabotage his job at the FBI. When Travolta and Cage eventually come face-to-face for the first time as each other, the pulse-pounding gun shootouts ensue and build up into a stunning climax at the end set with some good visuals, and its all fun to watch. The performances are solid and the plot moves at a reasonable pace, and with consistency.Face/Off sets a great example of how action movies should be and it takes a position as the one of the most entertaining action flicks of its decade. Actions fans will be pleased by this film as well as those looking for a great action flick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

It also has over the top action by John Woo. The introduction scene for Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) is the funniest and best introduction to a character. John Woo, thank you for that scene. John Travolta gave a hilarious Nick Cage impression, these two actors where chosen for these roles by destiny. What perfect casting, Caster Troy is one of my favorite villains of all time. This movie is worth seeing if you have never seen it. The action is so so so cool. The gun fights are awesome, and the boat chase was very cool.

"Brilliant film, great story.","This is one of the best films of the year, but we could expect nothing other than a great movie from John Woo. Another one of John Travolta`s good acting roles which made the film good, and of course the what seemed to be slightly psychopathic character played by Nic Cage. A few slight errors in the making of this film which I spotted, when the Aeroplane crashes into the building we see one of the cops running in with a gun, and before he is thrown across the room we can see a wire attached to his back that helps him appear to be thrown back across the room, and also I don`t know if this is an error but when there is the fight in the prison before Nic Cage`s character leaves we can see on a computer screen that Pollux Troy`s name is still there, even though he has been set free!But errors aside, this was a great action film with the usual aspects we come to expect from John Woo - lots of fight scenes and people jumping through glass window`s, I give this film a 10 out of 10!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"

The most over-the-top movie of all time,"Well it's time to finally review Face/Off (1997), the most popular movie of John Woo's filmography. And after watching it, I completely understand why that is because I love Face/Off (1997) and I'll even go a step farther, Face/Off (1997) is the most over-the-top movie I've ever seen in my life.Positives for Face/Off (1997):
The thing that I love the most about the movie are the performances by John Travolta as Sean Archer and Nicholas Cage as Caster Troy. Never in my life, have I seen a movie where the actors are so committed in being so over-the-top, cartoonish and larger-than-life than I have with both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage in this movie. It also helps that John Woo is the man sitting in the director's chair of this movie because if this movie was being handled by any other director, this movie would've failed spectacularly. This movie is 90s cheese at its absolute best. The action sequences in this movie are by far the best of any movie in John Woo's filmography. I love the shootouts and explosions in this movie so much and it was to the point where I realized something about this movie and it's that this is the kind of movie that Michael Bay wishes he could direct. I loved John Woo's use of the slow-motion to where it makes everything in the movie look even more cool and badass. I was also surprised to see that Thomas Jane was in the movie as one of Archer's fellow prison mates, who helps him escape from prison. I was even more surprised to see Chris Bauer as another prison mates in this movie and I was sitting there and I said to myself, ""Holy sh*t, is that Wild Bill Hancock from Heels."" And finally, I love the little details that are introduced in the movie to where they do eventually come back into play later on and pay off perfectly in the climax of the movie.Overall, Face/Off (1997) is a absolute instant classic in John Woo's filmography and it's the most over-the-top movie that I've ever seen in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Radical,This is a great film and was totally fresh for the time period it was created in. The special effects were genius. I loved the two actors and how they played off of each other.

Woo's Hollywood masterpiece,"For anyone who has seen ""The Killer"" or ""Hard-Boiled"", you probably will not be blown away by ""Face/Off"". As good as Face/Off may seem, we have to remember it is still given the Hollywood treatment. Less guns, less bullets, less death, and a happy ending. Of course, for the regular neutered American filmgoer, this seems like a GOOD thing. But for REAL hardened action fans, this Hollywood intervention is an unwelcome intrusion. For all the fireworks in Face/Off, it still does not even come close to matching up with even ten minutes of ""Hard-Boiled"" or ""The Killer"". These two Hong Kong movies are John Woo's REAL masterpieces, not tied down by any ropes or watered-down to fit the standards of any major movie company.However, that being said, Face/Off is certainly a masterpiece in American standards. Woo manages to still offer us an energetic and eye-pleasing action movie despite being tied down by Hollywood. The plot in this movie, while comical, is very engaging. A little known fact about this movie is that it was originally meant to be set in the future. That would better explain the validity of the operation AND that wacky futuristic prison. However, Woo refused to do this, and the movie is much better because of it.The complications of Castor Troy turning into Sean Archer and vice versa are brilliant. Sean turns into the very man he has loathed and despised. He is reminded of him every time he looks in the mirror. Castor, on the other hand, turns into the man who has been chasing him with passion for years. This turn of events causes major psychological trauma for both characters (although Cage's character shows it a lot more). The extent of these emotions are limited on screen as Woo chooses to push that aspect of the story away and instead focus on the action. Good choice!Make no bones about it, this is not a psychological drama. It has John Woo behind the camera, so it's a full-tilt action film. As in his Hong Kong films, Woo manages to make EVERYONE look more cool than they really are. Case in point, has Cage EVER looked cooler than the opening scene when he exits his car and his overcoat goes flapping around in the wind?The most brilliant example of Woo's genius is the scene when Cage and Travolta are back-to-back with each other with only a mirror separating them. When they both turn away and point guns at each other's image, you can't help but get chills at how brilliant this is. They're both pointing their guns at the very man they hate, and even though it is really themselves, shooting at that image could kill the enemy. As complicated as it is smart, Face/Off has many scenes that envoke chills like this.And of course, the raw unorthodoxed action...the only moment that this film felt like a Hong Kong movie was the scene when Cage slides on the floor to shoot at the SWAT member breaking into their hideout. The camera follows Cage sliding on the ground while sparks fly all around him. This just screamed Hong Kong action all the while and it was beautiful! The final church shootout was ripped off from ""The Killer"" (but severely diluted), and the boat scene was also something out of ""The Killer"". That being said, both were well-done and actually made the movie!The plot does seem a bit far-fetched, but it is as interesting as it is implausible. People need to stop looking at this film as a true-life action film and start looking at it like a sci-fi film (since that's what it was originally supposed to be). That is, keep your mind open and you won't be tied down by the physics and technology of today. Take the story as it is and breathe in the premise of the story and not the reality of it. Seen in that light, Face/Off is certainly an action masterpiece and one that John Woo should be proud of despite its lack of punch and flair that was present in The Killer and Hard-Boiled.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
Made for idiots,"If this isn't the biggest piece of crap that Hollywood has ever generated, then I pray I never have to sit through the film that beats it.

I hope that the three of them never make another movie again.  And if I ever meet one of them, I'm going to make them give me the $3 I wasted back.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
One of the best action movies ever made.,"After non-events, such as the disappointing HARD TARGET and the fun-but-insignicant BROKEN ARROW, John Woo finally achieved his potential for making great action movies with Hollywood's money.Using an amusingly improbable plot, Woo fleshes the bones of the script with some truly amazing action sequences, such as the speedboat chase and the apartment shoot-out. Woo shines as bright in the West that he did in the East, with films like THE KILLER and HARD-BOILED. Starting with a scene that most films would be happy to climax with, a jumbo-jet and chopper chase, notorious villain Castor Troy (snarling Nicholas Cage) is comatose. All is said done, until anti-terrorist agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) discovers that Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in downtown LA, to go off any time soon. So, through the wonders of medical science, Archer swaps faces with Troy, to infiltrate a high security prison and get the location of the bomb off Troy's weedy brother. But problems begin when the real Castor Troy wakes up, sans mug, and decides to get his own back by nicking Archer's. Roles are reversed, in a very Grecian way.Travolta and Cage bounce off each other fantastically well, and it is good two potentially brilliant actors working in unison so well. Supporting cast, such as Joan Allen, the delicious Domanique Swain, and the ever reliable CCH Pounder add good back-up. The story could not be more implausible if Dolph Lundgren played Travolta's wife, or if suddenly Charles Bronson turned up in a blonde wig as his daughter, but you can forgive that for the sheer breakneck speed Woo goes at, and the fact that how original the plot actually is.  One of the truly great action thrillers of the '90s, this breathed new life into a genre dominated by yet more LETHAL WEAPONs, Arnie, and Stallone. A new, interesting variation on the old Good vs. Evil theme, with a neat schizophrenic twist in its tale. If you haven't it already, I urge you too now - it's the best movie John Woo will ever make in the West, espcially if you've seen (groan) M:I-2 and WINDTALKERS.  Go, see, now.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Sci-Fi"
