BlacKkKlansman,"Amazing true story of a small team of police infiltrating a local klan chapter to try to stop looming violence.Driver is first class as the white undercover presence, with Washington himself oozing presence throughout as the black officer who conceives the plan, runs the show and in a number of hilarious high points gains the respect and trust of the big Klan chief over the phone.Whilst there is arguably room for a little bit of trimming, this remains highly engaging throughout with a great script and fine performances. The amazing trick here is how Lee seems to very cleverly shift from laugh out loud comedy to troubling sometimes fairly intense scene and back without missing a beat.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Totally Recognizable Villany,"A terrific Spike Lee film with humor and gut wrenching truths. My first reaction was that the villains were too one dimensional, caricaturesque. It was impossible to stay with them for more than a few seconds - even that outrageous scene of connubial bliss where she expresses her willingness, in the most romantic terms, to kill Blacks. I recoiled in horror and kind of laughing nervously - what is this, a satire? And then, I realized - the real life villanis are one dimensional, they are caricaturesque, they are their own satire. John David Washinton is great and sounds just like his father. Adam Driver brings a presence that is nothing short of compelling, The final real life images are devastating, I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One hell of a movie,"Spike Lee has created an almost unimaginably uneven career in films, but it has never been in doubt, that he is one of the most talented American filmmakers of his generation. And should you have forgotten that, now you can remind yourself by watching the amazing ""BlacKkKlansman"", which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May.""BlacKkKlansman"" tells the true story of a rookie African American police officer who in the 70's infiltrated in the KKK, but that's certainly not what the movie is about. Lee tackles head-on the contemporary hot topics of racism, the police killing black Americans, and white supremacy to create an overwhelming pamphlet about the American identity - which has been hurled into a state of great confusion after the last presidential election.Movies don't come much more political as this one. In a way, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a companion piece to ""The Post"" - a movie that similarly discussed the current political climate in a 70's setting - but with loads more of blackness, humour, anger and attitude. It's a better movie, too.Though not perfect. Form-wise, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is sometimes paced oddly and feels needlessly long: not overlong, exactly, because you're not going to be bored for a minute. Visually it could have used a little more of the delicious textures typical of those 70's blacksploitations it makes references to.But Lee is such a virile storyteller, that you can't help but get sucked in it all. And he has SO much to say. ""BlacKkKlansman"" is at its savage best when putting in perspective the official holier-than-thou image of the white Americans: Harry Belafonte cameos as an eye-witness of the beastly lynching of Jesse Washington in 1916.Actors in ""BlacKkKlansman"" are great. John David Washington excels in the lead role. Adam Driver signs what is arguably his best role to date. Ryan Eggold is terrific as the local boss of the KKK, and the Finnish Jasper Pääkkönen impresses as his right hand man. The biggest surprise of all is Topher Grace, who is near-ingenious as David Duke, a well-mannered bag of sleaze in a three-piece.""BlacKkKlansman"" is an incredibly rich and stirring piece of contemporary cinema with enough stuff to fuel a conversation for hours. Or days. You can get a lot less with a price of a movie ticket these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film that's both a joy and very difficult to watch,"Based on a true story, the first black detective at the Colorado Springs Police Department infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan with the help of a white undercover officer.Not content with the battles portrayed on the screen between black civil rights groups and the Klan, Spike Lee has squared up against Donald Trump and the political state of America today. Throughout the film, there are not-so-subtle nods to the US President's rhetoric and how it echoes the KKK's leader David Duke: at one point he says he wants 'to make America achieve its greatness again' and chants 'America first!' during a speech.The messages the film is trying to get across are not subtle, but it doesn't have to be when the messages have never been irrelevant. At one point, the true and horrific story of the public torture and execution of 17-year-old Jessie Washington in 1916 is told. This story is unfolding as the camera cuts back and forth to the Klan's initiation meeting which makes for a powerful scene of intense juxtaposition (Lee explained in the post-film Q&A that, ironically, this cross cutting technique was invented by the director of Birth of a Nation, an intensely racist pro-KKK 1915 film).The final minutes are fearful to watch as Lee brings us to the present time and the last few shots (which I won't spoil here) left me with a genuine tear in my eye and an uneasy feeling in one of the most basic, primitive part of my being - fear for the minds of my fellow man and the state of the world I'm meant to be leaving to my children.Best Quote: ""America would never elect someone like David Duke as President."" - ""Coming from a black man, that's pretty naïve.""",,Anonymous,Biography

Incredible true story comes with a lot of fictional baggage,"There's much good about this movie, starting with Ron Stallworth's incredible deception of the Klu Klux Klan. Racism in all its ugliness is powerfully shown. There's a lot of humor at the expense of some really dumb people. 
Unfortunately, there's a lot wrong with the movie too. Most of this is because the director embellished the true story. I'm not a big fan of directors tinkering with what really happened in order to add their own touch, and then still claim ""based on a true story"".
The result of the tinkering is a very uneven movie, particularly in the apparently ""easy"" parts of infiltrating the KKK and the ""hard"" parts where things go wrong. The ""easy"" parts are, remarkably, mostly the true story. Apparently this wasn't dramatic enough, so a lot of fictional ""hard"" parts were added to build tension including whole characters and situations. That's bad enough, but the added parts often made no sense, such as having no real origin (like one character's intense suspicions) and no resolution to the dilemma presented - they just seem to go away, are forgotten or have no effect on the inevitable story arc. Many seem to have been thrown in only to make already duped people look even more ridiculous. 
The characters themselves are, with a few exceptions, just caricatures. It's not hard to figure out what's next since they do exactly what you expect.
Eventually the movie just got boring since it all moved to an inevitable and very easy to see end. Ultimately, the movie is maybe an hour of an amazing true and humorous story marred by over an hour of superfluous and poorly executed fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Powerful film based loosely on a true story,"Directed by Spike Lee, this is a powerful film based loosely on a true story that took place in Colorado Springs in the 1970s. An undercover black police officer, played by J. D. Washington (and also, sort of, by Adam Driver, who plays a Jewish officer) infiltrates the K K K, which had (has?) a robust presence in Colorado Springs (which also happens to be a city with a large number of HQs of right-wing and evangelical organizations). Topher Grace plays David Duke, once the Grand Wizard of the K K K, who has positioned himself as an Executive Director and looks forward to the time when, through political action, his group can get one of their kind in the White House.The film, which is fairly traditionally shot, is clearly presented to foreshadow the increase of K K K and white supremacist activity taking place today. In fact, news footage of Donald Trump and the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally of 2017 is shown in the film, and the message is clear. At times obvious and even almost corny, The BlacKkKlansman is an important and sadly timely film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A funny, gripping and upsetting movie!","Hi, I'm french and I'm 16. We saw the movie in the cinema with my english class and our english teacher asked to us to write a revue of this movie, and after put in on this website.
Blackkklansman is a movie birected by Spike Lee in 2018. This film is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, a black police officer who wanted to infiltrate the KKK. Inspired by the book, Spike Lee made a film. In the movie we have funny moments and romance too; Ron falls in love with Patrice, a beautiful blanck woman who fights racism. It is certainly at the top od my list of good movies because it is not only about racism, but about several kinds of discrimination, anti-semitism and gender inequality. And so I think that a lot of people can indentify to both characters and realise that discrimination must be fought. And I think that Spike Lee did a good work because hemanaged to make in making a comedy with a dramatic issue, and Adam Driver and John David Washington have a really good actor's game, it couldn't be other actors!
So yes I think that this film is compelling, convincing, realistic, startling and funny, don't miss it!! And there is a lot of reseach from the film director about the KKK, who is a secret organisation of white supremacists directed by Donald Duke and created in 1865 after the Civil War, a war between Northen and Southen states of the USA, the North wanted to abolish slavery and the South didn't. In the movie, we can also see the KKK rites, with the white costums and all tradition. I really enjoyed that because you get out less stupid than you were before seeing the film.In conclusion, it's a fantastic film, with good actors on the top of that, and you learn a lot about discrimination and humanity, but with funny moments as well. It's a hit and a freat piece of film-making. Go see it!!Good work, Mr Spike Lee.Valentine B.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee Is Back In The Game,"What blows me away the most about BlacKkKlansman was its ability to profitably blend such a serious and calamitous subject with an appropriate amount of comedy. Only a long-in-the-business, cinematic master like Spike Lee could pull off such a trick, and he does it without complication. It's also refreshing to see that Spike Lee avoids stereotypes even when depicting some of the more unpleasant and nefarious characters/groups, allowing the film to feel less biased and more grounded in reality with various angles interweaving. BlacKkKlansman contains one of the most hard-hitting, politically dynamic screenplays (right next to Blindspotting) of the year that had me infatuated with revelation. It certainly is one of Spike Lee's best joints in years, maybe even decades. (Verdict: A-)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"BlacKkKlansman is somehow funny & utterly brutal at the same time, phenomenal.","I'd love to thank the Adelaide Film Festival Film Club for the free advance screening for this review.Blackkklansman comes to us from Director Spike Lee & Producer Jordan Peele and tells the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first african-american police officer in Colorado Springs infiltrating the Klu Klux Klan.To achieve this he enlists the help of a fellow officer played by Adam Driver to pose as him in person while Ron handled the phone calls and planning.This film is biographical in nature but has some fantastic storytelling, looking at the trailers, it looked like a really fun time with some funny humour about the time period and racism.
I'm glad to report this isn't just some comedy movie, here we have a rare film that manages to be funny and outlandish at times but at the same time drives home a serious emotional message, Spike Lee should absolutely be commended for this because it was executed flawlessly.John David Washington gives an interesting quirky performance here and nails it perfectly, Adam Driver turned out to be much more involved in the story than I had anticipated and has some really great moments.I have never had a cinema experience quite like this, for instance at the tail end of the film, in the space of 10 minutes the entire audience in my screening went from laughing and some perfectly executed comedic dialogue to utter still silence in absolute awe, frozen & horrified by what was appearing on screen, this silence went on for a few moment even after the fade to black and an applause started up.This film had me thinking about what I had seen for a long, long time afterward and I am still thinking about it almost every second.Blackkklansman really shows the Klan for what they really are, and highlights the good work of an amazing african-american police officer. The supporting cast does a great job here, Topher Grace as David Duke was an insanely good performance and I can imagine how hard it would be to embody that particular character and Laura Harrier plays off of Washington beautifully.In addition there is a great cameo at the beginning of this film, be on the look out!Blackkklansman is easily in my top 10 for 2018 so far and I urge you all to go see it in cinemas, small warning though, there are some quite confronting images in this film, they are hard to watch but I think that it should be watched as that is the intention here.

A Powerful Message that Gets Unfortunately Forced on the Audience,"Spike Lee's films have never really resonated with me for whatever reason. BlacKkKlansman is a fascinating story with an average execution at best. Lee brings some solid performances out of Adam Driver and John David Washington, but I'm not sure those characters are fleshed out as much as they should be. But my problem doesn't come with the actors or story per say, but more so with the message that is shoved down your throat. The very beginning and end of this movie present a particular message that is prevalent throughout the film on its own, without the book end scenes. It's a powerful message and reminder for our country, which is still going through its own version of the racism shown in the movie. Perhaps more subtle directing and a better 3rd act would have given this a higher score.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressed,"While not all the jokes landed, and some of the music choice for some scenes seemed out of place, Blackkklansman is an extremely good film. Each of the characters have interesting stories and arcs to keep you interested and the small segments of well crafted action kept me entertained. Blackkklansman has a very relevant message with twists and turns which keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a film that everyone should see.

Not Best Picture worthy at all,"Every year I make a point of watching each of the Best Picture nominees for the Academy Awards before the ceremony airs. And every year I'm astonished at some of the films that are considered to be the ""best"" of the previous year. 'BlacKkKlansman' is a prime example of this. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a good film? Sure. But is it a great film and one of the eight best released in 2018? Not in this lifetime. Sadly I understand a lot of politics come into the Oscars and I think that is a large part of what is at play here. This is a heavily politically driven film that tugs at the heart-strings of just the right type of people that dominate Hollywood and the Academy. For that reason it gets a nomination. Not because it is a great film.Adam Driver has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards as well. This was also a baffling one to me. His performance is good and highly watchable, but he never blew me away by any stretch of the imagination. I kept waiting for him to be given one big scene he could really shine through and knock the audiences socks off with, but it never came. A really bizarre nomination from the Academy I would find it extremely surprising if he got the win for this reason.The film was actually very similar to the 2016 film 'Imperium' starring Daniel Radcliffe. Obviously it didn't have the twist of a black man being behind the infiltration, but a lot of the actual person to person undercover scenes were very similar in nature. I think I enjoyed that film more though because it was more interested in telling you a story, instead of ramming a view down your throat. I also thought the real-life footage shown at the end of 'BlacKkKlansman' was cheap and out of place. A very tacky decision by Spike Lee to throw that in there. I miss the days from the 90s when if a film was nominated for Best Picture you could be assured it was a truly brilliant film. This film doesn't even compare to those.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Spike Lee's comedy+horror,"What makes this movie more gutting & funny at the same time is that this is a true story. The horror of those kind of acts actually happening and the laughing stock of how they fooled KKK.This movie is wonderful acted by Washington and Adam Driver. Topher Grace as David Duke was a scene stealer.Thank god Spike had a comedic/more entertaining vibe to the film, he did balanced the comedy and horror quite good. The satirical approach makes the film more accessible for the inner message to reach a boarder audience. I have no problems with minor changes to history for entertainment value.Spike didn't just let the story from a biased-political agenda, he had the Black Panther group. The confrontational scene between Patrice and Ron was well handled with great movitations shown by each character.The story is unique and exciting but I sadly saw the trailer so the excitement of discovering the movie died for me and I felt bored in the first half, as nothing new was happening. After this I decided to stop watching trailers for indie, oscar films.The end clips made me feel speechless and how to this day, the horrors exist and why we need more of these film.Compare to this years Da 5 Five Bloods, this is a more entertaining film but Da 5 Bloods has more artistic merit to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An entertaining ride through some harrowing material,"BlacKkKlansman (2018)The problem with this movie is exactly why Spike Lee made it: it is political activism. It's well made and a decent bit of storytelling with good acting and a strong underlying story. But it overtly pushes its message, and makes no effort to hide that.
But this isn't a Michael Moore documentary. This is a film based on a true story, with actors and some embellishments. And it pushes the obvious, clichés and all. It does this not only in the end and beginning, which are bookends that announce their message, but also in the story itself, by keeping it simple to the point of simplistic. Maybe that's unfair and extreme--on second viewing I realized the movie is first rate filmmaking, whatever its limitations.
If you get the story, and even if you empathize completely with the message, the effect as a movie, as a feature film out to create drama and move and shape you, this effect is flimsy and false. Yes, false even, because you know a grittier, more complicated truth must be there.
You do end up thinking of director Spike Lee's other films here, like the brilliant ""Malcolm X"" and its own historical reconstruction, or ""Do the Right Thing"" with its more fictional immersion and conviction. And this one, ""BlacKkKlansman,"" is less lyrical even though it is quite well filmed, and less moving even though built on compelling facts.
The conventional core of the movie is good (and sometimes fun and funny), with the infiltration of some KKK types (made generally caricatures to the point of being almost comic, which is a shame). However, the last scenes with all the high fives might drive you crazy, and the documentary footage will make you realize there are more penetrating things out there than the movie you just watched.
It's good, I'm glad I saw it, but it's half of what it could have been. But in truth (seeing it a second time), it's very well made and compelling. But for
Spike Lee (at his best) it ends up half of what he has pulled off in the past. Which isn't so bad at all. Watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
CONGRATULATIONS Mr Spike Lee!,"To begin with,I will sum up what Blackkklansman is about.The story is about an African-American police officer in Colorado Springs.He wants to infiltrate the KKK to collect information.This is an action movie,a drama with a bit of humor.It's made up of a romance.Ron falls in love with a beautiful student:Patrice.
So now,let's talk about the film!
It was the first time I had seen this movie and let me tell you that I will do so again !It's vert entertaining and thought-provoking movie! The script is exciting and the actor's game is excellent.I loved Ron Stallworth's performance,especially the scene when he talks on the phone with the KKK chief and he is a white man and the KKK chief says :""yeah,I know because There IS a difference when a white man speaks and when a black man speaks"".It's very funny.You can't take your eyes away from the film,all scenes are striking and eye-opening.
I do ni agree with others who say Spike Lee is a racist Man,he shows just one side of the USA it's false.It's true je campaigns for the African-American cause but it's not just for Black people,it's algo against xenephobia,anti-semitism and for minorities' rights.He only shows what really happened in the United States.it's also a burning issue these days.There are a lot of people who don't want black people and immigrants on their country.I know it's a disturbing subject but we can't say he is a racist director.He just wants to attract people's attention.

compelling story,"Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first black police officer in 1970's Colorado Springs, Colorado. He faces racism in the department and is eager to go undercover. His first assignment is to attend a speech by a former Black Panther. He starts dating Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the Black Student Union. After reading an ad in the newspaper, he calls up the KKK to apply for membership. He is readily accepted by local leader Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold) with only one problem. He can't meet Breachway face to face. He recruits Detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to be the face while he provides the voice. Eventually, he would even connect with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).Flip's infiltration into the local KKK is compelling. It seems immediately stupid that Ron continues to do the calls. It's not a carefully conceived investigation. Also the third act bombing is too conveniently staged. It needs to be more realistic and more messy. It wraps up too neatly. There are aspects that feels too artificial which detracts from the tension. The subject matter requires the movie to be more real.

"Spike Lee's perhaps most significant work after ""Malcolm X""!","Legendary director Spike Lee has steadily made movies for some 35 years but it's been a good while since he was a true household figure.Younger audiences may not even recognize the name although he was considered something of a wunderkind and pioneering black filmmaker way back in the 1980's and the first half of the 90's.Having premiered at this year's Cannes festival and received six-minute standing ovation, ""BlacKkKlansman"" has turned out to be Lee's big comeback ""joint"", and deservingly so.It's a timely and sharp overview of racism in the modern U.S. society but also a pretty damn fine intellectual comedy in its own right.Despite the controversial topics such as racial inequalities and sticking it to Ku Klux Klan, what we have here is a long and talky movie mostly free of action, graphic violence or (er) real suspense.Relying mostly on dialogue may sound like a weakness but Lee has really taken the most out of the both material and colorful cast led by promising newcomer John David ""son of Denzel"" Washington.We also have this current hot indie star Adam Driver and also probably the most interesting movie performance by Topher Grace that you will ever see.The social satire conveyed is Lee's usual but crisp indeed, including the horrifying and unexpected epilogue which kind of puts the central message in new, stronger perspective.The dialogue is sharp and there's lots of it, the cast brave and committed - in fact, it's probably one of the better ensemble movies that one may catch in cinemas this year. The comedy is in the details - how the characters move, talk, and react to situations.And last but not least, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is also a pretty cool period piece.The true events have been moved from the end of the 1970's to the beginning, which enables to add ""disco age"" color to the atmosphere, from jeans, jackets and big afro wigs to blaxploitation movies to student marches, overt racism and police violence.Lee is clearly nostalgic for these times, probably because of freshness of students being political and really trying to change the society.Then again, the central themes used here are evergreen - such as readiness to stand up for what one believes in or how belonging to groups can change one's attitudes and perspectivesBased on the ambition and depth of social criticism it dares to offer, ""BlacKkKlansman"" feels like a true event movie, sort of Lee's new ""Malcolm X"" (starring Denzel Washington).Luckily for us, the storytelling is more hip, and the movie itself shorter by a whole hour.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Occasionally heavy handed but still well worth watching,"This film is inspired by real life events in the 1970s when Ron Stallworth, an officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department, infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. Officer Stallworth is actually African American and contacted the Klan by phone so when members of the local chapter ask to meet him he has to find a white officer, in this case a non-religious Jew named Flip Zimmerman, to attend any face to face meetings while he continues the phone contact. Flip is welcomed by most of the chapter but one is highly suspicious; Ron eventually finds himself talking to, and ultimately befriending David Duke, the Klan's leader. Ron also gets involved with Patrice Dumas, a local black power advocate who distrusts the police and is in the sights of the KKK.When I first heard about this film I thought it must be a comedy; the concept sounded too crazy... then I learnt that it was inspired by true events. Like many such films plenty of liberties have been taken with the actual events but the core of the story is true; a black police officer did infiltrate the Klan. The film creates an interesting narrative; from Ron Stallworth joining the police, dealing with racism there then going undercover at a black power student meeting to joining the Klan. The story does provide many amusing moments; mostly at the expense of those that deserve to be mocked, namely the Klansmen and other racists. There is also plenty of real tension as it often looks as though Zimmerman's cover might be blown. There are times when elements of the Klan's history and historical racist incidents are discussed; most potently when a character played by Harry Belafonte tells black students about the real life lynching of a seventeen year old black boy in Texas in 1916. The central cast is solid; most obviously John David Washington and Adam Driver, who play Stallworth and Zimmerman but also those playing the Klansman; they make them believably disturbing rather than just pantomime villains. On the down side the attempts to link what happened then to events in modern America is very heavy handed; we even get an epilogue showing an admittedly terrible event; something that detracted from the main story of the film... still this wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film that is well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Joining the organisation,"BlacKkKlansman is a Spike Lee joint that is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth (John David Washington.)

One day after seeing a newspaper advert, he rings the local branch of the KKK and applies to join.Obviously as Ron is black he cannot meet the local members. So fellow undercover officer Detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) goes to the meetings but Zimmerman is Jewish. Both end up investigating radical members of the Klan who plan to wage war against the local black college student union who bought in an ex Black Panther member to speak at an event.There is a powerful cameo from Harry Belafonte telling a story of a mentally handicapped black man who was found guilty of rape on trumped up charges and was then brutally lynched. The white crowd had been whipped up by D W Griffith's movie, Birth of a Nation.Lee's film takes liberties with the actual true events. It starts off as a satirical drama. Lee however in unable to resist being heavy handed with his message and makes a few digs at President Trump and his America First policies, which Lee regards as code for supporting racism.The film benefits greatly from the performances by John David Washington and Adam Driver. However it is a little too long and uneven. The last act with the bomb did not work for me and looked contrived. It is still an interesting and enthralling film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good from all perspectives,"You watch too many movies and have act plots memorized, know every cinematography bullet they teach in college, and got an idea for how audio should be mixed? Yeah, well, this movie breaks all of that and it is such a breath of fresh air. The cinematography is dramatic, but not distracting, it's artsy without alienating the not-artsy crowd (I usually hate artsy movies), the audio mixing is level except when it it counts the most. Without spoiling, there are times a telephone rings way louder than the rest of the movie, and there's a spot where the audio becomes gradually louder and more chatoic, but you don't notice until it suddenly drops absolutely dead quiet. This movie does such an amazing job setting mood that the theater was absolutely stunned at the end. It's damn easy to follow if you're the average movie goer, but breaks a lot of conventions that'd get a sigh from a critic. I take pride in that I know how much runtime is left in a movie based on what textbook bullet point on a three or two act structure the movie is on, but because this movie didn't restrain itself to a textbook, it flows so nicely, I had no idea when the movie was gonna end, and yet I was still stunned when it did.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee's timely political movie,"""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018 release; 135 min,) brings the (true) story of Ron Stllworth. As the movie opens, we get a clip from Gone With the Wind, the famous scene where Scarlett walks among the hundreds, if not thousands of wounded soldiers, with the camera eventually catching the Confederate flag. After that, we are introduced to Ron Stallworth, an African-American interviewing for, and getting, a job on the Colorado Springs Police Department, the first African-American to do so (we are in 1974, as we see ""Re-elect Nixon"" signs). The Department is blatantly racist on many levels. After a rough start, Stallworth asks, and gets, to be assigned as an undercover cop. Then one day, he sees an ad for the local chapter of the KKK in the local newspaper, and decides to call the telephone number in the ad. Much to his surprise, he makes headway in the KKK's local chapter... At this time we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: writer-director Spike Lee has known many ups and downs in his 3+ decade career, and this surely is one of the ups. Taking an obscure fait diver from 40+ years ago (a back man infiltrating the KKK!), Lee builds it into a timely political movie about today's leadership in Washington. Yes, let's just say it: David Duke, featured prominently, is projected as a precursor of the current POTUS. ""Make America great again!"", and later ""America first"" are used in the film. If it looks a bit heavy-handed, it frankly is. The movie benefits greatly from the charming performances by its leads, John David Washington as Ron Stallworth and Adam Driver as fellow undercover cop Flip Zimmerman (and stand-in Ron Stallworth). Laura Harrier has a breakout performance as Stallworth's romantic interest. On the negative side, the movie's running time is way, way too long (by a good 20-30 min.). Yet all that said, none of this would matter if it weren't for the last 5 min. of the movie, which all brings it home so pointedly (no worries, I won't spoil). You could hear a pin drop in the theater where I saw this during the movie's conclusion...""BlacKkKlansman"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate acclaim (it won the Grand Prix), and was released wide this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED. Given the inherently controversial nature of this film, I have no idea whether this will be a box office smash, but that isn't even the main point. If you have any interest it the racial divide that exists in this country, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Too Heavy Handed,"As other reviews have said the first and last scenes of the movie shouldn't be a part of the movie. The movie is a reflection of today's politics through the lens of yesteryear. However, the first and last scenes hammer home a singular perspective rather than the more complex reality the rest of the movie reflects.The issue isn't as simple as white supremacists are bad and still present. Which is pretty much all those scenes say. It is not just one sided. There are the white supremacists, and there is ANTIFA...they are opposite sides of the same coin. The messages might be polar opposites, the attitudes, intolerance, and adhesion to nonsensical dogma is the same.I felt there were some key scenes that showed how similar the two opposing groups in the film were. Particularly when the female lead calls Ron ""the enemy"" in the end because he is a cop, when in fact he accomplishes far more in regards to her goals than the entire organization she runs. She is narrow minded, inflexible, and unable to see the reality of what he has accomplished.The entire concept that intolerance isn't unidirectional is completely obliterated by those first and last scenes, where it forces a one sided perspective. Racism isn't a one way street. Intolerance and hate for people that are different isn't just something one side does. The people on the far left, and the far right are the same kind of people, they just hold opposing views.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist?,"NO SPOILERS!But seriously can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist? FIRST! I did like acting power from most of the cast (really good job), it was filmed in appealing style, and it had its funny moments.So why 5 stars?1. Biggest reason is how this movie was adverted. I went to cinema with absolute different vibe and expectations and because of that I could not enjoy movie right after 15-20 min when I felt it isn't what it tried to sell me. 
2. Movie did not bring anything new to the table. It has solid (really good) acting, but it seemed like I'm watching cut-scenes from different movies and put together.
3. It has bad mix between comedy and serious parts. Maybe jokes are too rare or to plain, but it makes you struggle to understand what was directors intentions? 
4. End scenes (this is kinda spoiler, so will not say what was in it) felt really biased and ruined last bits of movie, because it felt too much out of place. It made me feel like all what trailers wanted is me to spend my money and see end scenes of directors views.I don't mind more political movies, but I felt tricked and movie itself wasn't that good.I don't want to spoil movie, so I would have more to say, but then it goes in discussion of certain scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Adam Driver a confirmation that gives us an exceptional performance,"A film that shines for elegance and balance, a mature work that represents a happy sum of Spike Lee's poetics",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
BlacKkKlansman (2018),"BlacKkKlansman centers around the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated and exposed a Colorado chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970's. John David Washington and Adam Driver (who portray Ron and his partner) both deliver exceptional performances as officers who must navigate the hatred and cruelty of the Klan first-hand. Directed by Spike Lee, the film also deserves praise for its ability to balance several genres and shifting tones - from gritty drama to black comedy (and even a bit of Blaxploitation thrown in for good measure).We're almost 40 years removed from the actual events of BlacKkKlansman, yet the film is possibly more politically relevant today - and the screenwriters are intent to make sure you realize that. The script, which is politically-charged and has a lot of truth to speak regarding America's historic and persistent issues with race relations, repeatedly seems more interested in making the political point, than telling a story that makes the political point. BlacKkKlansman is eye-opening and thought-provoking - but for a medium whose ""golden rule"" is ""show, don't tell,"" the film simply too often relies on the later approach.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strong 4 // Goes down easy but sits in the stomach like a rock,"A genuinely disturbing exploration of racism in America disguised as buddy cop comedy. Don't let the trailers fool you, this is a fiercely political film that does not shy away from the horror of its central theme. And though I squirmed many more times than I laughed, BlacKkKlansman manages to entertain as much as it unsettles. Spike Lee smartly chose 70's blaxploitation as the framework for the film which enabled him to inject some levity into a subject that could've otherwise been harrowing and indigestible. With that framework, he has crafted a film which is equally playful and disquieting, one which is able to joke about the absurdity of racism in America all while impressing upon the viewer how far from a joke this really is. Some may call the ending cheap and sensationalist, but it undeniably pulls the rug out and forces you to simmer in the harshness of reality. It's a film that goes down easy only to linger in your stomach like a rock.Strong 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting New Spike Lee Joint,"Spike Lee has returned with the thoughtful and intensely relevant ""BlacKkKlansman,"" a drama about an African-American police officer in Colorado Springs attempting to infiltrate a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. The film uses a wide variety of common motifs in Spike Lee's films that enhance the story and the viewing experience considerably. Such motifs include deeply topical social commentary and analysis on the nature of racism and hatred, clever homages to other films of the time period (especially Blaxploitation films,) and a variety of visual tricks to help direct the viewer's attention to what is most important in the scene. The story moves along quickly and thoroughly, and its use of characterization is generally well-planned. Ron Stallworth is a charismatic and generally well-developed lead character, and most of the film's major supporting characters all serve unique purposes akin to the plot. The only possible weak link in the cast is Topher Grace as David Duke. While he does not give a bad performance, his portrayal of the infamous KKK leader can sometimes feel rather tepid at times.Some might say that the film could have been enhanced by generally not reducing its depiction of KKK members to primarily cartoon stereotypes, but I would argue that this depiction actually helps Lee's greater point about the true nature of the Klan. Lee is trying to portray that their cataclysmic ignorance and buffoonishness breeds their insidious racism. The film's script includes a lot of current political commentary, which generally feels well-placed but can sometimes feel too on-the-nose or predictable. The film's story is engaging and entertaining, but does contain some cliches and relatively formulaic elements. Deeply disturbing real-world images and materials are effectively used by Lee to help synthesize the film's structure. The film's tonal shifts between comedy and dark drama do not feel poorly planned at all, although some could say they are a bit jarring. While it isn't Spike Lee's best, this is still a solid and highly thought-provoking film that should definitely please Lee's fans. Recommended. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Trumploitation,"Spike Lee has an engaging dramatic-license-taken, based-on-a-true-story with ""BlacKkKlansman,"" of an undercover operation led by a black police officer to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan, and it's ripe for making into a subtle critique of the current Trump presidency and continued violence, including by law enforcement, against African Americans, but subtle Lee is not and, instead, the blunt polemic is hammered into our heads. There's also a nice concurrent theme concerning the mainstream Hollywood white-supremacist epics ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) and ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) contrasted with early-1970s blaxploitation films, of which Lee's film aptly borrows much of its style.I thought ""The Post"" (2017) was too obvious in its paralleling a Nixon-era narrative with current events, but ""BlacKkKlansman"" could've benefited from even that level of understatedness. On one hand, the opening sequence is rather good at connecting all of the threads, with clips from the aforementioned 1915 and 1939 films being projected during the making of Klan propaganda-- the hate speech being delivered by none other than ""Saturday Night Live"" Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin. But, then, the film continues to make certain no member of the audience is left behind in understanding the message. There's the joke that America would never elect a David Duke type, although that was the only part of this rather satirically-approached picture that received a laugh from the audience I was in. The historical events are pushed back to coincide with Nixon's 1972 Southern strategy. And, finally, there's the epilogue of real footage from the 2017 Charlottesville protests and car attack and President Trump's much-criticized remarks thereafter. It's too much.The cinematic allusions aren't exactly subtle, either, but I think they're sometimes executed better. Although there's a conversation between the lovers debating their favorite blaxploitation flicks, this film also incorporates the genre into its style, including by actually being a film photographed on film. I especially like the brief disco scene, which is energetically compiled. I haven't seen much blaxploitation fare, but of the ones I've seen, they tend to include musical nightclub interruptions to the plot. They also contain scenes where the characters debate opposing sides of the approaches of African Americans to white-dominated America, whether to fight injustices from outside or to reform from within, especially regarding law enforcement. This one does the same thing, including one man becoming a city's first black cop, who, then, poses as white to expose the Klan and another cop, who's Jewish, ""passing"" in predominantly-Christian white America and acting anti-Semitic to infiltrate the same Organization. Similarly, they earlier go undercover at a Black Panther speech by Stokely Carmichael.Unfortunately, Lee's anti-racist polemic can't entirely escape the kind of filmic rhetoric that has underpinned so much of Hollywood cinema all the way back to the racist pomposity of ""The Birth of a Nation."" Just as in the film, the black student union's ""black power"" slogan forms a sound bridge with the ""white power"" chant of the Klan. While surely not hoping for the sort of hooting and hollering of the Klansmen at the racist caricatures of white actors in blackface of the screening of the 1915 film within this film, it may be expected that supporters cheer the message of ""BlacKkKlansman"" just as audiences once roared for the KKK racing to the rescue in the climax of its predecessor. More interesting and likely more successfully than whether this affects the political and racial issues in America is whether Lee has changed the course from within of the white-dominated movie business. It's the Organization he's been infiltrating for some time now.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lee is a master of entertaining film and racial realism. Thiis is no exception.,"In the '70's race relations were détente at best, nowhere better exemplified than by the Colorado Springs Police Department, where black Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) was a detective. Not just any detective, for the true story of his infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan is smartly re-created by acclaimed director Spike Lee in BlacKkKlansman.Lee opens with a claim that sets his wide-ranging tone: ""Based on Some Fo' Real, Fo' Real."" His subsequent illustration with D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind, however, shows that the deeply serious subject of BlacKkKlansman is racial terrorism.The biography and satire are best at showing the racism still prevalent at that time, especially the Klan's fervid hatred of Jews and blacks. The infiltration of the Klan is uniquely pulled off by splitting up Stallworth into his white phone voice and in person using the white Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to substitute for Stallworth.When Lee uses Alec Baldwin to play a pro-segregation narrator who keeps fumbling and forgetting his lines, Lee is at his best with trenchant satire going down easily with a bit of humor. In some ways, this film approaches the brilliance of Lee's Do the Right thing.Lee, who inherited this project from Jordan Peele, keeps the action moving, as if it were a top cop show in the '70's with low-key humor and slow revelations accompanied by crisp performances and an air of professionalism. Most notably toward the end are Lee's obvious references to current authoritarian, racist administrators at the highest levels of society.The claim by one character that the level of bigotry and racism would never happen again received chuckles from our audience. Yet, more seriously from Mr. Lee himself:
""We are living in pure undiluted sanity. Families are being stripped apart, kids put in cages, that's going back to our ancestors being broken up and sold. That's the world we live in.""",,Anonymous,Biography

John David Washington and Adam Driver deliver standout performances in this gripping tale of infiltration and racial tension. The film editing keeps the tension high as the story unfolds, with Spike Lee's signature style enhancing the narrative's impact. Its strength lies in its thought-provoking exploration of racism and the power of unity, offering a message that resonates in our times. The music, a mix of '70s classics and Terence Blanchard's evocative score, adds depth, and the cinematography captures the era's social and political turbulence. ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a potent reminder of the need to confront hatred and injustice, a testament to the courage of those who fight for what's right, and my liking for it is as strong as the film's call for change.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One of a kind, Spike Lee has still got it!","When it comes to films related to/about the Ku Klux Klan, it's an odd mix. From the earliest days of cinema, you had blatantly racist propaganda films such as 'Birth Of A Nation' - footage of which is shown in this film. Then to the 80s you had the controversial and apparent good-natured however very flawed thriller 'Mississippi Burning' - especially in its tone and message. And since then, you've had such things as the new all-black cast remake of 'Birth Of A Nation' which put the story correctly. However - from my point of view - you have never had a film about the KKK as strange and varied as this one.Of course, it's not going to be like any other film you've seen, because it's not a film. It's a joint, which means Spike Lee is behind the camera, and most of the time, that means something brilliant is going to happen. And in this case, it does.The film, set in the early 70s', loosely tells the true story of Ron Stallworth (played brilliant both comically and dramatic by John David Washington), a black detective in Chicago who pretends to be a white man to try and infiltrate the KKK, and to do so, gets his colleague and friend, Flip (played by Adam Driver) to go undercover as the white 'Ron Pearlman' and join the Klan. And while this plot may sound somewhat like a 'high concept idea' it becomes something much more complex and scary.Towards the start of the film, Spike gently pulls our attention towards the story, with the laugh out loud humour and mocking of the Klan, making us developed and entertained, and making his central characters likeable. But slowly, as the films real messages start to unreavel we realise this isn't a comedy. However, it also isn't a drama. It's both, and the idea of the comedy and drama going back and forth, putting you in an awkward and nervous position on when to laugh and when not to laugh, works very well. Sitting in a fairly crowded cinema, I didn't know when to laugh and when to cry, and how other people in the audience would react.Another thing that works very well is the films style. The film is shot like an early 70s' blackpoitation film, such as 'Super Fly' or 'Shaft' both of which are mentioned and referenced to in the film. Because of this, we hear a lot of funky 70s music, and we see light disco visuals, reminding of us of the style in 'Boogie Nights'. And this idea of 70s nostalgia is highlighted in a nightclub towards the start of the movie, shared by Ron, and his love interest - and also very well written complex character - Patrice.And all of this style, substance and story is brought to life by the cast, who manage to balance the humour, drama and everything in-between brilliantly, at times making it all the more fun, and at others, making it much more scary and alarming.But none of this would matter if it didn't really mean something. If it didn't have something dark and political to leave on our minds. Of course, it's a Spike Lee joint, so it's going to have some relevance today. And my god, does it. Yes it does! I was in tears in the final part of the movie, which, after laughing and smiling with these characters, racism still goes on, and one person won't change that. It takes a lot to change racism, and no matter how much we can laugh at the racist idiots, the KKK are still out there. And that message really leaves a massive impact on you as a viewer. It's a film where you don't want the lights to fade up, because your not sure what to say or how to feel, and a film like that comes very rarely. And that's why, truely why, BlackkKlansman is one of the best films of the year. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A solid Spike Lee joint (even if it could have been better),"Here's the thing: it is possible for me to say that this movie works, that this Spike Lee joint is his best in a while, that it is both funny and powerful...but still think it could have been a little better. That's where I am. The movie's great as a broadly comedic satire with a political edge, and its many homages to film (from blaxploitation to D.W. Griffith) feel on point and at home here. More importantly, Lee brilliantly leverages a 1970s tale to shine a light on what's happening around us right now. So what could be better? Well, that light is REALLY bright. This is not a subtle political satire. At all. Typical Spike, basically. Also, the plot's pacing leaves something to be desired. And the characters sometimes seem a bit less than real. In fact, it is kind of funny that a movie inspired by a true story is most challenged by a lack of realism. But there you are. Still, Lee adapts this tale brilliantly. It is funny and exciting and insightful, especially as an examination of self identity. Just because it is flawed doesn't mean it isn't great.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie you have to like to not be called a racist?,"I'm not white or black, and I'm not American. I guess this allows me to see the film in a very neutral, unbiased perspective, and to judge it based on its own merits rather than the political issues surrounding it.When I watched the trailer, my impression was that the movie was going to be hilarious, probably a subtle, lighter take on a heavy subject, with a strong ending that sends the right message to the audience. That was my expectation of the movie. Since it also ended up as a nominee for Best Picture at the Oscar, I expected a really good, solid movie that deals with the subject of racism in a unique, creative way. Instead, what I got was a dragging movie full of cliches, uninspired dialogues, and in-your-face message before the credits rolled.I was left underwhelmed and very disappointed. Not only that the movie was such a drag, I didn't like how one-sided and stereotypical it was. I think the reason this is so highly rated is because people are so afraid of being labeled ""racist"" for not liking the movie. That, and the political views that it projects, some people want their views to be validated. Pardon me, I'm a person of color and I didn't enjoy the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Timely Film from Spike Lee,"Perfect timing for release with the craziness with the POTUS and the White House. Has enough ""comedy"" to make it fun for such a serious topic.

Kkklantastic...no? I'll go on.,"This movie is not for everyone due to the amount of grotesque language, but is highly educational and entertaining. Denzel Washington's son John David has already established himself as an up-and-comer and sounds just like his pa! He has some of that same charismatic charm that we love, and I hope to see him again in other movies. Adam Driver did a good job playing the hard nose cop who has some problems of his own, and he really showed passion. Topher Grace was good as KKK leader David Duke, and his conversations with Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) were some of the best parts of the movie. This movie has a unique blend of comedy and drama, and doesn't have any sex, and barely any violence. I sometimes didn't know when to laugh or not, but some of the things they say are hilarious yet scary because there are actually ignorant people like that in real life!

"Funny, Unique, Sad and Heavy","This was my first Spike Lee film ever and I am nothing short of astonished by his work here. The true yet uniquely told story about a black man infiltrating the KKK. John David Washington and Adam Driver deliver stellar and riveting performances to each of their characters, the chemistry between these two is truly a spectacle to watch. The plot mixes between comedy and drama but do not believe that the dark themes are overshadowed by the well written screenplay, there are definitely some very serious moments, especially during the end of the film where they show actual events happening today reminding us that humanity hasn't changed in the slightest. The cinematography done in the film was greatly executed, you can tell each scene was carefully shot and tells you that this was obviously not a cash-grab because of it's theme and heavy subject although it is presented in a lighthearted manner, you can see that this was a passion project with Spike Lee wanting to deliver a reminder of how today's world isn't so different to how it was back then. My only gropes with this film is that it tends to drag scenes longer than it should making it a little bit long and at times kind of boring, and it also has a theme that was pretty nice the first few times it played until you realize it keeps playing throughout the entire thing, it got really annoying. Overall, great directing, performances, camerawork and fresh storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strong Story With Some Issue Politics,"I enjoyed the movie, not sure what it was about, but it was good entertainment. Everyone was a hater and every ""ism"" and ""ist"" was present.Everyone was so equally incompetent the inherent comedy and juxtaposition of apple pie and explosives was great fun. Fundamentally it was an american story that had no transferability.I loved the fro's, the fashion, the cars, the cinematography, the lighting and the tight script, throughout it was fine acting.If there was a theme over and above the story on screen, it was perhaps the dangers that come with any blind sort of identity politics. If there was meant to be some parallels with the now I couldn't see any, subtlety is lost on me.The strange footage at the beginning and end of the movie was a strange interjection that had little to do with the movie and was just an unnecessary distraction",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Thoroughly enjoyable, a bit of a must-see","Some websites describe BlacKkKlansman as a drama, some as a comedy, some as both. It is funny at times, yet for all the wrong reasons, as we watch a predominantly white police force begrudgingly help a black detective infiltrate the KKK and thwart a fiendish, if inept, plot.Some have criticized the message as too heavy-handed, but how can that be given the final scenes which jump forty years ahead to documentary footage from the Charlottesville protests and the horrific vehicular homicide?The pernicious question is whether it is best to fight for your civil rights from without or from within the government, because it seems impossible, at least in movie terms, to do both at the same time without sacrificing some ideals along the way. Can you be a part of the system that oppresses but use it to defeat itself, or are you simply another cog in a machine, allowed to play a small role to claim unlasting gains now and then?Does Adam Driver act? He could be portraying Kylo Ren again, given the narrow ranges of his performances. Was David Duke as milquetoast as Topher Grace's phone voice suggests?Fortunately for our hero, the KKK is comprised of a bunch of drunk, hateful, and ignorant idiots. Naturally, it is the white people who swoop in to save the day, leaving a lasting impression that black power is simply what white power allows.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Powerfull!,"Spike Lee is one of the most remarkable directors of the decade, independent of your political posture it is undeniable that his works have highlighted minorities and racial issues, he is the main voice of a movement, and that is a hell of a thing to do! That said, while personally I disagree with the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement in the present, I enjoyed a lot this picture, there is so much to tell about it: Let's start with the trivials, the editing was marvellous, you can easily detect a music motif, but out of that, the scenes were all so cleanly orchestrated, the story was smooth and credible; the film was comical, everyone at the cinema were loosing their asses at a couple of scenes (I would mention some examples, but I'd rather not to avoid spoilers), but much more acknowledgeable is the fact that the movie is capable of building tension and creating suspense when necessary, but also has the hability to loose and be funny at times. It's immersive, powerfull, very straight-forward with its intentions, it's beautiful to watch and although it's not too partial (politically, I mean) it makes some breathtaking parallels, it's filled with smart simbolism, and it's definitely one must-watch tape of the 2018",,Anonymous,Biography
"An interesting movie, really representative of the truth.","On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd rate this movie a 7 because I found it really representative and well played.

Somehow, it's a sentimental movie and that's why I liked it. I have to admit that it was a true to life, realistic & moving movie, but I particulary loved those real videos shown at the end of the movie. It was fascinating and disturbing at the same time, because it's just striking. The plot focuses on the infiltration of a man in the KKK, a very courageous man.

Blackkklansmen somehow oozes 'cool' while at the same time grappling with America's tense racial politics. It's a nice time capsule to the hip 1970's but still makes jokes about current events.

Sadly over-the-top,Spike Lee must be cash-strapped to make a movie these days as he obviously had to pander to certain elements to get this farcical adaptation onto the screen.

Amazing,Amazing how a period piece can resonate so profoundly today.,,Anonymous,Biography
A very good story that is weakened by Lee's insistence on preaching,"There's two sides to BlacKkKlansman.One is a fantastic period thriller, where a pioneering black detective works with white colleagues to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan.The other is a heavy handed political statement from Spike Lee.The first side is really good. Based on a true story, it feels authentic to its period, has great performances from John David Washington and Adam Driver, and builds tension expertly. You get a real sense of the risks the police face by getting so close to the rag-tag group of local Klan members, whose lack of organisation only serves to make them more dangerous.A few parts of the story feel rushed - Washington's whirlwind romance with a student activist feels too much like a plot device, and the climactic action sequence takes a few liberties with space and time - but these don't really detract from what is, at heart, an impactful story about racism and prejudice in the United States.Which begs the question of why Spike Lee felt it was necessary to include the flip side - several polemical and preachy sequences that hammer the same point home?The audience is smart enough to know that the film is critical of racism. It didn't need the extra content that makes it explicit. Aside from the post-credits footage of violence at marches in 2017, there is also a speech on lynchings in the early 20th century, and a couple of sequences that are dedicated to celebrating black culture of the 1970s.There is nothing wrong with this kind of content. But it belongs in a documentary. It doesn't benefit BlacKkKlansmann the feature film. And it's Lee's lack of confidence in the impact of the film on its own that actually ends up reducing its impact even more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Beauty,"I sit across the fence (border) from America, and do my best to avoid Americana movies that expose the wretchedness of the human condition. It feels like an assault on my maxim of inherent goodness (naive comes to mind). Perhaps, I don't want to be reminded in a leisurely evening. It seems, rather hypocritically of me, that America 'owns' every conceivable nightmare imaginable. Yet, I find myself, yet again, surprised by the depths we plumb. This may be just another movie on the struggle of racial equality and horrors observed, but Spike Lee manages to wrap it up in a story, that seems patently absurd and tacitly comedic. The silliness and stupidity of folks will never wash away humanities failings. Yet, is true, as non fiction movies go. I'm telling you, after watching this movie, I want to disown my membership card in the human race. The movie might take liberties with the truth, but not with reality.

Certainly, Spike Lee has held his grudge against ""white"" America for his entire career and has used the film medium as a way to express his opinion through transparent characters and generic stereotypes (SEE: Sal's Pizzeria in ""Do the Right Thing"") .

Lost potential.,Obviously going into this movie it was going to have a political message. And obviously this message was going to draw some parallels with modern day.

However in that film the plot had more of an opportunity to push its message. Blackkklansman doesn't have the same luxury but it acts as if it does.

Shocking and Beautiful,"This movie is great at what it sets out to do: provide a comedic, interesting story on a black man infiltrating the KKK, while also providing a strong message saying that some of this hate we've seen throughout the movie isn't gone yet. 
While I do think this movie has a few pacing issues around the middle of the film, the denouement and ending are both fantastic, and are well worth sitting through some dragging scenes. John David Washington is fantastic in this movie, and also Adam Driver. Driver plays a character who is trying to play a character of someone that would support the KKK, and this is just another great performance on his growing resume of acting. 
Like I've said before, the ending is amazing, and I won't spoil it for you, but you could hear a pin drop when the credits rolled in my screening.

"Deep, smart, powerful, funny and emotionally investing, BlacKkKlansman is a triumph","Movies about the darkest parts of history are difficult to pull off. In the era of Trump, Hollywood has started to focus on race and politics more than ever, with the likes of Get Out, The Purge, The Death of Stalin, Detroit and so on. BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee's latest 'joint' (his stylised possessory credit), explores messages, social commentary, themes and ideas as deep as possible. Not a second is wasted on what it's trying to say, while its engrossing storyline is told with sweeping energy, creative freedom and emotion. I haven't seen race and racism displayed so effectively in cinema for a very long time.The movie centres around the true story on the racist troubles of Ku Klux Klan during the 1970's. The police service of Coronado Springs attempts to take them down with the help of a young African-American named Ron Stallworth, the first in the department.Punctured by a smart screenplay by David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, Charlie Wachtel and Lee, Lee's approach to the event clearly shows his vision wasn't interfered by an uncompromising bankable studio. Cinematographer Chayse Irvin wisely chose to shoot on 35mm and 16mm film, creating a serious old-school 70's vibe where at times characters are slightly out of focus and the sunlight is overexposed due to the sensitivity of the film stock. Wes Anderson-like techniques are frequently present here, with closeups of images that fill the screen, quick pans, dolly shots that go from character to character (especially in one scene) and a few beautiful dreamlike shots that unintentionally pay homage to Bohemian Rhapsody. This is what sets the film apart from others, adding a scoop of creative juice within the storytelling.John David Washington's first acting role, son of Denzil, is a knockout. He really digs deep into the psychology of Stallworth and nails it onscreen. In his big break from playing Kylo Ren between 2017's The Last Jedi and Episode IX in 2019, Adam Driver puts on another great performance as Flip Zimmerman, with his laid back presence lighting up every scene he's in. Topher Grace's career has officially been revived with this movie after going out of the spotlight since Spider-Man 3. He somehow fits into the role of David Duke with his talent to be serious and ends up being taken as comedic.There are a few fizzles along the way. Lee's ability to occasionally break the 180-degree rule for effect and use multiple shots on a single action can come across as jarring. Sometimes Barry Alexander Brown's editing from scene-to-scene are blink-and-you'll-miss-it transitions, jumping to the next stage way too fast.Besides these issues, the whole thing flows pretty well. I don't think we'll seeing anything as satisfying as this in a very long time. One of the best films of 2018.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"a movie with potential, but destroyed by the director","The story of the movie is very good, but the way it was filmed was disturbing!

Politics,"I was looking forward to Klansman, it had an interesting premise and could have been a funny, well written comedic satire. Unfortunately that potential was thrown away when Spike Lee took the original events and tryed to spin it to confirm his own political views.Now don't get me wrong it's perfectly fine if you want to make a movie with a political message, but if you do so you should at least make sure the dialogue is well written, so that it feels as though it's a character speaking and not the director. But apparently Spike Lee doesn't understand this which has resulted in most of the characters just being Spike Lee himself.Another big issue I had was the jokes seemed to get old really fast. This was because most of them amounted to ""Ha Ha he's actually black"" or ""Look at how stupid these white people are"".The movie was also incredibly bland as far as the cinematography goes, as most shots were just shot reverse shot. Almost nothing visually interesting happened at all, until the end. But at that point the shots were just so bland and uninteresting it just felt forced.The one plus side in my opinion would be the performances, because although the dialogue is not well written the actors do a great job delivering their lines with sincerity. Especially Adam Driver, but overall this film was just a boring, poorly written mess.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

an engaging biographical story from director Spike Lee,"Ron Stallworth is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department during the early 1970s. Unhappy with his minute initial assignment but still determined to do his job, he's transferred to the intelligence division where he tries to pull off the daring task of infiltrating a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. Despite how far-fetched it may seem, this is actually inspired by true events (though some obvious artistic liberties are taken) and naturally Spike Lee uses this as a platform to try injecting some of his own political propaganda, but it's a fascinating story with fine performances, invigorating dialogue, and much more humor than you'd expect from a film with this type of subject matter. A solid all-around showing, with effective performances from Washington--yes, he's the son of Denzel--and Adam Driver. ***",,Anonymous,Biography
It is OK but obviously bias.,"The acting is superb, and the whole cast does an excellent job, but the story leaves something to be desired.It is going to be difficult maintaining balance when making a film based on a person's subjective interpretation of events, and bias within the story and directing is evident.The 'Black Panthers' get a very cursory mention yet they were embedded in the black student movement of the 70s, and were as equally idiotic and prejudice as the Klan. Perhaps covering their involvement would have given more reasoning to the black characters motivations and views of the time.It's not a bad film, but it is far from a true reflection of race conflicts in the 70s - which is a time I remember well.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

As in pretty much everything, Adam Driver is exhilarating to watch and John David Washington tows the line very well between comedy and also expressing the severity of the situation. The only reason this film doesn't achieve a higher rating for me is because sometimes its choices of humour don't always hit the mark and i feel the villains performances are slightly 2 dimensional meaning the fear of them being able to outwit Driver and Washington is lost throughout the film.

There are also some pretty good edgy jokes but it's well brought and not embarrassing at all !But in my opinion the bad point of the movie is that there is a kind of victimization that is making white people like they were all racist but it's okay it's just me I think about racism too much.

Everyday human beings doing the extraordinary,"BlacKkKlansman tells the story of Ron Stallworth, the first African-American undercover agent for the Colorado Springs Police Department as he infiltrates the infamous Ku Klux Klan back in the '70s. Not bad for someone that was originally hired to be the poster boy of the CSPD's effort to diversify. Starring John David Washington (son of THE Denzel W.) and Adam Driver (HBO's Girls, Star Wars), we follow them as they take on the dangerous task of finding out if a known hate group with a massive reach and resources has really reformed or is still out for blood for the sole purpose of ""making America great again.""The movie is very timely considering what's happening in the US: racism has become mainstream again, rising from the shadows from whence they were banish forth. If you think about it, it's true when George Santayana said that 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' Here we are 50 years later, white supremacy is rearing it's ugly head once again. Depending on which side of the narrative you are, you will feel disgust as the poisonous hate and the creative ways the whites spew like they own the world are never-ending, or if you are a white supremacist you will feel disgust among your colleagues for having been fooled by a tandem of cops, one is Black rookie and the is a non-practicing Jew.Comparable to last year's The Post, and 2015's Spotlight, BlacKkKlansman will give you your fix of normal, everyday human beings doing the extraordinary in the service of humanity even at the risk of their own life. The difference is amidst taking on a serious and heavy topic, director Spike Lee made sure to put some needed humor so we don't choke on the urgency of what message the movie is trying to convey. I mean if you really think about it, it's not that hard to make fun of those that are so full of themselves they honestly believe they can do no wrong, thinking highly of themselves as the chosen race when the rest of the world looks at them like a joke that write itself (insert Pelosi clapping at Trump.) If anything, I realized sometimes you really have to see destruction first because from there, only better things will come. If from all this hate and death we will see another Marthin Luther King Jr. rise from the ashes or Obama become a world leader again, maybe it will make it all worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great film if you want to watch something informative and entertaining.,"Based on a true story, I watched the Spike Lee Joint Blackkklansman. The movie is about a black man played by John David Washington infiltrating the KKK. The movie starts with Washington's character Ron Stallworth being the first black officer hired to the police department in Colorado spring. He is later given the task of infiltrating the KKK and the Black Panther. He and his partner played by Adam driver becomes one person as Ron voices the Ron used to join the KKK and his partner plays the actual in-person Ron. It's interesting because they're both placed in a situation that may have comprised their loyalty to the police department and their case. Worth mentioning, there is a scene where Ron Stallworth is mentioning an officer on the force who killed an unarmed black kid and when asked why the force keeps him around he was told ""they're a family and we stick together, right or wrong, we stick together"" Ron replied ""that reminds me of another group"" if that doesn't make you think. I will say your ear will burn from the use of racial, ethnic and homophobic slurs so if you're sensitive you may want to consider not watching. The film was very entertaining and informative although it would have been nice to get some action movie type action; it wasn't that type of movie. I commend spike lee on retelling this story and putting that reality in art at the end.

Spike Lee strikes gold in fierce sociopolitical satire,"Spike Lee has always been a refreshingly brazen filmmaker; with movies like Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X, the director is not one to shy away from political statements all delivered with distinct style and zest. The same is true of Lee's latest film, the creatively helmed BlacKkKlansman, a fictionalised telling of the memoir of black Colorado cop, Ron Stallworth and his risky infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan. Here, Spike Lee is at his best, painting an enticing tonal mix of humour and horror that feels all too topical.
Son of Denzel, John David Washington stars as Stallworth, the so-called ""Jackie Robinson of the Colorado Springs Police Department"" and the first black officer. Ron's ethnic background makes him the man for an undercover mission spying on black activist Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), as he excites the city's discontented African-American community. Soon enough, however, Ron is caught up at the other end of the racial spectrum as he and partner Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) attempt to infiltrate their local chapter of the KKK by posing as a budding white supremacist. It's a life-risking double act as Flip becomes the ""face"" of Ron Stallworth, as the real Ron rises the ranks through incidental phone calls with KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).
BlacKkKlansman is a film that presents racism in an interesting way, almost as a dichotomy between the ridiculous and threatening. The script is a genius work, jolting along with the speed of a bullet between moments of almost absurdist comedy to those of darker truth. A particularly good example is that of a racist couple cosying up to one another in bed, dreamily discussing their plans for homemade terrorism. This is a film where white supremacy is served with cheese and crackers and social commentary is accompanied by bizarre humour. Lee does a superb job of balancing these tones, catching the laughs in one's throat within a net of horror. This clashing approach continues throughout the film, even into Terence Blanchard's innovative score, which jumps from the safety of strings to impassioned guitar riffs.
Washington and Driver are two very-well cast leads; the former's delightfully dry yet nuanced performance allows the film to stay grounded. Driver's performance is equally captivating; in many ways, Flip has the scarier side of the job, having to meet the members of the Klan face to face hoping they believe the caricature and stay masked to his Jewish heritage. An opening cameo by Trump-impersonator himself, Alec Baldwin reminds one of the trenchant relevance of Lee's film; the costume design and jukebox soundtrack lend it all the authenticity of a 70s period piece, but the inclusion of Trumpist slurs, ironic asides and a heart wrenching final sequence remind us that BlacKkKlansman is very much a film for today. There are points where the film seems a little too self-aware, but perhaps it is intended to be; from the profane tagline right to the end credits, Lee is truly in control of his craft and the message he wants to put forward. Performances by Washington and Driver are brilliant and credit is due to Get Out's Jordan Peele for the pitch, but the real star here is Spike Lee. With BlacKkKlansman, the director returns to form with satire as it should be; sickeningly hilarious, yet equally as shocking and, most of all, with something important to say.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Blackkklansman (2018),"This retelling of a most jaw-dropping police investigation ticks many boxes - namely those for artistry, roundedness and tonal consistency. It engaged me early, with the apathetic and blasé persona of our central protagonist something I found incredibly attractive. His take on the KKK presence (which is advertised briefly in the trailer) never seems to tire, though the film by no means relied on this for its appeal. In fact, most of the characters (including those involved with the KKK) were well developed and believable. That said, I have a few issues with this film. Firstly, there is a romance that I did not care a lick about and seemed to be included for relief from the central plot. I found myself feeling irritated whenever it cut away to this subplot, as it felt like there was way more they could be doing to flesh out the cop - KKK cat and mouse aspect. Another big problem, perhaps the biggest one, was the political newsreel tacked onto the end. Throughout, I'd lauded their objectivity, which steered clear of commenting on the grotesqueness of the KKK and their activities. I'm not saying the KKK should be respected or anything, just that their malevolence goes without saying, really. Well, they broke cuff right before the credits rolled. The montage, which I'll try not to spoil too much, basically ended up saying something along the lines of ""the KKK is a movement at large in the USA and one that our current president endorses openly and stridently"". I am not a Trump supporter, but I don't think revealing your political views right before the curtains were drawn does a lot to help you. For me, it destroyed any trust I had accrued in the filmmakers. Was everything I just witnessed refracted through a political lens? I know this is a little pedantic, but it left me with a sour taste in my mouth.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Mediocre at best,"I do appreciate the historical value that some good movies are able to provide while at the same time also combining quality cinematography with superb acting performances through the portrayal(s) of historical figures. But this film does not provide a balance between fine acting and historical documentation. No, what this film provides in my humble opinion is a very left leaning political message.Adding insult to the intelligence of the producers/directors intended audience is the fact that the film also included actual film footage from the August 2017 clash between white nationalists and counter protesters and how each party blamed one another and the police for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va. I am not objecting to the actual footage included at the end of this film, only that it displays an obvious clear bias that one party is racist and violent and that this film only encourages the continuation of hate amongst races based on either the color of one's skin and or choice of religious faith.As for the acting in this film Adam Driver's performance stood out, but I was less than impressed with either Topher Grace's role as the Grand Klansman David Dukes, or by John David Washington's performance as Ron Stallworth, an undercover cop. But what I was most disappointed with was the screenplay itself which was so one-sided that the audience was expected to believe that the civil rights movement origin was formed by the Walt Disney Mickey Mouse Club.For Spike Lee to receive an Academy Award for best Director, the year 2018 must have been a very lousy year in the entire film industry. The Academy members were obviously attempting to appease one group for the previous year's/decades of exclusion of the top awards but I expected to see much more from a film that received six (6) Academy nominations. Instead, all I gleaned is frustration from another film in a long line of politically motivated films that wreak with a one-sided view of a suppressed society. I don't call this entertainment at all. This film's only success may be in re-energizing the continuing divide amongst the nation.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

BlacKkKlansman Review,"BlacKkKlansman is a film co-written and directed by Spike Lee. The acclaim surrounding this film along with it being in the Oscars compelled me to watch the film. After watching it, I can say that this film is pure entertainment.Plot: Follows Ron Stallworth, a police detective in the Colorado Spring PD and his attempt to infiltrate the local Ku Klux Klan.Story and direction: To be very honest, I haven't watched most of Spike Lee's ventures except for INSIDE MAN which to me was quite a different kind of thriller. So watching this film for me I had no expectations whatsoever. But having said that I was mesmerized by the sheer brilliance this film had. Each and every frame had a uniqueness and beauty in it. I am not saying that the film is perfect, but it was great to watch. The writing of the film is so intelligent that in scenes of tension they introduce certain things that make it a delight to watch. The subtle comedy is to watch out for and I can understand many people not getting that. The use of music and the songs played in the background are just awesome. You feel like you are in the 70's and living in the era. The film is basically about racism and a big salute from my side to the makers for portraying this aptly (although I still have heard from various sources that certain things were not correctly depicted). With that being said, I still felt the film would have been better if the runtime was trimmed a bit. Also, the romantic subplot made no sense and I didn't feel any need for it.Performances: Let me say that I just love Denzel Washington. He has a charm and that hasn't faded up until now. Now watching his son in the film, I even fell in love with him. He lives up to his father's name and I want to see more of him. Adam Driver doesn't have much of a role but he shines with what was given to him. Laura Harrier was OK. Ryan Eggold and Jasper Paakkonen were great. And so were Topher Grace and Ashlie Atkinson. Robert John Burke and Fred Weller also do deserve some praise.Favorite Scene: The scene comes quite early in the film where Ron is a rookie and he is kept in the archives section and Andy comes in to ask for a file on a 'toad'. He replies that there are no toads here but human beings. He gives him the file anyway and after Andy exits, Ron does some kind of hand movements. What got me in this scene was the comedy, I was laughing throughout the scene.Verdict: Many people will actually not get this film and honestly if this film would have come out a few years ago, my review would have been entirely different to the one I have written now. I had a blast watching this film and Spike Lee is definitely a director that is on my watchlist.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great message about the similarities of the klan in the 70s and the klan now and police brutality then and now. Additionally, I liked the juxtaposition between the Black Panthers and the klan. Not many films have shown the Black Panthers in a positive light. Unfortunately, Spike Lee often has trouble writing script for women, it's evident in this film. Also, there were some plot holes and some questionable decisions made by the characters. Overall, this is a really good film I'll give it a 8.2/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Grand Prix winner,"As a finn, I just have to begin this review from a supporting cast standpoint. The character of Felix Kendrickson, an aggressive KKK member, is played by my fellow countryman Jasper Pääkkönen. You certainly wouldn't want to bump into Felix in a dark alley. Pääkkönen has actually played a somewhat similar character in a finnish film called Leijonasydän (Heart of a Lion), a really well made 2013 film about neo-nazis.But back to the BlacKkKlansman...Spike Lee's newest joint starts with images from Gone with the Wind and evolves into an important film about a touchy subject, hopefully this film will be another step forward in the battle against racism. The premise of the story, while being about a serious issue, is giggle worthy - the plan of an african-american police officer infiltrating Ku Klux Klan doesn't necessarily sound like the best of ideas -it's kind of a ""lets wing it"" type of deal. The movie is a part comedy but it is tonally a bit more serious than the what the trailers had me anticipating. I also felt that there were a couple of instances where the movie's history telling interfered the pacing and thrillingness of the actual story. BlacKkKlansman has laughs, thrills, importance, shock value and nice portrayal of the period, but for me the film didn't quite come together in the way I would've liked.

Pretty solid movie,This movie did a good job of combining some comedic elements while still staying true to the subject matter. Washington uses a accent that comes off as a bit strange at times but it doesn't take away from a good performance. Some scenes are a bit random and don't serve much to the overall plot. There are a few times where the camera work leaves you scratching your head but that's pretty true to most Spike Lee movies,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An outrageous yet interesting, funny and thrilling masterpiece that brings Spike Lee a glorious back to form","With Spike Lee's recent filmography making a disappointing and mediocre impression towards critics and audiences, BlacKkKansman is considered a glorious return to form for Spike Lee and without a doubt, one of the best films of the year and also a superior film that surpasses Spike Lee's other acclaimed films such as Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X. BlacKkKansman truly delivers an outrageous yet interesting true story that blends very well with funny one-liners and quips as well elements of comedy, in which that type of technique was previously used in The Wolf of Wall Street. Furthermore, it also adds a realistic yet accurate timely themes that tackles on the issue of racism, white supremacy, current events and divisive politics under Trump era that define the American perspective.Apart from Spike Lee's masterful direction, this film is also defined by a shocking, compelling and riveting performances from John David Washington, Adam Driver and Topher Grace. Clearly, BlacKkKansman is a worthy film that allows an educational insight of showing America's current political moment as well the viewpoint of racial prejudices while at the time, making the film as funny and not as boring.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too funny to be true,"Ron Stallworth, what a bizarre era of your life. Imagine answering a newspaper ad for a hate group that hates you and your race. This movie subtly presents the idiocy of the KKK, who claim to smell the ""inferior race"" from a mile, but can not even hear the difference in Stallworth's voice over the phone. Incredibly hilarious throughout.I did feel at times that Washington was a tad too robotic through some scenes, but there were also some brilliant scences where I thought wow the nerve of this man. Fantastic altogether!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
BlacKkKlansman Review,"I recently saw the new Spike Lee movie BlacKkKlansman, and I'm happy to say it was a great experience watching it. I was somewhat nervous going into the movie due to the fact that most of Spike's other movies were underwhelming to me. I'm happy to say that BlacKkKlansman breaks that trend.One aspect I never found Spike Lee to be great at is Shot Composition. Even in his movies that I like ( He Got Game, Do The Right Thing), The cinematography seemed very uninspired to me. For BlacKkKlansman the cinematography had to be better because of the time when the movie was set in. After viewing I can confidently say that I really enjoyed the majority of the shots in the movie. The shot were John David Washington's character is in a room were a speech is being given and the camera zooms in on the people's faces and creates a really compelling shot. I also really enjoyed the scene where two people are having a conversation and the shot is split into two dutch angles, and I also loved the shot were two main characters are walking down a hallway a the shot zooms in to them in a way that really emphasizes the tone of the scene. All of these do a great job a helping us believe the time of the movie and is very reminiscent of the Black Exploitation movies that very clearly inspired it.The acting was great, John David Washington does a phenomenal job as the main character. Adam Driver also provided a great performance and had great chemistry with Washington which was essential to the success of the film. All of the members of KKK gave great performances, Especially Jasper Paakkonen who's role had the potential to be very cringy.The story of the movie was pretty good for the most part. One gripe I would have is that there is a break in between the end of the second act of the movie and the third act which moved very slowly and was especially annoying because I could clearly tell where the film was going. With that said the final act of the movie is great and the tension is very palpable even for who knew how it ended before hand. The way the movie leaves little clues that come into the third act later is really rewarding for people that pay close attention.Now for the elephant in the room, what do I think about the messaging in the movie. I'm not going to complain about the movie being preachy because it is very clearly trying to have a message. I was big fan of when the movie pulled very sneaky messages were they make parallel to today in a very clever way, the way that you have to catch the messages yourself makes the movie far more engaging. For the sake of spoilers i'm not going to go into to detail on any of them. The only complaint I have is when it comes to criticizing Trump the movie throws the nuance out the window for painfully obvious lines that are cringy enough that I half expected the characters to wink at the screen. It always annoyed when musicians, filmmakers and other forms of media bash Trump in such a dumb and lowest common denominater way as if to not go over anyone's head. Thankfully there weren't many examples of this.In conclusion I think that BlacKkKlansman was a great movie that is very poignant for today. Spike Lee really returns to form and I would say this is his best movie yet. I would highly recommend for everyone to see itScore: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting true story,"To be perfectly honest, the fact that this was a true story makes it hard to make a bad movie about it. If you have the budget to cast great actors and make the movie pretty looking it will be a decent movie. But for me that was about it. It was a decent movie. It's hard to say that tackling racism related issues that took place in the 70's United States is a brave or controversial one anymore. Nonetheless it is an enjoyable but slightly long movie.An African American manages to infiltrate a KKK branch with the help of his coworkers.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Profoundly racist film by Spike Lee,"Spike Lee has, from his earliest film, depicted whites as dumb, exploitative, manipulative, redneck, and uncivilized, among other negative traits.In contrast, he portrays the black person as the victim, the enslaved soul of goodness trampled underfoot, and demeaned by whites. The only good souls among the latter come from the Jewish, a minority biblically known to include various races, including the Falasha, a black tribe hailing from Ethiopia. In other words, from Spike Lee's standpoint, the only good whites are those who are not completely white.I am a white born in Mozambique, Africa, and am proud to have had, and to continue to have, blacks, Chinese, Asian Indians, and mulattoes among my friends.While I find political correctness a destroyer of art, and welcome the fact that Spike Lee does not hesitate to blast it, I find BLACK K KLANSMAN a profoundly racist film. The highly intelligent black rookie quickly outsmarts all daft whites in the police force, launching an investigation into KKK with the very help of the white estabishment Lee so attacks.Lee directed the excellent 25TH HOUR in 2002. In it he showed talent that he has sadly withheld from the public since. Which is a pity, because he could have been a director of the highest cut. Instead, he has elected to go on racist tirades of dubious moral authority.Direction is heavy-handed and biased; acting is pedestrian; script is uneven and you have to suspend your desbelief to unbelievable lengths to believe the action (especially when the white woman is trying to plant a bomb in Laura Harrier's post box); and cinematography is mediocre, to put it mildly.Best avoided, unless you are a diehard Spike Lee fan.2/10.

An intriguing story buried under political propaganda,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was pleasently surprised. The movie appeared to have a lot of life to it and at the heart a great chemistry between John David Washington and Adam Driver, both of whom I am huge fans of.Unfortunately, this movie was a really disappointing film that buried a really engaging story into a piece of propaganda with the intention of turning blacks against whites.I gave this movie a decent rating because the strong parts are great, but we didn't get enough of them. As expected, Driver and Washington's chemistry was top notch, making me think and laugh time and time again. Even the side characters such as the other members of the police department added a fun, comedic element to the movie. The investigation was down well, but not enough of the focus was on it. Spike Lee took a really interesting story that I had never heard before and surrounded it with plain old bias.My political views aside, all audience members, black, white... Christian, Muslim... Liberal or Conservative... should be able to join together at the movies to enjoy a film. However, as a white male, I felt like I shouldn't have been in the theater and no movie should make its audience feel that way. Film is an art and a form of expression, but it is also something that people are meant to enjoy and cherish with others. This film fails to capture all audiences but one.Multiple political jokes and nods against the current administration in a movie set in the 70s felt jarring and took me out of it. Not to mention the forced propaganda placed at the end of the film, which did everything but straight up encourage a race war.I wanted to love this movie. To me it doesn't matter what color skin or what religion an actor or actors is when determine which movies I see. All that matters is the story and this film had a good one, but other factors bring it down.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thank You Spike Lee,"Perfect example of truth being stranger than fiction. He used his real name to apply for membership in the KKK. How was that possible? The film technique took me back to the 70's, back to Black Belt Jones, Foxy Brown, Get Christie Love, etc. The Charlottesville, VA scene was shown at the end of the movie, demonstrating how things have not improved. Things are worst now, since racism isn't compelled to hide it's face. When the movie ended, it was eerily quiet. The truth was uncomfortable and disgusting. People got up and left silently without comment. It was a lot to think about. I'm still thinking about it. Thinking about seeing it again.

"Those who don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it","Robbie K back again with another review, this time on a biography that showed promise for being a wild, crime filled law. Yet, there was the potential political game embedded in it that looked to get in the way, bringing concern that this movie may go down the wrong pathway. Nevertheless, I'm back to give you yet another review in hopes that I can help shed some light onto whether the movie is worth its weight in money. Let's get started on the review of:Blackkklansman (2018)Director:
 Spike Lee
Writers:
 Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz 
Stars:
 John David Washington, Adam Driver, Laura HarrierLIKES:Great Setting 
Costumes And Makeup
Clever Comedy
Awesome Sound Editing
Fantastic Acting
Strong LessonsBlackkklansman is one of those movies that brings you back in time to all the crazy events of history. The setting alone feels like a blast from the past, as we drop into the war against segregation from the unique perspective of an undercover agent. Amidst the world building of this movie, comes an impressive display of retro fashions of the time, bringing nostalgia and a certain panache to the film. In addition, the fantastic soundtrack and sound editing brings that needed dynamic that represents emotion. While the film is certainly strong in the drama/crime aspect, the comedy is reserved for those with a dryer sense of humor. Clever wit awaits the audiences for this movie, forgoing the over the top slapstick for a richer laugh generator. Of course, all of this fails without great acting, and this film's two leads reach the goal of bringing the times to life and representing the story it wanted to tell. This strong work helps sell the strong lessons of what history can teach, wrapping it up in very grandiose, preachy method that rolls with the movie.DISLIKES:Aggressive dialogue
Too Dry at Times
Slow Pace
The Ending?Back in the day, the politeness and filtering were highly more advanced than today's standards. Sadly, the accurate yelling and vocabulary is a little too much for me, hearing all the derogative slanders, hating, and passionate politics just got to eye rolling proportions. Fan who don't like all the forbidden words of sailor talk, need to already turn away from this movie, though it still has nothing on Django Unchained and Phone Booth. Trying to offset this is the comedy that totally goes down the dryer route, but sometimes it becomes more a desert wasteland devoid of the usual comedic ocean. This leads to some fewer entertaining choices, and with it a slower, dragged out piece. Blackkklansman is horrible for pacing with me, establishing fantastic details, but sort of shirking the time management thing in advance of a complete story Still, the movie needed some spice to well spice things up so that the monotony could be broken up at times. Finally, the ending. Symbology and tributes are there to help motivate and teach the life lesson contained in this viewing. However, the real error I have is that the ending itself seems out of place for me. I get it, the movie was showing some current events, but it just didn't fit with the story they were trying to tell, which was about the past.The VERDICT:Blackkklansman is an artistic piece of work, that makes some parts of history fun to revisit. However, the movie still needs some help with maximizing the entertainment/suspense element in their work. Given the dry, barren joke pool and an ending that doesn't quite click, you can see why the film gets some points docked away from it. Still, looking for the informative, big-budget portrayal of the events that took place, the movie does warrant some applause for the ability to make history come to life once more. Worth a trip to the theater? Can't say so, unless you want a political work of art... literally.My scores:Biography/Comedy/Crime: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"So disappointed, so much potential","I wanted to like the film. I was excited to see the film. I could not stay awake in this film.The pacing is molasses and the camera work was so poorly constructed. The lofty narrative of racism was consistently undercut by the films jarring use of terrible comedy. For the duration of the film Lee portrays the threat of the KKK as almost whimsical, only to abruptly transition to real footage of the Charlottesville riots and ensuing death. If the film had either stuck to a Millenial-ironic humorous take or a edgy documentary of the atrocities of the KKK and the real life work to stop them it would have been fine. Like khaluha and wine, they are better left separated.Honestly I was hoping for more but it didn't deliver. I will recommend anyone to see Sorry to Bother You instead.

The good old undercover narrative device,"No one can´t deny the relevance of the true story. The struggles and adversities of the afroamerican people have been resepresented in films various times. While many have show profundity and intense pasions in the plot others were made for the sole purpose of entertainment. I dont see anything but enterteinment here.
So a black man in joins the police in a time of great racial conflict and infiltrates the KKK (not himself but another detective using his name). The good old undercover narrative device. i´ve seen the exact story various times: the romantic relation of the main character, the dynamic in the grup the inflitator is in, the conflicts between characters, etc.
the clan or ""the organisation"" at any point seems threatening, just a bunch of red neck hanging out. And although the perfomances are enjoyable, no actor tried to individualized their characters. Thus making an average movie too long for his own sake.

Underdelivers due to some odd stylistic choices,That this film tackles a very important topic is obvious. And on that level it delivers with all its jabs against dumb prejudices and racism. Also both or leads Adam Driver John Washington give us really good performances.But from a technical standpoint this movie really underdelivers. Spike Lee chose to portrait the KKK for what it is. A bunch of clowns. And this tone is conveyed throughout the whole film. The problem is that even though it is very funny it lacks conflict. And no point do you feel like any harm will be done to our protagonist(s). Even when it comes to the supposedly climax we never really feel like there is any danger because this is just not the tone of film. This is underlined by the music Spike Lee chose. Even though at times where there should be tension we get this recurring guitar theme which never conveys tension or drama.And ironically the last 3 Minutes that show footage of actual events that is the only time the movie really touches us and makes us sad about all that racism that is still out there.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What America Needs,"After a very stale and political year, as far as cinema goes, this political film is very refreshing and is exactly what America needs. The film steers clear of hate and instead focuses on the main theme...and tagline of the movie ""all power to all the people"".I'll be perfectly honest and say I was not expecting such a good movie as I'm not big into Spike LeePros:
-The film has an exceptional amount of comedy. Just enough to keep you laughing, but not so much that it takes away from the story.-You will feel for the characters. They are very strongly developed.-The cinematography and colors are beautiful. Very soft to look at-The story has a fantastic message-I can see this movie being popular for years to come.Cons:
-Some of the dialogue seems very forced.-Choppy editing at some points-1 extremely noticable continuity error-The last scene in the movie (if you can call it part of the movie) should cut completely.

"Polished, wondrous satire at times, oozing class!","This is such a well-crafted Spike Lee effort and feels as polished as anything he has created over the last decade. The wonderfully quirky story of a fresh young black police officer infiltrating the cocooned world of the local Klan and humiliating its hierarchy is told through such panache. Wonderful acting and a cracking soundtrack brings each scene alive and all references to black culture and the civil rights struggle are delivered with such poignancy, humour and at times with such powerful lines that the overall effect is like watching a wondrous creation by a masterful auteur. Of course the symbolism of Charlottesville and Trump's pandering to the alt-right makes it a very contemporary film, but even without that Lee is a class above all other retelling of the black struggles that have come out in cinema over the last few years.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Outstanding work with meaning portrayed through every means.,"As the first review I've ever written, this movie made me want to share how powerful and well written it was.
Although the plot is relatively ordinary with the undercover cop scenario, it includes uses of humor and circumstantial irony that makes the audience so engaged. It captures racial injustice that will leave you furious as you have to sit and watch the injustice occur, but it will also leave you leaping with joy when justice has been served. And although the film does discuss racial injustice, it doesn't make all the white characters unlikable as many of the cops were supportive of Washington and his cause. The producer doesn't narrowly point to the discrimination of blacks, as he brings into light antisemitism among the extremist members. 
There is so much to think about after watching this movie. The movie does end with footage of the riots in Virginia in 2017. Some may find this unappealing, but it is one of the major themes to the movie, that this sort of extremism is still existent today in the United States. 
I would have given this a 10 star rating, but the filmography style wasn't particularly my favorite, although it was effective for film.So yeah, definitely recommend. I will probably watch this thirty more times.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Funny, dramatic, shocking","I had no expectations for this movie, I just saw the trailer and figured out it was some kind of comedy.Turns out it's a social drama about racism and particularly about KKK, it's handled in a clever way,
No surprise here because the director is Spike Lee who likes to make movies about this subject, like Malcolm X.I like the way this movie is both funny and political, and I especially like the way ""white power"" and ""black power"" are aligned by editing like the extremisms they are.
It's really interesting and I recommend it.I didn't like Adam Driver in Star Wars 7 but here he's a big surprise. His character is really strong with improvisation which helps a lot his infiltration in KKK.
Both main characters are well written.
The costumes and haircuts really add an immersive atmosphere for the time period.Watchout for the end though, don't bring anyone under 16 it's really graphic and it's real footage of violent riots about racism.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Using language from today instead of authentic speech from this period and when they do it's always ""right on brother"" and ""brother this and brother that."" Lazy writing.So painful to watch. And what's with the constant head-on shots?It's supposed to take place in 1979, but the design, wardrobe, hair etc look like it was in the late 60s and early 70s.

I can't say I've ever loved any of Spike Lee's films, but I haven't gone out of my way to see all of them either. To me, he seems like an angry director, bent on making sure everyone knows how angry he is, and after a while, that gets tiresome. This movie is probably the best Spike Lee that I have seen. I guess I'm just not a fan of Spike Lee, and that's fine. He's a filmmaker with a voice, and many people are drawn to that voice like it's a siren song.

The subtle stuff was great, but when the lines ""America first!"" are uttered by two Klan members in a context that made absolutely no sense (there was no discussion of any other countries, foreign policy, etc) I was severely disappointed...

The disparate ratings for this movie seem to be par for the course for movies with a strong political bent, in these supercharged times. But this is a well crafted movie with a strong but not well known cast. The adapted screenplay and cinematography are first rate, and some of the scenes are imposing. One in particular, members of the local kkk watching the 1915 Birth of a Nation film was stomach churning. There was a scene where a police sargeant challenged the assertion by the black officer that America would never elect a person like David Duke to the presidency. As current eventshave shown we are capable of that and more. This is a movie that should be talked about.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Enjoyable film,"This was a great and enjoyable film.Some strong performances and hilarious dialogue. The build up was done really well and one could say it was a good outcome in the end. It takes skill and good film making to take an issue and show it in an enjoyable, humorous and almost relatable manner.The part at the end showing real footage and tension really was juxtaposed to the film, too heavy, intense, sad and no one in the theatre made a sound.

Spike Lee goes for the gold - and delivers,"Spike Lee is known for translating difficult stories into cinema, and 'BlacKkKlansman' is no different. In what is one of the most interesting and head-scratching tales from the civil rights movement, Lee brings us the story of Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first African-American police officer, who also is part of a covert team that infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan.One of the biggest surprises in 'BlacKkKlansman' is the job John David Washington does as the aforementioned Officer Stallworth. The son of a film legend and a relative newcomer to acting, Washington has everything down from the accent to the look to - most importantly - the quick wit needed to outsmart a bunch of backhills racists. Joining him on this journey is Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), a Jewish officer who is also an unconventional choice to take down the KKK.The film is many things all at once - a crime drama, a dark comedy, a time travel back to a different era - and it delivers on all of these points. Through the eyes of Stallworth, the audience can identify with the personal struggle he experiences, trying to be a black cop in an all-white force with few friends or believers, while also straddling the line when it comes to sticking to his roots, including the young civil rights movement led by Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier).'BlacKkKlansman' also earned Lee his first Oscar, for best adapted screenplay - incredible to believe given his long career. It is not the best (nor is it his best) effort, but it's a well done film that tells a crazy story in a unique way.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This was an ambush,"This movie was promising and then came the editorial sermonizing. Yeah, I know racism exists and was really bad in the 60's, 70's and so on. But seriously, this country has a long history of correcting its mistakes. The movie was well written and superbly acted. I know that ""America First"" was a slogan from the isolationist apprasers of the rising German post Weimar National Socialist Party and it's rising star Hitler. I recognized it when Trump was using it and was chilled. But how does Yrunp bashing have a place in a movie set in 1970's America?I saw this film in the San Francisco area and I know that the audience has a more left leaning outlook than where I come from...and that's cool. But seriously I watched the local audience break out into applause and vocal ""I hate Trump"" outbursts. Then I watched an older white woman sidle up to a young black couple and tell her how much she ""...hates Trump.""C'mon Spike. You're better than this crap. I came to be entertained and I was just irritated.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
What we all need to see right now,"This is a very timely film that is so relevant to what is happening in the world. There were many parts that were uncomfortable to watch because it is sometimes difficult to imagine that such racism and hatred can actually exist, but recent events clearly show that it is not limited to the 1970's. I think the film shows how there are some issues on both sides, but ultimately caused by the extreme prejudice prevalent in America. Stop. Watch. Think. Act.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"excellent movie, a beautiful story","I loved this film because on the one hand the story interested me a lot,
and on the other hand, the director, Spike Lee, added several comic scenes.
What interested me is that through fiction, he gives us a real message,
it shows us through images of real facts that the problem is still relevant for years after

Spike Lee's Best Work Since Malcolm X,"One of the most moving yet hilarious films I've seen this year. Spike Lee knocks it out of the park with his best work since Malcolm X.John David Washington is so great in his role. He's got a real commanding presence and I can't wait to see him in future projects. Other actors worthy of a shoutout are Adam Driver (who gives the best performance I've seen from him since Silence, although he really is great in everything I see him in), Topher Grace is haunting yet captivating as David Duke, and lastly a tiny shoutout to Ryan Eggold who is hilarious and slightly likeable (despite being a Klansman).Besides the acting, I also thought the script was great. It was hilarious and intense, just like Get Out. The cinematography is great as well. Lastly, I know a couple people didn't like the ending. Unashamedly, I thought it was great, obviously not in a good way. It took you out of the movie, but that's what it was supposed to do. It was a presentation of sorts, like ""We showed you this, now look at this and think about how we feel."" It was something that stood out and I support it.I have some issues however, none that made me dislike it in any way. I don't think some choices necessarily fit as much as they thought it did. I know it was Spike Lee's vision, but I just don't think it fit. For example, when Ron and Patrice are walking/talking about blaxploitation films, the posters of such films pop up on the screen. It took me out immediately. It just felt like Lee was saying in all caps ""THIS IS YOUR HOMEWORK!"" I just don't think the posters popping up was needed. Another example is during Kwame Ture's speech, where the camera shows distinct faces flying across the screen. I know Lee probably had a meaning to it, I just didn't really think it fit. Aside from that, I wasn't really a fan of the editing. It was kinda strange. It would cut to different shots every word a character spoke some times which just looked odd. It was distracting, but it didn't make me hate the movie or anything. Lastly, I think it went a bit too far on some things that took unnecessary time out of the movie. The primary example is a 4-minute scene where Lee is calling out Trump. I'm all for it, but I felt it should have focused on the story at hand rather than waste time on something he touches on at the end.Despite that, I still think BlacKkKlansman is one of the best films of the year and I think it's message is strong. I liked that it showed both sides of the cop/racism incident. I don't think it's better than Get Out, but the importance is just as big. I had chills at the end like everyone else in the theatre and I truly believe BlacKkKlansman will hold up in the time to come.8.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
BlacKkKlansman,"While I'll never have a full perspective of the political messages in Spike Lee's movies, I still try to enjoy them on a more basic level. This film was much better than 'Da 5 Bloods', with a more coherent story line and fewer story jumps and style changes - however, there were still some. There were also several moments when the voice dubbing wasn't edited in correctly and stood out in conversations where we couldn't see the characters face. The ending was unsatisfying (although that may have been the point), but the final dolly shot was excellently done.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
And the Oscar goes to...,"BlacKkKlansman is an expertly made movie in every conceivable way. The acting, directing, writing, cinematography, editing, and music all mesh wonderfully to create one of my favorite movies of the year so far. I have been hearing about BlacKkKlansman all summer long as it came hot off the festival circuit, so my expectations were high, and boy did it live up to them. With the exception of a few on-the-nose lines, Spike Lee wrote and directed a movie that subtly and almost flawlessly drew stark comparisons with America today and the turmoil of the early 1970s. Detective Ron Stalworth is a torn man. Torn between helping to liberate and empower black Americans and uphold the law. How he manages to tow the line is by infiltrating and sabotaging the local KKK chapter. This movie is funny, poignant, and most of all horrifying. Like many movies that depict the race relations of the post-civil rights era, there are scenes and characters in this movie that will make your skin crawl and make you feel sick to your stomach. However, it's not without it's charm. Lee inserts just enough larger than life humor to keep you from becoming completely emotionally spent. The acting is also superb throughout, with every single major and minor character giving it their all. John David Washington was amazing as the lead, but Topher Grace and Adam Driver stole the show for me. I hope all three of these actors are in the conversation come Oscar season. Speaking of awards, I will be truly amazed if BlacKkKlansman doesn't just clean up next year at the Oscars. As I said, I thought every piece of this movie was well executed, but I in particular will be upset if it doesn't get nominations for directing, adapted screenplay, and of course best picture. This movie is not only wildly entertaining but also gravely important. I hope every person in America sees this movie because its message needs to be shared.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I thought this was satire,"I really thought Spike Lee was joking with this one. No way this could be an anti-racist film like some critics are arguing. This is precisely what a hateful racist film looks like. The way black people are portrayed is stereotypical, and that's surprising. I'm not sure if this is only obvious for people who do not live in the States. Any white critic who says this film is impressive is only because they are too afraid to sound racist. Everyone is trying to sound politically correct and use the word ""ethical"" as a cookie cutter tool to look at everything around them. A critic should not be afraid to talk about anything, let alone being afraid to be ""offensive."" It's absolutely preposterous that people think about being offensive. And because of this everyone is self-censoring themselves. I read from some critics that Green Book was a racist film made by a white person when compared to this film which was anti-racist made by an ""intellectual"" director. I did not feel that way at all. I think white critics are too afraid of their own racist thoughts, so they search for anything that resembles their own opinions. They feel like they have to love anti-racist films made by oppressed people even if the film (or any artwork for that matter) is terrible. And yes, this film is awful. Editing is a joke, the floating heads in the dark during Kwame's speech was laughable with calls and cries that sound like they were being said by a white person trying to sound black. How did anyone keep a straight face making this film? If they thought this film was serious, then they were accepting Spike Lee's discriminative and derogatory way. I hope people start making overly-offensive films so maybe some of those people who are all PC could wake up well healed after going into a coma watching them.",,Anonymous,Biography
Decent too politcal...,The movie was entertaining and at times funny. However the movie was totally ruined by the end. Way to overly political and that totally ruined it for me. Here are a couple of facts to give you some perspective. The movie Birth of a Nation was shown in the White House by President Woodrow Wilson (first movie ever seen in the White House) who is a Democrate. Also Robert Byrd (a Democrate) was a former grand wizard of the KKK at his death he was praised by President Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. To learn the truth I would recomend the movie Death of a Nation.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hats off to Spike Lee,"Some of the reviews foud this movie appalling, I found it eye-opening. Some people found it biased, I found it daring.
This film, which is directed by Spike Lee, is based on a book after a true story ; the story of Ron Stallworth (performed by John D. Washington, whose performance is absolutely inspiring), first black police officer in Colorado Springs, Colorado. To be able to enter the Intelligence Services, or lead character is going to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan's local chapter. There will be other characters, who will help him throughout the film, such as Flip (Adam Driver), the Jewish policeman, or Patrice (Laura Harrier), the Black Panther activist.
In my opinion, this film is an absolute must-see! As I said, the actor's performances (not only John D. Wasington's) are very convincing, and they are supported by a screenplay that manages to be both funny and thought-provoking at times.
I did find the movie a bit long at times, though. However, it does not keep the audience from understanding the numerous (and very up-to-date) inequalities this film is about : racism (obviously), anti-Semitism, gender inequalities,...
Last but not least, the Charlottesville scene at the end. Many people found it upsetting, since it doesn't have any direct ties with Stallworth's story. But since these subjects are still so present in America nowadays, I find it legit, and it's a perfect conclusion for a masterpiece such as BlacKkKlansman.
Just to finish with a few words about the film's direction : it feels like such a true to life 70's city! It is striking!

"Good story, well made, unfortunately unethical and distortionist","I have always liked Spike Lee as a director.

It has some great comedy that mixed in with a serious situation as well. Even at times when the scenes were intense it could be funny. The real shame it all is how Spike Lee added these edited clips of Trump at the end to present the idea that Trump is a racist.

Meh,"This movie is clearly overrated. It'll probably die a death the same way most Spike Lee movies die (Does anyone remember his war movie? And the fact that he used racism to try to promote it - Key Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman). The man hasn't made a good movie in almost twenty years but in today's race baiting society with Drumpf in office - he's making more race related movies. As a whole the movie is very subpar with a funny ending. The guy from that 70's show is excellent as David Duke, but there isn't much else. There isn't anything special about it except for our present time. This movie will probably disappear like almost all of Spike's other movies except for maybe 2.

Interesting & Entertaining,"If it wasn't based on a true story, you probably wouldn't believe that a black man was able to become a member of the KKK.

The chemistry is great between both Washington and Driver, their characters brought together for being the focus of the hate group. There is a strong reminder that we are far from when this story actually took place which is unfortunate. I also like that this wasn't a one sided story. It shows that both sides hate the police, assuming they're all the same as well while Ron is stuck in the grey area in the middle.

He was focusing on things that were unimportant..
And I don't live in the US so we don't have any kind of problems like this at all.

Brillant Spike Lee's latest masterpiece,"I love Spike Lee sarcasm. His realistic point of view truly amazes me every time I watch a work of his.
He always vouches for black community however, including the villains, degenerates and the oppressors in the public take place in his picture without harsh denunciations. On the contrary, all his characters appear in his movies with the idea of ""we are all human after all."" Thus, this naturalism is always giving the audience the message of ""It's useless and the most ridiculous thing to fight each other in a racist perspective, or a in religious diversity especially in the U.S.A where the multiculturalism has been living since in its origins"".
BlacKkKlansman as in its double party plot which the audience sees the inner circle of the kkk and the Black Civil Right group, defends the idea I mentioned above. I think Spike Lee's anti-acute diversion picturization with his usual sarcasm he uses in both communities in his movies, demonstrates the sick parts of discrimination in a nation in a better way (Like in BlacKkklansman) rather than the hatred, violence and brutality are pictured.
In technical angle, the cinematography, mise en scene and the shooting smells like an auteur work as Lee has it with his many years experience in Hollywood and movie is perfect in total.

Read the book first!,"To begin, the book, as almost always, is better than the film. This review is for the movie, which I am considering ends at the cross burning. The footage at the end is amazing, powerful, and indicting, but not part of the movie proper, in my opinion. To which -The movie is ok. It doesn't really deal with the actual plot of the title until about a half an hour in, which didn't really make sense to me. The speech at the beginning is awesome, but has very little to do with Stallworth's overall investigation. And with all the new pieces the filmmaker added to the plot, the actual investigation itself seems watered down in here. Even the great scene with Harry Belafonte juxtaposed with the KKK ceremony feels like a separate event than the investigation. The movie just stops to let these amazing speeches occur, and I wish they had their own, separate, spotlight. In my opinion.
Just like the ending news footage. Watching the real David Duke, the horrible Donald Trump, and the footage from Charlottesville slam home that the KKK and their kind are still here, and very much alive! I cried at the end. It just felt that though it all is connected by the same message, it wasn't part of the movie. Just my opinion.
Also kudos to Mr. Lee for NOT being in the film. He is such a bad actor, and I'm glad he was able to stay out of this one.

I only had a few criticisms with this: Patrice's character was a little unnecessary (except at the end) and I wish we had gotten to know the lead characters a little more (like it took no time for Ron to lead an investigation or for Flip to follow his lead).

If you would have told me that it was a true story, I would have immediately said you were lying. But surely enough, based on the book written by none other than Ron Stallworth, this movie chronicles the insanity and also hilarity at the mere concept of this true story. The movie has extremely well pacing, there is never a dull moment. Spike Lee knows exactly what he wants to accomplish with each scene he presents, and boy does he exceed that accomplishment. Now that's not to say this movie is absolutely flawless, there were a few shots that I just found completely unnecessary and absolutely strange in the way that Lee directed it. Now, especially for me, weird shots in movies are not a bad thing at all, just look at Sorry to Bother You, my second favorite movie of the year, it was filled to the brim with weird shots that did not make any sense. However, in the context of that movie, it seemed to fit more. Because while Sorry to Bother You was definitely more geared towards comedy, this movie is first and foremost a drama/thriller. And therefore some of the bizarre stylistic choices just didn't work for me. However, that is my only complaint for the movie, the rest is absolutely amazing, from the acting to the character development, to the comedy. The one thing that I did not fully expect when walking into this film was purely how funny it was going to be. I expected there to be a few chuckles here and there but there were honestly some sequences that had me laughing out loud. One of the things I appreciate most about this movie is how Lee presents not only the KKK side of the ""race war"" but also the Black Panther side of things as well. He does not necessarily paint an obvious picture as to who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. There are three total groups that are looked at during the course of this movie, the Police force, the KKK, and the Black Panthers. And every single one of them has things that they were doing wrong. None of them were perfect, and I appreciated that view of things because it seemed more like Lee was just presenting history rather than trying to put his own biases into it. The acting here is all phenomenal, specifically from Topher Grace playing David Duke and Adam Driver as Flip. And of course, John David Washington did an excellent job as the main character. This movie, while somewhat flawed, is excellent and definitely up there in the list for movies of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gotta Hand It To Them,"As a white male conservative, I really wanted to hate this movie. But when I took into account how great this movie must ""feel"" to blacks and Jews and other marginalized populations, I couldn't help but appreciate what Spike Lee was trying to do here. Because it doesn't take itself too seriously, Blackkklansman is downright fun to watch; the characters are likeable enough and the script moves very well. So if you'll put away your politics for a couple hours and try to see the world through other people's eyes -- just for fun -- you'll laugh, have a good time; and with an element of surprise you may even benefit from a sense that we're all in the same family, however dysfunctional that family may be.",,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee has made an incredible film which MUST be seen.,"My first impression of ""BlacKkKlansman"" was my reaction to seeing its name listed among the films selected to premiere in competition at the Cannes film festival. I remember thinking, ""Did the filmmakers really need to put the ""k"" between the two words? Isn't the ""K"" in ""Klansman"" enough?""The answer to the first is yes; the answer to the second is no. This is a film which makes no attempt to explain its behaviour, which is original and relentless. The script wastes no time in packing in as many racist slurs as it possibly can, with no careful exposition clarifying that the people saying the words are bad. It goes without saying - the Klansmen are utterly detestable and the actors playing them seem in competition to be the most unpleasant. It says a lot about the careful, purposeful direction of Mr. Lee that the greatest merit the Klan characters have is that they aren't quite as socially unacceptable as Jasper Pääkkönen's Felix. Certainly Mr. Lee wishes to show that the well-spoken David Duke (Topher Grace) is deluded in believing that he is any better, by amping up the classical expressionism of the camera in Duke's scenes.Speaking of the camera, it always seems to be in the right place. It works as an onlooker, never quite embracing a wholly ""modern"" style. Much has already been written about the ""creamy"" cinematography, designed to emulate the look of 70s exploitation cinema. This is a success, and the film's atmosphere bleeds through the screen similarly to ""Fargo"" Season 2 and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Inherent Vice"".The soundtrack, by Terence Blanchard, whose fantastic work in Mr. Lee's ""25th Hour"" should not soon be forgotten, is in a league of its own, fading out through most of the dialogue and popping up in force to punctuate the previous scene and lead into the next. I'm a fan of this style: it allows for a much more energetic soundtrack. Certainly parallels must be drawn between the lone guitar and the character of Ron Stallworth, as played by John David Washington.Mr. Washington's performance, as well as Adam Driver's, will not be acclaimed enough, as ""BlacKkKlansman"" is not the type of film that allows for its performers to be the stars. Clearly Mr. Lee's focus is on the story (a compelling one, producer Jordan Peele has said that he successfully it to Mr. Lee in a mere six words) and the parallels found between the story and the world of today. That is, in part, what makes this such an interesting film. Like Mr. Peele's ""Get Out"", the film functions on the surface as an entertainment piece - a buddy-cop story with an ironic premise. That it's based on a true story elevates it to incredible. That said, this film does not have the subtlety of ""Get Out"" - not that it has to; that film would've been a mess if it had been too direct. In ""BlacKkKlansman"", we can appreciate that this is an attack on anybody that could dare to have a mindset ranging from Felix's to Duke's. It is a successful one. The film is profoundly moving and strongly independent. That's why the title has the ""k"". This is a Spike Lee joint.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cherry picks the facts to fit a political agenda.....,"I'll start by saying the actual film itself is very watchable and enjoyable. The acting is excellent, the story line clever and original. Its also deeply sad and at times, extremely funny, in equal measure. Its nice to see people deriving a kind of wry humour from what is a legacy of, at times, downright nasty, discrimination.Now comes the ""but"". Its unfortunate that this film doesn't let the story it tells speak for itself. Instead, it elects to stifle its powerful message by overlaying a pretty obvious political one. One that seems intent, in my opinion, on blaming one side of the political spectrum for the woes of establishment discrimination.Here's a few facts that don't fit that picture. David Duke first ran for the Democrats before switching to the Republicans (its all up on Wikipedia if you wish to fact check). It was the Republicans who voted to end slavery and both the Confederacy and the Union supported segregation and the North tacitly supported slavery. To say racial discrimination is somehow a Southern mindset, is misleading.The truth is the US has a long history of establishment support for all manner of discrimination. Social, racial, economic and philosophical (just look at 50's style McCarthyism which seems to be making a come back). To try to imply things are suddenly ""different"" ignores the fact that ""nothing ever really changed"" no matter which party or President was or is in office.Its such a shame too, because this film was almost, almost there, with a powerful message of hope for tolerance and understanding. What a genuine shame. 7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An important film which also entertains,"When I heard about the bizarre story of a black American cop who apparently infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Colombo, Ohio, I assumed it would be tongue-in-cheek, and possibly 'true' in the same sense as the Coen bros' 'Fargo'. I was taken with the mad Afro hairdos depicted in the trailer. When I heard it was a Spike Lee film, I thought it had a chance of being very good, and happily I wasn't disappointed. For me, BlackkKlansman is a return to top form for Mr Lee.
While it is a very entertaining film, it packs a real punch to the guts at the same time. It feels like a blast from the past with respect to the openly institutional racist attitudes, but sadly by the end we're all reminded that it never really went away, and the white supremacists are just as misguided and dangerous now as they were in the '70's.
John David Washington (son of Denzel) was a revelation. I was intrigued as to why such a talented actor took so long to emerge into the limelight, then I discovered he had a career in NFL first. A talented man, then, just like his father. He shows every sign of successfully emerging from Denzel's shadow and having a blistering acting career of his own. He really owns the role of Ron Stallforth.
Adam Driver was also excellent as Ron Stallworth's colleague and accomplice in face-to-face meetings with Ku Klux Klan members.
I don't know how true to Ron Stallworth's 'memoirs' BlackkKlansman is, but I imagine there will have been some dramatisation to make it more filmic. Having said that, there were a few bits which seemed just a little contrived. Even these moments didn't take me out of the story, though, so the overall feeling I was left with was one of satisfaction, which juxtaposed sharply with the jaw-dropping finale, as I'm sure Spike Lee intended.
If you're not sure this film is your thing, I wasn't sure it would be mine either (I don't usually go in for social conscience stories), but I can't reccommend it highly enough. This just might be the best film you see all year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too bad the actor they cast...,"... doesn't code-switch properly, as the ability to do so is pretty essential to the plot.

Very Good,"It's been a couple of weeks since I've seen this, and the thing that sticks in my mind after all that time is that it reminds me a little bit of a Quentin Tarantino film, though not as gleeful in its portrayal of violence. That by no means is a bad thing.The film has a stylized feeling, it doesn't feel quite realistic, like a Tarantino film. For example in the way the main character spoke. I know that half the time he is trying to sound white, but even when he isn't pretending to be a white man, he had this annoying nasally white voice when he was being himself. Something about that struck me as not quite right.It is a humorous film, but the humor seemed stylized - not quite natural. Again, it reminded me of Tarantino film in that way. Characters were archetypes. We have The dumb fat, but viscous racist who at first sight seems harmless. The smart, even more viscous racists who is very menacing. Then you have the white naive (or is he?) Klan leader, who plays the straight guy for all the gags. Very little goes into what makes these characters tick. Even the good guys' characters are not very well developed.The film also kind of hits the viewer over the head with it's message, though it is an important one indeed. For the most part, police stations are integrated now. For the most part, people understand that the KKK are bad. Modern day race problems seem to be more intricate than those presented here. Even the closing, in which Lee ties in his move with current events, is kind of obvious. But it is beautifully done with a match cut that starts with a Klan rally and switches to the Alt-right rally in Virginia. it shows that maybe we shouldn't take those obvious problems I just mentioned above for granted.I don't mind the stylized manner of this film and I even quite enjoyed it. This film is better than any Tarantino film, but I think the flaws I mention above keep the film from being a master piece. ""Do the Right Thing"" was a masterpiece.A better film on race relations that is released about the same time as this one is ""Blindspotting"" - my favorite film of the summer so far. Be sure to check that one out, if you liked this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Topical to the extreme,"Based on police officer Ron Stallworth, played by John David Washington, the first black officer to serve in Colorado Springs, and his successful attempt to infiltrate the ranks of Ku Klux Klan. Helmed by the legendary Spike Lee.As you'd expect, the questions and themes concerning race and race relations are heavily featured. The films speaks for unity and peace, but it's also a cautionary tale about hate and intolerance. The ugliest performances are of course given by the Klan members, but the film does show that the other side had advocates for violence as well. Which is of course natural. We're all human, after all.And speaking of ugly performances, I have to raise my hat for these actors. Washington, and Adam Driver as Detective Flip Zimmerman, play the two officers doing the infiltration, and they're wonderful, but I can only imagine what it must been like for Topher Grace and Jasper Pääkkönen playing the roles of David Duke , the grand wizard of KKK, and Felix, a psychotic Klan member, respectively. Pääkkönen especially has some truly haunting scenes where he has to spout the most vitriolic, hate-filled, blood mad filth imaginable. Scary performance, I have to admit.Aside from that the film is very solid on the technical side of things, has a sense of humour and is all around well-told. I did feel that the last act was perhaps a bit more outlandish than it necessarily needed to be. I get that the director wanted a big finale and to raise the stakes, but I wonder whether the focus should have been maintained on the actual issues, which are still ongoing even in today's world. The last minutes focus on those modern day issues, which was a nice finishing touch, but still.Nevertheless, a very good film. It should fill us with shame that such a world of hatred and intolerance still has a place in this day and age. And if this film opens the eyes of even one of its viewers, its existence has been justified.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A well worth watch of historical drama-comedy,"BlacKkKlansman stars John David Washington and Adam Driver as it follows the first black police officer in Colorado Springs as he develops an investigation against the KKK and his suspicion on a possible attack they are about to commit. With having Washington coordinating on the phone with the klansmen and Driver meeting them in person to form one person.This movie I actually have been excited for as I am a fan of Spike Lee and his 'based on true story' films. I loved Malcolm X from him, which ironically had John David Washington in it along side his dad Denzel Washington. And this movie lived up to every expectation I had for it. Spike Lee has always had an interesting way of approaching a topic especially one of controversy like this one. I feel like if any other director took on this film it would come off as being very one sided or even racist. But Lee found that perfect balance with it's amazing visuals and tight dialogue.Going to writing, this is one of Lee's best written scripts to date. The dialogue is both funny and meaningful to show the characters extremely well and how these two detectives are having to change their own beliefs and the way they talk to fit best with the people they're undercover as. Especially some of the scenes, I was laughing out loud in the theater and enjoying every bit of it. One scene towards the end in particular had me laughing and in shock all at once.The acting was once again amazing for Lee. Washington did an amazing job for his breakout role on the big screen as Ron Stallworth. He's hilarious and nobel for taking a role that could have been so racist or interpreted as anything but positive. Driver as well gave once again another amazing performance, possible Oscar worthy. And with him coming from an earlier career of R rated comedies, this type of racist jokes and insults almost fit him. Alongside with his quick reactions to his own lines and his pauses and stutters and with him almost fake acting throughout it makes this film feel so real and grounded all at once. Even some of the other cast members like Alec Baldwin, Robert John Burke, Brian Taratina, and Ryan Eggold. Even Topher Grace as David Duke all fit and were both funny and realistic and shockingly portrayed the characters extremely well based on real footage and documents of the real life people.This film won't be for everyone. They will find it useless or racist or another film to show how bad 'whites' are. But I found this film very enjoyable and entertaining and gave a unique history on our country and what negative things that went on during that time and how it wasn't just a one sided story like what they portray in school or even on documentaries.BlacKkKlansman gets a 9.75/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pretending to be white while speaking with David Duke (Topher Grace), Stallworth infiltrates the organization. But when the Klan asks to meet in-person, Stallworth has a white officer (Adam Driver) impersonate him.Inspired by Stallworth's book, director Spike Lee takes a number of liberties with the source material in order to make the story timely and more impactful.

"Entertaining, slightly odd pastiche of comedy, drama, politics, history","Spike Lee has some great source material here (how was this story not more famous?) and he doesn't screw it up.The comedy isn't laugh-out-loud funny and some more suspense could have been wrung from the plot. Because the book really didn't contain one, a big ending had to be written in, and it's a bit of a let down.

It might seem a little didactic to those who already know the story, but it's a good history lesson for younger viewers.Lee bookends the film with political commentary in his typically provocative fashion, which was jarring but affecting.

a good one from Spike,"Greetings again from the darkness. Adam Driver impersonating John David Washington or vice versa ... either way is comical, except that it's also based on a true story where their characters existed and this chain of events actually occurred. The source material is the memoir by Ron Stallworth and it's possible, given today's social climate, that only director Spike Lee could pull off a film that so blatantly uses racism for comedic effect, yet also reminds us of its inherent danger.Mr. Washington (Denzel's son) plays Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first black rookie police officer. His job interview is quite awkward and, of course, features a reference to Jackie Robinson. Quickly growing tired of his records room duty, Stallworth's first field assignment is to infiltrate a local black activist group and report back on a Stokely Carmichael/Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) event. This leads to a much bigger and riskier plan of going after the KKK. Yes that's right, no need to re-read the part about him being the first black police officer. This is the incredible story of how an African-American (with the help of his white partner) worked his way into the KKK, even speaking with David Duke on a few occasions, and ultimately prevented an attack on local black activists.The adapted screenplay was a collaborative effort from Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, and director Spike Lee. The film is simultaneously laugh outloud funny and provocative. The outlandish plan involves Ron Stallworth (and his white voice) being the telephone connection, and partner (and non-practicing Jew) Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) being the ""white face"" of Ron Stallworth at KKK meetings. There is extreme tension during Zimmerman's undercover scenes, and much of the humor occurs during Stallworth's phone conversations. Topher Grace is extremely effective as David Duke, a thankless role to say the least.Superb support work is widespread in this film that runs 2 hour and 15 minutes. Robert John Burke plays a no-nonsense Chief Bridges; Frederick Weller is racist jackass patrolman Andy Landers; Laura Harrier is Patrice, the Angela Davis lookalike activist and love interest; Jasper Paakkonen plays skeptical and high-strung Klansman Felix; Paul Walter Hauser (I, TONYA) is the comical and unnerving Ivanhoe; and even Harry Belafonte makes a surprise big screen appearance. Other notables include Alec Baldwin (in an opening that sets the stage), Nicholas Turturro, Damaris Lewis, Ryan Eggold, Isiah Whitlock Jr, and Arthur J Nascarella. It's a terrific and deep cast and they walk the fine line between entertainment and enlightenment. There is no shortage of Hollywood family genes and blending thanks to: Washington, Baldwin, Turturro, Buscemi, and Weller (it plays like 2 degrees of separation).A low-budget look to the film gives it an authenticity and 1970's vibe, and cinematographer Chayse Irvin works wonders with the camera in a multitude of situations where our attention should be on the dialogue of the characters rather than the colorfulness of set pieces. Black Ron running the show from a telephone (and a white voice) and White Ron face-first in the muck both have their burdens to bear, and much of the time, Zimmerman's is the more interesting of the two - although as a whole, it's an astonishing story.Perhaps Spike Lee set out to make the polar opposite of D.W. Griffith's 1915 most controversial film THE BIRTH OF A NATION, and he has certainly crafted one of the most effective films of his oeuvre. He also nails a few jabs at Trump and the current political climate, while the music from Terrence Blanchard perfectly complements the tone. Mr. Lee interjects some historic moments as well as some fictional ones - none more powerful than the back and forth chants of ""White Power"" ""Black Power"". At the conclusion, Lee serves up footage of Charlottesville, reminding us that the racism that caused us chuckles over the past couple of hours, remains prevalent today ... only that's not the least bit funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

As usual Mr. Lee tried to enhance visually, and personally I believe it was more distracting than art.

A forceful yet necessary film that shows how the past repeats itself,"Taking a unique style on a timely subject, BlacKkKlansman is a film that shoots right for your face and doesn't let you beat around the bush.

Whilst standing in front of a projector displaying videos across his body, it quickly cuts between many different takes with misspoken racist words Immediately establishing the parody that the movie was based upon. 
 The film follows an African-American police officer Ron Stallworth, played by John David Washington, who successfully infiltrates the KKK. With a very obvious problem of him not being KKK material, he enlisted the help of fellow white officer Flip Zimmerman, played by Adam Driver, who must act as him when meeting with the ""organization's"" members.
 Director Spike Lee took a very in your face approach to the film, not cutting anything out, going into great detail, and at some points pushing the envelope as far as he could. With many scenes filled with racist rants from KKK members, there is no way this film could be watchable by non-racist people without a superb director at the helm. Lee was able to give you a great balance that brought you to the edge of your seat without you falling out. He breaks up these hard to watch scenes with well-timed humor, and an overarching aura of ridiculousness and unbelievability. Many times throughout the film, your caught thinking to yourself that there is no way they can be serious, that no sane person could actually think these things. But the more unbelievable fact is that people did and some still do.
 John David Washington is a perfect fit for the role, he plays the very clever but quirky black cop in a white world to a tee. Giving a performance that is believable without hesitation. Paired with the up and down Adam Driver, playing a similar style character as from ""Logan Lucky"", always seems to find his way into these bizarre roles. He has a knack for embodying a slightly redneck character who doesn't give off a complete feeling of confidence. And it works. Each character is able to bounce off the next and not necessarily put in performances to remember, but performances that don't get in the way of the voice and message of the movie. 
 BlacKkKlansman does an incredible job of showing both sides of not just the KKK but also the Black Panthers. Maybe leaning towards one and not the other, but it gives a window into how these groups were organized and what they stood for. Juxtapositioning ""White Power"" with ""Black Power,"" the movie leaves the audience with evaluating not just their own beliefs but where the state of the country is. Moreover, the entire movie you are thinking how ridiculous these people's thoughts are and how could anyone really believe this. Then the film ends showing footage from Charlottesville and reminding us that those people aren't gone. There are still many people today who think this is how it really should be. 
 This day and age, movies are coming out about black people, women, gay people, and the underclass that are beginning to show to the country that there is whole other sides of life that we aren't used to seeing in popular culture. Spike Lee definitely joined in to that message now, and it's a push that will begin to hopefully educated the masses on what this country truly looks like. Especially if movies are going to be this well made, there is not an end on the horizon.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Spike Lee's artwork is funny, clever, however summed up with a sloppy and rushed ending.""","Spike Lee's artwork, Blackklansman is a movie, which is based on a true story, about a African American whom decides to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan.
It has stunning and well acted performances from both John David Washington (Monsters And Men, The Old Man & The Gun) and Adam Driver (Logan Lucky, Star Wars: The Last Jedi)
The movie manages to balance drama and comedy very well.
One moment might be very intense, over moments might be outright hilarious.
However, towards the end, Blackklansman gets very messy.
The movie feels very incomplete, which I may not get into due to the fact that this is a ""spoiler free"" review.
Also, the ending feels very rushed and clearly doesn't sum up the movie like a ending should.
However, all together, Blackklansman is a funny and clever movie, despite its ilogical ending that will most likely leave its viewers divided.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Though Left-leaning, with subtle jabs at President Trump, its message is still important for all Americans. Klansman illustrates how hate comes in All colors, and only by working together can we bring an end to the Cycle of Hate. You leave the theater hopeful, yet troubled by our country's racial hang-ups.

BlacKkKlansman - Cinema with CJ Review,"BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee spouting more of that fo' real, fo' real sh- and I dig.I dig real hard.A few slices from perfection, but still all in on all the things that still matter. It's pretty well worn the comments on how the film is perfectly timed and a wonderful snap back at the real state of the union, but in its real construction...That's what I'm talking about.For all the Trump parallels, the commentary on racism on all levels, the evolving but still problematic nature of police investigation, to all the other themes that stick and resonate so hard, especially in those last five minutes...Spike Lee reminds you once again why he teaches on the subject of film. He constructs a damn fine one.There's a sequence near the beginning that alone shows the power of powerful dialogue, strong direction, purposeful cinematography, and masterful editing. Then you get that throughout the rest of the film. BlacKkKlansman speaks through the medium of cinema in how calculated and important each cut is, and it speaks through Cinema itself. Hell, it opens with film footage that already throws in a reversal and then uses film further in many scenes following to play off the heroics of ""white"" cinema and ""black"" Cinema. Juxtaposition is alive and well in BlacKkKlansman and sometimes the simplest technique is the most powerful.We see how two worlds are so different through their similarities, and context truly plants where the line in the sand is. Lee has created another film to shine a light on how f-ed things are and some people are, and that times haven't really changed and that all lives matter. There are still some misjudged violent wrong people in the world and they haven't stopped yet. But Spike Lee has made another flick that can be put in cinemas and show us - because that's where we go to see our heroes - that there's good people fighting the good fight, and infiltrate hate.Because this film points out pretty easily...that hate is stupid.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Very Good Movie but Not Spike Lee's Return to Greatness,"I really liked most of this movie. John David Washington and Adam Driver's performances were great, the soundtrack was good, and the last 40 minutes of this movie were brilliantly crafted and powerful. Where this movie slips up is just how heavy handed it is. Spike Lee tries so hard to make this THE movie of 2018; the movie that tackles Trump and tackles racism more head on than any movie recently, but instead of Spike Lee's attempts coming off as relevant and ""important"", it mostly comes off as annoying. Don't get me wrong, I agree with what Spike Lee was trying to say, but did he have to beat me over the head with the obvious themes of the film and then scream them into my face. Spike Lee needs to learn what subtly is. Also, this movie tries to be funny in many places, but mostly all the jokes just don't land.Like I said, I liked this move but it's not the best movie of the year like a lot of critics are making it out to be. This is not Spike Lee's return to being a great filmmaker, and it's nowhere near the quality of Lee's earlier movies like Malcolm X.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

By itself it is a very well paced, humorous and thrilling movie.
I found the direction and photography incredible, Most of the time I was impressed by how well Lee has mastered his craft and found a group of professionals to work with that elevate his art.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee shows the problems of racism on a realistic and with some comical moments with BlacKkKlansman.,"BlacKkKlansman is a biographical crime drama directed by Spike Lee, the director of Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X. The film is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first African-American agent who managed to infiltrate Ku Klux Klan.
In the film, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is one of the first African Americans to work with the police in Colorado Springs. Here he is treated as a lesser person by his colleagues because of his skin color, but Ron does not try to attract too much of it here.
In order to get a better job, Ron manages to make contact with the Ku Klux Klan by telephone and knows how to draw their interest with insults about the dark people. When Ron is invited to come by during a Klan meeting, he asks his partner Flip Zimmerman to play his role as a person.
So they infiltrate in the Klan with Flip as Ron's personal character, while Ron himself continues to work as a telephone contact with the Klan. For example, they must continue to play Ron Stallworth until they reach the Klan high enough to access most secret plans and then stop them as agents. In order to succeed in this, Ron and Flip have to keep their actions for many secrets. Flip is known as an agent and should try not to stand out too much and Ron can not easily warn befriended African Americans how to get information about the dangerous plans of the Klan.
This film plays well and informally on the problems of racism of the past and present. The film responds so realistically to how people who were formerly no white Christians were seen and treated as inferior. Despite the fact that this is no longer done so extremely, unfortunately it still happens too much that people treat their skin color or belief as negatives or are treated by, for example, extreme right-wing politics or people who have less and still remain to blame. to give. That is why this film is important to watch in order to learn and see more about this subject. For example, the end of this film contains real images of true racist situations of the past and present.
Spike Lee tells the story in this film a bit in a dark comical way to keep the film nice despite the dark theme. For example, some scenes have a laugh in the film, but in most scenes the film remains serious and exciting where the two agents try to keep their work secret. Spike Lee also added some slight adjustments to the film to make it more like a film.The acting is also done well and realistic in the film. John David Washington has not had many major roles in his acting career, but still puts down good work as the main role of this film. He also delivers good acting that clearly shows how difficult his character is in certain scenes in this film. You can sometimes tell from his voice that he is the zoom of Denzel Washington, but despite that he gets out of the shadow of his father with this film.
Adam Driver also performs good acting and comes out especially well in the exciting scenes where he is an undercover agent between members of the Klu Klux Klan. Topher Grace David Duke plays the leader of the Klan in this film. It is special to see an actor best known from the comedy show That '70s Show now as the racist leader of the Klu Klux Klan. Like other actors who play members of the Klan, he has also admitted how difficult it is to play such a dark role, and Topher Grace also said that he felt very depressed after playing this role.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

BlacKkKlansman,"What a fun movie, irreverent but impactful, walking that thin line of making a point and making a joke so we'll until the very end.There's just so much here, so many layers, all so well portrayed. Like many movies with a strong message, it does tend to champion one side and demonize the other but, in this case... We'll, it's hard to make look real good.That said, whether intentional or not, there were some shots that really evokes a sense of how dangerous radicalism can be, regardless of what side it's on. There's a definite undertone here that goes beyond the normally portrayed tenants of racism and instead touches on a broader sense of equality, of trying to see things from another person's perspective which is endlessly important.That said, the last couple minutes forgoes the entire tone of the movie to try and show us what's still happening today but it's jarring in the worst way and doesn't fit at all. Remove the actual news footage and this is a better movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee's Best Movie Since BAMBOOZLED -- Maybe His Best Ever!,"I've never been a fan of Spike Lee's movies, not because I disagree with his angry views but because as works of entertainment his pictures always impressed me as being profoundly mediocre. With a few notable exceptions, (such as the superb cultural study BAMBOOZLED), a typical Spike Lee Joint is shrill, preachy, and one-dimensional, with flat characters, forced comic situations, a lot of lecturing and very little action.But this movie is different. This powerful, action packed police drama made me totally rethink the limits of Spike Lee's talent.For the first time in his career, Spike shows subtlety and restraint. He allows the characters to live and grow on screen, instead of just shouting at each other. He allows the story to make the points he wants to make, instead of just stopping the action so the characters can lecture the audience.The power of this movie comes from the fact that the storytelling is very quiet, almost low-key. When the black cop calls up the Klan and tries to enroll, at first it seems like a prank. But soon it becomes very serious. And when the Jewish cop has to step in as the ""double"" of the invisible Klan recruit, you can feel the tension building just in the way Flip Zimmerman becomes better and better at playing a racist white man who hates Jews. John David Washington is a classic leading man, but Adam Diver really steals the show as the complex and conflicted Zimmerman. This is the first Spike Lee movie I've ever seen where a white man is something other than a menace or a buffoon. (""But black men are portrayed that way all the time!"" I know, Spike. I know.)It was so obvious that this time out Spike was working with better camera people, better film editors, and a better composer to write the haunting musical score. As the cops, black radicals, and Klansmen rushed headlong to their final showdown, with a literal ticking bomb to provide suspense, I didn't feel like I was being preached to or bullied. I felt like I was caught up in the story . . . caught up in the action. And I didn't want the story to end.This isn't a perfect movie, of course. There were some awkward moments, some characters that didn't work out. Young Corey Hawkins effortlessly delivers the goods as a fiery orator, while an aging Harry Belafonte struggles to project emotion as he recounts a lynching from decades ago. It's also interesting that Spike Lee has moved on from challenging the Jewish and Italian racists in his own beloved NYC, in movies like DO THE RIGHT THING, and is now more interested in a can't-miss attack on a culturally acceptable basket of ignorant hillbilly stereotypes. On the one hand, I appreciated the subtlety of naming one of the Klansmen ""Ivanhoe."" (Sir Walter Scott's white fantasy of European chivalry set the pattern for the all-white escapism of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Martin alike.) On the other hand, setting up the mean Klansman's fat and ugly wife to be the ultimate villain in the film panders to a whole lot of prejudices that have nothing to do with racism.It's no accident that the ridiculously mannered Anthony Lane at the NEW YORKER sneered at the evil Klan wife in his review as a ""doofus."" To a bejeweled dowager like Anthony Lane, all poor white people are ridiculous and contemptible. Lane is so eager to flaunt his class privilege that he's even willing to pretend to admire Spike Lee. And Spike is happy to flatter his upper-class prejudices in order to get his story told. It's a beautifully symbiotic relationship. But the snobbery and hypocrisy of the liberal elite only intensifies the appeal of Donald Trump . . . or the Ku Klux Klan. Spike Lee can't be expected to solve this problem, but sooner or later the liberal elite will have to confront it. There will always be poor whites who resent minorities, but ninnies like Anthony Lane and magazines like the NEW YORKER aren't part of the solution . . . they're part of the problem.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Promising but propagandistic,"The movie has some very good features: photography is great, acting is quite good, decorations and music are nice, the vibe of the movie is positive and the story behind it is really cool.

"Lighthearted story about racism in the seventies, portraying the story of 2 cops who went undercover in a racist organisation. Good acting performances.","Generally speaking a lighthearted story about racism, with lots of tongue in cheek jokes and a few dark and cruel racist scenes as well. The story is based on real events about 2 cops, one white, one black, who went undercover in a racist organisation in the seventies. Did they succeed in bringing racists to justice by going undercover? That is the cliffhanger of this story.Direction is ok, acting as well and the story is quite interesting because it was based on real events that happened in the seventies. Any bad? Well, not really, only 1 thing at the very end. What took me off guard is what happened at the end (last 10 minutes) of this movie. It hammered down a political correct message from politics from today by showing some explicit violent REAL LIFE news footage about race riots. Why does Spike Lee do that? His message at the end is superfluous in my opinion and only substracts from the powerful fictional story that has already just been told about racism in the seventies.This weird choice to start mixing real life news footage from today in a fictional movie really is in bad taste in my opinion. Never seen it done before in this blunt way. Make a fictional movie OR make a documentary. Make a choice.

Would you believe this story if I told you it in a bar?,"You know those stories that are extremely hard to believe? Those are the best, you listen to them drinking your beverage, laughing and trying to stick some logic to the events but eventually give up and just enjoy? This one is pretty much like it, but a pressing matter constantly flows in the air, jumps to your face and doesn't rest a minute. This matter is racism.Spike Lee doesn't allow you to divert your attention from the wrongdoings of white supremacists. It not wrong, but the realism is too cruel. It's hard to watch the movie easily, when you understand all the horrors of racial hatred. The undercover story though is unbelievable and is kind of fun, when you realize that all those ""high standards"" are so easily fooled that no one notices two guys that represent one of the biggest enemies of the clan: Black and Jewish folk respectively, to infiltrate the organization.I was really impressed by Adam Driver's performance, showing that he can act while acting and his army experience made him even better in portraying a cop. John David Washington stunned by a great range of emotions. Love how all his concerns directly appear on his face, delivering a powerful statement of a man fighting for the right thing.Throughout many serious moments quite a lot of funny stuff is happening that relieves you from the tension and ridicules the ""organization"".

The kind of historical film we need,"""BlacKkKlansman"" is, I think, one of my favorite 'Based on a True Story' movies I've ever seen, and that's saying something. From fantastic performances to it's hilarious moments of attention-grabbing comedy to it's difficult and horrifying truths, ""BlacKkKlansman"" stands out because of just how raw and real it feels despite creative liberties taken with historical accuracy--and that's a good thing.I could talk about the cinematography and the acting and the direction for a long time, but I'd rather discuss what makes this movie truly unique in my eyes: the message is prioritized above all else. Far too many historical movies get lost in the minutia of historical accuracy that they forget to remind us why this story matters. If too much energy is devoted to period accurate set and costumes, to keeping the story strictly within the time period, the message can easily get buried. Now, historical accuracy is by no means a bad thing, but in ""BlacKkKlansman""s case, it is less important than telling a story of white supremacy in the modern era, police violence, and solidarity between minority groups. Through John David Washington's Ron, Adam Driver's Flip, and Laura Harrier's Patrice, Spike Lee tells a tale of how each of these characters has a different role in combating white supremacy, and how none of them are less valuable than the others. The characters may disagree on methodology at times, but the film really portrays how much risk each of these people put themselves at to fight for their unified cause.Three scenes really jump out to me in the way of overall tone and message. The first is the scene in which Kwame Ture is speaking to the Black Student Union. This scene is incredibly powerful because of how the faces of the crowd overlay the speech about black beauty and excellence. Secondly, Adam Driver's monologue about his own Jewish identity is extremely moving because he talks about how he used to never be fearful or uncomfortable about his own identity as a Jewish man, but ever since he entered the fight against white supremacy, he has begun to constantly think about his identity. This scene is particularly poignant because of how it expresses the dichotomy between being comfortable and somewhat complacent versus being uncomfortable and active. Lastly, the heartbreaking ending reminds the audience of just how relevant the issues presented in the film remain, and how little progress it feels like we've made. This scene makes it unequivocally clear the message Spike Lee is attempting to portray: we still have a long way to go, as a nation, and we must continue to fight white supremacy, because it still exists.""BlacKkKlansman"" doesn't beat around the bush in telling the audience what is means; rather, it slaps the audience in the face with meaning. And that is exactly what we need right now. This movie exists to make its audience uncomfortable with the way our society is now, but it also inspires us to make a change. It is, without a doubt, one of my favorite historical films, and a film that everyone should see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

And honestly, even after the half of the film I was still trying hard to enjoy the film and to convince myself that the turn of the events must be later amazing if I wait enough. Unfortunately the promised climax was nothing but a ""nah"" and the typical Holywood clichés started pouring down that I don't know how many times I had to roll my eyes. There were other problems as well, like the editing which didn't make a lot of sense in some scenes and also the soundtrack. The main theme coming up in most of the scenes killed the whole vibe as it sounded like a cheap erotic b-film and even the jokes didn't work and come to rescue. By the way, I really respect Adam Driver and love how he progressed in his career, but seriously, how could he get an Oscar nomination for this role?

"Teachers, Leave the Audience Alone","Story of first African-American detective in the city's police department as he sets out to infiltrate and expose the local Ku Klux Klan chapter sound so incredible that it just has to be true.There are so many interesting and subtle elements in movie that make great addition to story. Spike Lee does good job in portraying situation, surroundings and reasons why it's so hard to make a change - even with a people willing to make one, it's dangerous turn it into reality. He also dares to start questioning the individualism of movements - when does ""me"" become ""we"" and individual becomes idea (even if it is for good cause) undistinguishable from the rest of crowd? Footage from Gone with the wind with ""wounded"" Confederation flag and Ku Klux Klan part in The Birth of The Nation is provocative remainder (although not first to mention it) of past times and raises interesting question.There is just one problem with movie that for me makes all the difference. Films (and plays) are there to give experience, not to teach. The thing Lee avoided so elegantly in the past films is exam he fails so clearly in this one for one simple reason: in his best work it was never about teaching audience, but simply telling the story. This is what he does in first 1/3 of BlakcKkKlansman and when the movie is at its best with no pressure in ""making the point"". As soon as he tries to make one (in fact in moment when any director tries to make one) it starts to fall apart and falls into cliches he is trying to avoid. It starts with Trump miniatures in dialogues that seems as nice auteur expression at beginning, continues with inserting ""change the world"" parts in otherwise engaging dialogue (something director would say, not characters), Harry Belafonte giving monologue about African American suffering that seems so obligatory and culminates with Charlottesville footage, for all people who didn't watch the previous 98 minutes of movie.Loosing respect for audience intelligence is one of the worst things that can happen to film director. He resembles parent who wishes to teach children by lecturing them, while children at same time crave for real life experience. It will not work for simple fact that we all have organic adversity of being programmed by other people. We are truly touched by other people's experiences that makes us think.Ironically, but not illogically, Lee does his best with limited sources. I remember accidentally stumbling on Do The Right Thing on TV many years ago. I signed up for comedy, ended up with movie that stuck with me till today. All it tried to do is tell a simple story about hanging pictures in one pizzeria, and ended up telling story about human character, relationships and love. I kept thinking about it hours after it ended. BlackKkKlansman took different approach - it's more direct story that tries to be larger than life. I was doing my best to be touched, I honestly did, but there was nothing left for me to do since Lee did it all the thinking for me.There is one thing I was left with, although not sure director did it intentionally. As I scrolled against the list of Oscar nominees for last couple of years I couldn't help noticing it was less and less about movies and more about political correctness. Let's be honest - Oscar never was about auteur cinema, but in most cases it had respect for quality that would stand the test of times. I hope that after it pays its due to all movies with agenda, it will turn to filmmakers in pursuit of telling the story. I cannot help myself thinking about Paul Thomas Anderson, caucasian middle aged auteur from San Francisco who usually tells interesting stories about ""ordinary"" people. It's just about character's lives and relationships, nothing more. It's something Spike Lee used to do.There is parole in BlacksKkKlansman that says: All Power To All People! (which actually doesn't make a sense if you properly think about it). I propose another one: All Power To Story Telling Filmmakers!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing!!!,"So I gave this movie an 8 because of a few reasons... first the reason I decided to even watch this movie was because President Obama named it one of his 2018 favorites. Now, after seeing the movie, I can tell you with confidence I know why. This movie is unique, authentic and heartfelt. The ending brought me to tears. I think the acting could have been a little bit better, especially the love story between the officer and the Black Panther president... I wanted to feel Dead Presidents vibes.

"too much filler, not enough thriller","I feel like I've been criticising a lot of woke films lately; I haven't gone looking for them, but any new film on British TV at the moment seems to have an agenda, and the trouble is they're just not very good.This one sounded like it had an interesting premise, and in Spike Lee a director with some prestige - even if, like Tarantino, it was always more hype than substance. But, disregarding the basic director's tenet 'don't tell, show', he sits his audience down and lectures them for segments of five or ten minutes at at time about the evils of racism in the old-time South. We know racism is bad, and in any case it's implicit in the main story; couldn't he have just got on with telling that story as interestingly as possible? Some scenes were almost ludicrously reminiscent of the pietistic Biblical films of the 50s, individually lit young faces gazing up in awe at the wise old man telling them of their People's struggles.In the end we weren't actually engaged enough to watch the finale, and switched over to see some boxing. At least there you can be sure that something will happen.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It isn't subtle, but it's certainly powerful.","There's no real room for subtlety in 'BlacKkKlansman (2018)', a film that's almost alarming in its frankness and its ability to draw blank parallels between its seventies setting and our still-troubled modern times. It's this decision not to leave anything to interpretation that gives the piece its real sense of urgency, as it feels as though it's grabbing you by the shoulders, shaking you as hard it can and yelling, ""look at what's happening, still to this day - wake up!"" It really is a powerful experience, one that feels especially relevant today; it's very much a response to America's current political climate. It isn't always a pleasant watch (by necessity) and often evokes a real sense of anger, both at its more deplorable characters and at its overall situation. However, the feature somehow manages to be entertaining, harrowing, moving, frightening, funny, vexing, ironic and sobering all at once. It seems to encapsulate everything, to say all that needs to be said, and it feels really significant in a way that's difficult to describe. It's a cultural statement that will be looked at for years to come and, no matter what effect it has or how it's remembered, it's happening right now and it's as real as it gets. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Compulsivly Watchable Future Classic,"Spike Lee remains one of the most interesting American directors working at this moment, regardless of the varying quality of his work as of late, it's immediately apparent with any of his projects that even in his early 60s he remains just as eager to experiment and indulge as he was when he got out of film school. Even his outright bad films contain so much cinematic flair and so many flat out ballsy choices, that they are worth watching. BlacKkKlansman, his best film of late, bounces with so much energy that it's easy to forget how much of the runtime is given to discussion, how much is dedicated for varying parties to reveal their view points and logic. Its a film which bounces effortlessly between black comedy and police procedural, which is filled equally with gut busting wit and sweat inducing suspense, and most importantly which never skimps on entertainment. But Lee is always aware that his film is first and foremost a vehicle to deliver social commentary, and he ends the film on a left field gut punch the likes of which haven't been seen since Do the Right Thing. After 2 hours of laughter and a good time, the final frames of this film left me speechless in a way that few films have, and crystallize the films message in the boldest terms imaginable. Many people will hate this film because of its politics, because it states things that are frankly uncomfortable to think about, but the message is supported by top knotch craftsmanship, the filmmaking on display is inspired to say the least, and it feels like Lee is again filled with the same infectious energy which made him a legend 30 years ago.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good but not great,"Spike Lee is a top notch story teller and an obvious talent, but sometimes he lets his politics (and his latent hatred...and maybe even his racism) crowd out his talent.I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie and it was a must see after watching Lee's behavior at the Oscars; I just had to see what all the fuss was about. So while I would certainly recommend anyone to see Blackkklansman I wouldn't make the argument that it deserved best picture.The acting was very good, the screenplay excellent, etc. But the film, like a lot of others, was needlessly long and could've done without some scenes. I got the impression that Lee wanted to make sure he made his political points while telling a story. For instance, he wanted the villains to look as stupid and backwards as possible. We get it, racists are stupid and backwards, but the audience doesn't have to be hit over the head with it.If I could speak with Lee I'd tell him to make more movies...and maybe take some anger management classes as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I had never seen a Spike Lee movie before, but I knew his name thanks to Télérama. So let's talk about the film. To me, this fascinating film is very good way to send a message about racism in the USA. First of all, the actors are talented and they make this film very funny. I already knew John David Washington as East in The Walking Dead show, but he impressed me as Ron Stallworth. I also liked the actor game of Adam driver as Flip who was a very interesting character. In short, the cast of this film is excellent. I really like this kind of story because to me, racism is one of the worst crime in the world and I didn't know a lot of things about the Ku Klux Klan.

"A confrontational and highly effective ""Joint"" by the veteran director","BlacKkKlansman is a biographical drama film co-written and directed by Spike Lee. Based on the non-fiction book ""Black Klansman"" by Ron Stallworth, it is a confrontational and highly effective ""Joint"" by the veteran director.In 1972, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is hired as the first African-American detective at a Colorado Springs police department. Initially given menial tasks around the police station, John decides to branch out and requests to work as an undercover agent at a local Ku Klux Klan rally. Fully aware that the KKK would never accept a black man into their organisation, John suggests the idea of using his co-worker, white Jewish police officer Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to pretend to be him when meeting with other Klan members in person, while still maintaining verbal contact over the phone.As ingenious as it is aggressive, BlacKkKlansman is easily one of Spike Lee's best films in years and a solid commentary on society's views on racism in America. As to be expected, Lee does not hold back in showcasing the racial epithets and slang used against African Americans. However, he also chooses to juxtapose this with an extreme depiction of black nationalism in certain scenes, and this brings something of a balance to the overall story and makes it seem less biased. The acting between the two leads John David Washington (Denzel Washington's son) and Adam Driver is fantastic and it helps to make what may have been considered a farfetched plot had it not been a true story seem so believable. If one can stomach some of the more extreme scenes of racism and injustice, then this ""Joint"" is certainly worth the time to watch and discuss afterwards.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Conflicted Experience,"First of all, i did learn a couple of things that i had to look up after the movie that i found genuinely interesting and fascinating, having said that the movie touches on a very good subject but ultimately is just not very good as a movie because of pacing issues.
It's very hard for me to put the finger on it and verbalize what bothered me about the movie. I felt very disconnected with the characters mostly but was very interested in the story itself and the underlying issues.
Being called a racist if you don't like this movie shows exactly nowadays herd mentality, i was under the impression that i'm going in to watch a movie, and i will judge it as that, this is not a documentary that aim's to be judged on the researched facts. Consequently i'm also willing to forgive certain historical inaccuracies.
As i said initially the pacing is all over the place, some odd scenes in that are absolutely unnecessary to drive the story forward - but most important the ""schtick"" of this movie that the trailer showed was not necessary (and not adding anything) in my opinion in the end. Some scenes also felt incredibly rushed and felt like there was 20 minutes of additional content just missing for them to make sense, especially towards the end.
Having said all this i wasn't particularly bored, just mostly irritated and not very immersed. I don't regret going to see it, but i would not recommend the movie without reservations, i felt this is a bit of a missed opportunity and could have been even heavier on the subject.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Smart, terrifying and brutally funny","I've gotta be honest, with a trailer like that, ""BlacKkKlansman"" held little chance of disappointment; not with such a charismatic performance from John David Washington. I can't even think of a weakness in this cast. The minute you see Alec Baldwin as a right-wing firebrand, you know you're in for something special.It all starts with the wild premise - a black police detective infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan - the mechanics of such an operation are massively entertaining, and the sheer audacity of it is a constant eye-brow raiser. There's unbridled evil lurking throughout this movie, but it comes in the form of the small-minded. Let's face it, these white supremacists are morons (led by an equally hapless Topher Grace as David Duke), and their cruel intentions are regularly undermined by their simple natures. But Spike Lee pulls no punches here. The statement he's out to make with this is as time-worn as it is aggressive: hate finds its way into the top levels of power. And he makes no bones about tying it directly to modern-day politics.In the end, this is a delightful period piece with an impressive cast and more than its share of laughs; a wicked surprise all around.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie perfectly describe how rough the climate between balck and white people was in the 70's US society, and how it hasn't really changed nowadays.

In today's life in the United States, people are living the same tensions during the Civil Rights riots in the 50's and 60's, extremism is upcoming, people die for their opinions and a huge wave of violence divide the country in different parts.

"Polemical, didactic, confrontational, angry, trenchant - a state-of-the-nation address","BlacKkKlansman is a film with a lot on its mind. It opens with one of the most (in)famous scenes fromGone with the Wind (1939), before pivoting to a fictional precursor ofAlex Joneslecturing the audience on the dangers of the ""negroid"", and later takes in everything from Kwame Ture to David Duke, before lambastingThe Birth of a Nation (1915), criticising the tropes of classic Blaxploitation films, going into agonising detail regarding the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington, sardonically criticising police bureaucracy, and concluding with a montage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, intercut with Duke championing Donald Trump's presidency, and Trump's own reluctance to condemn the white supremacist component of the rally. The film then ends with an upside-down black and white American flag (a symbol for ""dire distress""). Yep; this is a film with a lot to say.Telling the story of Rob Stallworthy (John David Washington), a black police officer in Colorado Springs who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in 1979, at its core, BlacKkKlansman is about institutional racism in the United States. Ostensibly dealing with the 1970s manifestation of such, the film's real point is that in 2018, not only is such racism still a problem, it's now even more endemic, due to its pseudo-legitimacy in the wake of Trump's election, and the concomitant upsurge in hate crime across the country.Co-writer/directorSpike Lee's combative intent is signalled in the first scene, which is actually a scene from Gone with the Wind; Scarlett O'Hara wandering through the thousands of wounded and dead Confederate soldiers after the Battle of Atlanta, as a crane shot pulls back to show the devastation, finally coming to rest on a tattered Confederate Navy Jack. The implication is clear - this is very much the world of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, the belief that prior to Reconstruction, the Antebellum South was an urbane and benign society, with the Confederacy heroically fighting the corrupt Union so as to preserve the inherently honourable southern way of life.Lee keeps up the confrontational tack in the film's second scene, which depicts the fictional cultural anthropologist Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin), who, in grainy black-and-white footage tries to alert the audience to the fact that the negorids are attempting to take over the country. What's especially well done here is how Lee usesD.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. As footage plays behind Beauregard, his face is erased of its colour - he is literally rendered white enough to become part of the image, which depicts a narrative built around the inherently virtuous nature of being white. It's a powerful shot that clearly tells us, yes, this is a comedy, and yes, these people are ridiculous, but also alerting us to the fact that Lee is not playing around here.But what is Lee's point? The cultural instability of the United States in 2018, with its entrenched institutional racism, an entire race of people once again being treated like second class citizens because of the amount of melanin in their skin, hateful rhetoric masquerading as national pride, the breakdown of the distinction between xenophobia and patriotism, and the transition of hate crimes from the fringes of society into the realm of social acceptability. The film suggests that organisational racism once existed half-way between the absurd and the dangerous, but in recent years, it has moved in the wrong direction. Even before we get to the chilling closing montage, Lee and his co-writers (Charlie Wachtel,David Rabinowitz, andKevin Willmott) have dropped a few subtle allusions to Trump's presidency. In one scene, Stallworth confidently asserts that it doesn't matter how much of a legitimate businessman Duke becomes, and no matter how much he hides his racism behind more patriotic rhetoric such as immigration and crime, the country would never elect a crass, hate-filled racist as president. In another scene, David Duke (Topher Grace) explains he and the KKK are ""making America great again."" These two allusions would be enough to get the point across, but it would also mean that that point remains in the realm of comedy, and is therefore easily dismissed. The closing montage changes that, as it drops all pretence of humour in depicting what happened in Charlottesville, and Trump's asinine response. This is very much a state-of-the-nation address.In relation to Birth of a Nation, of course, things are more complicated than they are in relation to Gone with the Wind. Yes, the film is horrifically racist, and yes, it was singlehandedly responsible for the 20th century revival of the KKK, but it is also probably the most important film ever made, and literally wrote the book on screen grammar. Conceivably, Gone with the Wind could be removed from the canon and no longer taught, but Birth absolutely could not. It is a foundational text, an undeniable landmark film, completely independent of its politics. Birth is based onThomas Dixon Jr.'s 1905 novel The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan. The second book in his KKK trilogy, the novel valorises the practises and institutions designed to oppress black people, whilst depicting emancipated slaves and Yankee carpetbaggers as the ""real"" villains behind the Civil War, positing that the plight of the freedmen during Reconstruction was a direct result of their liberation (i.e., they (and the south in general) would have been better off had they remained slaves). In Dixon's depiction of the lawless society of the south, created by the Union, where coloureds can walk around freely, southern whites have become the target of racial violence, with freedmen being particularly fond of raping white women. In the trilogy, the Klan are depicted as arising from this maelstrom, honourable and heroic men forced to reluctantly take the law into their own hands so as to stop the rampage. So influential was the film that the modern KKK practices of wearing white hoods and burning crosses come from it, not from the original 1865-1871 incarnation of the Klan.Lee uses Birth twice - in the Beauregard scene, and in a later scene where his use of it speaks to the formal complexity of his own work. One of the most important of Griffith's innovations was that of parallel editing (better known today as cross-cutting), something we all take for granted in everything from films to commercials to music videos. In a nutshell, parallel editing is when two separate actions from two separate locations are intercut to suggest they are happening simultaneously, often, but not always, to heighten tension. It's one of the most fundamental components of screen grammar, so much so we don't even think about it today - we just take it as given. However, Lee's genius in this scene is that he uses Birth to mock the Klan by way of, you guessed it, parallel editing. As the KKK sit down to watch Birth, Lee intercuts their enjoyment of its absurdities with Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) telling the story of the barbaric lynching of Jesse Washington, which saw a crowd of over 10,000 people in Waco, Texas, cheering on as his testicles and fingers were cut off, after which he was slowly burned to death by being continually raised over a fire. Lee uses parallel editing here so as to have one scene comment on the other - he is literally using Birth's own innovations against it and what it represents. Birth may be politically abhorrent, but Lee is savvy enough to not only recognise its technological importance, but to co-opt that importance and use it for his own ends, showing us the stunned reaction to a vicious murder contrasted with a celebration of the conditions which led to that murder.As all of this may suggest, yes, the film is preachy, but that's because Lee is preaching. He makes no apology for such. This is polemic filmmaking, and the move into heavy didacticism in the final montage is completely earned.All of this is not to say the film is perfect, however. For example, how he employs the double dolly shot (which he has used throughout his filmography to suggest characters' inability to control their own actions as they are inexorably pushed forward, divested of the contextualisation of their environment), raises some interesting problems, suggesting, as it does, that orthodox black activism and underground black militancy must combine forces in the face of hate. The film also glosses over Stallworth's time in COINTELPRO, where he worked to sabotage radical black organisations, because this doesn't fit into the overarching theme the film is constructing. Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), Stallworth's partner, who poses as him during face-to-face meetings with the Klan, being Jewish is also problematic (the real person he was based upon is known only as Chuck, and all we know about him is that he definitely wasn't Jewish). Is Zimmerman supposed to represent Republican voters who abhor the KKK as much as the political left do? Who knows, because beyond being Jewish, there's no further character development; he's more of a rhetorical device, a meme rather than a person with an inner life. Similarly, the fictional explosion towards the end of the story serves to distastefully simplify everything, once more making the KKK look foolish, something which is wholly unnecessary at this point in the film, whilst also positing Stallworth as a clichéd movie hero, something Lee has avoided up until this point.These are relatively minor complaints, however. Look, Lee is far from my favourite filmmaker. I really dislikedMalcolm X (1992), for example, probably his most celebrated film, and he has justifiably been accused of racism himself on multiple occasions. None of that, however, changes the fact that this is an hilarious, powerful, insightful, and frightening piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Spike Lee joint,"""BlacKkKlansman"" is proof that Spike Lee is basically the best filmmaker making topical movies today, in this extraordinarily divided political climate.It will probably not convert anyone who isn't already on the side of the filmmakers, but it is never less than interesting.It tells the true story of two police officers, one black, one Jewish, who infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. David Duke, the still extant former klan leader, is portrayed in the film by a restrained and creepy Topher Grace.The film has a couple of genuinely heartening moments that put a smile on my face, and a stirring montage of actual film clips of recent years to conclude the film, and frame the true story in today's world.Spike Lee does not just make topical, controversial films, a la Oliver Stone. He is an auteur with a lively and unique style of his own. His films are, as near as I can tell always of interest. He has what Pauline Kael called ""film sense"", knowing what works and what doesn't.Even among his superlative record, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It isn't Lee's best work, but arguably his most ambitious","Although he is still producing an impressive body of work, it feels like Spike Lee has been away from the mainstream for an age. When Jordan Peele brought him the unbelievably true story of Ron Stallworth, a black detective who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s, Lee jumped at the chance to tackle what would be his biggest joint since 2013's rather pointless Oldboy remake. If the movie didn't tell you as much at the introduction, you would likely have a difficult time believing that what you are seeing actually (well, kinda) happened. Based on Stallworth's memoir Black Klansman, Lee takes the story and successfully manipulates it into a commentary on racial hostility in the U.S. and its circular momentum throughout the country's history. Not only that, but BlacKkKlansman is also a funny police procedural that tips its outlandish hat to the blaxsploitation movies of the era.Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) has just become the first black police officer in the Colorado Springs police department. He is eager to make a mark, but finds himself assigned to the records room, locating files for his racist co-workers. After making his desire to work undercover known to his superiors, Ron is tasked with infiltrating a rally involving civil rights leader Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), where he meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of a black student union. Assigned to the intelligence division, Ron spots an advert in the paper for a KKK recruitment drive and, with his best white man voice, bags himself a meeting with Walter (Ryan Eggold), the president of the local chapter. His fellow officers are quick to point that not only did Ron give Walter his real name, he also happens to be black. Enter Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), the Jewish co-worker who takes the job of working his way into the ranks of the ever-suspicious Klan, while Ron does his part on the phone to try and land a conversation with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).BlacKkKlansman is certainly not without its flaws. Lee's desire to envelop Ron and Patrice's blossoming romance into the KKK's plan to carry out a terrorist attack leads to some glaring pacing issues, and an eagerness to hold up a mirror to the growing far-right attitudes of the Trump era can often be heavy-handed. Yet Lee's interesting style - mixing comedy with serious issues and often within the same scene - pulls you along for the ride, with the director showcasing a rarely-seen talent for suspense. Flip's assignment is fraught with problems, from the volatile and suspicious Klansman Felix (Jasper Paakkonen), to the fact that Ron's voice sounds oddly different on the phone to real life. Some of the supporting characters are perhaps a bit too cartoonish for the film's overall tone, the script from Lee, Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz and Kevin Willmott, is incredibly sharp and witty without taking anything away from the seriousness of the underlying themes at play. Lee goes straight for the jugular, ending with shocking footage of the car attack at the 2017 Unite the Right rally to remind us of how little has changed, and how the threat never really went away. It isn't Lee's best work, but its one of his most vibrant and cinematic joints, and arguably his most ambitious.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Maturation of a Master filmmaker,"What we have here is Director on the level of a Ford or Spielberg. This film is an American masterpiece that should be mandatory viewing by anyone who dreams of coming to America. Lee's America is the real America. The ' It's too late to turn back now' scene is pure gold. After seeing this, I went back and watched Lee's other films, and now they make sense to me. We should all sit back and leave him alone and let him do what he does best- tell the great American story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gripping, eye-opening but quite tedious and ridiculous","First, I think that the actors' performance is very good, especially Adam Driver as Flip. Besides, the film has some quite funny moments and on the other hand, some upsetting and moving moments, wich make a very good mixture. But sometimes, especially with Laura Harrier as Patrice, I found the film boring and also not at all realistic. So, from my point of view, the members of the KKK are ridiculous. Thereby, the film can't be taken seriously when the villains in the movie are very cliché. It looks like a comedy, not a realistic film, which wants to be convincing. Even if the cast is great, it needs to be more serious. Besides, the film has a surpising ending, which I think is interesting because the script is very smart. On a scale of 0 to 10, i give this film a six because even if there is a good cast and a good script, sometimes it's long and slow. I can recommend it because the storyline is good and creative, and also because Adam Driver is one of the lead characters. Fans of him must see his great performance ! And Finally, the soundtrack is compelling and corresponds to the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Schockingly relevant,"An important and absolutely relevant film these days. I loved how Spike Lee mixed history with little hints of today's political situation sometimes more literal than expected. Lee portrays racism as an never ending conflict and war but also kind of spoofs it in a very respectful way. Even if some of the characters were too cartoonish for my taste. Like Connie.
Nevertheless it was an important and effectly entertaining ride that gives us some of the best performances of the years at this stage. First of all there is Denzel's son John David Washington's who inheritated his fathers talent and follows his legacy. Another great performance came from Adam Driver who is Devine and steals many of the films scenes. Jasper Päakkönen gives possibly the best performance in the film. Sure his character appears to be very cartoonish too, on the paper however he is convincing with his rough and sometimes frightening aura. Laura Harrier was also wonderful and gives the film the right heart and soul. Nice change for Topher Grace in an unexpected role. Great cameo by Alec Baldwi. The score was fantastic, some editing really wonderful. Its your typical Spike Lee joint... as it was made in the 90s so glad he is back to good quality films again. The screenplay was very good as well and I loved the general look of it. Good film with many great references of the actual situation. The ending footage was heartbreaking and the most perfect way to end a film like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee's return to form,"BlacKkKlansman for the most part was good. I was impressed with the way Spike Lee handled the film considering his last few ventures didn't work out. This was a film I could tell he really cared about.The overall presentation of the movie was great. It was well shot and had some great cinematography. The soundtrack, in particular, got me into the mood of the film. The main theme, to this day, is very catchy and still playing in my head on loop.This was the first time I witnessed John David Washington act and I felt he did full justice to his role and played it off really well. Adam Driver was also fantastic and hilarious in many parts of the film. His chemistry with Washington felt believable. Topher Grace was great as well. The acting overall was solid.I liked Lee's approach to the film. Whilst trying to spread awareness of themes like racism, Lee mixes the seriousness of this issue with some lighthearted humour which kept me invested with these characters. Whilst I did feel the story was predictable and knew what direction the film was taking towards the 3rd act, I didn't lose interest due to the subject matter and interactions between each character. I also thought the film was a bit too long. If around 15-20 minutes were trimmed off the runtime, then it would have been more smoother.All in all, BlacKkKlansman was a decent film. It may have not surprised me but it was a fun experience which you can take a lot away from. I'm happy Spike Lee is back into his territory and hope he continues to make good films more like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Hilarious, Nostalgic, and Often Disquieting Comedy Masterpiece. May be Spike Lee's Best","A black guy goes undercover in the Ku Klux Klan. Sounds like the setup of a joke. Or one hell of a comedy. And indeed it is. But more than just a hilarious comedy, Spike Lee's Blackkklansmen is also an excellent cop movie and a moving, surprisingly nuanced statement on race in America.For much of its runtime Blackkklansmen is an engaging, frequently tense police procedural in which careful police work and a knack for thinking on their feet allows the protagonists to worm their way into the Klan. But when it switches gears and goes for laughs it's absolutely hysterical. The phone calls with the Klan feel like sitting in on history's greatest crank calls, and this movie can even turn a racially motivated bombing into an over the top farce. Plus there's even a charming love story that doesn't feel forced or tacked on.Lee has a real gift for editing and composition. I wouldn't have expected a speech by a former Black Panther to be one of the high points of the movie, but the masterful cinematography gave it a power on par with Capra.John D Washington and Adam Driver have excellent chemistry as officers Ron Stallworth and 'Flip' Zimmerman; Washington brings an over the top swagger and perfect comedic timing while Driver remains absolutely deadpan no matter how ridiculous the situation. Topher Grace is wonderful as a surprisingly unassuming, mild mannered, and rather nervous David Duke. For a racist demagogue he's a pretty likeable guy.The period touches are pervasive and coupled with a heavy helping of warm nostalgia. Between the clothes, the hair, and the soundtrack, it's like stepping back into the age of jive.Of course some historical liberties have been taken to liven things up. In real life the Klan never detonated or even completed a bomb, nor did they ever suspect they'd been infiltrated until well after the investigation was completed. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the romantic sublot either. But yes, a black guy really did go undercover in the KKK, he really did have multiple lengthy conversations with David Duke, and it was every bit as funny as depicted here.If this movie has a weakness, it's some overly obvious references to the current president. It's one thing for David Duke to say that the Klan is trying to make America great again. It's another for a room full of people to chant ""America First!"" at length, particularly given that this was not a Klan slogan at the time. The ending is also kind of a downer, but I suppose we live in fraught times, and it wouldn't be a Spike Lee movie if there wasn't a little grandstanding.It's a shame more of his movies don't turn out this good.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

DULY HUMBLED,"Okay. Look. I'm an old white lady who jumped on Spike from the moment of the release of his first film. I've been hooked ever since. Why? Did I mention that I am an old white LADY, as opposed to white MAN? After having one perspective rammed down my throat for over 55 years, I yearned to see Western life from another perspective. Lee gives me that. And here is his genius: without revenge, without anger, without bitterness, this man puts an objective camera out their, and records what happened. Just the ability to do that is remarkable. With his latest film, BlackkKlansman, he gave himself a Herculean challenge; can I depict this situation without any cultural slant. My tears attest that he did so, in spades. From the protagonists relationship with his white superior officer, to his conduct throughout... Lee never tilted the odds to be any different than if the protagonist/superior officer relationship were any different to that of a Bruce Willis in relationship to any similar situation. There was no cultural or racial bias even hinted at. The entire script allowed anyone from any background to experience the story from the drivers seat.

A reminder we haven't advanced very far,"Film Review: BlacKkKlansman. Director Spike Lee (""Malcolm X"") returns to the big screen with a current look back at the 1970's emergence of the Ku Kluk Klan. Enter rookie black Colorado Springs cop Ron Stallworth (the charming and self driven John David Washington - son of Denzel Washington), who is brought on to the force because he can talk ""normal"" and ""jive"". When an opportunity to spy on visiting revolutionary Kwame Ture (the empowering Corey Hawkins ""Straight out of Compton), Ron begins his infiltration into the both the black empowerment movement and the Ku Klux Klan, eventually meeting its leader David Duke (portrayed convincing enough by Topher Grace ""That 70's Show""). Linking him to both groups are the strong-fast President of the Movement Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrie """"Spider-Man: Homecoming""), and Klan's men Walter (Ryan Eggold ""New Amsterdam"" TV), wild man Feliz (Jasper Paakkone ""Vikings"" TV), his bubbly wife Connie (the terrific Ashlie Atkinson ""Crashing"" TV), and goof-ball scene stiller Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser "" I, Toyna""). Reluctantly at Ron's side are fellow officers Flip (one of the hardest working actors Adam Driver ""Girls"") and Jimmy (""Blended's"" Michael Buscemi - brother of Steve Buscemi), both who learn a lot from their involvement. While Lee's presentation is a bit stagey throughout, especially the opening informercial by Dr. Beauregard (an out of place Alec Baldwin) and the various floating faces during Ture's speech, it does help to establish the time, place and feel of the 1970's community. As usual, Lee has a lot to say about ""the day"" and today, creatively interjecting current political climate catch phrases like ""Make America Great Again"" to establish his point that we haven't advanced very far as a society. Lee interjects this association at just the right time in the film, making the films final moments coincide with footage from the recent Charlottesville White Nationalist Rally that stuns the viewing audience into silence. If nothing else, the last few minutes of ""BlacKkKlansman"" says it all.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lee's Black privilege fails to disguise heavy hand.,"Spike Lee gets his shots in at the Klan in this lumbering repetitive tale of a black detective infiltrating the organization in BlacKkKlansman. One shot however is in his foot as he exposes himself for what he condemns.Dan Stallworth is hired by the mostly lily white Colorado Springs Police Department where he chafes at the smug bias of officers in the records room. He requests a switch to detectives where he is given assignments to infiltrate the Black Panthers and KKK which finds him a love interest and getting up close with grand wizard David Duke, acting as his bodyguard during a visit. Eventually the dim witted Klan members put things together and plan a big hurt for Stallworth and his politically woke squeeze.Poorly paced, haphazardly edited, Lee loosely attaches the plots of his storyline together without much rhythm or energy, his players (with the exception of some of his moronic goobers) lifeless dullards of sober demeanor that make every pregnant pause overdue. The entire cast looks like it could use some rest.There are attempts by Lee to be au courant hip (it's Saturday Night's Live's Alec Baldwin! And how bout that title? ) and address today's racial tension with current news footage perhaps attempt to elevate this banal film's gravitas. But it cannot hide Lee's lifelong problem with pacing, packed on mostly with insipid dialogue and sermonizing displayed in abundance here with Lee's heavy handed juxtaposition.Most revealing is Spike's handling of scenes from Birth of a Nation with its vile representation of virulent racist black faced northern pillagers. Given the absolute clueless imbeciles of the Klan and the casual bigotry of the boys in blue he presents in his film one might suggest Mr. Griffith has taught him well.

Entertaining but factually wrong,"I have to say, this was a really funny and entertaining movie. However, as someone who knows the actual story I have some rather harsh criticism to share. First off I'd like to state that I'm half-black and that I know David Duke, just to give you some perspective. While the movie was fun to watch it was very inaccurate as far as the facts are concerned. There was no terror attack/mail bomb and the police officer Flip wasn't Jewish. He was a Christian. Spike Lee basically sensationalized the whole thing. If you don't believe me go and read the book that this movie was ""vaguely"" based on. I mean, the story in itself was interesting enough, there's really no need for sensationalizing it like this. Also, I like how they constantly joke around and ridicule the ""conspiracy theory"" that Jews are over-represented in positions of power. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's the statistical truth.
Towards the end the movie segued into video footage from the Charlottesville riot and other racially charged attacks. Nice appeal to emotion, I see what you did there. The only problem is; leftist extremist are actually more violent than the few right extremists who are insane enough to drive a car into a crowd. They are not just more violent but also legion. There are so many of them that it's quite scary. Especially in European countries like Germany, where I'm currently residing. The European Antifa is akin to a terror organization. They're highly organized and very dangerous.
I'm not saying that racism does not exist. All I'm saying is that it isn't really a big issue anymore. Through constant perpetuation of these ""lores"" we're entrapping the generations to come in a literal prison for the mind. Spike Lee, just like Tyler Perry, are basically just exploiting black culture for financial gain. The only reason why they've gotten away with it over all these years is because they're black themselves. Overall, however, they've been a net negative influence on the black community. I obviously don't condone it.The inverted American Flag at the end was straight up disrespectful, there's something called the Flag protocol according to which this act is classified as ""flag desecration"".To conclude: the movie was good but don't believe everything that you see. If I didn't know it any better I'd call it a modern propaganda flick.

The best Spike Lee film in years!,"I finally saw BlacKkKlansman at the theater. I really didn't know what to expect from the movie initially. The previews made it hard to tell if this was a comedy or a drama, plus Spike Lee has been slipping over the years. I'm happy to say I was incredibly impressed with this movie.The plot of the movie follows an undercover police investigation into Klan activities along the way exploring elements of institutional discrimination, prejudice, and race relations. All the while the movie also offers a stark commentary on modern day racial violence and hostility.The movie perfectly blends a serious drama with elements of dark humor to make a poignant and entertaining journey. The movie certainly has a message, but I never felt like it was preaching at you. At its center the movie remained a very well made, quirky, stylish, and thought-provoking film.I will say the film could have used a bit of tightening near the end. There were so many strong ideas in the movie that the love interest interaction felt a bit unnecessary and rushed.Acting wise the movie was great all-around. I wasn't aware of John David Washington before this film, but I will certainly look forward to seeing his future films. All around he managed to blend a mix of drama and comedy in is character while still keeping him human. Of course Adam Driver did a great job. He is quickly is becoming a must-watch actor in all of his roles.I also have to mention how well this film was directed. Spike Lee has been hit-or-miss over the past few years but he really put his all into this film. The film was masterfully well-crafted which further helped to immerse you into the story and message regarding racism. This is Spike Lee's best film in years. This of course should be no surprise considering it was also produced by Jordan Peele coming off of his success from Get Out.Overall I was immensely impressed with this movie. Not only was the plot interesting but it managed to combine a serious topic with dark humor in an entertaining manner. It is a very important film with a message that very much resonates with our current socio-political climate. I would recommend this film to pretty much everyone.

Spike Lee's return to form,"Easily Spike Lee's best joint since ""25th Hour"", this is the true story of how a black police officer in Colorado in the 1970s stood up to the Ku Klux Klan's presence through an undercover operation. In this film, Spike Lee has gone back to his old school rage that permeates the social fabric of America in the present day. It's a thoroughly relevant drama and an affirmation of American identity, one that burns with righteous anger but also has moments of incendiary humor aimed at the racism being depicted.Performances here are first rate. John David Washington is the title protagonist, a bold black police officer in an overwhelmingly white community who dares to use his investigative ability to counter white supremacists in his own backyard, an idea he embraces after being sent on an undercover assignment to keep an eye on the black panther movement where he finds much agreement and closeness with those he encounters. Topher Grace shakes off his polished preppy boy image for the menacing role of David Duke, the grand wizard of the KKK. Adam Driver is solid as the undercover Jewish police officer who enters the KKK as the white front for the undercover operation. Although the film concludes less dramatically than I was expecting, it still packs a wallop in terms of bringing very relevant issues of white supremacy to the forefront.This is also a cautionary tale about how resilient white supremacy has been over the course of the nation's history right up to the present day. It's a warning that the same scourge that plagued American society in the era when this film took place is still festering in full force today. A challenging message like that is worth conveying, which this film does eloquently. Strongly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Movie Review: BlacKkKlansman,"The conversation around this film inevitably ends up at the closing few minuets. to get it out of the way I think the way this film wraps up was certainly a bold choice on Lees part that helps ground he movie in todays political climate and draws parallels between the struggles of the of the 70s and the struggles of today. This will alienate a lot of potential audience members but it is a Spike Lee film so you should know what you are in for.The film proceeding the controversial short documentary is actually one of the most entertaining films I have seen all year and certainly isnt shy about tackling political and social issues head on. At times it can be tough to believe that this is a completely true story as the screenplay elegantly glides from one insane encounter to the next without ever flinching. As far as I can tell with my limited research this is a largely accurate retelling of the story and if that is the case then screenwriters Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott and director Spike Lee landed on a perfect story for Lees unique style. The influence of black cinema from the 70s is felt everywhere from the cinematography to the music gives the film a feeling of cool that not many modern films pull of.If BlacKkKlansman is not up for at least one acting Oscar then I might just have to give up on trying to predict Oscar nominees. Adam Driver is the best he has ever been in a non Star Wars project, Topher Grace delivers an unsettlingly charming and perfectly threatening performance as Grand Wizard David Duke and John David Washington breaks out of his fathers shadow within seconds of screen time.BlacKkKlansman is absolutely going to rank high on my best of the year list this year! this is a film that has to be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Worth the watch,"I enjoyed the film. Finding out it was a inspired by a real life story made it more enjoyable. All aspects of the film was well constructed from what it seems went from pre to post production. I do have a great deal of respect for period pieces and respect for the crews that have to make this happen.

Whitewashed,"I liked the Black Panther speech. The rest of the movie seemed fairly mediocre. There is so much injustice in black history that this movie seemed inappropriately tame. That this is being called ""hardest-hitting work in decades"" seems silly. Give us the real history. These recent ""black"" movies seem so whitewashed.The main benefit I see from this movie being a ""prettied up version"" of reality is that it might not turn away certain people who would otherwise dislike it?

I deducted stars because....,"I thought the movie was very interesting. I'm so tired of reviewers saying everything is a cliche. There are cliches in just about every movie. I was going to give it a 7 but deducted two stars because of the one sided anti Trump ending. There are far more Antifa violent "" protestors"" than white supremacists currently causing problems in the U.S. To blame Trump for these demonstrations is disgusting. So my new rating is a 5. Keep your Hollywood views out of the movies. This is a based on a true story according to reviewers who were disgruntled that it wasn't totally true in every aspect. The director may have added some fiction to the story but sometimes in order to make a movie that will be entertaining or will flow well that can be a necessity.

Fictional movie with a strong message and it's high time now,"All lives matter, no matter what is the color of your skin or what is the size of your eyes.

Racism has got to end and it can only end when everyone is treated equally right from the school years. Not only racism but also gender inequalities, are also talking the world down to hell.Astonished to see that the movie is set in 1960s but it is still not too far from reality.

Missed Opportunities and Polarizing Agendas,"BlacKkKlansman attempts to use history as a springboard to address serious issues such as race relations and political ideologies, but unfortunately falls short in its execution, leaving audiences with a film that disappointingly leans towards polarizing narratives. While the film aims to offer trenchant commentary on current events, it often succumbs to the allure of political propaganda and black exploitation, ultimately undermining its potential impact.The movie's overt political perspective is hard to ignore, as it seemingly attempts to mold history to fit a particular agenda. While this premise holds promise for a nuanced exploration of systemic racism, the movie frequently veers into didacticism, sacrificing subtlety for heavy-handed messaging. The narrative's approach to politics becomes its Achilles' heel, as it often feels more like a one-sided sermon than an opportunity for genuine discourse. This lack of balance detracts from the film's credibility and prevents it from being the thought-provoking exploration it aspires to be.Furthermore, BlacKkKlansman unfortunately exhibits signs of what could be labeled as black exploitation. While the intention may have been to highlight historical injustices and empower marginalized voices, there are moments when the film seems to capitalize on black suffering for dramatic effect. This raises ethical questions about how sensitive topics should be portrayed on screen, and whether the film is genuinely honoring the experiences it seeks to depict or simply exploiting them for shock value.While the film's performances are undoubtedly strong, particularly John David Washington's portrayal of the protagonist, the characters often feel more like mouthpieces for ideologies rather than well-rounded individuals. This detracts from the authenticity of the story and makes it challenging for audiences to fully invest in their journeys.Despite its ambitions, BlacKkKlansman fails to strike a balance between history and contemporary relevance. Its heavy-handed political perspective and questionable portrayal of historical trauma undermine its potential as a vehicle for dialogue and understanding. Rather than fostering genuine conversations about racial issues and identity, the film falls into the trap of polarizing rhetoric and a sense of exploitation that hampers its ability to contribute to meaningful change.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Interesting times, feel good story","My problem with this movie is that it has two agendas. On one hand it's a feel good bonhomie, with a spicy love attraction, boisterous good cop buddies and zippy to and fro between the troops and higher command. That's entertaining. Then again this is also about an undercover operation with real perils, where the 'bonhomie' (with the racists) is contrived and false of course, and should have had me gripping my seat. I'm sorry but these two agendas clashed for me. Maybe for others that won't be an issue. Basically I found it all mildly exhilarating, and somewhat intriguing from an historical perspective, but couldn't resolve the nonchalant attitude of, well, just about everyone to everything.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing short of incredible,"I was apprehensive upon approaching this film - would it have the gall to face up to the harsh truths of racism, which exists now as it did in the 1970's? In a way I was pleasantly surprised. BlackKkKlansman never falls short in showing a transparent depiction of what racism was, what it meant to be black in such a time, and what the Klu Klux Klan really was. This movie was compelling, shocking and truthful in a raw and heart-wrenching way. The final scenes, in which real footage is shown, are absolutely hear-wrenching, and they brought a tear to my eye. They make the whole film real. The only complaint I can fathom is the over-dramatisation of the true story, but this is completely understandible in order to create such a rich production.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A controversial movie asks for a controversial review,"Thanks to the possible and potential metaphysical powers that are at play in this world, I watched this movie a couple of nights ago.It was just the movie I needed to watch in order to focus my anger, my frustration and my sadness towards the human kind to fight the right battles.Its director, Spike Lee, just like Gandhi, Mandela, Buddha or Jesus Christ, is not a myth. He is a human being with his own shortcomings, just like you and me.

I know many fellow Brazilians understand what and who I'm talking about, and the moment we're living right now.Nobody will ever live in peace until we start to fix this world for real.Nobody will ever experience real love until each human being inhabiting this planet stops being treated like dirt by ignorant people, people who devote their lives to hatred.There is no place for neutrality, pacifism or amnesty, as responses to the absurd times we're living.The struggle happens every day and will happen forever.

Drags on a Bit - Some Very Good Performances,"There is much to like about this film, but I only give it a 6/10, blaming most of the negative aspects on Spike Lee's direction. There are more than a few very good acting performances: Washington and Driver, and several of the Klansman, especially the husband-wife duo (especially when contrasted to the poor acting of the ""bad cop"" character). But Topher Grace as David Duke is a great, spot-on portrayal of the smarmy, ""marketable"" klansman David Duke.. I was less convinced by the love interest/student activist and her relationship with Washington's character. The film suffers from an identity crisis, not knowing whether to be a drama or a comedy. This would have been a better story to be made as dark comedy (maybe like ""I, Tonya"" (9/10)), or maybe an action, suspense drama. But instead it meanders throughout much of the film. When it's good, this film is superb, but there is much dead time in it. The long speeches greatly slow down the pacing of the film (and I'm NOT a person with a short cinematic attention span - I love ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the wedding scene in ""The Deer Hunter""). A second long speech is a lost opportunity to build suspense. Lee tries but fails to build that suspense, with cinematic tools he should know how to use by now. Lee's attempts to tie the 70's Klan to Trump were forced and at times insulted the intelligence of the audience (Did he really think he had to repeat a Trump catch-phrase over and over and over . . . or we'd somehow be too stupid to get his point?). Factually,.this former Colorado Springs resident can accept (for cinematic reasons) moving the mostly flat city of Colorado Springs to the hills (Spike's city looks more like neighboring Manitou Springs). At least the Black Student Union sign was written in the correct Colorado College Colors. Go Tigers.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spike Lee is coming at you with his greatest and most galvanizing movie in years,"""Blackkklamsman"" Review
(9/10)Spike Lee is coming at you with his greatest and most galvanizing movie in years. BlacKkKlansman is right up there with Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X in the Spike's Joint pantheon of game-changers.
BlacKkKlansman, adapted by Lee, David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott from Stallworth's book, demands the best from everyone, including cinematographer Chayse Irvin, editor Barry Alexander Brown and composer Terence Blanchard. (Having Get Out provocateur Jordan Peele on the producing team doesn't hurt, either.) Still, the movie breathes Lee as he walks a tightrope over the heroic best and craven worst of humanity.
Some might argue that the movie didn't need a present-day coda of the showdown between white nationalists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia; the notorious Trump speech claiming there was ""blame on both sides""; or the still-active hatemonger Duke praising the President's comments. I am not one of those people.
While this movie may have been about a true story from back in the 70s, this true story still has tons of merit in today's society. For the most part, the moments of levity serve to keep the bleakness at bay. Evil is among us, hidden - or not so hidden - in the hearts of ordinary-looking people. As the film's final moments make clear, we need a new fight back against it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

There are some decent acting performances save the typical overacting we get from characters who are supposed to be portrayed as racists. The main drawbacks of the film are the occasional lapses in logic that present themselves and the score. The score is terrible.

Beware fiction masquerading as fact.,"This is a good movie. It is important to throw a spotlight on our cultural flaws and ingrained pre-judgements of each other. Otherwise. how will we overcome them? It is a good story, incredible in its root in reality. The cast and their performances were good (with the exception of Topher Grace who was horribly miscast). It had some unexpected treasures, like Harry Belafonte as Jerome Turner who mesmerized us with his testimony of brutality. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. Does its subject matter alone elevate it to Best Picture (it is nominated in 5 other categories for Oscars, as well)? I'm not sure. MINI RANT - In an age when popular understanding of history is based on the movies people see, I think it is important to point out that if a movie says it is based on actual events, as when a movie says it is based on a book, there is a lot of artistic license taken to shift details around and changes made to make it a good movie, even to the extent that the film is more fiction than fact. I'll give you just three examples from this film, it is based on the 2014 memoir BLACK KLANSMAN by Ron Stallman. The writers moved the story back seven years (1979 to 1972) to facilitate a reference to a number of blaxploitation films. David Duke didn't find out that Stallworth was black until 2006 (27 years later) when called upon by a reporter to comment on these events. The detective who is characterized as Flip Zimmerman was not Jewish, that is a total contrivance of the film. Two other Oscar nominated films, also saying they were based on actual events, THE FAVORITE and MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, are really fiction far from fact. Beware fiction masquerading as fact! END MINI RANT. Fun Fact: Stallman still carries his KKK membership in his wallet. {Crime Drama}",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Blackkklansman,"Spike Lee has not had a commercial, or critical hit since 2006's Inside Man, and after that he would often attempt to get bigger films off the ground such as Miracle at St. Anna, or his remake of Oldboy, a few years ago, but both films were neither received well, nor did they have the box office receipts to prove they were hits, in fact the complete opposite. Lee, who I have always admired as a filmmaker, did get other projects going since and during that time, but mostly they were smaller films that would only play in the very biggest of cities meaning that if you lived anywhere else you would either have to rent, buy, or stream the films in order to keep up to date with his body of work. Lee needed a film that was both going to be a critical success, but also one that would attract audiences and actually make some money as well. When his new film, Blackkklansman premiered at Cannes, I am certainly not sure what audiences, or critics were expecting, but the result turned out to be Lee's best reviewed film in probably longer than a decade as well as winning some of the top prizes at Cannes, which in my mind because of their very particular, yet often right on the money judgements, this meant that Lee's new film was great, but how would audiences fare and let alone the movie when it had a theatrical release date right in the middle of summer which we often know can be very difficult for smaller and more intelligent films? Blackkklansman continued to earn rave reviews as more critics were able to see it and the film was even given a wide release by it's distributor and the film was made for roughly 15 million dollars and after not even a month of release it has already doubled that amount in box office returns and has many saying that it is certainly a contender for Best Picture at next year's Oscars and in my mind, I wouldn't be surprised if the film, or Lee himself were standing on that stage next year picking up their awards. Having now seen the film myself, I will have to be honest and say that the style and tone of the film was a bit of a surprise to me because I was not expecting it to be so comedic and yet I found it often worked by also dealing with pretty upsetting subject matter and allowing us a chance to breathe and also to get immersed within the film and have a good chuckle as well as getting some hard hitting material as well, so I felt the balance which at first may have taken a little bit to get used to, ended up working beautifully. The story in itself is one of this year, or any recent year's most interesting plots around and the fact that it is all based upon a true story further adds fascination and a great emotional impact at the end of the film. The performances both by the leading cast as well as supporting were all fantastic and some of the best of the year. The script which Lee had a hand in writing is often smart, funny, intriguing and like any of Lee's best films, it also hits home and gets a point across that will certainly leave you shaken and stunned by the time you have walked out of the theatre. Lee has always been known for being angry at the world's injustices especially regarding race and this new film is no different. I appreciated that the violence in the film was toned down and realistically there was very little of it, so I think it would also bring more viewers in that way. The racial hatred, bigotry and language of which the film has lots, can be offensive and almost sickening at times, but we know why Lee went for this and he certainly gets his point across and then some. This is a film that is fascinating entertainment and also entertainment that will make you think about what you have just seen and may even change the way you look at current events and American history itself. The all too true aspect that is most disturbing is that this kind of hatred and acts of violence still exist and there are too many of these type of stories in the news today which makes the message of this film all the more timely and prevalent. This is one of the year's best films if not the best film of the year so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good balance,"I'm not a Spike Lee fan, necessarily. This movie has given me a reason to become one.

And this is back in the 70's! I was pleasantly surprised to see a movie that showed that. Granted it must have been a part of Ron Stallworth's experience, but nonetheless, I appreciate that Spike Lee appropriately focused on it. The movie itself was entertaining, funny and moving. John David Washington did a great job portraying Stallworth. And I loved Adam Driver's character. He's turning out to be one of my fav actors.With all the hassles of ""racism"" in today's America, I loved that this movie showed one man's story of courage, imagination and success assisted, helped and applauded by his workmates...regardless of his or their color.

Why did the Colorado Springs Police end what, by their own admission, was a very successful operation? Why were all the records destroyed? How well did racial integration of their force continue from there? Wish the imdb still had the forums, so we could discuss this.

It had potential. But still worth the watch,"The movie knows its message and never pulls any punches in demonstrating this. Although sometimes it felt almost too prevalent, at least the message is very accessible and understandable. For this reason I think the film should certainly be used and presented to children in high school to show the truth of the very real, ongoing horrors of racism that continue to plague our society. This all said, as a film, I feel it needed polishing especially regarding its script and overall plot. The pacing is very slow and dialogue often, as I say makes the message too bold, feels forced often breaking the all so important realism this film deserves to invoke, to thusly cement the realism of the issues it shines much needed light on. This, plus lackluster climaxes, often tedious scenes of dialogue and shallow characters really (and very unfortunately) harms the film. This movie had potential, it just needed a bit more polish to make it shine. Regardless, show this movie to your teenagers.

BlacKkKlansman doesn't hold back addressing the current political/racial climate.,"Truth be told, I've not been looking forward to reviewing this. Much like Spike Lee, I have much to say regarding the apparent racial clash in America's modern-like society that feels more archaic than ever. However, I shall be discarding my political views from this review and strictly taking the time to critique Lee's boisterously powerful drama. Chronicling the true story of a black detective infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan to prevent any attacks that may result in a race war. An absolutely fascinating case that metaphorically represents a variety of multi-dimensional themes. A black individual joining an all-white clan, without them identifying him, shows that all races are able to integrate and reside peacefully in cohabitation. We are all law-abiding citizens. We are all integral components in society. We are all the same, regardless of skin colour. The KKK contrasts with former Black Panther Party members in the method they choose to rally up support. The former are likened to a terrorist organisation where actions speak louder than words, whereas the latter utilise the power of words to incite their followers, not to provoke them, but to motivate them in expressing themselves for a revolution. That's not a biased representation from Lee, it's fact. This is not a subtle depiction of a minority dealing with the remaining racists of society. This is a message. A message of power, liberation and revolution. The several screenwriters, including Lee, remove all expletive barriers. Nearly every offensive, racial and derogatory word is embedded within the sharp screenplay. It irrefutably has bite, and immediately absorbs you into the visceral environment of 70s America. Illustrating the racial ideology of white supremacism for both political and socioeconomic systems against a contemptuous backdrop. It's provocative, making your inner activism rise as the narrative progresses.Fortunately, the script's focus is still on the plot, and it remains enthralling throughout. Balancing astute contemporary humour with uncompromising speeches where we cling onto every spoken word, witnessing Lee's illustrious perspective on black power through the medium of film. I'm not overtly familiar with his filmography, but there is no denying that his ability to address important issues without conforming to melodrama is nothing short of genius. His precise directing allows the cast to integrate themselves as part of the story. Washington portraying naivety through sarcastic wit and energetic bodily movements enabled him to be a likeable character amongst a sea of societal regression. But, yet again, Driver steals the screen. His acting is effortless and still remains one of the most credible actors working today. His comedic timing, calm demeanour and emotional conviction all amalgamate to create an authentic character portrayal. There is no denying that this is a timely film that is more important than ever given current situations, which are highlighted in the final five minute sequence. Yet, I do have some issues.Regardless of my political and social views, I find injecting one's opinion into a film so forcibly, considering the basis of the film is the depiction of a true story, to be distasteful. Understandably, Lee utilises the case to compare the similarities of today's society with that of 70s America. But in doing so, the consistent sly remarks against the Trump administration tainted the tone of the film and instead started to become a personal attack. It is a personal statement, I get that. And Lee clearly wanted to share his viewpoint with the rest of the world. It just needed less lambaste in order to maintain the professionalism that was nested throughout the rest of the film. It didn't help that those particular scenes were embedded within the clunky narrative, furthering its own dispensability. However, the unique prowess of BlacKkKlansman should not go unnoticed. Both important and entertaining, Spike Lee is back on top form, and he has something to say.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Is realism just an excuse?,"Maintaining the smoothness of entertainment and the integrity of the theme has always been what Spike Lee is good at, so the film's comedy tone is actually expected.
Therefore, the basic texture of the film is very similar to a more entertaining ""Malcolm X"", of course, the latter focused on the individual, and the film focuses on the group.
One problem that needs to be pointed out is that the end of film can give the audience an instinctive emotional sublimation, but as a functional part of the film, the end seems to be slightly redundant. Or is this also a part of ridicule?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
