Movie that everyone should see!,"Greetings from Lithuania.WOW! The best word that describes this movie is ""wow""! Not only to say that this is the best Action movie of all time, this is probably one of the greatest movies ever made . The people in my country watched this film when there where limited VHS cassettes at all. And again, my favorite Director did an timeless epic-masterpiece. Yes, an epic. Every scene in this movie is beyond the perfection. The timeless plot. Groundbreaking effects. Unforgettable ""Hasta la vista, baby."" .Perfect direction for a sci-fix action film. When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. There never be the same movie like T2. What else I can say about this film? A Must see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is the sequel that dreams are made of.,"Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in ""liquid metal"" machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he's great entertainment.Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of ""a mimetic polyalloy"", a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on ""Judgment Day"".Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it, there's something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold's line ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"" is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said "" The terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him."" meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Words cannot describe the greatness of this movie,"A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator"" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars.Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world.Robert Patrick as T-1000 is ""a mimetic Polly-alloy"" or ""liquid metal."" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do.Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to).Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time.Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects.The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie.The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston.It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.That's your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn't cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when ""Bad to the Bone"" music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you'd think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hasta la vista baby,The best terminator movie by far and one of the all time greatest movies ever made. The effects are amazing for the early 90s and hold up even by todays standards. The storyline is easy to follow and the action scenes are amazing. The characters are well cast and the actors sell this movie. An absolute classic.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Preferred the 1st one then. Still prefer it now,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great film but it is much more child friendly compared to the first movie, and is more commercialThe biggest problem I have with it is that the whole Mexico thing goes on for far too long and the movie loses a huge amount of it's pace. I have never been able to fully engage with this movies second half for that reason. Granted the first film also slows down mid way-ish but for nowhere near as long, and we always feel that Sarah and Kyle are being relentlessly hunted and in considerable danger. Indeed, they are attacked immediately after and so the pace continuesIn Judgement Day we know the characters are in a place of relative safety at this point in the movie and the feeling of pursuit is well and truly lost from thereon inI much preferred Arnie as the bad Terminator, and find a lot of the comedic aspects of this sequel goofy, taken to a further extreme in the third outing. They also date the film furtherI feel that the first movie has strangely aged better than this one. It is set firmly in the 80's but without all the stupid guns and roses and other obvious 'cultural' references. The liquid metal thing while amazing at the time would let's be honest, look a little crap to young eyes I'm sure. The opening sequence is still brilliantThe sound in Judgement Day is unbelievably good. All the weapons sound fantastic and full of character, especially the grenade launcher, mini-gun and the T1000's Beretta. Although I did prefer the delayed style heart beat effect in the first one which intensified the tension and was a very clever audio cue. They use a similar device in Judgement Day but it's not nearly as goodA great movie that absolutely shouldn't be missed, but I find The Terminator stands up much better to repeated viewing",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great idea, great sets, pretty straightforward acting and action flick stuff","Terminator 2 (1991)In terms of movie-making, this second installment is clearly a smoother, smarter, more professional product. It's rightfully admired as better, in some ways, that the first in this epic series. Like the Star Wars movies, the first installment excels for sheer story introduction and originality (and I'd throw Hunger Games in the same mix). Once the depth of the success took hold and some money was applied to the second (and third) movies in the sequences, the quality naturally rose. And so ""Terminator 2"" is a better, more solid production.But it's derivative. Sometimes the scenes are deliberately echoing the first movie, which is understandable, but then other scenes just seem like a lack of originality. There are a couple nice shifts of plot again as you get used to the idea that the future is meeting the past, but really it's kind of the same thing all over again but better.One thing that doesn't improve is the acting—both Arnold S. and Linda Hamilton are pushing the limits of their abilities, and their credibility. I have to say Hamilton is much better this time around, playing both the sympathetic mother and future hero but also a crazy person really well. Which also helps give the movie a little boost. It's also nice to have Schwarzenegger around for the whole movie, including the finale (again in a factory, like the first movie).For me, the bad cyborg was too all powerful—the effects were astounding, but if you have a guy/robot who can pretty much do anything you wonder why he doesn't at times just kill people and take care of business with a quick one two. The vulnerability of Schwarzenegger in this film is a welcome contrast, and it makes him almost, well, human.The plot has progressed over the last seven years well, and we are ready for the third installment—which is part of the idea. Well done, as far as it all goes. Fast, energetic, clever, with great sets and effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best action film ever!!!,"This superb sequel surpasses the excellent original in every department and quite simply you won't see a better action film. Set 15 years after the original Arnie may return as the good Terminator trying to protect John Connor but he's a redundant piece of scrap metal compared to the T-1000.The opening hour and the last half hour is absolutely breathtaking with action sequences that still remain unsurpassed. Their's also a wonderful piece of storytelling 3/4 of the way through where Dyson relises the terrifying consequences of the project he's neglecting his family for.The performances are memorable particularly Linda Hamilton's Sara Connor and simply put, they'll never make a better action film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
He Said He'd Be Back...and He Certainly is!,"Who said sequels aren't any good? ""Terminator 2"" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.Yeah, he's ""back."" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and ""Xtreme"" edition DVDs, Sarah says, ""You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!"" It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), ""T2"" clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is ""T2: Judgment Day"" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.In some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One sequel that out does the original,"I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,but T2 certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in my opinion, of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in terms of greatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy once again,but you don't mind once you witness the incredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film is nothing short of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forget the talents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave great supporting efforts.Thumbs up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

T2 is a timeless movie. It is much better than the original. It has superb car chases, big guns, dynamic explosions, gore, tension, suspense, etc. The chase sequence is awesome and nail bitingly intense, it is one of the best action sequences ever made.

surpasses the original,"Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or, rather, the ""Bad"" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean, DAMN, it still looks great, and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more, for me, impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable, of course, that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people, incidentally, or, you know, all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but, hey, ""He'll live"" is enough.But if Cameron is ""soft"" at all here, it doesn't show too much... well, okay, Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms ""No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc"", and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best, annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold, in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn, and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced, he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress, at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing.She can never be completely hard, though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her, so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World, she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past, which is a cousin of this flick, gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad, but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero, one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So, blast your Guns N Roses, say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him, right, Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight, like the voice-over, it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie, which the first Terminator just was).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Better Sequels,"T2 is a fab movie, especially with its 2nd generation cgi and the introduction of Morphing. Coupled with a good, but slightly convoluted script, and passable acting, T2 deserved to be a box office smash.It was also good to see Arnie return but this time as the good cyborg as opposed to the baddie in T1. Robert Patrick was also very good as the T1000 but again, the sfx took most of his character away so he didn't do very much other than do a lot of killing, staring & running.I also felt Linda Hamilton just didn't ""look"" right as her powerful role, Sarah Connor compared to her original performance in T1. In T2 she looks thin, pale, drawn and doesn't seem to have the same drive or mommentum that she did in T1, even though we have to accept a certain amount of deterioration owing to her incarceration in a mental institution.Ed Furlong, is also quite flat in the acting dept as the young John Connor. He didn't convince for a second and made the film feel uneven: there are better child actors available but I'm afraid Ed just didn't cut the mustard here.It's a shame the Mike Biehn didn't reprise his role because he would've added more interpersonal characterisation between Sarah & himself. But as it is the film lacks a certain ""warmth"" that leaves the audience isolated and not fully caring for any of the lead characters.It cannot be denied that T2 is a great film but only in the context of sfx and extending the scope of the sci-fi genre. Otherwise the film looks a pale imitation to the original & superior Terminator.**/*****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It pushes the limits of greatness,"Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a cliché and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent movie, but not as good as the first movie","Terminator 2 was the most expensive movie in the world when it was released back in 1992.  This movie is a big-budget-blockbuster, whereas the original movie was a cultish action/sci-fi made on a small budget. The extra cash means cooler and more spectacular actionscenes, tons of special-effects(but they look a bit crap now) and better-looking scenery. The movie is almost as good as the original, but this is why I think the original Terminator is a bit better: it doesn`t have the annoying and completely useless brat whose name is John Connor, it was an overall darker movie and Schwarzenegger was more sadistic(which is what The Terminator is all about). Still, it is a must see for those who`ve seen T1, just turn your head away from the TV-screen when John Connor(Eddie Furlong) enters the screen. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

That tension and amazing chasing scenes were just revolutionary.But I don't know how improved this much in this movie. In Terminator 2: Judgment Day you're experiencing the best action scenes of all time. This is the Die Hard level of action with chasing. I don't know what you think but I think it's still better than all those Mission Impossible's action sequences. And those are great by the way. But this isn't great, this is just beyond great at Action sequences.Besides the great Action scenes with some revolutionary VFX, the storyline is just brilliant!James Cameron just written the best Time Travel story. I don't think I experienced any Time Travel movie like this. How can you assume that this time travel thing could be possible? This movie makes you question about it.When you're combine the whole story in your mind, you'll find one of the most brilliant storyline. It may feel like simple but I guarantee you, It's not at all. It's just too well written. Not only based on time travel of course. In my opinion after The Matrix, this is the second best AI Rebellion story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A bigger, richer sequel that is  every bit as fantastic as its predecessor and even  surpasses it in  some areas","The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.In conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great action and much more,"The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create.

All I can say is that when I first saw the movie (at only 9 years of age) it had an effect on me. It blew me away! It opened up my eyes, and even at the tender age of 9, made me realize what I wanted to do with my life: I wanted to make movies, and I wanted to make movies like ""T2"".As I'm watching the film, I glance over at another patron and this woman, her eyes wide, was gripping the arms of her chair so tightly I thought they were going to break.

Masterpiece Sci-Fi,"Terminator 2 (1991)**** (out of 4)It's not often a sequel is better than the original but that's the case here. I'll go a step further and say this here is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made. It's funny but I still have vivid memories of watching this on opening night even though I was only eleven-years-old. I remember the buzz going into the movie. I remember who I watched it with and I can even remember what part of the theater I was sitting in. At the time I don't think I fully realized how special the film I was watching was because I only saw it as something extremely cool with ground breaking effects. Today I see the film as a complete masterpiece of film-making even though one might find a few logical issues but then again this is science fiction so the logic could be overlooked anyways. I think it goes without saying but the story is the best thing going on here. The plot is a very simple one: the prevention of Judgment Day so what else do you need? The movie has Arnold Schwarzenegger returning and giving the greatest performance of his career. Linda Hamilton is also back and the way she transformed her character from the first film is pretty remarkable. Edward Furlong makes for a very good John Connor and Robert Patrick is terrific as the villain. The special effects were ground breaking in 1991 and I might say they haven't been topped in all the years since. Sure, CGI has come along but they can't hold up to anything in this movie. The liquid metal is pure genius and all the effects are masterfully done. You could pick any single one of them and hold it up as being some of the best ever created. Whereas the first film was extremely dark, this one here allows for the Terminator to have more character development and I think this was a great thing to do. Just as it was great to have Frankenstein's monster speak in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, I think it's great to show a more humor Terminator. The jokes work perfectly and you can't help but find the ending very touching. No matter which version you watch (I prefer the theatrical) this is a marvelous film that has perfectly stood the test of time and delivers itself as one of the greatest of its type.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The ""Empire Strikes Back"" Of The Terminator Franchise","After the original ""Terminator"" film that was so ahead of its time that the special effects couldn't keep up with James Cameron's vision, ""T2: Judgment Day"" is an action-packed, adventure-filled extravaganza. It basically does everything Cameron wanted to do in the first one...and then some. The only problem? It skimps on the time-travel storyline in favor of the romping action.For a basic plot summary, T2 tells the story of a young John Connor (Edward Furlong), a boy who is vital to the future of human civilization once the machines take over in 1997. With mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution for her wild (yet accurate) claims of the future, John has turned into a rebellious youngster. When a new kind of cybernetic (Robert Patrick) comes from the future to hunt him down, this time John is protected by the Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that tried to kill his mother. The goal this time? Trying to prevent Skynet from ever being created.T2 is an entertaining experience that never gets boring. The special effects are explosive, the pace is always moving forward, and the franchise certainly sheds its ""80s movie"" clichéd reputation with a slick, edgy new look. Patrick nearly steals the show as the advanced, liquid metal Terminator, one of the great on-screen villains of all-time. Simply put, there is simply a lot to like about the film that most people consider to be the best in the franchise.For me, however, T2 comes in a notch below the original. Why? When I watch this franchise, I primarily watch it for the intriguing past/future time-travel storyline. That kind of gets lost in this one, what with all the stunts and visual effects. Even the plot arc involving Cyberdyne kind of gets short shrift. Personally, I liked the gritty, darker tone of the first film better. More focus on story/characters than on effects, humor, and action.The best analogy I can make is that T2 reminds me of ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the original Star Wars trilogy. That film also forgoes plot a bit in favor of rollicking adventure. Many people (just like T2) think that is the best installment of that series, but I liked its predecessor a bit better (just like in this case too). I can appreciate ""Judgment Day"" for what it is, but I can't say its my favorite.Overall, though, T2 is a fun movie that I can still enjoy. It adds some elements to the franchise that I like (primarily Patrick's character). I just wanted a bit more story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

T-2  The Return of Cyborg model # 1 0 1,"This as I remember back in 91' as I watched the first few minutes of the movie take flight, was a vastly different feeling from the original.In 1984 when I sat through the first Terminator, it seems now in retrospect, a lower budget movie, however a 'gigantic' story feel. It was brand new and it was different than other sci-fi stuff that was out then. I was gripped by the feeling of an almost unstoppable machine. Schwarzennegger had captured the very element of a futuristic killer that was bigger than life. And scarier than HELL. It was an emotional thriller, with bigger than dollars outcome on how you felt when you left the theater after the ending was over. Now it seems to be traded for an over M-TV commercialized slicker packaged new Terminator. This one now is not un-conversational. He can look sideways at you and learn a joke or two. As I watched the new one I enjoyed it but realized later that, this was more like a 'drug' that would fade, than the preamble that left you squirming in your seat and thought provoked by the end.This was a new-digitally mastered machine that was not going to kill, just act as a body guard for John. Understandably. I can see the point in it and the logic behind that concept for this story. It just was not as bold and fresh as the first. It was quite a thrill-rush...but just seemed to dissolve for me after a while. I liked T-2, truly. This just is though for me not as strong and pure as the first bum-rush the conscious feeling as you watch it, best casted futuristic story, made even better by Stan 'The Wizard' Winston.

A big disappointment,"Once upon a time there was a talented young director called James Cameron. He made a classic low-budget sci-fi thriller called The Terminator, and followed it up with other minor classics such as Aliens and The Abyss. Then he was seduced by the Dark Side of the Force and started making s***.***PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Terminator 2 is an appalling film. Certainly, the special effects were ground-breaking (although look ordinary now)but I'm more than a little sick of hearing people say this in its defence. Special Effects alone are not enough. There needs to be a plausible story, decent dialogue, solid acting performances and a basic artistic integrity. Linda Hamilton excepted, the performances here all suck. Arnie was perfectly cast in the original as a cyborg villain - for once his mechanical tics and twitches actually worked in his favour. His attempts to make the robot in T2 more human are just tragic. The plot is totally lacking in plausibility. Edward Furlong, we are supposed to believe, turns into a ruthless future guerilla leader. Someone who orders his troops not to kill the enemy (as he tells Arnie in that patronising ""You can't kill anybody"" sequence)clearly isn't meant to be a general. In the first film, we were told that the time-travel equipment had been blown up after Kyle Reese had been sent back in time. So how come it's now working again? And if they're capable of sending more Terminators back, why didn't they just send back a cyborg to kill Sarah Connor when she was in labour? She could hardly have fought back then. It seems as though Cameron thought he could blind his audience to these obvious discrepancies by bombarding them with special effects. The whole film is a mess. Everything that made the first Terminator film great was sacrificed to make a gaudy, crass effects-fest. I had been looking forward to a sequel set in the future, featuring John Connor fighting against the machines. Instead, they made the biggest fake in history. And the thumbs-up bit at the end? I vomited a river.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
There's a reason this is so appreciated,"Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
King of the Action Flicks?,"Most action movies follow a pretty predictable sequence. There's nothing written in stone, but the movie tends to have an introduction, an epic conclusion, and then fills the intervening hour or two carefully switching between scenes of suspense, heroics, setbacks, triumphs, evil ploys and noble sacrifices. The more you watch, the more you notice the formula.Terminator 2 is one of the few good action movies that dares to throw the formula out the window, and that is what makes it so great. Instead of structuring the plot to build suspense by the book, Terminator 2 makes the bold move of telling a linear story where every scene actually has to be multi-dimensional and build the plot in a creative and new way. This is very hard to do, each scene practically has to be written from scratch like a chapter of a good book, and the difficulty of making that style of film-making succeed is why so many films rely on the trusty old formula.The structuring of Terminator 2 is a subtle thing to notice, but I do think it contributed to its success, and certainly to the relatively serious respect its given as a film. No one is going to confuse it with an art house film, of course, but at the same time, it does something that formula thrillers like ""Air Force One"" don't even try to do, it tells a story in an original, genuinely creative way without relying on traditional suspense-building clichés. In its own way, this film is a work of art.Of course, the film has much more obvious assets. The film's calling card will always be the epic action and special effects sequences - Arnold riding his bike off a ledge, twirling his shotgun around to reload it, tearing aside his fake skin to reveal the metal parts below - ""Terminator 2"" was a stunningly exciting film when it came out, and its visuals don't feel dated at all even 18 years later.Still, though, a lot of other films have had competent special effects. Why do people consider T2 a classic instead of films like ""Independence Day"", which also invested heavily in effects? It's not enough to just generate 15 minutes of jaw-dropping visuals in a 2 hour movie. You need to be creative about what you're actually depicting. A $10 million scene that's carefully crafted into the film's narrative is always going to do more for the audience than a similarly expensive scene that doesn't bother to give the audience any real reason to care about what's happening. Terminator 2 is a movie where the director spends time on the non-action scenes, treating them as more than just filler, and this really pays off because instead of seeing a nifty visual sequence with some character you don't particularly care about, the excitement of the action scenes in Terminator 2 is actually enhanced greatly because you like the good guys on a deeper level than in a formulaic action film.T2 is one of the high watermarks of action films. Everyone should see it, it's that simple.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Still going strong,"15 years on and still Terminator 2 remains a turning point in cinematic history introducing the world to photo-realistic computer generated 3D rendering. To this day, this is still an astounding achievement, however (ironically) these are the things that re-watching the film now, you notice as not being to the standard we now expect films to be.As a result of this, you're then forced to look beyond the graphics in search of other quality. When I last watched it (about 3 weeks ago), something stood out to me that never did before because of no longer being mesmerised by the graphics.This was the interactions between characters who are gritting, no nonsense, hard edged people, but those who care deeply for one another. In particular, I'm referring to Sarah and John Connor, but also to the inhuman T-101 in all it's programming trying to humanise itself (at the demand if John).Though these might sound like day to day interactions (pardoning the whole terminator and robotic elements here), but to put them onto film and not have them feel forced or contrived is quite a feat, and all of these were achieved far above the expectation of one watching an ""action"" movie. You truly believe that John is devastated to have to lose T-101. You can tell he's fearful about Sarah going off to kill the man who would kill the world, unwittingly.I urge you all to sit down and watch this film again.

"Action, Emotion, and Thought: Exploring the Brilliance of Terminator 2","From a young age, my parents, especially my dad, understood that I could handle watching rated R movies without being phased by them. I vividly remember seeing Terminator 2 on Netflix, back when it was available on the Wii console. The action and battles from the very beginning thrilled me to the core. The characters were all memorable, with quotes that still echo in my head to this day.As a child, I found myself relating to John, the protagonist, despite our different backgrounds and ages. I could empathize with his journey as a future war hero, fighting against the machines. But Terminator 2 is far from just an action movie. It leaves the viewer with profound thoughts to ponder. The idea of giving artificial intelligence too much knowledge and control over our everyday lives, the concept of a malleable future that can be changed, and the realization that nothing is truly set in stone - these are all messages that director Cameron skillfully presents.In my view, Terminator 2 surpasses the original (which is still masterful in its own right) in many aspects. The visual effects still hold up remarkably well even by today's standards, and the action is unparalleled. It is a masterclass in action filmmaking that all aspiring directors in the genre should take notes from.Terminator 2 is not just about adrenaline-pumping action, but it also evokes deep emotions and profound thoughts.

A little over rated,Terminator 2 is a good film but not as good as the first one. In my opinnon Arnold gave a better proformace in the first movie along with the directing. To me if it was not for Robert Patrick being one of the greatest villins I have ever seen I dont think this film would have been rated as high as it is. So I have figured out that the highest this film should be rated is a 7 and anyone who rates it over that is stupid.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Failing in all ways (aside from special effects) to live up to the original,"Okay, I dislike this movie intensely.  I saw it before I saw Terminator, and I almost didn't watch the original because of it.  I love the original, it had character and drama, and you felt something when you watched it.The thing that most upsets me about this movie is that it all but totally disregards the original.  Sure, the psychiatrist shows up, but that does not continuity make.  Sarah was supposed to be strong and brave, and teach and guide her son.  I didn't think that meant being an alcoholic female Rambo. That glimpse of her we caught at the end of Terminator was what she was all about.  Sure, she was strong, but she had vulnerability.John, though tough for a kid, lacks something.And the cyborg (also 800 series) looks exactly like the first one?  If they all looked alike, it would be pretty easy to pick them out after one revealed itself.Ah, and the plot was absolutely grade-schoolish.  Killing machine is redeem himself.  While I have no problem with this plot in general, the Iron Giant (an animated film) managed to pull it off better than T2.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful,"All time favorite film. Linda Hamilton really makes this film special to me for her performance as Sarah Connor. The whole scene where she is trying to warn the docters at the psych hospital iabout the end of the world is just mind blowing. The relationship between Jon connor and the T 800 is unforgettable. The aesthetic is gritty and real. The lighting in certain scenes realy sets the tone. I know that alot of original fans of the series prefer Terminator 1 and I get it, but Terminator 2 is one of those sequels that really knocks it out of the park.Beautiful plot and execution for an action film in 1991.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" - A Groundbreaking Sci-Fi Action Classic","""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an iconic science fiction masterpiece directed by James Cameron, a film that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every way. Released in 1991, this groundbreaking sequel redefined the action genre and set new standards for visual effects, storytelling, and character development. With its heart-pounding action sequences, mind-bending visual effects, and exceptional performances, ""Terminator 2"" remains a timeless classic that continues to thrill audiences worldwide.Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the film continues the story of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and her son John Connor (Edward Furlong), as they face a new, advanced model of the deadly Terminator cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger). However, this time, Schwarzenegger's Terminator is reprogrammed and sent back to protect young John from the relentless and nearly indestructible T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a shape-shifting killing machine sent by Skynet to eliminate him.""Terminator 2"" is a technical marvel, pushing the boundaries of visual effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI) at the time. The seamless integration of practical effects and cutting-edge CGI created jaw-dropping action sequences, notably the iconic truck chase and the nail-biting showdown in the steel mill. These scenes are a testament to James Cameron's visionary direction and his ability to blend spectacle with a gripping narrative.The performances in ""Terminator 2"" are exceptional, particularly Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor. Hamilton's transformation into a hardened and battle-weary warrior is awe-inspiring, and her dedication to the role brings depth and authenticity to the character. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the Terminator with undeniable charisma and delivers his iconic ""I'll be back"" line with perfect timing.Edward Furlong's portrayal of John Connor brings a refreshing innocence and vulnerability to the story. His chemistry with Schwarzenegger creates an unexpected and endearing bond that lies at the heart of the film's emotional core.The film's screenplay is intelligently crafted, blending action, drama, and thought-provoking themes about the nature of humanity and the consequences of our actions. ""Terminator 2"" is not just an action-packed spectacle; it explores the relationship between humans and machines, raising questions about free will and the potential dangers of technology.Brad Fiedel's electrifying musical score is a perfect accompaniment to the film's pulse-pounding action, capturing the intensity and urgency of the story.If there is any minor criticism, it's that some scenes may feel slightly dated in terms of CGI by today's standards. Nevertheless, this in no way detracts from the overall impact and brilliance of the film.In conclusion, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a genre-defining science fiction action classic that continues to leave an indelible mark on popular culture. James Cameron's visionary direction, groundbreaking visual effects, and outstanding performances make it an unforgettable cinematic experience. It remains a testament to the power of storytelling and remains as thrilling and relevant today as it was upon its release. For fans of sci-fi and action alike, ""Terminator 2"" is an absolute must-watch, and its enduring legacy solidifies its place as one of the greatest films of its genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Cameron's Magnum Opus,"A movie that set the bar for related genres, the claim of ""Greatest Action Movie of All Time"" seems not an exaggeration.

After more than thirty years of being present with other extraordinary films, Terminator 2 still being one of the most phenomenal and influential films for the film industry and pop culture, it's no wonder that this film will still have an impact in the decades to come (especially for Sci-Fi genres).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best. Terminator. Movie. Ever.,"I'm not even going to bother with a real review of this film, because it has like 4000 other reviews and most people know what it is even if they haven't seen it. Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum, and a robot from the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry, because her son (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and save the son (himself). Yeah, it might not make sense from a time travel point of view, but just deal with it.What to say? Arnold is great, as usual (though this is no ""Commando""). Edward Furlong is young, but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on him some people do, but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome, even if he has creepy weird ears. And this is more action than you'll get in most films, which is probably what you want if you're watching this.There, that was my little review. Maybe next time i see the film, I'll expand it to something with substance. But for now, this is good enough... read the other reviews instead.

Was the scene deleted from the movie?I think it is a very important scene.Because at that time Linda could destroy the terminator.But she kept him alive(John helped her)since they need him or it to be alive.But this very important scene is vanished.I don't know why it happened,there may be some reasons.I am steel searching the scene.I am mad about T2.Please please tell me where is that scene?

The Last Action Hero,"Starring Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Earl Boen, Joe Morton, Castulo Guerra, S. Epatha Merkerson, Danny Cooksey, Jennette Goldstein, Xander Berkeley, Michael Edwards, and introducing Edward Furlong.In the year of 2029, John Connor has become a rebel. He has tried to protect humans from Skynet, a computer fighting human resistence. Skynet sends a terminator, different from T-800, out to kill a younger John Connor in the 90's. At that same time, John Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect him.After saving John from T-1000 in the 90's, John and the Terminator go to to free Sarah Connor, John's mother, from a state mental institution. Sarah has been held there for years because of the events of ""The Terminator"". When they free her, they go to see Miles Dyson, the leader of Cyberdyne, the same company as Skynet, who has no idea of what it is becoming. All of them go to Cyberdyne and try to destroy it before T-1000 gets ahold of them.Filmed with amazing special effects and an interesting storyline, ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" scores a pretty high rating in my book. This feature ends up being pretty than the original.The acting was very good in this film. The acting from Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick was all good, as for Edward Furlong, a fair performance. I didn't expect much from him, after all, this was his pre-""American History X"" performance.The special effects in the film are top-notch. They were very well done and even helped the movie win an Academy Award.""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is one of my favorite Action movies ever made. The special edition DVD makes it even more fun to watch, with the picture and sound remastered. You won't be disappointed with the ending, the emotion between The Terminator and John cannot be missed.

"Good action movie, but strays too close to Terminator 1's formula","This is by no means a bad movie. I love the performances all around, the action is great, the directing is very smooth and I was overall very fond to stepping into the Terminator universe once more. That being said, while this sequel is certainly more ambitious in it's set pieces, I enjoyed the first one a lot more.The plot follows the same structure, except Arnold is casted differently. The first half of the movie fleshes out the characters and their motivations. It definitely sucked me in. The second half consisted of mostly just metal, bullets, trucks and explosions. The ending was kind of predictable. All in all, it was very entertaining and polished, but I don't think the film had anything significant to add on the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's all about the sub-plots,"I will never forget the day when my dad took me and my three older brothers to see T2's premiere in 1991. I was only 6 years old. During parts, and at the end of the movie, people stood up, on their seats, and applauded louder than I have ever heard people applaud since. This is in my mind, at least one of the best 100 movies of all time. It's hard to beat out those older films that AFI for some reason greatly respects, but for their time, they were good too. What I like most about T2 is the sub-plots. The one sub-plot I enjoy the most is the greater awareness and human instinct of the Terminator as he evolves through the film. I'm a film student at Columbia College in Chicago, and I will tell you that this movie is very under appreciated. However, I will always be it's biggest fan, along with my best bro Panty. Here are some of my favorite lines: ""Good morning Dr. Silverman...how's the knee?"" ""He'll live!"" ""Sayyy, that's a nice bike..."" ""I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.""

Not as good as the original....,"Terminator 2, overall, is a good film. For its time (1991) the special effects is simply amazing. The whole story is excellent for a sci-fi film. But, the original is a better film on the whole. John Connor for example....is simply horrible in this film. I can't remember ever having to hear a voice more annoying than his in a movie. Because he is one of the main characters...we're forced to see him a lot, and unfortunately HEAR him a lot. There are certain scenes that are a bit corny or cheesy if you will... but I kinda expect that from James Cameron. Robert Patrick made himself pretty much here...I don't think anyone else could've played the T-1000 the way he did. The original Terminator was much more colder and darker....which I prefer for such a heavy story. I feel the story was more concrete in the original as well. Overall I enjoyed the film...despite the amazing special effects...I'm not sure if it surpasses ""The Predator"", done 4 years earlier. I give it a 6/10...but the original was better. And now that I hear Cameron will not do Terminator 3, I highly doubt if I will even bother with that sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good special effects,"Many people thinks this movie is better than the first. I do not agree. The first had a great story, great acting and REAL exitment. Arnold was a ROBOT in that one, not an actor who tries to do a likeable version of a robot. It was also more thrilling becourse Sarah didn´t have a robot who never needed sleep to watch over her. She only had a vulnerable young boy from the future who she fell in love with and lost. I don´t say the second was bad. But the most touching scenes was those who reminded me of the first movie. Like when John wonders about his dad and they show Sarah photos from the policestation 1984. Its also is hard to see ""father unknown"" when the computer scrolls down information about John. The first one left the future hanging in the air. The other one was good, but should of been more of a ""human"" story like the first one was.T1 10/10 T2  8/10Sorry for bad english.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Perfect 10,"This movie is perfect...seriously. That's a dangerous thing for a reviewer to say, but there it is. The effects are great (maybe not as ground breaking as they were back in the day, but they work, and they aren't overused). The story is gripping and original. The acting is spot on, and ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE. There are no ""why would he do that"" or ""why is she so ripped?"". This movie is so tightly constructed that the audience can suspend their belief and get thoroughly enraptured in it.Edward Furlong deserves the ""Christian Bale Child Actor of the Year"" award. His portrayal of John Connor is vulnerable, intelligent and lovable. Linda Hamilton becomes her character utterly, body (0% body fat) and soul. And Arnold Schwarzenneger appears in the role he was born to play. He is remarkably engaging and (dare I say it?) comedic, for a man playing a machine. His performance is utterly believable. Robert Patrick (who doesn't have much charisma) is perfectly cast as the stone cold killing machine who looks like an everyman.This movie is thoughtful, exciting and epically good. See it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More Than Just Action,"When this movie came out at the theatres, I was 15. I thought it was cool. I'm 24 now and I see this movie in a completely different light. I don't doubt that the movie has amazing special effects that makes the movie quite watchable if you just want to vegatate for a couple of hours. I don't doubt that there  might be a few plot holes and discontinuity in the time travel aspect of the story. This is something I have yet to figure out.   But after watching this movie a few times and reading critical reviews of the movie, I've come to this current opinion. If you bother to think about this movie beyond the great special effects, you might find that it has more to offer than the cool F/X. James Cameron is a very critical and detail oriented director. If you are familiar with his work at all, you will see an emerging theme in all of his movies. I believe that theme is humanity vs. technology. (THE ABYSS, TITANIC, ALIENS) In any case, the characters are an INTEGRAL part of the story and not simply the platform in which the action takes place. Compare this movie to say, practically any Jerry Bruckheimer movie. (Gone in Sixty Seconds anyone?) James Cameron thinks about his characters first before he can imagine the situation in which they may reasonably be confronted with. James Cameron says himself that the intent of the movie was to make people feel for a robot, to cry for him, and not simply to be blown away by the action taking place within the context of the characters and the story.With this in mind, I see this movie as first and foremost, a human story. The whole premise of this story is the fight for humankind. Humans vs. Machines. I mentioned Cameron's theme earlier: humanity vs. technology. In this movie, the more technologically advanced we become, the more inhuman we are. Witness this as Sarah Conner becomes more of a terminator herself in her willingness to kill Miles Dyson. She does not question morally or ethically about why she is killing him. She is just going to do it. Before she does it though, she has an epiphany and she realizes exactly what she has become. It is shattering to her. There is such a moral fabric throughout this story voiced by our future hero: ""You can't kill people!!!"" And later on, ""Don't you get it?! Don't you understand why you can't kill people? Because we hurt, we feel pain, we're afraid..."" It is not surprising that John has such a strong moral fabric. After all, he is going to become a great leader someday. Ironically, it is his teachings to the terminator and the resetting of the CPU that makes the terminator more human. In the end, he becomes half-human and he realizes his half-humanity. ""I know now why you cry... but it is something that I can never do."" It makes his sacrifice even more greater. A hero is defined as someone who sacrifices himself for a greater good, something greater than even his own existence. Although the terminator could have stayed, he chose to go. In this movie, he is a true hero. Cameron chose to have this strong moral issue in the film... he did not want Arnold as the good robot killing everything in his way- which he could have easily done. After all, he is a terminator. He chose to weave this moral fabric into the story which I think many people easily overlook. The terminator teaches us a lot about ourselves too. This is a very spiritual aspect of the film. John says to the terminator, ""we're not going to make it, are me? People, I mean..."" to which the terminator replies, ""It is in your nature to destroy yourselves....""   It makes the theme and message of the whole movie even more meaningful. The theme of the movie can best be summed up by Sarah Conner, ""If a machine,a terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."" It took something as inhuman as the terminator to teach us something very human about ourselves: loyalty, love, fear, sacrifice, and hope. So before you write T2 off as just another action movie, I challenge you to watch it critically. This movie is about destiny vs. free will, (how much control over our future do we have? as john says, ""there is no fate but what we make of it ourselves."") and as I've said before, really about being human in such a technologically run world. Watch as Sarah fights to protect her son, watch as john just desperately wants his mother to embrace him and love him. Observe the quiet moments of contemplation and rest in this movie. This movie is not perfect as no movie is but as an action movie, it certainly provides a lot more than a two hour adrenaline rush.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

He's just great here, as is Robert Patrick, the perfect mix, equally cool, but he's menacing, and had that other worldly vibe going on.The special effects, they were ground breaking at that time, and I would argue proved to be a game changer for Hollywood, they still hold up incredibly well, those liquid metal sequences, especially that iconic moment on that chequered floor, sensational.It's a phenomenal film, rightly regarded as a classic.

New level of Sci-Fi and movie art on whole.,"If not the best Sci-Fi movie ever, then at least heads TOP 5.It is hard to describe awesomeness of this movie. Made back in 1991 it possesses all the elements of a modern Hollywood masterpiece, and still retains its originality reminds of that era in 1970s-80s when there were no rip offs and directors like Coppola and Scorsese were defining the meaning of MOVIE MASTERPIECE. James Cameron achieved the same thing in a totally opposite genre.In this movie he depicted such a vivid and deep vision of an apocalyptic turn of the events, a consequent doom of mankind as he saw it in a modern world where hastened evolution of technology implied a disaster so deterrent as a nuclear war. The screenplay keeps your attention to the very end, and visual effects were kind of revolutionary.A high level entertainment unveiling a much greater message than the plot itself. I'm a dedicated fan of T1, but the sequel is without a match.Without the vision, this movie would be nothing. The visual allegory of nuclear fire destroying playground and terminator skull emerging from flames as the utmost outcome... That's some good stuff. In moments like that can one discern the true quality of the movie. Sarah's dream sequence is one of the highlights of the movie, and again would be ridiculous without the(director's) visionThe iconic intro and credits were composed brilliantly and the music theme couldn't be more fitting to the whole idea. Never before, nor after, have I heard a theme that describes the message of a movie so appropriately.The movie itself tried to maintain the touch with younger audience by implementing kitschy innovations but on the other hand directors like Spielberg maintain this as their freaking modus operandi.Schwarzenegger's blunt acting fits in this role perfectly, and T2 spawned some memorable one-liners. It really somewhat captured the 80's/early 90's cultural zeitgeist.There is a lot of appropriately implemented shooting and explosion scenes, and fight between the terminators. Still, I have to mention that this part perhaps did not intend to leave space for a sequel and I'm not a fan of T3, but I think it's nice to see other directors making their own versions of this cult franchise.10/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

This is the Walt Disney Version of Terminator,"If you've seen The Terminator, then you've already seen Terminator 2. Same plot line, same scenes, even the same lines crop up - the only difference is that this time there's a cute kid, and the cute kid insists on there being no deaths. Instead of the terminator blasting away at everyone in sight, he shoots them in the leg! The first film was original, shocking, disturbing and carried a powerful emotional charge. The dream of Kyle Reese, the man sent to protect Sarah Connor, is powerfully disturbing - a vision of the future in which mankind is being hunted to extinction, yet manages to just about hold on. In Terminator 2 we have the same scene - this  time it is Sarah Connor dreaming, and her dream is a clichéd one: the atom bomb dropping. A vision we long ago became familiar with and so holds no resonance at all. That lack of imagination and originality runs throughout this tired film. The fight in the first film was between a passionate human being (a man who feels pain, fear and love) and a remorseless cyborg. The end, in which a human uses cunning and ingenuity to destroy the machine, and uses another machine to do that, is satisfactory. In this limp re-make it is cyborg versus cyborg, and humans are on the side-lines.

Worst sequel of all time,"Think I'm joking? I'm not. I would go so far as to say that if you saw and understood The Terminator, then saw and understood T2, you could only like the sequel if concepts such as consistency and plot integrity were of no value to you whatsoever. If you like a cheap grab-bag of special effects tacked onto the top of a cynical, lazy effort to rehash the original film and make loads of money, I can see why you might like T2. As a sequel to one of the most intelligent action films of the 80s, however, this is an abomination of a movie. If you think the two stories can be viewed as mutually compatible, you have a very poor grasp of the logic and metaphysics of the narrative universe set up in The Terminator. Basically Cameron and Wisher set out their rules in The Terminator, and then proceed to break them at every step here, hoping that the audience will be too stupid to notice or care. Sadly, for the most part they were proved correct.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terminator 2 is still the benchmark in action blockbusters 32 years after its release. Superbly aged!,"Already the incisive, cold, metallic main theme announces the impending apocalypse.A colossal clash between the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the modern, almost indestructible T-1000 (Robert Patrick) - every time you think you've seen the craziest and most spectacular scene, another one comes along that simply takes your breath away! You sit in front of the TV screens thinking ""you've got to be kidding me, how awesome was that?"" and it never stops. The movie never should have stopped.Not one second did I feel bored.Robert Patrick embodies the T-1000 perfectly. The facial expressions and gestures, the anatomy, the facial features!I think it's even better than part 1, with more pace, more effects and an absolutely cool Robert Patrick as the fluid Terminator T1000.He has a really fitting cold robot face. Smoothly cut, without blemish or emotion. As if modeled from clay.The T-1000 seems like a real threat, Arnie has never been cooler and the film is exciting from start to finish. The action is still outstanding, the pacing is perfect and on top of that the film manages to pull you along emotionally, because you are rooting for the characters and besides the action the film also offers many character moments that give the characters depth.Scary exciting chases and immense transformation with the artificial machine, which knows completely stubbornly and inevitably only one goal: eliminate. Cult.This movie offers us a lot of multi-layered and never seen before action - crazy car chases, cool sayings (""I want your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle"" - ""You forgot to say please""), well-placed humor (Arnie's glasses break).We also witness gloomy visions of the future, a scary nuclear destruction and a neat dynamic between mother and child.Production-wise, this film offers us the highest level of quality and you can tell that it was developed with a lot of heart and soul.Conclusion: For many people the best film of all time! Why: Because the film is exciting, because it was damn innovative in terms of trick technology in 1991, and because it still blows the minds of the masses today in terms of trick technology and because it was perfectly staged down to the smallest detail.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Absolutely Brilliant...,"One of my favourite films and one of the greatest movies of all time, Terminator 2 (T2) is absolutely brilliant!I remember watching T2 on the big screen in 1991. Oh boy! That was an eye-popping experience! Never mind that T2 set new standards in sfx - Terminator 2 is a tremendous film in its own right. Great story, great setting, brilliant acting & dialogue, great music. This is flawless. It's a Sci-fi Action film for the ages.There are so many sci-fi movies these days and the effects are so good that we've gotten used to them. Very few of them measure up to Terminator 2 though. Why? Because T2 manages to create its own visual language, and it has a proper emotional heart.Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, the more-than-half crazed, verging on psychopathic mother of John Connor (played brilliantly by Edward Furlong), future military leader (no spoilers!). Hamilton gives an exceptional performance throughout, and I mean exceptional...! The chemistry between her and her son is remarkable. But the most remarkable relationship of all is between John and a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the machine sent to protect him. This is one of the greatest screen relationships. Iconic.Meanwhile, a Liquid Metal Terminator - a T1000 (Robert Patrick) has been sent back through time as well. It is a highly intelligent and calculating implacable killer, and virtually indestructible. Through the T1000 we feel what it would be like to be pursued relentlessly and hunted to death. Alongside Schwarzeneggers' Terminator we understand the difference between men & machines. This is scary and brilliant at the same time.I love this movie!

This movie is pervaded with bad-ass chasing scenes, perfectly angled crashes, magnificently luminous explosions and gunshots etc which secures it's position as one of the best action movies of all time. But it's not merely the action that makes this a great movie. Apart from the overwhelming action scenes, this movie is also robustly acted , written, produced and directed which further adds up to it's overall quality. Hence, this movie is also one of James Cameron's absolute masterpieces (one of my top 5 James Cameron flims of all time). Furthermore, every single aspect of this movie plays an equal role in securing the greatness of the movie. From punchy dialogues to top-notch action sequences and outstanding acting to a captivating plot, this movie is undoubtedly a 2 hr 30 min roller coaster ride. 10/10 from me for this one-of-a-kind masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
one of the best action movies ever made.,"This is one of the best action movies ever made. The story line isn't anything revolutionary, it's practically the same as the first Terminator. The only difference is how it is told. This is one of the best examples of how powerful a good director can be. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, and well worth it. It received across the board thumbs up and broke box office records. The next most expensive movie ever made in chronological order was Water World - a turd.

No as good as the first film!,"I love 'T2' but it isn't as good as the original film.  People are fooled by it because, yes, it does look better.  But as a FILM with all the elements in place and evaluated, this film has less edge and a running time that is too long.  Although it won four technical Oscars, James Cameron's vision in the first film is far more clear and original.  Arnold looks far more menacing as a bad guy.  He looked younger and much hungrier for action in the first film and Michael Biehn was a great character as Reese who, unfortunately, had to get killed off.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A Childhood Favorite--Not As Good Now, Though","This movie was far and away my favorite film for several years after it was released. I was thirteen when the film hit theaters in 1991, and I had seen the original ""Terminator"" over and over again on VHS when I was a kid. Back then, ""T2: Judgment Day"" seemed like a huge improvement over its predecessor. The effects were much better, for one, and the storyline seemed more developed--and that's probably a true statement.However, having watched both films this week, I can safely say that as an adult, I now find the first ""Terminator"" to be far superior to this sequel. The original movie has so much going for it in terms of just being a quality stand alone film. This sequel has its good qualities as well--it's still a good film, which is why I've given it 7/10 stars.Still, seeing this film now, I'm able to see its flaws a bit more clearly. As good as it is, throughout the film I found myself surprised to imagine that it didn't seem too much better, quality wise, than a made-for-TV movie would today. Schwarzenegger's character still looks fake when the cyborg skeleton starts showing through his face in the final fight scene (although the part where the inner skeleton arm is revealed is pretty cool). That, and while there are plenty of big league action scenes in this movie, the light-hearted vibe of this movie--the witty banter mixed with things like George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"" being part of the score--just makes this film a bit hard to take seriously. It's a film that was made to be a blockbuster that would appeal to all, whereas the original was a sci-fi/horror flick that happened to become a blockbuster because of its innate quality.All in all this movie is still good and watchable. But I see it very differently at 37 than I did at 13. 7/10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Mostly Good,"I really prefer the first Terminator movie because it is darker and just has a more real feel and edgier tone. It's bleaker and just more pure sci fi to me.Kind of the same way I feel about Alien (best sci fi movie ever in my opinion except maybe for 2001: A Space Odyssey) and Aliens/Alien 2, just like that movie Terminator got a lot bigger and went for way more action with a much bigger budget. Still a good movie don't get me wrong but it lost a lot of the magic.For one thing, Arnold S. as the evil killing machine assassin from the future was wicked. That scene where he takes out the entire police station? Wicked! But because it's Hollywood the producers or he or his agents said that he has to be the GOOD guy so he comes back as a machine to be the kid's bodyguard. Would have been better in my mind to stick with him as the killer.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
In one word: Brilliant,"Let me start by saying what everybody has already said, the acting is great, the story great, the effects awesome, the characters believable, the action brilliant. I don't know a soul who doesn't like this film. Me personally, I though this would just be another shame to the original, make lots of money, and throw in some effects just to make a good profit. But I was wrong in every sense of the word. James Cameron has come over and beyond, not just mine, but everyone's expectations and has put together a film that doesn't just focus on action or effects, but focuses on the characters as well. Which is why I like older movies better than newer movies. The thing about older movies is that since back in those days, there was no such thing as CGI, so instead of making the monsters or whatever look real and convincing, they made they characters convincing as well. Now, we could make a movie that is entirely CGI, and the problem with that is, that instead of focusing on the characters, they focus more on making the monster or whatever as real as possible, but they forget about making the characters real. I like this film because it's the on in a million that has good effects, and good characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
interesting information,"The film was the most expensive film ever made. Its budget was exactly 94 million dollars1.

Terminator 2 was the first movie to do this and won 4 OscarsArnold Schwarzenegger said only 700 words in the movie for which he earned $15 million. In today's terms, each word was worth $21,429. The cost of the line ""Hasta la vista, baby"" was $85,7162.Robert Patrick, who played the T-1000 character in the movie, learned to run very fast for his role.

"Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" still a heart-pumping, thought-provoking sci-fi masterpiece","Terminator 2: Judgment Day, directed by James Cameron, is a masterful work of science fiction that effortlessly blends heart-stopping action with complex themes about the nature of humanity and the consequences of technology. The film follows Sarah Connor, now a fierce warrior and mother, as she fights to protect her son John, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines. However, the stakes are raised when a new, more advanced terminator is sent back in time to eliminate John and Sarah.One of the film's greatest strengths is its visual effects. The T-1000, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick, is a chilling villain with the ability to transform and regenerate, making it nearly invincible. The action sequences are heart-pounding, with car chases, explosions, and shootouts that never feel gratuitous or mindless. But the film also knows when to slow down, allowing for moments of quiet reflection and emotional depth that give weight to the characters and their struggles.The performances are all excellent, with Linda Hamilton delivering a fierce and nuanced portrayal of Sarah Connor, and Arnold Schwarzenegger giving one of his best performances as the reprogrammed T-800. Edward Furlong, in his breakout role as John Connor, brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the film.Overall, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that continues to be a landmark in the science fiction genre. Its themes of technology, humanity, and the power of choice resonate even more strongly today than they did at the time of its release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A great movie,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day, directed by James Cameron, is an iconic science fiction action film that remains a timeless classic even years after its release. Released in 1991 as a sequel to the original Terminator film, this masterpiece has continued to captivate audiences with its thrilling storyline, groundbreaking visual effects, and stellar performances.Set in a dystopian future, the film follows Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a resolute and fierce mother who must protect her son John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance against the machines. The Terminator, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, also returns, but this time as the protector of John, sent back from the future to thwart the efforts of the more advanced and deadly T-1000 (Robert Patrick).One of the film's major strengths lies in its gripping storyline, which seamlessly weaves together heart-pounding action sequences with deeply emotional moments. The transformation of the Terminator from a merciless killing machine to a compassionate protector adds an unexpected layer of depth and humanity to the character, making him one of cinema's most unforgettable heroes. The mother-son dynamic between Sarah and John is beautifully portrayed, and their bond becomes the emotional core of the film.Terminator 2 was a pioneer in visual effects and has set new standards for the industry. The liquid-metal CGI effects used to depict the T-1000's shapeshifting abilities were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up exceptionally well today. The film's action sequences, including the jaw-dropping chase scenes and intense shootouts, have left an indelible mark on action cinema, inspiring countless future films in the genre.Beyond the spectacle, Terminator 2 delves into thought-provoking themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the consequences of humanity's unchecked pursuit of technology. It raises questions about the fine line between man and machine, exploring the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the ethical implications of creating autonomous killing machines.The performances in Terminator 2 are outstanding, with Arnold Schwarzenegger delivering one of his most iconic and memorable portrayals as the Terminator. Linda Hamilton's transformation into a hardened and determined Sarah Connor showcases her acting prowess. Edward Furlong, as the young John Connor, brings innocence and vulnerability to his role, which contrasts beautifully with the hardened characters surrounding him.The film's score, composed by Brad Fiedel, complements the action and emotion perfectly, adding depth to pivotal moments and heightening the overall cinematic experience.Terminator 2: Judgment Day remains an influential film, leaving a lasting impact on both the science fiction and action genres. Its memorable quotes, iconic scenes, and unforgettable characters have become an integral part of pop culture. Even after decades since its release, the film continues to attract new generations of viewers, solidifying its status as a true cinematic classic.In conclusion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a must-watch film for anyone who appreciates thrilling action, heartfelt storytelling, and groundbreaking visual effects.

I like it,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" directed by James Cameron and released in 1991, is a landmark in the science fiction genre and a sequel to the 1984 film ""The Terminator."" It features Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the Terminator but with a twist: this time, he's the hero, sent back to protect John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines. The young John Connor is played by Edward Furlong, and Linda Hamilton returns as his mother, Sarah Connor, delivering a transformed and physically demanding performance that has become iconic.The film is renowned for its groundbreaking visual effects, including the use of CGI to create the shape-shifting T-1000, played by Robert Patrick, which was revolutionary at the time. Its action sequences, special effects, and emotional depth make it one of the greatest action movies ever made.""Terminator 2"" explores themes of fate, free will, and the possibility of redemption. It significantly expands the universe introduced in the first film, adding depth to the ongoing battle between humans and machines. The narrative combines thrilling action with a deeper exploration of its characters, particularly the relationship between Sarah Connor and her son John, as well as the bond that forms between John and the Terminator.The movie was both a critical and commercial success, winning four Academy Awards for its technical achievements and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of the early '90s. Its influence on the science fiction genre and action filmmaking is profound, setting new standards for special effects and narrative depth in blockbuster cinema.

More effective than electro-shock therapy,"I know, Iknow, I am in a minority but I feel compelled to write (for the first time ever) because this film is rubbish in comparison to the original. Yes I do mean RUBBISH, GARBAGE or whatever else you may care to call it. I've rated it a two because if you just want to see Arnie flex his muscles, grunt in an Austrian accent, and generally shoot the place up, I'd have to give it 10 out of 10 and if I was then to say that the special effects were way ahead of their time, why I'd go so far as to give it a 12. The plot's well paced, the acting is good and it makes a decent mindless action film. However this is NOT what I want from a movie, not even an Arnie number.Much of my disappointment is probably due to the time I saw the first film. I will never forget the fear I felt of the implacable terminator ruthlessly tracking ITS prey without regard for anything but fulfilling ITS programmed objectives. The first Terminator film now looks dated beyond belief, but it was way, way ahead of its time. Nonetheless in the sequel there's nothing amazing (apart from the special effects) to freak anyone out. Instead, James Cameron sets out to prove that vacuum cleaners too can have complex personalities. Sorry, it just doesn't wash. And neither does the anti-war theme which is so lightly graffiti-ed over the entire film with the subtlety of a skinhead wielding a baseball bat at a gay pride demonstration. The final little speech made at the end of the film is so unashamedly and outrightly didactic that its saccharin taste leaves one with the need to reach for the bucket. (It still makes me want to wretch just writing about it.)What I love in a good film is coming out of the cinema, forgetting it, but then continually thinking about it over the next few days. What I loathed about Terminator 2 was coming out of the cinema, forgetting about it, and then continually thinking about its inconsistencies for the next few years. Poor though the third film is, at least it attempts to sort out the muddle of illogical time lines left by the second film. It's downright illogical that the mainframe in the future, knowing it had been destroyed would firstly send a model of a Terminator with a surprisingly large batch run, then realize it had failed and so send a new and better number. Why didn't it just send the more advanced prototype first? (If it had lost the war at the hands of John Connor, what else was the thing going to be used for?) If it weren't for the third film, which was desperately needed to explain this mess, the mainframe computer must have known it had lost the battle instantly. After all, it must have found out through its own non-existence. I know I'm pedantic, but I can't really be the only one out there. However, if you are capable of leaving your brain somewhere else, be my guest. Otherwise I must seriously warn you: this film will do serious damage to your IQ and should be given a government health warning.

"Best action movie ever made, hands down!","Fury Road and Die Hard came close but Terminator 2 remains the best action movie ever made.. Worst part is it would have still been the best action movie out there even without the CGI.. Which looks good even today, 30+ years later. I'm a little disappointed that Linda Hamilton was not nominated for an Oscar for her potrayal of Sarah Connor but that's just how it goes I guess. And the fact that Arnie is a horrible actor worked in the movie's favor.. He's playing an emotionless robot and that's basically what he is in real life.. There was no acting involved here, Arnie was just being himself...Everything about this movie just works. The story, the pacing, the one-liners, the awesome special effects and everything in between. And as much as I love the original movie, I honestly have to say I prefer this one.. One of few sequels that actually did justice to it's predecessor. Very unusual in Hollywood.

*Daring Leap into Cinematic Greatness*,"When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This is an epic, in every sense of the word. I used this word only two time GODFATHER (1972) and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It's third movie in which I used 'epic' word. This might quite possibly be the best movie ever made.*Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, directed by James Cameron, is more than just a sequel; it is a revolutionary landmark in the landscape of action and science fiction cinema. This film not only expanded the universe established in its predecessor but also elevated the series to new heights, blending groundbreaking special effects, a deeply resonant story, and unforgettable performances into a seamless cinematic experience.From its stunning opening sequence, where we are thrust into a post-apocalyptic future ruled by machines, *Terminator 2* grips the viewer with an urgency that is palpable. The film's dual narrative thread-combining the relentless pursuit of the T-800, embodied by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the quest to protect young John Connor, the future leader of humanity-creates a dynamic interplay of action and emotion. Schwarzenegger's transformation from emotionless killer to a reluctant protector adds depth to a character that audiences had previously only seen in a purely terrifying light.The introduction of the T-1000, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick, showcases a leap in special effects that was revolutionary for its time. The liquid metal villain not only serves as an intimidating foe but also represents the terrifying possibilities of technology gone awry. Patrick's performance exudes a chilling efficiency that parallels the visual spectacle, making him one of cinema's most memorable antagonists.Linda Hamilton's return as Sarah Connor is nothing short of phenomenal. In this sequel, we witness her evolution into a fierce warrior, a protective mother willing to do whatever it takes to ensure her son's survival. Hamilton brings a raw intensity and vulnerability to the character that resonates deeply as she grapples with her fate and the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her portrayal is a testament to strong female characters in action films and her journey anchors the emotional core of the story.The film's themes are profoundly relevant, tackling questions of free will, the nature of humanity, and the ethical implications of advanced technology. The narrative intricacies encourage viewers to consider the consequences of our choices, making it a thought-provoking experience amidst the high-octane action. The emotional weight culminates in the film's iconic and bittersweet conclusion, leaving audiences both fulfilled and heartbroken.Cameron's direction shines as he masterfully balances thrilling action sequences with poignant character development. The special effects, many of which were groundbreaking at the time, still stand the test of time, thanks to the pioneering work of Industrial Light & Magic. The film's relentless pace and visceral action are perfectly complemented by Brad Fiedel's haunting score, which enhances the film's emotional stakes and adds to the overall suspense.*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* is not just a sequel; it is an essential piece of cinematic art that pushed the boundaries of technology and storytelling. It remains a milestone in action and sci-fi genres, combining thrilling entertainment with deep philosophical questions. With its rich character arcs, groundbreaking effects, and unforgettable performances, it is a film that continues to resonate with audiences, standing as a timeless reminder of the power of cinema to explore the complexities of the human experience while delivering an exhilarating ride.#one of the greatest of all time=10/10🔥",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
mind gum,"Well, I wasn't going to comment on this film, but I find that I have to. Comparing it to Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur is like saying that the Batman cartoonists can use chiaroscuro as well as Rembrandt did. I mean, I can see Arnie doing a cameo in a Kenneth Branagh film in the near future, can't you? He has so much heart, and does a great job of expressing the universal human spirit.This is a film that I loved when I was in high school. I am no longer in high school. I no longer love the film. It is a congeries of major elements in the American action film formula: lots of ""cool"" one-liners, impressive special effects, and lots of explosions and chase scenes. At least when the film sticks to these it's entertaining in that ripping legs off of spiders sort of manner. But when it strays into the arena of philosophical rumination it's just downright sad.One has to be embarrassed for Mr. Cameron that he thinks this should be taken seriously, particularly the facile conclusion at the movie's end. If I want deep thoughts I'll watch something by Bergman or Tarkovsky.

An innovative trend-setter,"Terminator 2, like Star Wars before it and The Matrix after it, revolutionized movie making. I'm not exactly sure, but I believe T2 was the first movie to use CGI. One thing is for sure, they were certainly the first film to use CGI successfully. They brought to screen only what minds could imagine when they introduced the shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator.T2 already had a set base as a story in the success of Terminator. T2 only built upon that success and made sure to one-up its predecessor. Besides the CGI there were some excellent shots and excellent scenes. Just to name a few: when T800 (Schwarzenegger) rescues John Connor on the motorcycle, the amazing slow-mo scene when Sarah Connor attempts to escape the hospital only to come face to face with the T800, and the fight scene between the T800 and the T1000 (Robert Patrick).T2 was a trend setter and a trailblazer, even other movies adopted abbreviating their title. The action was just right. Not too much, not too little, and not over the top to make you think, ""Absolutely impossible.""

The Best Action Movie Ever,"Where do I begin? Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a great movie. It has everything that anyone could possibly want. Spectacular action, state-of-the-art special effects, well-developed characters, a touching story, thought-provoking ideas, and a wonderful cast make this an awesome movie. Easily in my top five.First and foremost, the action scenes in this movie are, in my opinion, the best ones I have ever seen. Huge explosions, intense chases, awe-inspiring weaponry, and one of the most menacing bad guys I've ever seen are a great reason to see this movie, if nothing else. The chases keep getting better and better, starting with a riveting chase through a canal involving motorcycles and tractor trailer cabs and ending with a 'leaves-you-breathless' chase on a freeway with a S.W.A.T. van, a helicopter, and a tanker carrying liquid nitrogen. The weapons used are wild, most notably the scene when The Terminator obliterates the entire police force with a minigun and an M-79 grenade launcher. I could go on, but you get the idea. The action will blow you out of your seat.The special effects are, even now, some of the best I've seen on film. The CGI used here is better than half the stuff that's in movies now. The morphing and reforming effects are amazing, especially when The T-1000 gets its head blown in half and it reforms instantly. WOW! I also got a kick out of when its gun gets stuck after it morphs through the jail bars.The characters are excellent. Schwarzenegger is great in his best-known role and spits out many quotable one-liners, most notably ""Hasta La Vista, Baby."" Arnold as a cyborg has more charisma than Keanu Reeves. He evokes compassion, sadness, laughter, and had me cheering him on the entire time. Linda Hamilton is terrific as the tough-as-nails Sarah Connor, a major change from her innocent and desperate Sarah in the first Terminator. I'd be scared to even look at her. Edward Furlong is decent as John, and is never fully annoying. My only complaint is that his voice cracks a little too much. Everyone else is fantastic.The message conveyed in T2 is very strong. We have become so dependent on technology today that it is taking over our lives. It's also developing faster and faster. It just shows you what could happen if we didn't stop to think, 'Hey, maybe we shouldn't create something that thinks just like us, and can learn at a geometric rate?'But enough preaching.The Bottom Line:If you're looking for mindless action (which I'm a big fan of too) or a compelling story, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a superior film that mixes both of them and yields one hell of a result.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
THE most perfect sci-fi action movie ever,"This is a real piece of work. You cannot imagine a more excellent scenario and directing than these. The whole atmosphere and the combination of steel and blue color really keeps you at the edge.Cameron proves once more that he is a real genius with the camera as his work really moves you deeply.The casting selections seems to be very strict and finally very accurate. If Cameron could work on the sequels, I believe we would watch a trilogy better than ""The Lord of the Rings"".I must have seen this movie over 70 times :P.

No Fate...,"With TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, Director James Cameron did the near-impossible. He surpassed the original film by making the follow-up even more exhilarating and explosive. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his signature role as the killer cyborg from the future. This time, he's on an altogether different mission. Linda Hamilton is back as Sarah Connor. Now in a mental institution, she's become a force to be reckoned with, lean and definitely mean!Edward Furlong is young John Connor, the object of not only Arnie, but a new nemesis (Robert Patrick) that could spell doom for us all!This movie has an almost continuous stream of classic scenes, including the incredible biker bar opening that establishes Arnold as a leather-clad demigod! If you love action, then you'll love every minute of this gargantuan opus!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hasn't aged well,"It really pains me to say this because when I was younger Terminator 2 was always a personal favorite. Unfortunately watching it now with fresh eyes and comparing it conceptually to the original, it's really a colossal mess... Everyone praises T2 for being one of the rare sequels to outdo the original. Actually it just tries way too hard to outdo the first and completely loses the effective simplicity which made the original great. T2 strives to be a 'perfect Hollywood Blockbuster' by blending thought provoking sci-fi concepts and strong character drama with high budget special effects, shoot 'em up action, and lots of comic relief. Unfortunately the end result is nothing more than a McDonalds Big Mac... It looks nice and indulges your craving but ultimately is filled with lots of artificial ingredients and cheese that doesn't sit well long term. It's trying to walk a tightrope with mass appeal blockbuster on one side and sci-fi mastery on the other. Instead of effectively walking this tightrope it more often than not jumps from one side to the other.The main problem I have with T2 is The Terminator itself. Going back to the original, the T-800 was designed to pass just as human enough that it can infiltrate resistance hideouts and assassinate everyone. Simply reprogramming one to go back in time and be a protector wouldn't result in the night and day character transformation the cyborg has from the original. Arnold does a good job staying stoic and cold for the most part but still this cyborg is way too human, and the biggest flaw of all is that it's 'more human than human'. Bladerunner reference aside, what I mean is The T-800 is actually the most likeable character in the entire movie which ultimately is problematic to the concept of the entire franchise. While almost all the human characters in the movie are flawed and unlikeable, The Terminator is perfect. It even points out that humans are destined to destroy themselves (granted if Skynet didn't start the war). When you really take all of that into account why are we rooting for the humans at all, why not root for the machines to win? The Terminator showing a sense of superior humanity is a thought provoking idea but it ultimately ruins the entire motivation of the story which should be that humans while flawed are capable of love and hope which conquers evil. That's the message the first movie conveyed which is completely lost here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Overrated doesn't mean bad.,"I saw ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" in the theater (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) when it first came out. I thought it was great. I watched it many times after it was released on video and cable. As I watched it tonight I realized that when I watched it, I only watched the the first half. I realized that I almost never finished the movie. Tonight I watched the whole thing and realized why. The second half isn't that good. Sure there's some good action but it's not that interesting. The first forty-five minutes or so of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is terrific. The second part of the movie pales in comparison. It's a good movie but not as satisfying a watch as it should be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Arnold for life,"Good Stuff! This movie is perfect. What else can I say? Arnold is back as the Terminator and this time his mission is to protect John Connor from another terminator, the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick (awesome!).At first I was afraid that John Connor would ruin the movie as the annoying kid we see in many movies. I was wrong. As the focus lies on the chase between the two cyborgs and by the way, Arnold has never been this cool!(taking movies as Predator, Conan, Commando and T1 under consideration)Having him on his Harley with the shotgun is priceless! Every aspect of this movie is awesome and this is my number 1 movie of all time. There isn't a single lame scene which gives you a ride you will never forget.10/10 is an understatement...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie.,"This movie is a rarity - if you manage to catch it on TV while channel skipping, you don't change the channel anymore; you just SIT DOWN AND WATCH. That's the commanding power of this film. It has something for everyone - young and old, for the typical summer movie lover to the hardened film critic, this movie has it all.There are so many, many things that I like about this movie. Firstly, there are the action sequences. They are big, grand and spectacular in every sense. Since this is an Arnie/James Cameron movie, you know it's gonna be big. From the storm drain chase to the Cyberdyne police shootout, it is massive. Hordes of stunt-men are present here. You can tell they are dedicated when doing their job. #1 rule of action movies - always have a LOT of stunt crew around.Next, the acting. Arnie is used to being Arnie, but instead of that, and also the creepy, relentless killing machine in the first film, here we see him as a worthy hero and protector, who will do anything to protect John. Some moments in the film shows the Terminator's humanization, an element which gives the movie more credit. To which I recall ""Arnie, do your stuff"". But, truth be told, Arnie gave a better performance as the villain in the first film than in this. Linda Hamilton is also highly commendable as Sarah Connor. In the first film, we see her as the damsel-in-distress, in this one, she's a gung ho commando mom who will do anything to protect her son. This also shows that she is a changed woman, both physically and mentally, as her adventures in the first film have shaped up into this Sarah, and we can't help but cheer for her. Edward Furlong also gives a charming performance as young John, who develops a strong father-son bond between his cyborg protector, an element which serves as the emotional theme for the movie. And, who would not review this movie without mentioning Robert Patrick's chilling and menacing portrayal of the seemingly indestructible and invincible T-1000? The cinematography is great. Adam Greenberg really picks the right scenery for the film to make it feel more ""epic"". The city of Los Angeles have never looked this wide. Also, the night scenes were incredibly shot, especially during the Cyberdyne shootout. The dark scenery is joined with a great dark yet heroic atmosphere which gives the film yet another one of its key elements, although frankly speaking, in terms of atmosphere and mood, my vote goes to the first Terminator movie, no contest.The music - Brad Fiedel returns to give us not only his signature synthesizers, but also to give a new orchestral arrangement for the heroic tone of the movie. His score is fantastic, and the music fits the right places at the right moments. I wish I could hear more of Fiedel in the near future.This movie wouldn't have been possible without the special effects and makeup. This film is one of the first movies to fully take advantage of CGI, but only, repeat, ONLY, during scenes with the T-1000. This is great, because limited CGI means more time for real pyrotechnics, gun-play, and vehicular play as well. VERY unlike the films made today, an example would be Transporter 2. So stylized and so unrealistic. Thankfully, and possibly hopefully, Hollywood have learned its lesson and will probably continue making old school action films, with action films like ""Live Free or Die Hard"", ""Casino Royale"" and recently ""Rambo"", which are all done old school style. That being said, the CGI in the film looks terrific and does not at all look aged. The makeup effects are also good, with realistic metal skull revealings. Both these elements easily surpass the first film.Finally, I would have to comment on James Cameron, who wrote, produced, and directed this blockbuster. He practically delivers fast-paced, kinetic direction, and knows how to build up tension as well. As for the story, some may criticize it for being too redundant to the first (which I agree), but I think that Cameron has done a tremendous job for turning the dark and moody atmosphere of the first into a rip-roaring, no holds barred action adventure. And, giving us moral insights and predictions of machines turning against their creators. Really, if not for Cameron, then who? Overall, I think this is one of the finest films ever to grace the silver screen, and as of today still stands as a colossal and grand masterpiece few can beat. However, in that said few is the first Terminator, which is better than this film.But that's just me being a harsh critic.Now, being the little kid I've always been, this is my favorite movie. I first watched it on VHS when I was 6 years old in 1997 and since then I have watched it more than a dozen times and I never get tired of it. It's a film that will probably never grow old or outdated. This movie not only sparked my interests in movies, but also made Arnie into my favorite action hero. This film is the reason why I've decided to pursue my dreams into becoming a film director (after seeing the hard work and dedication the filmmakers put in while watching the documentary in the Ultimate Edition DVD), and also why I continue loving movies today. This movie is an inspiration to us all, and I strongly recommend anyone - anyone at all, to watch this film. This film, one or not on its own, is a masterpiece.10/10Delton.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Action, action, action, and action","This was one of the greatest action movies of all time. And it had a story!! There was actually a plot to it. Arnold was very cool in that first bar scene. His acting was a lot better than in the first movie. John Connor was more annoying that an immortal mosquito. His constant voice cracking, was making me want to pull out a 9mm and blow him away. I think Sarah was so incredibly morbid the entire film, it kinda put a damper on things. (As if an unstoppable, shape shifting, death machine, hell bent on killing you wasn't a damper enough) It was pretty awesome. I have to give this one of the ""All-Time Best Special Effects Award."" I enjoyed this immensely.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Even machines need love too""","So speaks 'Ginger' from the original Terminator. 2001 will see both the tenth anniversary of the sequel, and, supposedly, the third film in the series. As a result I decided to dig out T2 and see how well it stands up nearly a decade later; watched in a straight run after the original. The 1984 film was made on a meagre budget of $6.4 million and made somewhere around the $50 million mark. This sequel had a $100 million budget and has so far earnt over $620 million.  So it's clear where Hollywood would stand on the issue.Disappointingly, the two don't complement each other at all. Somewhere between the two James Cameron had lost all sense of film-making in a flurry of allocated budgets, and Arnhuld had graduated to ad-libbing ""I need a vacashun"", with a hand-shaking, high-fiving Terminator that learns all about ""family values"". When the original was conceived, Arnold hadn't yet had his first big hit, (Predator), being nearer to Hercules Goes Bananas than True Lies. What happened to the egos of both in between is played out on screen, particularly the portentous monologues by Hamilton that are meant to be worthy and meaningful, but are more often unintentionally hilarious. This is a film, lest we forget, that climaxes with a ""moral of the story"". Did we all really like this kind of stuff at the beginning of the last decade?The original is a vibrant, moody, psychological piece, where the ironically named night club ""tech noir"" acts as a telling counterpoint to the minimalist art nouveau. A film for adults, it featured healthy, but not gratuitous, sexual tone, and occasional usage of the f-word. The sequel is for teenage popcorn munchers. Swearing is toned down and sex is absent, forging a film that, in England at least, became a box-office friendly ""15"", as opposed to a restrictive ""18"" certificate. John Connor sports the t-shirt of a black rap group throughout the picture (Public Enemy), yet the music he plays on his scooter and the incidentals are there purely to capture the lucrative ""white rock"" audience. So this is a Terminator that emerges leather-clad to the ""ironic"" strains of ""Bad to the Bone"", while moronic action sequences are feebly contrasted with Dwight Yoakam and Guns n' Roses.Was it always so bad? I certainly used to enjoy the overblown, overlong and overbearing ""Judgement Day"" a whole lot more. Yet where the original had night, this one has day, in full-blown comicbook Technicolor. While the first movie had some of Cameron's trademark contrivance and overstated imagery (particularly the constant ""machines in everyday life"" allusions), it was someway from the boo-hiss English villainy and Oirish jig-dancing of Titanic. In fact, the low budget gives it its feel. Very much a product of the mid-80s, music by obscure-but-dated group ""Tryanglz"" plays, while mullet haircuts, frizzy bouffants and thin white ties can regularly be seen. The special effects may have dated (notably the back projections, Arnie's false head and the stop-motion exoskeleton), but the whole film is calculated for optimum-noir feel, so it doesn't really matter. Of course Arnold can't act, but that's irrelevant as he plays an expressionless cyborg. In the second film the cyborg gets feelings, and that does cause problems.Formulaic, the second is basically a rehash of the first, complete with ""bad Terminator commandeers a vehicle by saying 'get out' to the driver"", HGV chase on a motorway and showdown in a machinery factory.  That bad Terminator is Robert Patrick, a slight man who doesn't really stand a chance against the twin might of a pumped-up Sarah Connor and the T-800 (weightlifter model). The fact that the main protagonist is wholly absent for a middle section lasting 37 minutes also dissipates any growing sense of threat, something which was constant in the first movie. Just as well he's aided by those magnificent FX, probably the major reason to watch the film, but also the least credible segment. Mind you, the expensive FX can't hide the rather obvious dummy that hangs off the back of Arnie's car, then abruptly cuts to a Patrick close-up. Reminded me of Benny Hill. Even less effective is a (cut, thankfully) scene where his hand turns stripy, as it uncontrollably emulates his environment. This was, of course, the other big selling point of the film, where, two years later, a ""director's cut"" of reinstated cut scenes was released. Some moments, such as a morality debate over whether to smash the T-800's chip add nice touches to the plot. Others, like Arnie learning to smile, or a tritely-written dream sequence with Kyle, detract, and the film is stronger without their inclusion.Moreover, the intellectual properties of the franchise are changed. The first was a warning against machinery, this one a far-less-subtle take on war. Rather hypocritical given the amount of screentime taken up by firepower. Dialogue is naive at best, banal at worst. Take this line from Furlong: ""We have feelings, we hurt, we're afraid. You've gotta learn this stuff, I'm not kidding, it's important"". Furlong, in fact, like all the actors in the movie, is encouraged to deliberately overplay his role, with a high-pitched characterisation that can be quite abrasive.The Terminator is the work of a man-woman team. The testosterone-led Terminator 2 was written by two males. It shows. It lacks depth, clarity, subtlety, and any kind of genuine relationship or characterisation. Aliens to Terminator's Alien, the only sore point here is that Cameron is responsible for both and should have known better. But he didn't, and neither did we, and so we bought a silly film about a sinking ship upon ourselves. And Arnie as the Terminator? No-one bothers to tell the dumb shmoe that if he succeeds in their mission  to destroy all Cyberdyne chips, including his own, to stop the great machine war  that John Connor will never have needed to send his own father back in time and will consequently never exist...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hands down one of the best action  movies in cinema history,"T2 is an excellent over the top action packed, insane visuals, amazing storyline, some emotional moments, in other words it had everything.Arnold was made for a movie like this, john conner was a really good actor for his age, also Sarah conner his mum, and the T-1000, man for a 1991 movie the effects were stunning, all the shape shifting and other kinds of stuff he can do were amazing.Nothing to do with terminator 3 or salvation which really where disappointing.

Really?,"That thing (T-1000) had a hundred chances to kill both John and Sarah and didn't do so. It was liquid molten whatever. It had speed, knowledge, strength, etc... and it was defeated? In the end, it would have cut off Terminator's head over that factory grill, not ""stabbed"" him and left him for dead. (though it would have killed Terminator long before that scene) It would have stabbed Sarah in the eye.. but why even ASK for her to yell for 'John' when he could mimic her voice perfectly (and did so 3 minutes later). So unrealistic. Then a 'magic' gun destroys it? And the end just happens to take place in another weird factory? This time a steel liquid molten factory? T- 1000 was incapable of being destroyed, until suddenly they made it capable. Ridiculous 90s film.

An Excellent Action Epic,"It seems that James Cameron only knows how to make epics, with films like Terminator, Titanic, True Lies, Aliens, and The Abyss it is no surprise that T2 is considered one of the best action films ever made. The special effects are phenomenal and still hold up today, of course you can see more of the flaws but they don't take you out of the film. Arnold is just Arnold but he does give more vulnerability to the role than he did in the original and yet he remains bad ass. Then there is the phenomenal performance of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor watching it again recently I realized how good of a performance she gives in this not just emotionally but how much she really became the character physically. There are so many good action scenes in this that I can't just mention one that stands out, but one of my favorites is the causeway chase at the beginning. Last but not least I want to mention Edward Furlong's performance this was his first film and you can tell that sometimes he is unsure but the performance grows on me every time I watch the movie.

T2 - The first 100 Million Dollar Movie,"Terminator 2 is an amazing action packed movie from writer / director James Cameron. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game returning to play the cyborg the T-800, his most famous movie role. James Cameron's love of Science Fiction and action coupled with the latest film making technology pushed the boundaries in 1991 to their limit. James Cameron uses classical action shots that allow the viewer to see what is going on at all times, something newer film makers/ editors should pay attention to. The reason this film works so well is down to the story itself and the concepts it deals with, James Cameron always writes interesting stories for us to think about but were he differs to 99% of other directors is he merges this with jaw dropping set pieces filmed with energy, often a moving camera shot he totally understands that this is an entertainment medium, he never forgets about his characters though and this why his films always have heart. Terminator 2 is one of the best action / science fiction films of all time, James Cameron is the best action director of all time and Terminator 2 is proof of that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An observation,"With nearly 650 reviews at this point, I haven't read them all so I may be repeating something which has been said elsewhere (although I haven't spotted it among the pages I've sampled).I liked the way Cameron didn't so much repeat the first film as echo it - there were many places where something from the original showed up again, but in a different context, making a different point, driving the plot forward.I liked the way that the gradual role reversal from the first film (Reese strong and supportive, Sarah weak and helpless at the start, exactly reversed by the end) was echoed in the relationship between Sarah and John.Which is why I was particularly surprised at the garage scene with the learning chip being cut from the release print - not only does it illuminate several points which follow it and which don't make sense otherwise, it is also the pivotal moment when John assumes the dominant role in his relationship with his mother which, in turn, echoes the moment in the first film when Sarah starts protecting Kyle rather than vice versa.And another vote in favour of the groundbreaking effects, particularly the way they served the story rather than becoming the reason for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the greatest sci-fi film in existence,"Strong points: Surprisingly complex and deep characters. solid acting, sweet action, special effects that still hold up in this day of CGI and advanced particle effects.Weaknesses: Minor plot holes that nobody cares about, oh who am I kidding, this film is flawless.I say this a lot to people who ask me about movies like Trnsformers that are based solely around action and special effects: The fact that a movie is centered on action and special effects doesn't automatically make it a bad movie. Many people disagree with this, believing that action is useless without characters and plot.This film is an excellent case for both people.The acting is better than any I've ever seen from any sci-fi film. Linda Hamilton is by far the best actress in this film. I am very sorry to say that she never went anywhere after this excellent film. Arnold actually is very good in this film, and manages to play the stoic, but increasingly human father figure to John Connor.That brings me to another area where this film excels, the characters. Every one of the main characters is given depth and emotional realism. The film even explores Sarah Connors psyche, and how it affects her actions.This film also has the some of the best action we have ever seen in a film. Each action scene is expertly crafted by James Cameron. the special effects are so excellent, they still look good, 15 years later after many innovations in computer technology. The only other film I know of to do this is the original Star Wars.The film has one factor which may make or break the experience for some. I for one, enjoyed this element. The fact is, before watching this, pay careful attention to the MPAA rating, because this film is very violent and disturbing. I loved the fact that they had no problem showing everything, but for some people, this may ruin the experience, I don't know, I've never had much problem with violence.Bottom line: Watch this movie, if you can take the violence.

"""Hasta La Vista, Baby!""","James Cameron's 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) is the sequel to 'The Terminator' (1984) and it is about a cyborg, identical to be the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor, must now protect her teenage son, John Connor, from a more advanced and powerful cyborg.Talk about a cool movie! This is one of the best pure sci-fi action films of all time (don't mind my rating)! It is genuinely ridiculous just how good this movie really is! The film excels in so many important and different areas and ends up being so much more than just a sci-fi action movie! At the end of the day, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' offers such a rich experience for the audience as well as some really terrific emotional moments!The T-800 versus the T-1000 is genuinely a great match-up. Making Arnold Schwarzenegger a good guy in this film was the right choice in my opinion while Robert Patrick is playing the T-1000, an AWESOME villain!This film has great visual effects as well as a well thought out story overall. The movie delves deeper into the mythology and the storytelling is so much better than in the first film.
I also found it highly impressive that the pacing in this film is phenomenal! At no particular point did I ever get bored!James Cameron and William Wisher wrote the screenplay and they managed to pack in so much great thought which added so much to the film's gravitas! Cameron also directed the movie and clearly executed it amazingly well!The composer Brad Fiedel did a really good job with the soundtrack as well. The music especially worked during emotional scenes as well as throughout thrilling action scenes.Furthermore it is also really refreshing to have a science fiction film that actually innovates certain things in the genre through creativity!One of the things that surprised me the most is how much I actually cared about these characters! There were a couple of moments that were truly heart-warming and others that really moving!
The bond/friendship between the T-800 Terminator and John Connor is just beautiful thanks to the great dynamic that Edward Furlong and Arnold Schwarzenegger had!If I had to point out a negative thing about this film, then I would mention how a few scenes are a bit too basic and predictable, but the film didn't even that many of those typical movie tropes (that can ruin a film) which I really appreciated!'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is one of the most influential science fiction as well as action films of all time! James Cameron proved a very valuable lesson to Hollywood: you can make an action film accessible for all interest groups! Cameron also gave us a really strong female character with Sarah Connor who is beautifully portrayed by Linda Hamilton!Overall 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is better than the first film thanks to a fantastic story, great storytelling, a threatening villain and awesome characters! This is one of the most innovative, creative and important science fiction films to have ever come out! I really love this film and I plan on watching it over and over and over and over again in the future! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Over Produced and Over Rated Sequel,"That`s typical . Hollywood decides to make lots of money by making a sequel to a classic genre film while ignoring the elements that made the original so brilliant.Take the script for example , THE TERMINATOR had one of the most tightly written scripts I can think of . The sequel is very flabby and mechanical especially in the middle where the fugitives escape to the desert. On top of that it`s very poor SF , if ten years have passed since the first film then that also means that ten years have passed in the future but as the original pointed out Cyberdyne systems had been beaten by the humans so how could they send another , superior terminator back to 1994 ?THE TERMINATOR worked so well because it was well made and written , not because it had an army of stuntmen or FX wizards. This seems to have slipped the producers memories. Here we are treated to explosions , stunts,  FX , car chases ,FX ,  explosions , helicopter chases , FX , explosions, FX, more explosions and a nuclear war featuring - you`ve guessed it - FX and explosions. The morphing FX might have been groundbreaking in 1991 but two years later every pop video , advert and TV title sequence had done the effect to death which means in a space of four or five years T2 looked extremely dated .My final gripe is down to the dubious morality of it all.

a film thats alot more than its special effects,"Terminator 2 has a rare quality amongst sequels! Not only is it visualy more sophisticated and more realistic in its action sequences but it also has a unique quality, that being its storyline. Many sequels are just money spinners with large set pieces and big scenes designed to hide the lack of story. T2 is a very unique film, not only does it superceed the original but it delves deeper into the story with a darker moodier and more creatively sophisticated vision which is rare for its genre.The story being focused on Sarah and john conner and their battle to stop judgment day and the human race being annihilated by machines. In the first film we see sarah being the target of the terminator but this film manages to be nothing more than a very elaborate comic book adventure, the second film becomes almost artwork, the story is much deeper and more emotionally wrenching as a disturbed sarah struggles with the knowledge of the precise date and time and the events leading to the end of civilisation as we know it. The story is much more focused on the nuclear war and the true elements of the whole terminator story where the first film only scratches the surface and just uses the story as an excuse for Arnie to chase Linda Hamilton around LA. the first film was excellent but the second really dug deep into the story to let it be told rather than just be a guideline for an action movie.T2 was groundbreaking in many ways not only for being a much better movie than the original but with its C.G.I (computer Generated image) breakthrough but this is not used to pull the wool over the audiences eyes it is merely there to enhance the realism of the picture and for us to believe and to tap into the emotional torment and horror that the characters must face with the burden of knowing the end of the world lingers and their battle to prevent the war from happening whilst avoiding the very thing they are trying to save that being the human race. Many films since like jurasic park used the same breakthrough effects but with very different purpose, to hide the lack of story and plot developement but T2 uses it to enhance the already very deep and sophisticated story.Terminator 2's script is emotional, unsettling and disturbing if people would just sit down and take the film in they will realise that this picture is much more than just fancy special fx its a triumph of story telling and movie making and its a credit to James Cameron for not letting the sequel drop into the same pit of nasty films trying to cash in on the success of the original but to make it a significant masterpiece in the world of storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Extremely Great,"It is no doubt that T2 is one of my favorite movies and I'm still so exciting when i see the toys the DVDs the pictures all about T2 even nowadays. When I first touched the Extreme Edition DVD collection, I forgot how to breath... What a great masterpiece!We can tell lots of reasons to explain why so many people love T2: the visual effects, the acting, the direction and many many other ones. I'm very agree with all of them. We can say that that's just the every part of T2 is perfect makes the whole movie so extremely perfect. Because of this, there is no need for me to write all. But I still want to mention one point, every time I see T-800 drowning down and disappear in the end, every time I cannot help being deeply touched. And that's the most successful part of the movie I think. It gives machine a heart, a kind of sensation. The machine is not only to live for a mission. He becomes a human's friend, a woman's protector and a kid's father. Although he can never cry.When John full of tears, the tear's flowing in my body too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best movie ever made,"Being a Terminator 2 fan for some years now I think it finally deserves a comment. From the first time I witnessed the fast paced action, high powered weaponry and the the T-1000 emerging from explosions and floors, I was immediately hooked. I don't think there's any aspect of this film that I don't like, it really has a great feel of humanity's struggle against the creation of Skynet which will be responsible for the loss of so much life.It's hard to pick out the best performance here, with Linda Hamilton portraying such a cold character (almost like a Terminator herself), to Robert Patrick's excellent performance as the new Terminator, the T-1000. Even young Edward Furlong is fantastic in this picture being just 9 years of age as the young John Connor. And of course you have Schwartzenegger, who is playing the role he was born to play, unlike the cliché he turns into in Rise of the Machines.I would highly recommend film to anyone. From a distance it might just look like your mindless science-fiction action movie with robots and explosions, but it really is just so much more than that. The production value is phenomenal with great chase scenes and fantastic special effects, even by todays standards. And as I mentioned the performances by the actors are fantastic. But more than all that I think is the whole feel of the movie, which contrasts good over evil brilliantly.10/10, your not going to find a better action movie than this, buy it on special edition if you haven't already..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Incredible Masterpiece! James Cameron You Created Two Of The Best Sequels Ever! (The other being aliens),"Terminator 2: Judgment Day Is One Of The Best Movie Sequels Ever Created.Reason's Why: Characters. The character's are just incredible, They all act very well. it seems as if i'm watching something that's really happening. 5/5Action: The action is some of the best i've ever seen! lots of explosions lots of action. if your a action fan this is the movie for you. 5/5Special Effects: The special Effects are Where incredible for the time and still are. its a good way to use CGI instead of spreading it all over the screen. now i don't hate CG i just think it's used to often. And the special effects are not what the films all about. its the acting and the characters. 5/5Dialog: The dialog was very well done it was never cheesy/corny. if you are picky about bad dialog you won't be picking around! 5/5Plot:In 1994, a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of humanity in a 21st century war against machines. A competing machine (Robert Patrick), the T-1000, is sent back to kill John. With the aid of John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton), the cyborg manages to destroy the T-1000 at a confrontation at a steel mill. However, the cyborg must then destroy itself in order to eliminate its chance of being used to help fuel the future war with the machines. Sarah helps the cyborg destroy itself, but not before the cyborg consoles John, quietly assuring him that everything will be okay. Sarah then notes that if a machine can learn the value of human life, perhaps people can, too.The plot is fantastic, the best i have ever seen! 5/5Overall Terminator 2 is the best film ever made in my opinion.its a A++ Film its much better then the first but thats not saying the first its bad its one of my favorite films.5/5 for terminator 2Thank You For Reading This.-Addison The Movie Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Truly one of Cameron's Best,"I write this comment after watching T3 : Rise of the Machines for the 4th time and it just makes me think that Cameron's movie was not just great, it was phenomenal in every aspect.Discount Arnold's wooden (yet perfect for the part) acting and some minor goof ups with the dates (in the present and the future), you have a movie that not only makes you stay and watch for 2 hours, it also makes you think about war and all its fallouts.The very strong woman character in all of Cameron's movies, Linda Hamilton, in this case is a fine example of how a great director can draw some really good performances from mediocre actors.The sound and the SFX in the movie are far too ahead of their times and are comparable to some on the movies I see today. All in all, an enjoyable film that I promise you will not regret seeing.9 stars out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Blazing Sequel That Terminates Almost Every Other Sci-Fi Movie,"""The future has not been set, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves"". These are the words that set the way The Terminator moves forward. The same applies to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which is one of the greatest sequels ever made in filming history.Like The Terminator, T2 has a Terminator and a protector sent back in time to change the future. But a couple of rules have changed in T2 that make it a different movie. For one, Sarah Conner is no longer the target of the Terminator, it's her now born son John Conner. The other changes is that instead of a Terminator and human soldier sent back, two Terminators are sent to find John Conner. The model sent to protect John is the same as the Terminator from the first movie, so Arnold is back but he's turned a new leaf. The model searching to kill John Conner is the more advanced Terminator, the T-1000, or Alloyman as I like to call him.T2 takes place about ten years after the first Terminator, and a bit has happened since then. One being that John Conner is born and living the life of a typical bad kid. The other and the more surprising being that Sarah Conner is now locked up in a mental institute, where unlike the first, she is now a tough and strict woman that does at times seem close to crazy. Since John of course can't live with his mother he's raised by adopted parents which he obviously loathes, being the computer hacking, bank-stealing kid he's become. The story of how Sarah and John got to where they are is told through the plot segments of the movie so the viewer doesn't feel completely lost.Like it's predecessor, T2 focuses on tense and suspenseful action sequences with plot segments in-between as its means to entertain. And like the first, this technique pays off thanks to some more exciting and memorable scenes. Such scenes that T2 is famous for include the first and last chase scenes in the movie and one of the best endings ever. The plot segments that go before and after the action scenes are more or less story-telling scenes that fill the viewer in on what they have missed between the first Terminator and this Terminator movies.Again, Arnie is back but he's changed. Instead of being a ferocious killing machine he's now a softer and less menacing character. The newer Terminator is played by Robert Patrick, who brings a charming yet obviously deadly personality to his Terminator role. Linda Hamilton returns to play Sarah Conner but she like Arnie has changed, but she's more like Arnold was in the last Terminator movie instead of the innocent hostage-like chick from the first. As for John, he's unprofessionally played by Edward Furlong, but at least he gets the job done as John, but just barely passing.Fans of the first Terminator movie might feel a bit betrayed by the changes in the characters but Cameron actually took a logical direction with the characters and it pays off surprisingly well. Most of the movie seems dedicated to allowing the viewer to establish an accurate with the new and old characters to the movie. This combined with some unforgettable action scenes help to make T2 one of the better movies to find a certain love for, one way or another. This works especially well in the perfect ending that many fans will say was the real ending to the Terminator movies despite the release of T3.Terminator 2 stands as a monumental accomplishment that shows the peak of James Cameron's directing talent. As Arnold said in the first Terminator ""I'll be back"" and he did come back and brought back a fresh supply of excellence. The great action is back, the excellent story-telling is back and the great acting, despite some obvious complaints in Furlong and perhaps Hamilton and Arnie's roles is also back nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best and most memorable film I have ever seen,"There are many people who call T2 the best sequel to date, others claim it is the best SciFi flick they've ever watched, but I would like to say: I never felt as privileged to be shown a movie as with this one. There are of course the more obvious fields in which this film excels, like mind-blowing special effects (especially for the time when it came out) and acting at its best (thanks Linda!), but there is so much more to it! A unique, original and very becoming soundtrack, cinematography that makes every still a picture to be hung in a living room and James Camerons virtually unmatched direction. All these factors combined would make a fantastic movie alone, but this one's got more: Heart, love and an unforgettable story. To see that so much emotion, reason and art can be expressed through a movie of the SciFi/Action genre that is stunning and entertaining at the same time - this is the ultimate joy of being into the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

This time 2 terminators are sent back in time, one to kill and the other to protect John Conner. Also, Sarah Conner has become a warrior in order to protect her son for the future. Once the machines find John Conner, the action never lets up ! The original special effects team is back with the addition of new faces. The effects in this were the first trek into the world of CGI. The action and stunts are better than there first and are mind-blowing.I give it a 5 out of 5",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Must See,"This movie completely changed cinema. It was one of the first modern sequels to greatly improve on it's predecessor in every way. At the time of it's release it was the most expensive movie yet; and unlike today every dollar can be seen on screen.The story, for not just an action film or a sci-fi film, is superb. Terminator 2 does not follow a typical sequel formula and the audience is greatly rewarded for it. James Cameron shows his uncanny craftsmanship in every frame. Each key character is given motivation and development that complement the direction of the movie. The performances in T2 are chilling, both Hamilton and Morton should have received academy award nominations for their efforts.I have seen this film countless times, and have been rewarded by the special effects each viewing. When I first saw it in 1991, every effect was cutting edge. There was nothing like it and that was part of why it was so successful financially. Since that time effects have jaded viewers. I find that after Jurassic Park, CGI effects became too mainstream and you can see that many films turn into a rush job. T2 was a pioneer effort and so the effects are given the utmost attention.I have to mention Arnold Scharzenger. With Arnold you get to see a cyborg performance that only he can do so well. You also are insured that that action scenes will be spectacular. Arnold has an on screen presence that most do not appreciate.Other praises go to Stan Winston with his creature effects, and all other technical efforts in the movie. This movie also has the smoothest sound editing ever to complement the most outrageous chase scenes on the big screen. Today so many chases are noticeably computer crafted, and to me that takes the audience out of the action. Here we see real buildings,vehicles, and people with amazing results.This is the first action movie to take a chance on an highbrow storyline, by giving characters rational thoughts. It raises questions on the effects that artificial intelligence could have on the world; while providing an exciting median for fans of action and sci-fi. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a great watch for any mature audience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Terrific action, great special effects, solid cast, great movie.","""T2: Terminator 2"" or ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is truly an example of how sequels can be better than the original.Here we are given more action, more special effects, more interesting characters, and a better terminator.It is truly a special and crowning achievement for director/producer/writer James Cameron.It's a film that knows how to make action sequences exciting and how to add some humor into them.That's something you don't get very often.I'll admit that the first movie was great, but it's mediocre compared to the greatness of ""T2"".The movie's key success is Arnold Schwarzenegger.Never will there be an actor who will do a better job as the terminator, for Arnold does it so perfectly that you think of him as a machine and not just an actor.I'll also admit that the villain is also a key role in the movie.Robert Patrick plays his role with lots of potential and you actually care that he's in the movie, even though he's a villain.There's also Linda Hamilton.She returns to her same old role as in the first movie, Sarah Connor.In the first movie, she just seemed like an ordinary person who's being chased by a killer machine.Here, she's a tough and smart character that never bores you and always keeps you interested when she's on the screen.Then there's the action and special effects.Outstanding, just outstanding.The film was made in the early 90's, and the effects are really this good?It just amazes me how Cameron knows how to put these great characters in these exciting action sequences.To put it in a couple of words, this is a GREAT movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Never ceases to amaze me,"This is one of those fairly rare cases where the sequel surpasses the original. In fact, T2 surpasses a lot of films, old and new. It was made around 7 years after the first outing, and is clearly operating on a much larger budget than the original. It has a blockbuster feel to it, as to the late night, B-movie theme of the first one, which still became a cult film despite its low budget.The special effects are amazing, even by todays standards, but unlike other Hollywood blockbusters, it has story, emotion and depth to accompany the explosions, chases and CGI. It has been 16 odd years now since it was made, and despite afew choice haircuts and references to old school gaming systems, it feels as if it hasn't aged a day.Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, but unlike her character in the first one, she is now a lean, mean ass kicking warrior woman. Arnie returns as the T101 Terminator, only this time he is playing a bodyguard sent by the rebel side, to protect a young John Connor (Eddie Furlong) the future leader of the resistance. Those who have seen the film (almosy everyone) will know just how much protection John Connor needs, as the machines send back the dreaded T1000 (Robert Patrick), a being formed of liquid metal, that can manipulate his body into almost anything at the drop of a hat, queue amazing special effects.Sarah, John and the T101 unite soon enough and start a quest to try and prevent the rise of Cyberdine Systems, who are the company responsible for creating a special chip in the near future. This chip will give machines the ability to think for themselves, which in turn will have a devastating, and I mean DEVASTATING effect on the general population. They do this specifically by locating a computer developer named Miles Dyson, who is the lead scientist in the project. All the while, the T1000 is following their moves. He is more advanced than the T101, more ruthless and will not stop until his mission is complete.This film is literally great scene after great scene. There is the brilliant storm drain chases scene, Sarah's escape from the mental institution, T101 with the chain-gun, the battles between T1000 and his target's bodyguard, with the last half hour or so being pure excitement. The character development is brilliant as well, seeing Sarah's bond with her endangered son John, John's father-son bond with the increasingly human 'machine', and Robert Patrick playing the emotionless T1000 with cold eyed precision.This is a film which sweeps you up and pulls you into whats happening. It has laughs and humour to ease the tension, classic lines, great cinematography, top notch action sequences and scenes that will stay with you long after watching. If you haven't seen this, you truly should. It is unmissable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Pure Chrome Musculature,"Some movies age sadly, some with style, and some do not at all. James Cameron, as director of the first two cinematic installments of the Terminator franchise, admits how the focal ideas of this tale are gravitating towards the works of author Harlan Ellison, who delivered numerous stories for the sci-fi series Outer Limits, back in 1963. James Cameron was 13 then, and this television program surely must have given him quite a few retina stigmas and a lot of quality fiction to chew on. After all, quality science-fiction really should be able to offer you a fictional language and a collection of ideas you find intriguing and entertaining at the same time, and this exactly is what the Terminator movie was doing, - in fact, does still - back in-, and from- 1984.Prior to that date, popculture robots were good fellers, cute sidekicks, friendly household appliances, or similar mechanical constructs of the sort that are seeking your bidding and amusement, ready to carry out your commands without hesitation. The Terminator movie rejected this view utterly, creating the then-fresh idea of sophisticated machinery that gets conscious of itself and recognizes its creator as something the world would be more easily manageable without. Machine sends a cyborg assassin back through time with the agenda of eliminating the current leader of the human Resistance. Though the ancient tale of the Golem may come into mind, the idea of intricate and ""evil"" machinery is unknown to the popular culture of the early 80's.""Evil?"" Why would The Terminator be ""evil?"" It is not. It is carrying out a Command, which is to eliminate the future leader of The Resistance. Yet, from a human point of view, - did you have any other sort of view than that so far? - evil is the capacity to harm without remorse. Since The Terminator has no awareness of such a vague concept as remorse, because remorse has no function nor relevance in spite of carrying out its mission with efficiency, the titular character indeed becomes the worst nightmare human can face: a nightmare that knows no mercy, simply because it does not know mercy, indeed.Fortunately, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger who could cement the extremely rare Popculture-Demigod status with his paradigmatic portrayal of the cyborg assassin, the T800 Terminator, as originally Cameron wanted a Terminator figure that blends in more easily. He wanted Lars Henriksen, among others - this concept became realized in the Aliens, two years after The Terminator.If one wants to be honest AND a Terminator geek at the same time - and let us want that, for a moment - then it is safe to state that a Terminator movie simply is not a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger, since the heart and soul of the entire franchise is Schwarzenegger, as he is methodically-, thoroughly clears out an entire police station with a shotgun, wearing cheap sunglasses, T800 haircut and a black leather jacket.The Terminator movie gains a pure-musculature continuation via its 1991 sequel Judgment Day, as director James Cameron has a masterful sense of what to offer-, what to show to deliver an installment that has no other agenda than to entertain with fresh and inventive elements he found, as result of going on with the story. This time, the T800 model becomes a good guy, while the main baddie is coming for you through the introduction of the state of the art T1000 model, the perfected cybernetic organism. As of now, the T800's assignment is to protect the leader of the Resistance from the death clutch of an even more efficient cyborg assassin, a construct Cameron uses to deliver inventive, state of the art special effects, revealing narrative brilliance and related playfulness at the core.The T2 movie is a cybernetic rat race really, orchestrated-, and operated by the simple conflict of the urge of Termination and the confronting urge of Termination-Prevention: the idea is as grateful as it is elegantly simplistic, and Cameron has a whole lot to tell about how good of a time he has with all the significant elements he brings to the fray. The T2 movie does everything with the largely abused term: action packed-, and THEN does some more with it. The reason the movie remains an accomplishment of truly slick qualities, is the accumulated result of Cameron's sense of how to give an extremely sharp character to a scene ""simply by"" throwing in masterful elements that can't help but support a set via their mere presence and their slickly chosen functionalities.In the exceptionally memorable chase sequence, for example, Arnold rides a good, old fashioned Harley Davidson bikebeast, removing the obstacles in his way via his favorite good, old fashioned shotgun, reloading it in a way that gives male viewers an immediate extra layer of hair to the chest via every buckshot implemented. Meanwhile, the state of the art T1000 model bids in radical proportions when the moment whispers lies about a second of peace, just to be shattered utterly-, and quite literally. Not to mention how Edward Furlong invents the ""Emo"" subculture without having any knowledge about that.T2 delivers decently from a storytelling point of view as well, as the primal portrayal of the bond between the exceptionally strong mother figure and her son eventually invites the narrative to a satisfactory emotional culmination the whole franchise could settle idle upon, withspoiler warning -Arnold giving you the thumbs.spoiler ends -The Terminator tale goes on of course, to entertain its fans further on, but the franchise is yet to see an actor and related character who surpasses-, or even approximates the gravitational pull of the so far unrivaled canvas presence Arnold Schwarzenegger stigmatized the Terminator mythology with.http://opiniononion.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A movie that has held up,To say that Terminator 2 has held up well over these last 18 years is a vast understatement the movie still looks amazing and you are still throwing your fists in the air every time Arnoldo blows a hole in the T-1000 the scenes where the T-1000 turns into liquid metal looks so good even by today's standards I was watching the film yesterday and i by now submission ended up watching a good thirty to forty five minutes of the film. James Cameron has given us at least two of th greatest action movies this gem and Aliens. Also look at the fact that both of these are sequels to very well liked almost horror movies. Cameron knows where to put the camera and knows how to make the action work. Now without even touching the surface look at the acting Arnold who also did the first Terminator in 84 and has aged amazingly well hell even looks better and they have flipped the script to turn what Sara conner fears most into what she needs to stay alive.

Sequel Exception,"This is one of the rare occasion where the sequel far surpassed the original. I would argue that a large part of that has to do with the drastic change in our media culture. For example, these days, if a commercial film is very successful, a studio will almost immediately green light and rush a sequel to the screen. In doing so, it is willing to sacrifice all quality just to take advantage of a hot item and to make money.The difference here was that because of a legal rights issue, the sequel did not come out until seven years after the original (1984, 1991). Also, James Cameron was behind it and it was his creation to begin with. He wasn't just a gun for hire. James Cameron would never attach his name to something that wasn't of the highest caliber and sense this movie has such extensive visual effects work (Cameron's strong point), the film far surpassed anyone's expectations. It's no wonder that the franchise has fallen apart ever sense he has departed and moved on to other works.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The perfect blend of action and sci-fi.,"Terminator 2 is, in a word, excellent.

Almost everything about the movie has already been said, or so you would think, so I will instead make a recommendation for all action and sci-fi fans to check out the Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition DVD.

terminator 2 judgment day,"Well, what can I say... James Cameron has done it again, with a brilliant photographic display, as usual. The plot however, is very derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Butter Bean"", from 1965, which also incorporates the machine-vs-human element. All that aside, this film is a lot of fun to watch. The scene where John Voight throws the noodles across as a weapon in the Asian restaurant and wipes out 5 Asian impostors is a classic, and should not be missed. Arnold's pick-up lines when he goes into Hooters, such as ""Where is the manager?"" and ""You can hold my gun anytime bitch"" are both misogynistic and hilarious at the same time. Other than that, the plot lacks direction, the special effects are superb, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The final quote - ""We are who we say we aren't, and everything else is a monstrous pig"" doesn't make any sense at all, especially when Sarah Connor is quoting that against the backdrop of a naked Timothy Dalton fading in the background in flames.

Terminator 3 didn't have the originality which Terminator 2 has. Terminator 1 didn't have proper animation for robotic action. Terminator 4 has number of inconsistence as well as poor storyline. Hope to see these type of movie in the future. The ATM hacking scene was funny. I still remember one of Arnold'd dialog ""Astala Vista Baby"". I miss Arnold's movie a lot. I know he has more responsibility than ever but It would be wonderful if he comes with another sequel of Terminator.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

This is how you make an action movie,"Certainly! ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a groundbreaking sci-fi/action film directed by James Cameron. Released in 1991, it is a sequel to the 1984 film ""The Terminator."" The movie revolves around the character Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton, and her son John Connor, portrayed by Edward Furlong, who are targeted by advanced cyborgs from the future. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the iconic T-800 Terminator, this time in a more heroic role, aiding the Connors against a more advanced and lethal model, the T-1000, played by Robert Patrick.The film's visual effects were revolutionary for its time, particularly the morphing abilities of the T-1000, setting new standards for CGI in movies. Moreover, the storyline skillfully blends action, suspense, and emotional depth, exploring themes of humanity, sacrifice, and the consequences of technology. Linda Hamilton delivers a powerful performance, transforming Sarah Connor into a resilient and determined character, prepared to protect her son at any cost.James Cameron's direction, combined with a compelling narrative and spectacular action sequences, cemented ""Terminator 2"" as a landmark film in the science fiction genre. It's not merely an adrenaline-pumping action film, but a story with heart and moral implications, making it a classic that continues to captivate audiences even decades after its release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terminator 2 is as the ultimate movie!!!,"I remember watching Terminator 2: Judgement Day at an early age and it has been my favourite then and it is now I then saw The Terminator and then Rise of the machines and finally Salvation and this is definitely the best out of the quadrilodgy (The Terminator is excellent as well, an ""edgy 80s sci-fi thriller"" and its only downside is how amazing T2 is), this is Schwarzenegger's best performance and he was born to play the terminator, the movie is filled with action, sci-fi, and even some drama, and great performances all around by Edward furlong, Robert Patrick and Linda Hamilton. The movie never has a dull moment and will keep you're attention throughout with dazzling special effects, the cg is really something special (James Cameron used the technology when it was new) even for todays standards, and the storyline is awesome,the only downside the movie had to end, if you haven't seen T2, then stop reading this and get a copy and watch :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""Back"" and better than ever!  One of the best sequels in cinematic history.","TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991) **** Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Joe Morton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, Michael Biehn (cameo). Rousing superior sequel to ""The Terminator"", this time with Sarah Connor (a bufffed babe Hamilton) as a mercenary institutionalized from her adolescent son Furlong (in an impressive debut) facing two terminators: one evil (Patrick in a chilling perf) and one good (Ah-nold) to protect the young Connor. Eye-popping visuals and introducing long format morph process computer effects that won a much deserved Oscar(the prototype was first seen in Cameron's ""The Abyss"").Oscars also went to Stan Winston's make-up, sound and sound effects editing. One of the most popular and profitable films ever made. Non-stop action to the nth degree, a blunt anti-nuclear treatise by director James Cameron, and some nice humor courtesy of Arnold as the kinder, gentler robot: ""Hasta la vista, Baby!""",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
T2 Special edition,"Any Terminator fans who agree with me that it was a shame that some of the deleted scenes (which were shown in the special edition) were some of the best scenes as well? I mean, Sarah's dream, in which Kyle visits her... Linda Hamilton is simply gorgeous, but more important, the whole scene is just fabulous. The scene in which the T1000 is on the phone with Jonh (who thinks he's talking to his foster parents) and then finds out the dog's name is Max instead of Wolfie). Then there's the scene where she wants to destroy the terminator's chip. And the scene at the end where we see an adult John with his daughter and mother at the playground. Linda looks great as a grandmother, and IF James Cameron would have kept it at the end, probably no one would have made that horrible T3 movie...

Yawn...,"Like action? Special effects? Explosions? Loud noises? Then see this film.But if you're looking for plot, exposition, and character development, go see the original. This film is far too wrapped up in special effects to bother with little details like those.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
James Cameron is Unbeatable,"The concept and visual work in and of itself makes this a masterpiece and a piece of history forever immortalized in record. All credit MUST be due to James Cameron because he is a groundbreaking and genius filmmaker. AND this was the highest budgeted movie to date...as we continue to look back at JC's record, he tends to demand these outlandish requirements and backing and yet always pulls it off. Since I have recently seen Avatar (also created by the master), I was fortunate enough to read an article that stated, in short, that Cameron spent the better part of 2 months in a hotel across from the Twentieth Century Fox lot in preparation for the Avatar opening and that Fox basically just handed him the keys as he was there day and night in genius mode. This brings to mind Leonardo DiCaprio's depiction of Howard Hughes when he was making Hell's Angels.Arnold was perfectly cast as a machine as no one was interested in his acting ability (none really required here) but he was the perfect action star at the time. In addition, we have some of the most groundbreaking explosions, visual effects, effects make-up, and adrenaline pumping action sequences recorded on film to date. PLUS, for all those who don't appreciate any of the technical aspects and major sacrifices that go into the making of a film, it was just plain hardcore fun and entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Feel the action experience.,"Ever since the 1984's The Terminator came out, it was a low budget film, but met with positive/mixed reviews. But after Cameron's other film, The Abyss, he made this fantastic sequel that surpasses the first one by many reviewers.It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong, etc.In the last movie, a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), but he failed. Now a much more powerful one sent from the future to kill Sarah's son - John Connor (Edward Furlong), the leader of the future rebels. A terminator was send from the future once more, but this time to protect Connor. The only problem is that the terminator who was send to kill Connor is much more powerful and clever than the one who was send to protect him. Moreover, none can help Connor, since they do not believe in robots. Now Connor and his protector has no choice but to survive on their own.Before there was Avatar, Titanic, and True Lies, there was this one, an action packed film with everything it had.So far this movie has been made into special editions to make the film a little bit longer, the original time for the movie was 139 min., but in the Extreme, and Ultimate Collectors editions made it only 152 min.Overall, the movie was amazing.Terminator II: Judgment Day gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest Sci-Fi Film ever made,"Dear James Cameron,You remember Terminator 2 right? Of course you do, it's arguably your best film, remember the script you wrote you know that super tight script, you remember the memorable and of course likable characters that gave fast, smart, and witty dialogue? You made and how great you made the character development yeah you do, a two hour and 15 min film and you just made it fly by. James Cameron you arguably made the greatest Sci-Fi Action film of all time. So when you're making Avatar 2 please work on the script, character development, of course characters and dialogue please, also make it less of a drag to watch than the first one.Sincerely,Alex LTerminator 2 like I said is arguably the best Sci-Fi Action film of all time and is in my top Ten Films of all time. The Plot: The T-1000 is sent back to kill John and The Terminator a.k.a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent back to protect John reprogrammed by John himself. Then the whole movie is about John, Sarah, and The Terminator needing to destroy the T-1000 and to stop judgment day from happening. The Characters: Edward Furlong plays John Connor. For Furlong there are two films he is know for, this and American History X, I like him better in Terminator 2. Essentially he plays mean, messed up kids in both of them, but what seals the deal for me is his father son relationship with The Terminator. With saying that I should mention that the way the characters change was excellent, from the first film and also during this film. The Terminator changing from a killing machine into a father like figure, and Sarah from being scared to death from the future to learning that we as a human race can learn to make the future better. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays The Terminator a.k.a T-800. He actually does a better job than he did in the first Terminator, mostly due to the fact that he has more lines and the way he becomes a father figure to John. He makes himself an incredibly likable father figure machine; let's just say he becomes incredibly likable that at the end of the movie it was making me tear up a little. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Conner the most badass female character of all time (some of you might say Ripley or ""The Bride"" but I stand my ground). I really don't know any other film Linda has been in besides the first two Terminators. In the first terminator she played this wimp of a girl and almost gets killed by the first terminator, in this one she this badass taking people out with a broomstick, stabbing people in the legs with pens or just explaining to someone how many bones there are in the human body, but is still worried about John's safety and preventing judgment day from happening, but by the end of the movie like I said she realizes that the human race is able to learn how to make the future better. (Remember it's just a movie) Robert Patrick plays the T-1000, he did an excellent job showing no emotion or sympathy for anyone else just kept a straight serious face, a killing machine, he fits the role perfectly.Everything Else: Terminator 2 like I said and I will say it again is arguably the best Sci-Fi action film of all time, for me it is. I'm just gonna say that everything in the film is top notch. The sound, action, special effects, everything is perfect, a fantastic looking film. What I love about the action is that it looks real especially with the car/motorcycle chases, Cameron did an excellent job with them and he sure knows how to direct an action scene(s). He also somehow made this two hour and 15 minute film just fly by, it never felt like a drag to watch, it was fun to watch and it is still fun to watch over and over again, I believe this is the film I've watched the most. The special effects were fantastic for the time and today they still look pretty damn good, very revolutionary for the time. But it isn't the best looking film of all time to me that goes to 2001 A Space Odyssey. What I learned by watching the film: There are 206 bones in the human body The Conclusion: What really made me love this film (besides being the best action film I've seen) is the characters, they are likable they are fun they make the movie worth watching until the end (besides the action). I honor James Cameron as a master of sequel making with this and Aliens. Hopefully he will continue this tradition with Avatar 2 I believe he can, but I don't think I believe too much because of the first Avatar. Avatar 2 comes out in 2014 so hopefully he will hit gold with that one. I'm not saying I hate the first Avatar, I just think it's his worst work. Terminator 2 Judgment Day with the action and especially characters and fast pace, this is what am I saying arguably, James Cameron made THE GREATEST Sci-Fi Action Film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My favourite and for some very good reasons...,"I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect)________________________________________________________________Visual Pleasure:[100%] Visually, this film is a monumental landmark. A dream film for every action-movie supporter. The futuristic scenes were classic for a film shot before 1991. And the present day scenes are no less epic. Especially the Truck-Chase scene (this in my mind is the single-most awesome action sequence in the history of film-making). We are treated to some of best action sequences EVER in the entire movie. T-1000 & T-101 face-offs will be cherished by me for the rest of my life.Director's Work:[100%] James Cameron needs no introduction. And this is probably his best work (he has done few of the best films so its no small statement). He weaves each and every scene so well that its truly magical and a viewer's delight.Acting:[100%] Wow! That about describes it. The best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie by miles. Edward Furlong's best movie (he was exceptional...no-one else would've been more appropriate). Robert Patrick's best movie. And above all Linda Hamilton's iconic role as Sarah Connor (Curse Oscar jury for not giving a well deserved Oscar to the greatest action female character of all-time:Sarah Connor).Entertainment Value:[100%] Perfect! Couldn't ASK for more. A high octane and thrilling ride throughout the movie. This is what I call COMPLETE SATISFACTION or in Hindi:""Paisa Vasool"".Script:[100%] Flawless. Some of the best one-liners EVER. A superb message:""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". The relationship between a Terminator(Arnold) and human(John) was awe-inspiring. There are endless things I can list down here but its better if you experience it.__________________________________________________________________My Advice: A MUST-SEE for EVERY action-movie fan. This film will definitely pass the test of time. In General, if anyone is a normal movie-buff, you should see this...What am I saying?? I'm sure everyone must have seen this if not something's wrong with you. Its a classic. My all-time favourite movie (and i've seen many-many films including most of the olden classics). I adore this movie!_____10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels on movie history,"Sequel to Terminator. Skynet, the 21st century computer waging a losing war on humans sends a second terminator back in time to destroy the leader of the human resistance while he is still a boy. His mother is the only one who knows of the existence of the Terminators, human-like robots that exist only to kill and are nearly indestructible, and Sarah, the boy's mother is currently in a state mental hospital because of her 'delusions'. A second protector is sent back to the past by the Human resistance to protect John Connor, their future leader, at all costs. This movie is state-of-art in special effects and Arnold is fantastic, He made a character unforgettable! Everybody will remember ""I'll be back"" and ""Hasta la vista, James Cameron also great and here he directs one of his best film.

Special Edition Review,"Two heads over the first film. Arnold shines three times as bright as in the first movie, now the other side, but still such a believable terminator. Sarah now relatable, everything that happens is interesting and has good build up. This movie aged so well, so well. Combination of good effects and even better shooting than in the first movie(even in the first movie it was one of the best sides). Much more cool frames, more details, better acting, cold real world. I would recommend this movie to nearly each and everyone and i highly reccomend watching special edition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Pure brilliance,"This was the best movie of the decade. In fact, I have not seen any movies that have surpassed it. This was arnold's best movie although he has had other movies that good. The same goes for Cameron. Titanic and avatar might have been decent movies that made tons more money but I would still choose T2 over them. Some of the fx are a bit dated but the t1000 effects still match up to modern movies. This movie was vastly superior to T3 and T4. The last two terminator movies were all style and very little substance whereas T2 had the right blend of action and wit. T2 had a heart and brain in there somewhere. T2 does have a few minor flaws. I thought that edward furlong was a bit wooden in places (only slightly) but then again this was his first time to act. The story also slumped a slight bit in the middle. Definitely a movie to be recommended",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Effects-laden Frankensteinian spectacle,"An American sci-fi thriller; A story about a woman, her 10-year-old son, and a helper from the future who try to stop future events from happening that lead to a day in the future when machines start to kill all humans. This second film in the film series has an intriguing hero, a convincingly fierce heroine, and a young boy played with energy for an anodyne character outline. Robert Patrick gives a menacing portrayal. It repeats the premise of the original film, and tension doesn't run quite as high as in the first film, where Arnold Schwarzenegger excelled at convincing us of a diabolical killing machine seemingly incapable of being destroyed. But he is played with some redeeming features that remind us of Frankenstein, but with an indeterminable heart of gold. The thought-provoking narrative occasionally produces comical material for light relief, necessary for its long running time in the action genre, and it leads to a satisfyingly tearful denouement. However, the story itself has a science paradox: a higher intelligence in the future would be the end product of any time-travelling mission in the same timeline, so it is implausible that it would not deduce that the mission would be futile logic. Burgeoning CGI technology is used to dazzling effect, and there are marvellous stunts, chases, fight sequences, and other visual effects and props. As an aside, the film is memorable for the way it envisions nanorobotics. Technology has emerged in recent years to demonstrate the mimetic properties of metallic objects, albeit in a rudimentary way, so it makes Director James Cameron's vision all the more remarkable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Excellent film but not quite as good as the original,T2 is a great film but in my view not as good as the original sure the effects are better but it loses the dark and brutal look of The Terminator.The plot is simple John Connor has been born and is now 10 (I think) Arnie is a good guy (reprogrammed) Sarah Connor has gone mental (who wouldn't?) T-1000 is the new guy (and he is kind of hard to kill) Miles Dyson is the guy who invented Skynet (Although T3 will prove that to be wrong!)While running from the T-1000 they decide to stop the war from ever happening.  Although now this was pointless considering that T3 will be coming out in 2002 its still good to see Arnie in all his bad ass gear giving them hell and saying 'I'll be back' to John and Sarah.  but hey its still a great film and the effects still look brilliant ten years later.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A simply great movie,"Terminator 2 is, for my money, one of the greatest films Hollywoodhas churned out.  Everything in it is top-drawer: the script, acting,directing, special effects, etc.  And you can't mention superlativeswithout discussing Brad Fiedel's music!In this flick you get chases, incredible special effects, cool kid stuff,twists, paradoxes, and even biting commentary on the sexes.   Ontop of everything else, the movie also has a lot heart, with sometouching observations about humans and non-humans.  And, ofcourse, it also deals with where we're going as a race and thepossible catastrophes we're headed toward.  But far from being adesultory comment on the end of everything, it also has a ton ofhumor--some obvert, and some extremely subtle.  And the endingmay just bring tears to your eyes.Robert Patrick, as the T-1000, is one of the great modern movievillains.  He never lets up, even when knocked down time aftertime, or having his head blasted in two.  He runs like a human, butdoes not take setbacks like one--he gets up and keeps comingafter you.And that's one of the things that's endearing about the twoTerminators--they are super-strong, but not supernatural.  Bulletsdon't stop them, but they do slow them down.  Thus we're able toidentify with them to a degree.As far as chilling scenes go, who can forget when Arnold iswalking toward John with the box of roses, only to toss the boxaway as he pulls out a shotgun?  And the T-1000's manyresurrections, especially the one of him slowly trolling along on thepolice motorcycle, surveying the ruins of Dyson's living room?Some people are undoubtedly put off by the series' titles, thinkingthat these are crazed, violent movies with nothing to recommendthem.

blockbuster mayhem for FX junkies,"In director James Cameron's blockbusting sequel to his popular 1984 hit the indestructible killer from the 21st century returns to 1990 Los Angeles, this time to protect a future revolutionary leader against an even more deadly assassin, able to change shape at will. Arnold Schwarzenegger has the advantage of superior firepower, but the script wants to present him as a surrogate, cybernetic father figure, softening a role already ideally suited to his limited talents (poor Arnold can't even portray a convincing robot without effort).The liquid metal computer effects are impressive, and the spectacular action sequences are staged with cold, mechanical precision, turning what could have been a thrill-a-minute adventure into the big-screen equivalent of an arcade video game. In the end the film amounts to little more than a marathon of furious destruction, undermined by some pretentious moralizing and by an absurd streak of pacifism: Arnold's terminator is ordered not to kill anyone, so instead he simply (yuk, yuk) maims half the armed forces of the Free World.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Sets the standard for action movies, and it still hasn't been beaten!","This is, simply, the best action movie I've ever seen. I just cannot get enough of it! Everything about the movie is flawless, the direction, the visual effects(which are still stunning, mind you), the action, the pacing. Just utterly flawless.James Cameron proved with this movie, not ""Titanic"", that he truly was the King of the World. He has created an action masterpiece. T2 set the bar for action movies for years to come, and that bar, in my humble opinion, has not been raised yet.In T2, Ah-nuld returns as Cyberdyne Systems Model T-101, only this time his mission is to protect. He is not supposed to protect Sarah Connor, but her teenage son, John Connor, who was conceived during Sarah's night of passion with Kyle Reese in the original. Of course, you can't have a good Terminator movie without a decent bad guy, and this bad guy is more than decent. He's the Cyberdyne Systems Model T-1000. He's a polymimetic alloy, liquid metal to the lay person, more than a match for Ah-nuld.Robert Patrick creates one of the absolute most menacing movie villains ever put to film. What makes him scarier than Arnold in the original is that he looks like an ordinary guy. He's clearly not a bodybuilder, yet his icy stare is utterly chilling. Arnold returns in fine form, though, proving that he can play a convincing good guy. He also throws in bits of comic relief, too, though it's mainly on the Director's Cut, aka the Extreme Edition DVD. Pick that one up; it's got a hilarious scene where John teaches the T-101 to smile.Linda Hamilton is perfect as Sarah Connor. She's buffed up since the last one, making for one heck of a butt-kicker. She also convincingly portrays an affectionate mom who, though she may sound insane, only wants to do what's best for her son.The biggest standout, though, is Edward Furlong, who plays John Connor. He's the perfect guy to portray the spunk and resourcefulness's that John has. It's all the more spectacular in knowing that this is Furlong's film debut. Sadly, he wasn't able to return for T-3 because of his continuing drug problem.I cannot do this movie justice! I've seen it many, many times, and I keep coming back for more. Everyone on the message boards agrees with me that it's one of the top 10 action movies of all time. Oh, I would want to caution parents before letting your kids see it. It's very violent, though not as graphic as it could have been. It's got some language, too, although compared to most of today's R-rated movies, it's fairly tame. See this movie now! You will not be sorry! Hasta la vista, baby.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Simply the best,"What can I say that hasn't already been said (and hasn't someone already said this exact line?) about this film?

You name it, T2 has got it. Great acting (even from the big man himself); kick-ass action scenes; wicked effects; and the list goes on. If you just look past the whole time paradox problem (yeah, I know, it's a big problem) and a couple of the effects shots (the dummy of Arnold is very noticeable when he's walking towards the SWAT team and getting shot up in the Cyberdyne lobby), but those are negligible, you will really enjoy this film.Bottom Line: Get it.

Definitely better than the original!,"I don't know anybody who said that the first movie was better. But who could, I mean come on this is the greatest Sci-fi movie of all time bar none. This is Arnolds greatest other than predator and true lies. This movie is the ultimate action Sci-fi thriller, although they could have gotten a better kid to play john. Arnold Makes the best killer cyborg of anybody. He should have won an Oscar for his performance. James Cameron is the ultimate action/adventure director. As Arnold says ""I'll be Back"". this movie should get like *****/**** stars, its just an American classic. Linda Hamilton did great reprising her role. So did that bad guy, the T-1000 guy. I meen come on who wouldn't want to be able to make metal out of your skin you know.

Great but too frightening and real,"This is a masterpiece, great sci-fi story, realistic and very well-done. The effects are great, the acting is perfect and even the sound effects are so good, and don't forget the famous soundtrack.
It's hard to believe that there is no book and the script is fully cinematograhical. The script writer and photography director are genius.
This is one of the best action movies and a good example of 90s movie - people are so real.
And also it's a good test for you whether you are a human - do you empathize for this Robot when he is suffering?",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A worthy sequel,"Really, they could have called this film 'Terminator vs Terminator"", but it's actually much better than that genre of cashing-in cinema..I like T2, it has so many exciting moments in it, it's difficult not to like it.Where the first film was a Sci-Fi horror, this is an all-out action movie, and probably one of the best. CGI was new when this came out, and is therefore not overblown like todays films, including the following Terminator sequels.While this is still a good story, it has gone slightly too far in the far-fetched arena. With these sort of movies you have to reel it in a bit to make it believable, which the first film did, but this is entry is borderline silly. I will also say it did drag a bit for me. The chases are the most exhilarating parts, in opinion, and they really are that, but I wish there had been more of that like in The Terminator.If you want lots of guns and explosions and seeing what happens when you mess with the Terminator, this is the one to watch. While the action is brilliant, it's let down by some pretty cheesy moments; John Connor is trying to be that little bit too cool, Sarah Connor is irritating in her new marine corps/tough b**ch persona, and the T800 talks too much which unfortunately removes some of the imperative cyborg elements.All told, an entertaining action movie with some great music, but just don't expect it to blow your mind like the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best sequel ever!,"This is the BEST sequel ever made to a movie! Terminator was a great movie but T2 made the whole thing one of the best movie franchises ever.

The CGIs looks great (not for just its time i find it appealing even now the t1000 looks great) but the great thing is that CGI is not overused like in films nowadays.

"An exclusive exception,","T2 is member of a very exclusive club. The club of the movies, which are prequels but better than its original. Some people would say now it isn't very hard to outclass some stuff like: ""Sarah Connor?"" ""Yes!?"" *shoots her*Well, to speak the truth, if you don't like the idea of a good action movie with an excellent story, you shouldn't watch this movie. In my opinion this movie is overvalued. But why? I think it's because most of us who have seen the movie, did that when we were younger. I can speak just for myself but, I don't think that I would liked it that much, when I wouldn't have been 14 or 15 years old.I think you shouldn't watch T2 just to have it seen. Some people often argues that there are films which should be watched by all means, but I'm not that type of guy.What also makes T2 worth-watching? First of all you should have watched the first part, because you'll get a better picture of the whole story. Compared with the first part the story is extended with some new and interesting characters and of course the special effects are excellent. Of course special effects are taken for granted nowadays, but these were extremely good for 1991.So I dedicate it to you, if you'll watch this movie. My personal opinion is that this movie is a far cry from being an inferior sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best visual effects ever,"The best visual effects ever, but the rest, really, really, really S#@t. I can understand why people like this movie because there's plenty of action visual effects and killing, but that doesn't make a movie good.This movie has no directional talent, no acting ability, shocking script and too many butch women. The same goes for The Matrix, stunning visual effects but one hell of a bad movie. But unfortunately, that's the way it is. People don't want to see Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and Citizen Kane anymore, they want Terminator 2: Judgement Day.My score -- 2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best installment of the entire saga,"One of the best sequels in history and without a doubt the best of the entire saga, Terminator 2 took the plot of the first film to a higher level. We cannot forget that this was Edward Furlong's first film as an actor and just at that moment he achieved fame, being remembered as John Connor. Linda embodies a rather strong Sarah Connor perfectly, taking the character's story arc to another level. Arnold, of course, gets all the attention being already in the moment and a huge action star. Robert Patrick, as the T-1000 has been the best work of his entire career and he will always be remembered for it. Brad Fiedel's soundtrack brings a lot of life to the film. James Cameron's direction is flawless compared to the previous installment. Stan Winston's special effects are not far behind and digital animation has given the T-1000 a lot of life, making it one of the best villains in cinema. This film could have given a good closure to the saga, although due to the greed of the producers it was not possible, but even so it is an excellent film in both the action and science fiction genres. My final grade for this movie is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The most timeless piece of cinema you'll ever see,"Written and directed of course by James Cameron, the 1991 sequel to The Terminator takes place eleven years on from its predecessor. In the aftermath of the 'Judgement Day' nuclear war, the self-aware computer giant Skynet initiates a paradoxical effort to once again attempt to eliminate the leader of the human resistance, John Connor.Well where do you begin? I personally find it impossible to look at Cameron's sequel as a 'film' to critique because it's simply so much greater than the confines of the silver screen. I'm currently sat with a tepid coffee, trying my best to conjure the brilliance of this epic and even with the worlds most extensive thesaurus I'd fail to do it justice.Casting aside the sheer admiration I have for Cameron's ability to intertwine science fiction, action and romance so poetically, it's the overwhelming character the film has to offer that I feel sets it so far above the rest. Whether it's Cameron's off-hue blue-lit depiction of LA, Brad Fiedel's tragically heart-warming score, Robert Patrick's icy demeanour, Arnie's stoical charm or the final brutally touching words of Linda Hamilton, Terminator 2 simply oozes with a unique and unmatchable style, character and timelessness.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Hasta la vista, baby.","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the special achievement that you all been waiting for, the sequel to the first film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Well, here it is, the sequel to The Terminator directed by James Cameron. It won 4 Oscars at the Academy Awards. One for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup. It was the highest grossing film of 1991 making up to $519 million over $102 million budget. How unbelievable is that? With Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor narrating having his son John Connor become the Human Resistance leader against Skynet - the artificial intelligence that will be given control of the United States' nuclear missiles and initiate a nuclear holocaust called ''Judgment Day'' on August 1997. But this film came out in 1991 so there's no way that'll happen in real life. Sarah was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory. So why didn't it show about what happened back there? Why didn't it show about what happened after she got pregnent to John Connor and she got arrested? Oh well. Anyways, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as The Terminator, this time a good guy. He went to the bar, wore somebody's clothes, took some sun glasses and ride off into the motorcycle. But then, a new terminator called T-1000 played by Robert Patrick is sent back in time to assassinate John Connor but was confronted by The Terminator who is sent back in time to protect John Connor. You can see why The Terminator is the second terminator and he become good because the first from the first Terminator movie is evil 'cause Sarah killed it. As the Terminator shoots T-1000, you can see that he is liquid metal. He can go through objects, walk through fire and become different people. The visual effects on T-1000 is absolutely incredible. Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman is a psychiatrist of Sarah Connor. He only had a small from the first film. He sounds like Rex from Toy Story. He sounds so similar than Wallace Shawn. I don't know. I just thought about it years ago. Michael Biehn has a cameo role in this and his acting is brilliant in this where he warns Sarah that John Connor's the target now. The scene where The Terminator and John called the Foster parents and The Terminator can imitate voices and realizing they're already dead. So The Terminator and John breaks Sarah free from the hospital and T-1000. They rescued Sarah and The Terminator says ""Come with me if you want to live."" Damn, I forgot about that quote from the first Terminator film like what Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese said and The Terminator imitating the voices. I like the scene where Sarah stops Miles Dyson, creator of Skynet played by Joe Morton from letting Judgment Day happen. The Terminator and John arrive at his house and warns him to destroy the items and the designs in Cyberdyne. There's an amazing scene where The Terminator cut his arm and pulls his off making him realize that he's a cyborg. So they went into the Cyberdyne building to destroy all the stuff and retrieve the CPU and the arm. Miles Dyson get shot and sacrifices himself by exploding the entire building. Now there's no way for him to kill himself because he got shot, I really like him. I really like that scene actually is because he gasping repeatedly and says ''I don't know how much longer I can hold this.'' I use to say that when I was feeling sick years ago. The chase scene and the final battle between The Terminator, Sarah, John and T-1000 is phenomenal. I even love the part where Arnold says ""Hasta la vista, baby."" The final scene where the Terminator says goodbye to John Connor is actually kinda sad but aside from that he says ""I know now why you cry, but it is something I could never do."" and went into the lava and gives John a thumbs up. Many people love this movie just like I do so does my friends Jacob Dimmock, Thomas Raddings and Shannon Walker. Everybody's a huge fan of The Terminator films. I definitely think the first and the second are as good as each other. Much like from the 1980s, it's not classed as a horror film. It's more than the 80s sci-fi action film much like what James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd did. This movie is kind of long. I think it's 147 mins long. Not that long though but it's considered be the longest film of the franchise. As far as sequels go, this movie is considered one of the best, most greatest films of all times much like my favorite film The Terminator the first one. But the first Terminator doesn't include at the Oscars it's still one of the greatest films of all time much like the sequel. From the beauty and the majesty of The Silence of the Lambs and Disney's Beauty and the Beast, this movie is most thrilling, most watchable, most greatest and most high rated movie at all time. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger: I'm back!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Best Sequel Ever Made! 9,5/10","After the release of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", we all knew James Cameron was the best director for sequels. He had already proved that a sequel could surpass the original with ""Aliens"", but with this one, he took it to a whole new level. The story of the 1984 hit thriller ""The Terminator"" is about a cyborg machine sent back through time to kill the future-mother of a military leader who will supposedly, take mankind to victory against the machines in an upcoming war. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" takes us about 13 years later. Sarah Connor is now in a mental institution after trying to blow up Cyberdyne. Her now-born-son, John Connor lives with his foster parents. But when a terminator called T-1000 comes to kill John, his only hope lies with the same terminator that once tried to kill his mother. Together, they will help Sarah to escape from the mental institution, destroy Cyberdyne to avoid judgment day and fight a metal-liquid made terminator, that seems invincible. What is so great with this movie is two things: the special effects and the script. James Cameron truly wrote a script superior to the original ad added more depth to the story. The special effects by Stan Winston are truly remarkable. They introduced CGI Animation to the world, long before""Jurassic Park"" or ""The Matrix"", to create some of the most impressive stunts and effects ever made with a movie. If James Cameron hadn't done""Titanic"" a few years after that, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" would've been his masterpiece. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his best performance in career as the good terminator to battle the invincible T-1000, played remarkably by Robert Patrick. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" came out on July 3rd, 1991, and took in more than $500 million worldwide, including $204 million in the U.S. alone. It wasn't only a movie, it was a phenomenon. I give ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" a very good 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.,"I think it's fair to say that terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the most beloved action films of all time. I can honestly say I have never met one person who doesn't like this movie in some form or fashion.James Cameron created one of the most iconic characters in cinema history with Arnold as the T-800. He also created one of the most interesting environments for all of his characters to develop in.The story is bold, in your face, and hard to ignore.

"Better than the prequel, though not as good","OK, it doesn't really need to be said, but the first film was better even though it was eclipsed in almost every way by this one.The stunts were bigger, the dramatics improved upon, the music used to more effect, but it still had the feel of a sequel which can't be good. An original will almost always be better than its sequel.The special effects and action scenes were greatly improved in content and in execution. The chase scene with the lorry is quite remarkable and is a good way of introducing the main players in the film. Some great scenes in the mental asylum and a good (though repeated) end location really manages to give a good feel to the film. However, special effects aside, we do get the feeling that it is just a makeover of the first film with a bigger budget, though that isn't a particularly bad thing.Though the original terminator never betrayed his mechanical instincts and thorough programming and ruthlessly killed anyone claiming to be Sarah Conner, the return of the terminator sees models that have inconsistent (and less ruthless) characters. T101 compromises tries to learn humanistic character traits, loosely veiled under the guise of fitting in (and encouraged by his young master) which could be excused, but the failure of T1000 to successfully complete his mission could not. Though he killed John's foster parents and dog with extreme prejudice near the beginning of the film, he failed to pull off a similar stunt with Sarah near the end. He seemed to be exhibiting some very bad human traits in wanting to see her suffer. Flaws like this simply weren't present in the original film. The original model showed himself to be so inhuman at the end that he was stripped of all flesh, while the return sees a terminator that is willing to make a joke at the end. Add this to the fact that T1000 had no reason to look like Robert Patrick at the end when his cover had been blown, meaning that he could take on a different and more effective shape (like a long serrated blade with barbed ends), and several more plot flaws are revealed.Despite this, Patrick does play a far more effective and menacing terminator in practice, and without having to dress up like a thug or have big bulging muscles. As far as playing an artificial human is concerned, he fulfils the role far more convincingly than Arnie. His face changes from being expressionless to conveying some kind of empathy, and back, in a mere moment. He isn't built up, which is probably because the people that he emulates weren't big, but it seems more realistic than Arnie's Herculean body structure. Let's face it; in a post apocalyptic earth Mr. Universes are not going to blend in too well. Something else that was (naturally) missing was the feeling of innocence that was being violated. Here we see a beefed up Sarah and a well keyed up John teaming up with the Terminator as if he was an old friend.Aside from this, the suspense, effects and amusing scenes make this well worth watching even if it isn't as dark and moody as the original. A very enjoyable film that improves upon many elements of the original but suffers from the sequel-plot syndrome.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A film greater than the sum of its parts,"I will always enjoy watching this film for all sorts of reasons. I really cannot find fault with the result, granted a lot of money was spent making it but for a pleasant change the money was well spent. It does help to see the first film first but in my opinion it stands on its own as a great film therefore it is not crucial. The quality starts at the beginning and continues throughout its 2 hours 20 minutes. I seem to recall Terminator 2 getting a cool welcome and mixed reviews at the time of its release in England. Fortunately the vast majority of people who have seen this film rate it very highly. This film has everything anyone might want from it, everything for me just feels right. I have read a lot of the reviews of this film and most of them are very eloquent about its contents and wax lyrical about this or that or all of the bits that make it up. I simply look at the whole and it is greater than the sum of its parts which I know isn't logical but it really is extremely enjoyable to watch. Like all great films the viewer needs to pay attention to the detail, it is well worth the effort, because it is clear that a great deal of time and effort went into the making of this film and all of the team that were responsible for the outcome should be satisfied on a job well done. I highly recommend anyone watch this film and you will probably find yourself watching it over and over again.

So many scenes, lines, and characters are the exact SAME as the first film that you can actually wonder if you're watching the first one or not.  Don't believe me?  It's true.  Every time afterwards I've seen the flick I notice new things from this one that completely plagiarize the original.  At times I wonder if Cameron actually had an ORIGINAL idea for this movie at all, or if he just decided to make a complete copy of part 1 from the beginning.BOTTOM LINE:  There's nothing worse than being a clone of an original hit.

He's back.,"Probably the greatest science fiction / action film ever Terminator 2 is almost the greatest sequel ever. That goes to Camerons other opus Aliens. In fact Cameron is so good at sequels Titanic 2 would probably be something to look forward too rather then fear. Unlike another Amityville Horror film.T2 takes place several years after the original. Sarah Connor has had her child - the young John Connor. Unfortunately she also came off as slightly nuts while raving about robots taking over the world and so she is locked up in a mental hospital. While this is happening another Terminator has been dispatched, this time to kill John himself. The T 1000 is a liquid metal Terminator capable of reforming into different shapes. Thankfully to combat our meltable foe Arnie returns, this time as the good guy to protect John and his mother.Its hard to review Terminator 2. Its just far too good for words. The villain played by Robert Patrick is probably the most villainous of all villains, the action is probably the most action packed of all action sequences. Plus it will also make you cry at the end. An action film. Seriously. OK just me then. Still a kind of bizarre situation where you find yourself close to shedding tears for a toaster with legs. But Terminator 2 manages it. In fact you feel Terminator 2 could do anything and get away with it. A bit like a woman in that respect.I don't know how Cameron created my two favourite films of all time.

And I agree with that fact. Terminator 2 is the second best time travel movie. The only time travel movie that is better then this is Back To The Future. This is also the second best sequel. The only sequel that is better then this is THe Empire Strikes Back. This is better then Terminator 1. Yep you heard me. This is better then the original and thats a fact. It has some humor. It is not as violent as the first one. It is more of a Sci-Fi picture then the first one mainly because of the T-1000. This is my 5th favorite film ever.

More Human Than Human,"In the rare pantheon of sequels that are just as good as -- if not, better than -- the original, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is in limited but good company. Nearly a decade after leaving his stamp with the first film, James Cameron returned to the property that put him on the map (perhaps with tail between legs following the disappointing release of ""The Abyss"" a few years prior). With original players Linda Hamilton and, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action, Cameron co-wrote a script that expanded upon the simple premise of the original film while adding more social commentary and even more action than before.While our heroin from the first film, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) rots away in a maximum security mental institution, her young son and future savior of mankind, John (a fresh-faced Edward Furlong), is roaming the streets of Los Angeles, blasting some GNR whilst robbing ATMs. Meanwhile, the war against the machines rages on in the future, and as such, a newer and deadlier Terminator with shape-shifting abilities -- the T-1000, as played by a stone-cold serious Robert Patrick -- is sent back in time to crush that little squirt John Connor before he leads all of humankind to victory. It's hard not to imagine the resistance chanting ""Yes, we can!"" while the machines retort with ""We built it!"" Anyway, as before, a protector for Connor is sent, only this time it's a re-programmed version of the same would-be Terminator that originally tried to kill his mother. And thus, Arnold is back.""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is notable for a lot of things, but what really makes it stand out is its stunning visuals effects. As one of the first films to utilize CGI in a big way, it simultaneously closed the door on the dominance of practical effects in the '80s while opening the door for the likes of ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Matrix"" and, of course, ""Avatar."" Using the T-1000 as the film's guinea pig, Cameron makes us believe liquid metal can come to life and stalk us. Even as technology has advanced, the CGI in the film is remarkable and somehow manages to look better than the CGI-heavy fodder of today.But special effects aside, the film is truly a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions. While admittedly not as tightly paced as its predecessor, the follow-up is chock full of dizzying action, dazzling set-pieces and big and bold ideas about the future. Amidst all of this lies a disarming sense of fun and humor, vis à vis the interplay between Schwarzenegger and young Furlong. To counter this, Hamilton steps it up as Rambo with sweater-meat. Her turn as the hardened and focused soldier is a natural progression from where we last saw her, and thankfully, Hamilton is up for the task.As far as big-budget blockbusters go, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" sits at the top of the heap. Very few films have come along in its time that are as truly epic and entertaining as this. With Schwarzenegger in his prime and Cameron at the top of his game, this is a no-brainer. One of the few ""must-see"" sequels in history. This one truly gives its predecessor a run for its money. While the franchise laid dormant for a good decade, Hollywood couldn't resist, and two sequels as well as a TV series followed. To be sure, though, ""Terminator 2"" is the end all, be all follow-up and a perfect companion piece to the original.

James Cameron's masterpiece!,"Terminator 2 is not only a mind blowing movie with spectacular special effects and unbeleivable action, but cultural phenomenon akin to capturing lightening in a bottle.Never will such a perfect action/sci fi movie ever be made in the history of filmdom.The casting of Arnold is perfect beyond belief.  He was born only to play the role of The Terminator.  His minimal dialogue enhances the roles mechanical robotic qualities.James Cameron is certainly a dedicated filmaker who cares about his work and the expectations of the audience.  The only other film that comes close to T2 is Aliens, also directed by Cameron.  His use of computer effects to augment and supplment the storyline is rarely ever used in todays overblown blockbusters.  In fact the special effects in T2 are so good that today's effects PALE in comparison.Robert Patrick is perfect as the predatory T-1000, and will be forever be remebered as the guy who gave Arnold a run for his money, as he definately attempts to steal the movie in some scenes.I am appalled that a T3 has been made without James Cameron.  T3 may be a decent action flick, but it looks embarrasingly juvenille from the trailers and TV spots.  Whats with all the sunlight???  Arnold even stated a few years ago he would not do T3 without Cameron.  After Arnolds diasasters such as End of Days (not bad flick) he needed a hit and the only way was to bring the Terminator out of retirement, with or without Cameron.  Thats Loyalty for you.T2 is the best action movie ever made, and if you have not seen it yet, you have probably seen paradies, ripoffs, and copies of the movie.But watching the original will give an appreciation as to how this movie shaped future action movies, as it is groundbreaking.I wished James Cameron had made T3, but I doubt he could have topped the perfection of T2, and that may be one of the reasons he decided to opt out of T3.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

about as good as basic action movies get,"This movie is so deftly composed that the ""battle"" scenes take on a heightened reality.Many action flicks - MI:2 is a good example - seem so absurd that it pops you back into reality rather than absorbing you into the action (in MI:2, for example, we are supposed to believe that the characters deliberately jump off their motorcycles to do a high speed body slam, fall 50 ft., survive without injury and shake it off immediately, then resume their fight.... puh-leaze, take a course in physics, or at least common sense). T2 seems believable, in the sense that the terminators act in much the way their capabilities are outlined, and the way the scenes unfold with a degree of intelligence.That intelligence undoubtably comes from Director Cameron: you get the impression that he didn't just blindly shoot a scene, but stood their scratching his chin to think of interesting, exciting, yet reasonable ways to proceed (eg. the scene with Arnold solving his tanker truck problem near the end of the movie).... ""What WOULD a smart terminator do here?"" Arnold probably contributed significantly, too, as he's no dummy.As action flicks go, this is pretty basic - interesting premise, but it's not as meaningful as the old movie ""The Great Escape"" or as intriguing or with the character development of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". But if you are looking for an entertaining and novel good guy vs. bad guy movie, and if you appreciate AH-nold at his droll best, this is a great bet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not very interesting movie,"Terminator 2
It is not a bad movie, but I see it's pretty average.The action isn't very interesting, neither is the dialogs. The interesting characters are the terminators.I think 2 and a half hour is very long for this movie, they could've cut it to make it shorter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Oh dear.,"I was a big fan of the original. The plot was a good one, the actors convincing, even Arnie (although perhaps having 42 words in the entire film helped.)and the action took place largely at night. Five minutes into T2 when Arnie has killed no-one and nicked one guy's sunglasses, I thought *uh-oh* - one-liner ahoy, and sure enough, later one of many such gut-wrenchingly bad lines emerges, delivered with enough lack of Acting ability to cover his compatriots in splinters. Now sometimes a Movie can be salvaged by it's co-stars, but unfortunately although Linda Hamilton is the only member of the cast that emerges with any credibility, the young John Connor is so incredibly irritating that 30 minutes into the film, I wanted to kill him myself. That leaves the quintessential ""Baddie"" to sustain some sort of suspense and danger. Alas, James was still obviously obsessed with the morphing techniques he discovered while making ""The Abyss"" with the result that we end up with a robot that is supposed to be made up of liquid metal capable of altering it's colour, texture and size, and even reforming itself. All movies of this type call for a certain degree of suspension of disbelief, but this is just ludicrous. Even in ""non-liquid"" mode, the new wimpy looking terminator runs around with his head inclined - apparently this is supposed to be frightening. Throughout the film, we have lots of explosions, laughable dialog and in the end, Arnie the philosophical friendly cyborg. This film could have been a damn sight better, even with Arnie in the lead, but this seems to have been targeted at a preview audience of teenagers in the mid-west with all the ingredients that they tend to expect. It is quite simply yet another standard formulaic attempt to make money, not a decent film, but hey, Isn't that what Hollywood is about?Dan Marcus",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terminator 2 One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made,"Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a big improvement over the original. Writer/Director James Cameron returns along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton from the first one. The story picks up many years after the original that finds Sarah Connor (played with vulnerability and intensity by Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution and her now punk teen son John (played to a tee by Edward Furlong) who's living with foster parents. John's world comes crashing down however with the arrival of a terminator (played once again by Arnold Schwarzenegger who does a great job in the role) whose been sent from the future to protect the young soon to be leader of the resistance from a deadly time traveling cyborg known as the T-1000 (played to perfection by Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype which makes it that much more dangerous. Soon The Terminator is in a race against time to protect Sarah and John from a formidable foe it may not be able to defeat. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles especially Schwarzenegger who does a fantastic job as the Terminator, Linda Hamilton still proves to be a perfect Sarah Connor, and Robert Patrick makes for an effective villain. He may not have much dialogue but Patrick makes the best of his villain role in the movie. Well done. Director James Cameron continues the story from the original and gives us a worthy sequel that is much better than the first one. From the intense action which is pretty much non stop, to the acting, to the characters, the story, the suspense, thrills, and some small does of humor this sequel makes for an enjoyable movie to watch. The special effects are amazing especially considering they didn't have the technology we do today. Despite some flaws when dealing with the time-traveling plot and some over acting at times the good more than outweighs the bad. Overall Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made with plenty of action, chases, explosions, fist fights, amazing special effects, solid performances, a compelling story, and some humor that sure to please any fan of the series or genre. Go see it. Terminator 2 does not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

a mindless action movie!,this is a weak sequel in my opinion. more action than the first one. but mindless action. not that much entertainment here. but i know many people like this movie better than the first. i give it ** out of ****,,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Here's why it outdoes the original:,"You see, the first ""Terminator"" had someone protecting Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and she depended on him. In ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", Sarah goes all bad-ass to protect her son John (Edward Furlong, in an impressive debut). Oh, and of course there's the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) battling the villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick), sent back in time to kill John.Okay, so ""T2"" goes a little overboard on special effects, but it does manage to have a plot. The threat of a nuclear holocaust is always unnerving. Obviously, sending someone back in time to change history violates the paradox of time travel (meaning that if you change the past, then the future will be completely different, so there would be no incentive to change the past to begin with), but this is a pretty good movie, as action flicks go. Among other things, it shows that when Ah-nuld tries, he can act.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Simply the Best Arnie Movie..Fantastic,"Terminator 2 is no doubt the Greatest Schwarznegger movie of his career. Arnie has given us great movies before like Commando, Predator and Total Recall. Arnie will always be Popular for his role as the Terminator. Terminator One was a great Movie and a Great Start the made Arnie a Star. Terminator 2 went 10 steps ahead to make one of the Best Sci Fi Movies of all time. Over 2 hours of non stop entertainment. I remember when i saw T2 when it first came out in 1992. At that time, the graphics in T2 were out of this world. Everybody wondered how did they do that with the T1000. If you see this movie just recently, you wont be so surprised. It was the movie everybody was talking about in school. T1000 was a great Villain, its a shame the creaters on T3 couldn't compete with it. T3 was the worst out of the trilogy.

And, quite frankly this is the best of the three. I'm not really much for science fiction, but this is one of the few that I really do enjoy. Robert Patrick gives a chilling performance as the 'bad' robot sent to destroy John Connor (Edward Furlong), and terminate T-1000 (Swarzenagger), who is ironically there to protect the son of the woman he was sent to kill in the last film.The whole film is almost non-stop intense, and there are times when you're heart will jump out of your chest, because it gets so nerve racking.Edward Furlong, in his debut role, gives an amazing performance as the son of Sarah Connor, and the leader of the future.I would give it a 10, however, there are times when the movie tends to slow down, for long periods of time and can get a bit boring. However, the rest of the time it's nothing but thrills and nerves at your doorstep, for an entertaining ride in the future, past and present.

Arnolds acting has improved from the first. You should get the extreme DVD, it is extended with extra scenes that are quite important (in my opinion). This movie is also the most lightened up of the three (mostly due to john Connor's sense of humor). Like all terminator movies, the bad guy has more advantages.

If you take in mind that the movie was made in 1991, and if you look at the way special effects have been developed since, you have to admit that this movie was certainly ground-breaking in those terms. I still watch it every now and then, and I find it just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it.

the greatest sequel of all time??,"i was first introduced to Terminator 2-Judgement Day at the tender age of 9 and ever since i have been hooked. i saw the first in the series on the same day for the first time too, and found it OK, but there were so many obvious mistakes, mainly due to the limited budget. Terminator 2 is however, so different, so spectacular, and so advanced, even by the standards of today. as i have grown older, i have learned to appreciate the first in the series more and more. the ruthless terminator who in some cases is so close to being a human yet so far away, and a soldier sent back in time to save a mother and her unborn (and unconcieved) son provide two completely opposite ends of the spectrum. the fear and determination to survive on the human part is quite moving, yet the ruthlessness of the terminator is utterly disturbing. now, this finally leaves us at terminator 2- and whats happened? a new terminator has been sent back in time, just as ruthless as the first, but with a mission to save john connor, age 11.( i think-lets not get into that!!)he must, however, obey all of johns orders, and promises not to ill anyone, a key moment in the film, as it not only expersses the terminators loyalty, but it is the same point where the terminator begins to feel human emotion, asking questions like ""why do you cry?"" and stating ""i know now why you cry, but it is something i could never do."" he's also prepared to learn the lingo!! sent back this time to terminate john connor is the T-1000, made of liquid metal, a far more advanced terminator than arnie, te T-100. some of the scenes the T-1000 provides are devastating, from the lorry chase to walking through metal bars, to he reformation when frozen by liquid nitrogen- undoubtably the greatest baddie ever to grace the big screen.its not often you can say this, but throughout the film, arnie is fantastic, his lack of emotion at the beginning, to a machine which is almost human by the end is breathtaking, and it is obviously the part which he was born to play- if the original plans went ahead and Van Damm played the terminator i guarantee there would have never have been a sequel. so, what do i think? the greatest sequel of all time? without a doubt. the greatest movie of all time - i think the shawshank redemption may have something to say about that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the greatest sequels of all time.,"Generally sequels never reach the cinematic heights of a good original film. But Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only an excellent sequel but also establishes a landmark in blockbuster cinema-making. Despite belonging to different generation this movie was almost 10 times more entertaining to watch than today's Transformers like crap. The highlights of T2 are its ground-breaking visual effects and awesome sound effects, surprises me that this movie was released in 1991. I know that visual effects only is not a measure of the quality of a film, but one must respect the achievements of T2 for establishing such great use of CGI for the very first time. Keeping aside the effects, the movie is still an excellent sci-fi action with a heart-touching story and memorable characters. Also should not forget the first terminator film which inspired all these sequels, of which only T2 makes remarkable use.It is almost impossible to talk about the plot without giving away one of the biggest shocking moments of cinema history.I really did not see that twist coming. Thus, leave the plot as it is almost a rehash of the previous one. Two guys sent back from the future to finish off John Conner so that he doesn't become leader of the Resistance. Well last time target was John's mother, this time target young John himself. Despite having similar story-line what makes it interesting is the relationship between the characters and great performances especially by Linda Hamilton and also Arnold. Edward Furlong also was lovable as 10 year old John. The action sequences are much grander here than in first film and terminator much more deadlier. Also lot humor thrown in all of which makes it more likable in general. Still the movie has enough sci-fiction elements which make us think and emotional themes to make it heartfelt.Brad Fiedel's score with slightly improved effects was fantastic.All the Oscar's this film got for its effects were well deserved. Unlike the first film which was much more focused and incredibly original, T2 covers different grounds of humanity, love, emotions and relations that kind of dilutes out its dreadful elements of the Terminator which were the focus of first film. Also T2 is much longer than T1 but it has enough content packed. The climax felt a bit prolonged, yet the ending was emotionally satisfying. Cameron has done a outstanding job with another great sequel, it gets all the things a sequels must do spot on. A big thanks to him a creating such an excellent sci-fi world with these 2 films, which gets ruined by its unnecessary and disappointing third and fourth installment.

But, this time, his mission is to protect a teenager from another terminator. The new terminator is played by Robert Patrick. What's unique about Patrick's performance is that his character is made out of liquid metal. It can form into a puddle, or shape-shifted in any way. The action sequences are astonishing. Every chase after chase, the action gets better and better. This is a good sequel to a good movie. Arnold Schwarznegger is terrific as the The Terminator, once again, this time playing a hero and, somewhat of a father figure to Edward Furlong, the actor who plays John Connor.

Iconic but over-rated...,"Terminator 2 is a film that I would like to like but can't. There are parts of it I genuinely enjoy but at the same time it doesn't have the appeal or seriousness of its predecessor or the inherent entertainment value of its immediate sequel.James Cameron's direction and visual style are what make the film look good. But as much as certain scenes from the film remind me of the first movie it never feels as good and dark as the first movie. The emphasis on even bigger action-scenes didn't impress me and only the T-1000 has stuck in my mind visually from this entry in the series.Arnold Schwarzenegger's role reversal from the previous movie is a refreshing touch but one that is undermined as the Terminator loses more and more of its cold and calculating robot mentality. Becoming a big buddy to the young John Connor is the reason why the ending of the film is so heart-breaking, but the change occurs in such a way that it feels like a very flippant change in direction from the first film.But maybe I'm too in love with the darkness of the first film and just a tad too sarcastic to enjoy the film's balance of action, narrative and drama. But for me the movie feels long, drawn out and not nearly as dramatic as the first or the third entry in the series.

This is all very obvious, and, since this is a movie aimed at younger people, therefor a good thing.Bottom line: if you want to spend a evening watching mindless, not-so-hard violence enjoying some of the best computer powered action scenes ever seen in a movie, rent this one.

The Terminator is here to save John Connor, and, consequently, Linda Hamilton, from the new T-1000 which, through some very impressive special effects can change into a liquid, among other things. Edward Furlong, he who could act in American History X, does not do so well here, with his character of John Connor rather annoying. An irritating voice-over from Hamilton is also peculiarly brought in halfway through that seems out of place as well, while Arnie is his usual self. Despite all this however, the sheer scale of the special effects of the action sequences is more than enough to make the film passable, with many scenes that linger in the memory. Even with some spelt-out 'sub'texts, this is almost the perfect action film. 4 / 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best SF film,"No doubt this is the best SF film ever made. I saw it about 10 times. Compact, beautiful, slick, elegant, no redundancy, no frills. The style of Aliean, not the style of Titanic.

Brilliant.,"This is one hell of a fantastic sequel...Jim Cameron does it again after the triumph that was Aliens, he produces another moment of magic...the way this movie consolidates and improves upon the first movie is near perfection. The special effects were absolutely amazing and even today it is difficult to see exactly how they could have been used to better effect. The way he managed to create a bad guy infinitely more scary than Arnie in the first film and make him (the T-1000) so believable is first rate...The cast was absolutely first rate, especially Linda Hamilton...her transformation over the two films was shocking and brilliantly played. The boy Connor was not just there for show either, his performance was great too as the child born to be world leader one day...the action was tense and relentless with some of the best sequences you are ever likely to see...the motorbike/lorry and the helicopter/van/lorry chases being cases in point...The only thing that prevents me from giving the movie ten out of ten is the slight softening of the mood in this film compared to its precursor. The first film was darker, moodier, and conveyed a feeling of dread throughout. This movie had the dread alright with the indestructible bad guy, but there were a few comic one-liners, especially from the supposed robot Arnold which seemed out of place (""I need a vacation"" for eg). Still this is a very minor gripe and will not prevent me from saying that this one of the best sci-fi or action movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Change of role,"In the first film, Arnold Schwartzenegger's character is sent back to kill John Connor by killing his mother before John is born. The second installment has Arnold coming back still as a Terminator, but now his job is to protect a now teenaged John Connor from a more advanced Terminator. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, John's mother. The film has lots of action and is certainly not going to put anybody to sleep! I believe this film is actually better than the original, which is a rarity for a sequel. The acting is better and I think the special effects are much better.

Even better than the first,"My Age: 13The T-1000 is an advanced terminator that is sent back in time.  Its mission is to terminate John Connor when he is a boy.  Also sent back is another, less advanced Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose mission is to protect him.  John is very important in the future and must survive, as his mother Sarah, Linda Hamilton, tells him after she escapes from a mental institution with the help of John and the Terminator.  Together all of them must survive the onslaught of the T-1000 and also destroy all the chips that made the terminators possible.The ""Terminator"" movies are one of the greatest action series of films around, along with the ""Die Hard"" series and I hope they make a third one. This film is fantastic in every way, credible after what happened in the first, but with incredible action!  This film is even better than the original.  It has fantastic action including adrenaline-pumping car chases and shootouts.

Excellent effects and performances but the script has some issues that haven't aged well,"When this movie came out, it was a watershed moment, especially among us 11-year-olds who were just now able to see R-rated movies here and there. At the time, we weren't thinking critically about whether things made much sense and we weren't comparing it to the first movie (which most of us saw later). The film changed the game of what a big-budget R-rated action movie could be, with top notch effects and plenty of scenes that will stay with you many years later.As a jaded middle-aged adult who has studied and attempted my share script writing and film making, I can certainly appreciate the original film as a mini-masterpiece of mood, atmosphere, and a lean, mean film all around. It's got a few underwhelming effects shots but overall a miraculous production considering its relatively low budget.Here with the sequel, they upped the budget 15 times, Arnold was already a major movie star, they threw in a spunky kid to be his sidekick, and so they had to up the threat level in terms of a new invulnerable foe. With the T-1000, I would say they were 100% successful in creating an interesting and relentless threat via the groundbreaking effects and Robert Patrick's genius performance. However, in the script, the machine would have been a lot scarier more tense had it behaved a little smarter.For instance - I don't understand why it has to keep reverting to the same form as Robert Patrick even later in the film when everyone knows who he is. One of its main assets is that it can copy other people and infiltrate. Think how easy it would have been to get closer to John in the factory if it just took the form of Arnold or anyone else who would seem more trustworthy. Another issue is that it doesn't just obliterate Arnold when it gets the chance on at least two occasions. I think since it's a more advanced model, it'd be aware of Arnold's power core and CPU location and could easily have just punctured those things and walked away. Why didn't it do this? Well, because we wouldn't have had a movie otherwise.After the amazing T-1000 morphing effects and a few heartless, dehumanizing kills, I still have to say that I'm a bit let down that this film just doesn't have the dark edginess and grit that the original had. It's not a small movie about a pursuit but a more muddled epic affair where the main characters go off on a bit of a tangent to change history later in the film which robs it of a lot of its energy. While it boasts bigger chase scenes with impressive choreography, the film had a lot less fatalities in an effort to give it more mass audience appeal.It's unfortunate the terminator doesn't get to terminate anyone, even prior to receiving his new orders, especially as it later comes to the detriment of the main characters as the officers he merely wounds are still capable of disrupting their plans. The film itself lacks daring to give the characters a hard choice; what if killing a few people could prevent the end of the world? Could you still do it? It would have been so much more interesting to see characters just go with a bold choice instead of playing it both ways in such a wishy-washy manner.Cameron just kept making bigger and bigger films as the years went on, with TITANIC and AVATAR both decent films but way more lavish and expensive than the scripts really dictated. Also an unfortunately byproduct of the success of this film would be the solidification of a repetitive formula that would haunt the franchise this spawned. The concept of a future war between humans and machines has so much that could be done with it. Why is every film in this series just another time travel plot about protecting some future savior of mankind and a bunch of chase scenes? Oh yeah, because this film made so much money, and the studios just think that all we will ever want is more of the same.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of my personal least favorites of all time,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. Let's start with the script. It is lame and does not feature one great line. Next, the special effects. These are all good and fine but stuff blowing up does not a movie make. The ""emotion"". This movie is in no way touching or anything else like that as the back cover would make you believe. The plot. There is some kind of plot but mostly it's just there so that we can get to the special effects. And finally the acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS. The John O' Connor kid is so amazingly bad that I muted this movie every time he started talking. A high-pitched kid swearing and trying to act big and bad is the last thing I am entertained by. Arnold Schwarzzeneger and John O' Connor's mother put on performances not quite as bad as the kid but close. I do not see how anyone could like this movie, but apparently some people do. They can have their opinions, but I personally believe that there is not a single redeeming value about this ""film"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The greatest sci-fi action movie of all time,This movie is extraordinary. I first got into the Terminator series with the show. Then I saw the first movie which was good and then I saw this. If you liked the first Terminator then you will love this one. Arnold Schwarzzenger is so cool as the good guy. Sarah Connor is awesome just because how much she has changed from the first film. The T-1000 effects are simply incredible. All the effects of this movie are incredible. The action is brilliant it had an excellent plot to it and good character development.

Best action movie I've ever seen,"Terminator 2 is possibly the best action movie ever made. Not only does it have very skillfully played-out action scenes, but it's also filled with some of the most incredible melodies I've ever heard, a factor that, simply, counts for at least 35% of the total excitement and feelings that the movie brings. In addition to being very well made, with no dull scenes whatsoever, this movie actually brings up some interesting questions. In one scene, John Connor looks at two little boys fighting, and asks a robot: ""We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean?"" and it replies: ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves."" I don't think one realizes right away how deep this small comment really goes, way beyond even the main idea of the movie, with all the time-traveling. In addition, unlike many other movies, every scene seems to last long enough to really give the viewer the exact feeling of freight, sympathy, or just exhiliration that the director or writer really meant by it.I, too, remember that actual August 29th, 1997; I was actually a bit scared of some truly devoted fans to start some ruckus. But nothing happened.That is, also, another thing about this movie: it is the only movie I know that predicted an incident in the very near future, which made it even more sci-fi-like. Finally, this seems to be the best movie for each actor who stars in it, and whenever I see them anywhere else, I trace them back to this movie before any other. This is a five-star, 10/10 achievement! If you're a fan of hard-core action, sci-fi, and a little bit of comedy, this will be your favorite movie, as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Redemption - robot style.,"This movie is: a sequel, silly, boring, stupid, an attempt to change Shwarznegger's image, asinine, derivative, foolish (sorry wrong word, it's not that good), unimaginative, ridiculous, boring, did I say silly?, ill-written, ludicrous.

T2 takes all the elements that made the first Terminator a great film and enhances them with amazing special effects and out of this world action. However, it lacks the dark quality that filled the first, which is a bit of a let down but one that's easily forgotten. If you're an action fan you cant find much better, it really has set the standard for all action films to follow, it is a genuinely enjoyable experience. Cameron has done a great job in bringing the story back to life for the sequel, and I especially liked the fact that he kept the original cast. However, I can never forgive that ending, it was horrible! They really did drag it out for everything it was worth and it just seem cheesy to me. Even despite this, it is still a great movie and one of the greatest action films out there.

Succeeds in so many areas...,"T2 is one of those rare masterpieces that attempts to do a genre like no one has done before. T2 does not only action, but drama, suspense and sci-fi as well. Going for a lighter, less mature atmosphere, James Cameron turned this movie into a giant action success that rivals all else. One of the things that T2 does that few have accomplished: using visual effects to your advantage. The T-1000 is easily the most marvellous thing you'll even see on the screen, not once do the amazing visual effects distract from the experience. The action scenes in here are just as impressive, from the fight in the mall hallway to the freeway chase scene, there is not an ounce of action missing from any of those scenes. And when cars aren't chasing each other or guns blazing, there is some serious plot development that makes you think, about nuclear war and of the future, which is in our hands. The acting excels, nobody, and I mean nobody could play a Terminator robot like Arnold does; nobody could portray the serious, on-the-edge Sarah Connor like Linda Hamilton does. Robert Patrick probably wouldn't be your first choice for a villain, but in here, he shows his intimidating side by providing us with a dark look at the future of assassin robots. The music is absolutely amazing, the main theme just sends a chill down my spine whenever I hear it, an amazing achievement.It is rare when you get a sequel that is just as good as, if not better than the original.

I honeslty don't know any other film (with a possible exception of Titanic) which was remembered so well for years after it was made. The special effects were and STILL ARE great. The good thing I liked about this film was that director James Cameron didn't swamp the entire movies with digital effects unlike the rubbish over-used effects we see in today's US 'blockbusters' like Minority Report, which was so bad it's not even worth mentioning in this report about a good film. The acting in this film is brilliant and there are funny one-liners and phrases like ""ASTILA VISTA BABY"" which everyone remembers.

"Hasta la Vista, Baby...","One of the things that I believe makes T2 shine more brightly than the original is the Super Hero movie rule. The average super hero sequel is more interesting because the first has to spend so much time on building the origin story, whereas the sequel can launch right into the action. The same formula applies to T2. Because they established the end of the world scenario in the first, the audience already knows what is going on, so we can get straight to it. Seven years passed since the original Terminator and special effects had taken a huge leap forward which helps the sci-fi genre immensely. Arnold is more comfortable being in front of the camera at this point so his charisma is fully developed and he is a less stiff robot. I do find Linda Hamilton more obnoxious in the sequel, but it's difficult to tell whether or not that is good story telling or bad. We are introduced to Edward Furlong and I'm still not sure that is a good thing. He's always picked interesting projects but we sort of knew he was a troubled young person from the start, so it is difficult to watch him knowing the personal hell he is going through in real life. When the movie first came out, I remember all of the stories about how it was the most expensive movie ever made and the speculation about its success.

Wow,"I am watching T2 on TV again tonight.  It is still Wow, even on a small screen TV.  The first time I saw it was at IMAX & that was a hundred times Wow.  I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see it on a big screen back then. The effects in T2 were revolutionary.  Kids who have grown up seeing the morphing in Tv commercials cannot imagine how impressive it was.  If I remember correctly, it was the most expensive movie made to date.  Those new effects cost millions & millions to develop.  Everyone in the audience was blown away by those effects.  For weeks after it opened, everyone at work stood around just talking about the effects, even people who really weren't movie people.  It is one thing to talk about revolutionary special effects, but it was really special to experience it. What was even better was that the rest of the movie lived up to the effects. Cameron put so much into the effects and the action without sacrificing any of the human elements that have to be there to make a truly great movie.  In another 20 years, the effects will by passe, but the ploting will still be tight and the directing superb.  But mostly for me, it is the characters: the Terminator and Sarah and John and Dyson & his family.  I like them, I care about them, I can cry for them.  Robert Patrick is even scarier than Arnold was is T1 (that Terminator only becomes truly chilling after the skin is gone). If you like Aliens, you've got to see T2.

One of the best action movies of the 90s!,"It happens only very rarely that a sequel is as good as the original film and it happens even more rarely that a sequel will be even better than the original film but Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of those movies. The movie has more action, emotional involvement and even a better script than the original Terminator movie. Also this movie contains two of the most brilliantly played out character changes ever in movie history. Mainly, however, Terminator 2 is quite simply a lot of fun. This is James Cameron's third masterpiece.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the title character but much has changed since the first film. Schwarzenegger was a superb villain in the first movie but proves in this movie that he is even better as a protagonist. Even though he still has the mannerisms of the original terminator you will soon see that there have been made subtle changes in the character which all work beautifully. The movie also plays on the fact that Arnold is the unofficial king of one-liners and gives him plenty of these to play with. The most memorable one-liner is probably ""Hasta la vista, baby"" said with the usual Schwarzenegger stiffness. Linda Hamilton returns as well and the changes in her character are far from subtle. She is almost a completely different character. Tough and incredibly strong while retaining the vulnerability that made us identify with her character in the first place. At first glance she will appear almost detached emotionally but on further inspection this proves to be far from true. A genuine tour-de-force by Hamilton. The movie also introduces Edward Furlong as a young John Connor and his performance is very much above average. In a world of annoying child actors he does the impossible and produces a likable character. One of the strengths of this movie is in its villain which is even more memorable than Arnold was in the original movie. Robert Patrick is quite simply one of the best screen villains of all time.Another strength is found in the effects which garnered the movie one of its Oscars. The effects are breath taking and like the effects from the original movie they hold their own even today. One could even go as far as to say that the effects in this movie are better than in most movies today which is saying something. Almost every scene involving the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) contains some memorable effect. Needless to say Terminator 2 is an effects masterpiece and the movie industry today owes a lot to the innovations which are found in this movie.James Cameron did the impossible. He produced a movie that lived up to the hype and expectations set by the previous movie. The movie even improves upon the terminator lore and in retrospect the series really should have ended here. The story really didn't warrant further continuation.In conclusion Terminator 2 is one of the best science fiction and action movies of the nineties and indeed one of the best movies ever and it is deserving of all the praise and a place in the history texts as one of the best movies ever.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A mind-blowing flick.,"All i can say is wow. this film has the action and terror of die hard, the anticipation of titanic and the deep psychological meanings of any top film to date. constantly kept off your seat by the lurking fear that any of the people could be the terminator 1000, and that getting close is all he needs to kill would be enough to give someone a coronary. this is only ever broken up by the excellently written narative by sarah giving deep insight into how her brain works. these bursts of action sandwiched between thought makes a powerful movie. i am still in shock, i have changed my fav. movie ever from ""the rock"" to this one. well done cameron.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Apocalypse never felt so good,"T2 opens with a series of shots showing typical LA morning. The everyday joys of life and the things we imagine as a happy day, and then at its peak we see a slow fade to white and the desolate vision of a hopeless future. And over the opening credits, while the longing mechanical sound of the Terminator main theme plays, we see fires consume the dead remains of a shattered city. This is the poetic craft of James Cameron.Terminator 2 never comes across as a sequel. It forever comes across as the film James Cameron wanted to make with the first--it's the film he wished he had the funding for to make. While the original Terminator is an incredibly well made film (especially considering the financial restraints), T2 takes everything the original couldn't do and does it. Now we have a director who isn't scraping along to survive, now we have a visionary with funding ready to show the world how to make an action film, and James Cameron delivered.After viewing Judgment Day for the first time in nearly a decade (after seeing T3), I have to say I liked the special effects of this film over T3, Matrix 2, and the Star Wars prequels. And I have to say I'm developing a growing distaste for the excessive CG in films. There's something more menacing and intimidating about the army of endoskeletons in this film and the raw gritty feel we see in the future scenes with HKs and the resistance struggling to survive. Star Wars had action figures and toys battling in out, Matrix was a video game, T3 was something in between, but T2 was real.The turn of events - making the killer robot from the first film, Cyberdyne model 101, the protector in T2 - that rocked. Since it's T2, why not send 2 terminators back through time? That idea rocked. Then Cameron introduction us to the T-1000. That so rocked.Robert Patrick's performance along with his array of inherent special effects made him one of the more memorable film villains. The key with the T-1000, though, he never does an effect for the hell of it. Limited to only 'knives and stabbing weapons,' he makes such incredible and effective use of the morphing ability you're never intimidated by the likes of Freddy or Jason again.Every effect has a purpose and is integral to either the plot or the characters. T2 makes no detours for the sake of special effects or action. Cameron gives reason for them to be there and goes from there, weaving it into the storyline and characters and cuts right to the point and gets away before it gets boring.The premise is simple and effective - a mother and her son fighting for survival, and then the fight for survival becomes a pre-emptive war against the machines. T2 wisely avoids explaining or even mentioning the inevitable paradoxes time travel concepts create. And never unmasks the ominous future entity that eventually takes over: Skynet.Despite not being the greatest characters ever conceived, I really liked John and Sarah Connor and the personality-less machine who gains his own personality in this film. Cameron doesn't go for overly dramatic with his cast, but instead infuses them with just enough traits and quirks to make them believable and likable without going into overdrive. The most extreme we get is Sarah Connor's mad ravings and venomous remarks towards Skynet's creator, but if you found out the exact date the world ended, why, and how and had to escape a machine from the future to preserve the survival of the human race . . . how would you act on a daily basis?Cameron has a way with the lights and the cameras that make his work transcend above standard action, and sets it in its own little category that's describable as 'James Cameran.' Seldom is there a visually boring moment in Terminator 2. Terminator has its own distinct look and feel. Brad Fiedel answers this with an appropriately unique score to match, now armed with superior synths.T2 succeeds because the music, the characters, and the images never loses its personal nature while the scope expands. Despite being a 'bigger' film, we're zoomed in on a few characters and these characters can and do grow on us. From there we can imagine the coming Armageddon being fought against billions of people just like these characters and not a faceless horde of people we neither know nor care about. It disturbs me that the popular trend is to increase the scale of these films to epic levels and yet throughout the whole experience you never find one character worthy of the film idea their inside.Terminator 2 brings Judgment Day its sad truth. Yes in the storyline 3 billion people die sometime in the future . . . but unlike T3, Cameron has the balls to show the faces of these people, and thus T2 is all the more powerful experience.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I want to love it....but I don't!,"Sorry to all you Terminator fans out there. But I just did not dig this film! It had some great action scenes....good characters and a touching ending.

I love the soundtrack too well ahead of its time so to speak.

Best for Both Sides,What the Title of this review means is its James Cameron's best movie and Arnold Schwarzenneger. This movie is a huge improvement over the mediocre Terminator.

"Great movie, except for the annoying brat kid","I seem to be in the minority here (based on the IMDb top 250 movie ratings) in that, spectacular as T2 is, I still prefer the original. Now, I must say that, having just watched it on DVD after having not seen it since it was playing in theaters, it's a better movie than I initially thought. Back then, I remembered it being a case of stunning special effects and amazing stunts trumping the basic story and characters (much like Independence Day), this in contrast to T-1 where they merely complemented them. I still think that is somewhat true, however, after watching this movie again, I really do have to give credit to most of the actors, as well as the writer(s), for a job well done.First off, Arnold simply delivers. Just as no one else could have played the terminator in the first movie, he's the only one who could play it in this one. He's still a machine, but much like Star Trek's Mr. Spock, there's a hint of humanity and humor right below the surface, and to portray this skillfully requires a degree of subtlety that Schwarzenegger hadn't previously been noted for. Robert Patrick is perfect as the emotionless, yet relentless machine sent to kill john Connor. Linda Hamilton returns, only now she has to escape from a mental institute to save her son, Earl Boen also returns as the perfect combination of jerk and dork as Sarah's shrink, and on and on. Perhaps the best scenes, at least in terms of emotional intensity, are the ones in the psych ward, where Sarah goes from determined escapee to terrified woman fleeing at her first encounter with the (good) terminator at the elevator to protective mom when the three of them steal a cop car and make their escape. The only thing I would have added would have been to show what happened to Dr. Silberman after he witnessed the encounter between Sarah, her son, and the two terminators. After all, he was the one who'd been scoffing at Sarah from the beginning, so it would have been amusing to see how he dealt with finding out that, far from being a loony, Sarah had simply been telling the truth. Would they have had to lock him up, or would he have simply gone into denial to protect his sanity and his reputation?Anyway, the bottom line is this film grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go till the credits roll. The amount of action is simply stunning, just think of what it took to film the final 30 minutes or so, from the gunplay at the Cyberdyne headquarters to the helicopter chase, and ending up in the steel factory. The story is well paced and, for the most part, the acting first rate. The only exception I'll make is for the kid. There are many instances where his dialog is simply awful, and his basic character seems unsuitable for someone who's supposed to be a great leader in the future. As just one example, there's a scene early on, shortly after John and the terminator have escaped from the mall, where he yells to a couple of guys to `help get this psycho off me!' then, when they actually come over to do just that, he insults them and has the terminator nearly beat them to death. This was just the worst scene he's featured in, but there are plenty of others, such as, right after the aforementioned scene, he tries to explain to the terminator why he can't kill people, but he seems unable to come up with a better rationale than `because you just can't. Trust me on this'. I'll be blunt  this kid (at least for me) is fully as annoying as Jar Jar Binks was in `Phantom Menace', and of course, since he's one of the main characters, it definitely detracts from an otherwise great movie. So, for that I rate it 9 out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
UNBELIEVABLE,"This is the best movie i have ever seen. First off it's the first action movie i've seen in a long time that has a plot as good as any drama or comedy. Second off the main spectacular things about T2 are the special effects, unbelievable, especially the part where the T-1000 morphs out of the floor and into the shape of the cop. Third is the acting which is excellent. Especially Linda Hamilton's super performance as Sarah Connor. Sarah is not insane, but also not exactly sane either.

The original is better,"Watched the Extended Special Edition cut for the first time and definitely prefer the Theatrical over this. That said, this review is for the Extended Special Edition cut.
Unfortunately for T2 there is little in the way of story that's very fresh. It's essentially the same movie as the first movie. It hits the same beats in the same places and has incredibly similar action set pieces. There are some new things in here like them going and blowing up Skynet. There a few new places they visit but at the core of it, it's very similar. Plus, the humor and one liners go little bit too far. There's great moments with the Terminator learning human emotion like when he attempts to smile but, there's a bit much of it. Speaking of elements that are a bit much, the product placement is EXCESSIVE. The amount of Pepsi and Subway in this movie is insane. Drinking, eating, and turning products towards the camera are only the start of it. While I'm complaining I may as well address the bizarre structure choices. The first hour or so is the Terminator sequel we would expect. A Terminator trying to get a guy and a guy protecting that guy. Pretty simple stuff but then it shifts into being about the creation of Skynet. Where our characters confront the creator and blow up the cyberdine building. It almost completely abandons the T-1000, barely mentioning it and showing it even less. When the T-1000 forces its way back into the movie it feels like the Skynet creation movie ends and the Terminator sequel begins again. It's jarring and only works thanks to pretty good writing but it's still an odd choice to make.
But this movie still rules. The characters are far more interesting then they are in the first movie and the themes presented far outdo the original. Even though there are a lot of similar action sequences, they absolutely RIP in this movie. The camera work is far slicker and more fluent thanks to the big budget making each sequence more engaging. There's a great blend of old school effects (rear screen projection, puppeteering, matte paintings, stop motion) and new school effects. It's also one of the last big budget action movies I can think of that meldes a ton of genres together seemlessly. You got The Thing type body horror, big action set pieces, comedic moments, character drama, and of course sci-fi. The Terminator is cooler, the action hits harder, the characters are more dynamic, and the filmmaking is top notch. Still one of the coolest sequels to a classic movie ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Come with me if you want to live!...,"This 1991 sequel to ""The Terminator"" from 1984, is almost as good as the first movie. Almost.Director James Cameron went in a somewhat very deviant direction with this sequel movie. And in my opinion he strayed a bit too much from the original storyline. Sure it was cool to see the T-1000 cyborg and its liquid metal ability, but at the same time having the T-800 model sent back to protect Sarah Connor's child was an odd twist of events for me.That being said, I am not saying that ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a bad or poor movie, far from it. Because this movie is action-packed and fast paced from start to end. I just personally didn't like the switch of roles all too keenly.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles quite well, carrying on from the original movie. I can't claim to be overly much a fan of Edward Furlong, so in my opinion he wasn't the best of choices for the role. Robert Patrick, however, he was really well-cast for the role of the T-1000.The effects in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" were quite good, and the effects with the T-1000 were rather groundbreaking back then in 1991. And the special effects really helped the movie along quite nicely, because they added a level of believability to the movie.All in all then ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an entertaining action movie. I just didn't find it fully as entertaining as the first movie. But still well-worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991),I saw this movie yesterday and It was the second time that I had bought the film. It is really entertaining always keeping you on the edge of your seat.

Is this a repeat?,"Really, stripping off the special effects and budget, this film is a copy from the original Terminator.  I saw a programme where Cameron explained that Arnie's set trailer cost more than the first film and realised where this film relies on: budget. The first had an excellent plot and this was ripped off in the second, OK, first copy: the first scene when the Terminator arrives, secondly, the factory and the steel plant at the end of both films, eg. a scramble for survival etc. The plot is also tacky and relies heavily on the tracks made by the first, eg. when the chip and arm were left in the factory the film finishes and then in the second, we see that Cyberdine own the arm and chip, this was not explained in either of the films and we as an audience are left to presume that the factory at the end of the first was Cyberdine, not shown recently until the DVD came out with deleted footage. There are also several plot disturbances, one of them being that Sarah was a young, average girl next door, then immediately we see in the second that she is streetwise, knows how to use guns, is tough and in Pescadero mental home where as at the end of the first she drove off into the sunset happily.

A sequel that tops the original and a benchmark of the action genre,"10 years after the events of the last film, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has spent the intervening years raising her son John (Edward Furlong) off the grid and training him in paramilitary and guerilla techniques for the coming war with machines and Skynet known as ""Judgment Day"". When Sarah is incarcerated at a mental hospital for attacks on computer and robotics labs, John lives with various foster parents and comes to believe his mother is insane. Meanwhile at Cyberdyne Systems, computer researcher Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) has made inroads in technological from technology Cyberdyne acquired from the first Terminator attack unbeknownst to Dyson. In addition to the first terminator sent back to 1984, Skynet was able send a second terminator, the liquid metal T-1000 (Robert Patrick) who can imitate anyone, to attack John in 1995. A second T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back, but has been reprogrammed by John Connor in the future to serve as John's protector. Now John, Sara, and the T-800 must elude the T-1000 while also trying to avoid Judgement Day.Following the success of the first The Terminator the cast and crew were eager to do a sequel, however due to technological limitations and rights issues with Hemdale development did not begin immediately with Cameron using the intervening years to pursue other projects such as Aliens and The Abyss, the latter of which served as a dry run for the level of effects work needed to create the T-1000. Schwarzenegger was able to convince Carolco to secure the rights to The Terminator which fortuitously lined up with availability in the schedules of Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and James Cameron. At the time of release Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the most expensive film made at that point (not accounting for inflation) but the gamble paid off with Terminator 2 becoming the top grossing film of 1991 and serving as a benchmark for action cinema and visual effects that still holds up to this day.Terminator 2 like the previous Terminator is a chase film, but despite the larger budget the movie both retains the gritty aesthetic it sold audiences on in the first film while also giving audiences new threads and ideas that build upon what was established in the first film. The story does a good job of playing with the time paradoxes with Miles Dyson and Cyberdyne Systems serving as secondary antagonists who are ultimately responsible for the emergence of Skynet and Judgment Day. While Cyberdyne as is typical for this type of plot is your typical faceless corporate giant (down to the fact we don't see any management or executive types who run Cyberdyne) the main focus is on Miles himself who's not some ""boo-hiss"" boogeyman, he's simply an engineer working on higher performing technology and his reaction where he finds out what this leads to is quite haunting. Linda Hamilton's hardened take on Sarah Connor is really strong performance wise (even if admittedly there's more than a little Ellen Ripley in it) and Hamilton really mines the character's darker more hardened edge for both great action and drama in the film. Schwarzenegger does well returning to the role of the T-800, playing the character with the same delivery he did in the first movie, but adding a layer of transhumanist elements where despite being a robot his character has an arc which is complimented with his relationship with Furlong's take on John Connor. Despite being Furlong's first film role, he shows some good charisma and prowess as an actor. Often times Furlong is overshadowed by the other actors such as Morton, Hamilton, and of course Schwarzenegger, but as a supporting presence he plays off against the other actors really well. Robert Patrick makes a really strong antagonist as the T-1000. Unlike the T-800 who was like a human panzer, the T-1000 is more sleek and streamlined with Patrick exuding levels of charm in his performance (especially earlier in the movie) that add to his threatening presence due to his chameleon like nature.The practical effects by Stan Winston (who returns from the first film) and the digital effects by Pacific Data Images (PDI) are really good and still hold up after all these years. The make-up and animatronics were already impressive in the first film (barring a few seams here and there) but Winston and his team have taken those effects and refined them to look better than ever. Add to that the effects by PDI in creating the ""liquid metal"" T-1000 whose transformation and camouflage effects are still really strong you can tell why this movie earned its visual effects Oscars. The action sequences are wonderfully intense and creative and build upon the ones we saw in the first Terminator with some great sequences that are both thrilling and fun.Terminator 2 does what many sequels try and fail to do, revisit the core appeal of the original while building upon it and going to new and interesting places not yet traversed. The cast all give really good performances, Cameron creates a thrilling sense of urgency, and the effects by Stan Winston and PDI create a believable scenario. It's solid sequel that tops the original.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I enjoyed all three of the ""Terminator"" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects.When this movie came out, the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping, so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later, they are still cool. Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible, literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time, he looks like the most indestructible ""person"" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.Arnold Schwarzenegger, an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg, plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged, too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first ""Terminator."" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid, a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong, and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star.Actually, a lot of the dialog in here is terrible and a testimony to the sleazy people who wrote the screenplay. The director, James Cameron, has done a number of similar films with foul- mouthed characters.Still, despite all these annoyances, as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn, I can't help but keep watching this DVD every three or four years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
just another Hollywood explosion movie,"Yes, this movie has everything you expected, but is it necessarily as good as it is made out to be? The answer is a resounding no. These movies these days seem to be a dime a dozen, add a big name, add some crazy ridiculous storyline and add a few million in special effects and that equals Hollywood success these days. Great movie if you don't want to think about anything or if you're upset and need to see a bunch of explosions. Arnold is everything he is cut out to be... big and strong and a terrible actor. The movie is worth a watch, but this cult phenonmenon that has arisen from this movie is kind of ridiculous to me. I'd like to see movies that have more thought in them then Terminator 2 start to get rewarded.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""The Terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him""","Watching 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' for the first time in three years made me remember how amazing movies could be. Director James Cameron had previously achieved unexpected success with 'The Terminator (1984),' a moody and relentlessly bleak tech-noir thriller. The inevitable sequel came armed with a blockbuster budget and state-of-the- arts visual effects, and it is a triumph on every level. The two films are very different, of course – just as Cameron's 'Aliens (1986)' was very different from Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' The first Terminator film was a down-and-dirty dystopian sci-fi, where the modern-day setting is just as drab and ominous as the terrifying future. In 'Judgement Day,' Cameron juggles a tricky juxtaposition of hope and despair. The blindingly-vivid 1990s action sequences feel as though they were captured in the flash of a nuclear explosion, and their dazzling intensity make our glimpse of a bleak, war-ridden future all the more horrific.Science-fiction has often tackled the notion that Mankind's technology is destined to rebel, as in '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).' However, unlike most entries to the genre, 'T2: Judgement Day' takes the time to explore the idea. As in Kubrick's film, the fates of humans and machines become inescapably entwined: Man is no longer merely the designer (a la Dr. Frankenstein) who creates an artificial son, but one who must learn from his progeny. Accordingly, John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) share a father-son relationship that twists back on itself like a Moebius strip, each half teaching the other. In one haunting sequence, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) grimly contemplates the Terminator's unwavering loyalty towards John, and his ironic suitability as a father figure. This grotesque interlacing of familial roles speaks a clear message: if Judgement Day is to be averted, Man and Machine must coexist as equals, though human vanity may never allow it.Throughout the film, Cameron weaves one astonishing action set-piece after another, utilising a seamless combination CGI and optical trickery. The T-1000 Terminator at first glance seems reasonably innocuous, but Robert Patrick brings something icily sinister to the role, a cold intelligence that isn't strictly mechanical but somehow filled with imagination. An equally fascinating character, I thought, was Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, a complete reversal from the innocent Sarah Connor of the previous film. Now emotionally hardened by the prospect of nuclear holocaust, Sarah sees only ghosts where she once saw people, her apathy stemmed only by her maternal instincts towards John. In a haunting dream sequence, Sarah Connor is powerless to warn a younger version of herself (representative of society at large) of the coming dangers, her screams consumed by a nuclear blast that levels cities and engulfs her in flames. Hamilton's performance is bold and ferocious, perhaps cinema's most intense female action role (not coincidentally, James Cameron also provided us with the runner-up, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in 'Aliens (1986)).'",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
'Come with me if you want to live',"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best action films ever made, that is a fact. It shows that a sequel can be even better then the original and expand on ideas set out in the first film.T2 takes place 10 years after the events of The Terminator, set in year 1995. In the year 2029 the Machines set a second Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to 1995 to find and kill John Connor (Edward Furlong) when he is a still a child. The Resistance also send someone to protect John, this time a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the same type of Terminator sent to kill Sarah Connor in 1984. John Connor has become a juvenile delinquent, living foster care, who runs away from home, steals bank cards, rides a mini-bike and goes to the arcade. Sarah Connor (Sarah Connor) had become a Luddite type terrorist, attacking computer factories, and ends up being locked up in a psychiatric hospital. When The Terminator saves John, John get the machine to help him break his mother out of hospital. It is after that event that Sarah, John and the Terminator should stop Judgment Day from happening, by attacking Cyberdyne Systems, as well as stop the T-1000.Some elements of the plot may seen a re-tread of the plot in the first film, but James Cameron, being a skilled writer and director, expands on the ideas of the first film, showing more then just a chase movie. Sarah Connor has grown as a character, from the scared teenager to a strong, kiss-ass woman and it is Linda Hamilton's strongest role. Cameron has a love for strong female characters. Cameron focuses on two key elements on storyteller, plot and character, and that is why T2 is so good. As well as the action and sci-fi storyline, T2 is the eternal love-story between a boy and his robot. Seriously though, there is a strong relationship and chemistry between John and the Terminator, John teaching the Terminator to be more human, whilst the Terminator acts as a fatherly, guardian figure. Cameron also expands on the theme of fate and choice and that the idea of the future is not set in stone. The film also has some of the best one-liners ever in film.The action is non-stop, relentless and some of the best you will ever see. James Cameron uses both old-fashion techniques for scenes like the chase scene with the truck, but also used to at the time top end special effects, which is effective even now. This film was the first to have a budget over $100 Million, and it is money well spend. The pacing is great, and can not get board during this film.The Terminator is easily Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role because it requires very little acting. It also fun to see a role reversal in this sequel. Robert Patrick has a real menace as the T-1000, all he need was a look and didn't need to say much. He was a lot better then Kristanna Loken in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. It was also a smart move to make the T-1000 a regular sized man, not another muscle man. Linda Hamilton is tough and believable, whilst, Edward Furlong had a decent debut. I don't know what happened to him, from staring in T2 and American History X to staring in Uwe Boll films.The Terminator was excellent, Terminator 2, even better, Terminator 3, don't bother.An essential film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More fun with multiple viewings,"I've seen a lot of movies in the theater(where movies SHOULD be seen),particularly since I turned eighteen which was not quite twenty years ago,so I have probably forgotten more movie experiences than some have had. I preface this comment with that because I saw this first when it was just two days freshly released, the 5th of July 1991,and I recall it(And even some of the anticipation for the film)like--if not yesterday--it was last week or last month. I got there late and had to sit and watch this WAAAAAaaaaayyyy in the back in the single seat reserved for the wheelchair patrons(I didn't quite understand that that was what those seats were for back then.Ay!). Having said all that,this filmgoing experience was STILL very memorable and quite fun.Flip forward over the years and,having seen this a number of times--in full and in partial--on big and small screens alike,but having not really sat and watched this in probably sixteen years,I bought this at the local movies and music secondhand store for a song and finally got around to watching it.Not only did I enjoy seeing this again,I think I may've actually gotten MORE out of it than before.The original HK T-800 model killing machine,so iconically fleshed out by Mr.Schwarzenegger,returns from the future to find John Connor,11(then newbie actor Edward Furlong,mixing annoying,tweener brattiness with an uncanny adult sensibility)and protect him from a new killing menace--the T-1000(Robert Patrick,then unknown and coolly menacing,counterbalancing the thunderous brute strength of Arnold's original),a liquid metal upgraded terminator with a scary efficient ability to both repair and replicate its victims and/or prey. John,despite advisement to the contrary,goes and rescues his mother,the intrepid Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton,ripped and sexy,in a haggard,toughened way that would probably change her career image permanently). Of course,becoming more and more aware of the seemingly inescapable doom of mankind's existence in the shadow of SkyNet's advent,she moves to change the future pro-actively,with interesting and even heart-breaking outcomes.Well before JAmes CAmeron became much more famous for winning awards for a faux romantic adventure about a large cruise ship sinking,he was much more remembered as making films like this:adrenaline-soaked blow-ups with unrelenting action and sharp(if perhaps a tad trite)dialog. This movie is probably king of them all. Sort of an expanded,more ambitious take on the original movie,it is more of a augmentation of the original's concept,taking it to levels it couldn't on the original's budget. Screenplay writer William Wisher is able to make the most out of clipped dialog,though the actors in place help it out immensely. A fantastic film-watching experience that only seems,like fine wine,get better with age and more viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
You want incredible action and excitement? No problemo....,"Seven years after he first said he'd be back, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator whose mission is not to destroy mankind, but to ensure its survival by protecting 10-year old John Connor (Edward Furlong), future saviour of the human race, from a T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a highly advanced, seemingly unstoppable liquid-metal killing machine.It's 1991: Arnie is a major box office draw, director James Cameron has spent years developing movie technology, Guns 'n' Roses are rocking the charts, and I'm only too happy to stump up some hard earned cash to see all three join forces for the follow-up to 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator. The original was a masterful piece of low-budget film-making; with a much bigger budget and the latest special effects technology at his disposal, Cameron's sequel was a must-see.It didn't disappoint.Twenty years later: even though film-making technology has advanced in leaps and bounds over the last two decades, and budgets have got bigger and bigger, very few movies have provided me with as many perfectly executed cinematic thrills as T2. An incredible action juggernaut packed with unbelievable scenes of OTT mayhem, iconic performances, and groundbreaking effects, all accompanied by an unbeatable Brad Fiedel score and Axl Rose's unmistakable wailing, this still ranks as one of the biggest and best sci-fi/action flicks ever made. Not only does the film deliver everything you could want in terms of explosive entertainment, but it also has some wonderful humour and a lot of heart—and anyone who says otherwise can eat me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Oh For Just One More Chase Scene,"I am getting very weary of writers,directors and producers who over-do race scenes in their films at the expense of the story and the logic of  the film's message.And does every mental institution have to be peopled with cruel,uncaring staff. However it is the constant chasing by car,foot,  car,motorcycle ,truck (U name it) that I feel transforms an otherwise entertaining film into a boring experience! I am surprised we weren't treated to a couple of chases featuring lions ,tigers and other ferocious creatures. What a blast that would have been!!!! Ronin was bad because it too overdid the ""chase"" element. By comparison the director of Ronin was a ""piker"". I still insist! Each unnecessary and boringly long race scene, means one less opportunity for creativity or character development.

I enjoyed the entertainment value, but still feel it needs to be cut down 15-25 minutes.The acting is a bit hokie, especially from Furlong and Hamilton. Arnold is Arnold and he never was a great actor, but he always does his job well. Hamilton is just so over the top unlike the first Terminator. Maybe poor direction. Furlong is just hammy and wooden, but it could also be because of the bad ADR that actors sound bad. It certainly doesn't help. In fact, I think Furlong's side kick in the film, the red head kid with the mullet was not only a better actor, but would have been much better playing that part.Robert Patrick was amazing and without him this movie wouldn't have been that great. I always felt like he was a robot, but there were part of Arnold's performance it didn't feel like that.The special effects still hold up today and it's actually pretty amazing what they were able to do back then.The overall message and story is good.

"He said, ""I'll Be Back"", and he did!","The Terminator failed to destroy Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). This time, The T-800(Arnold Schwarzenegger) is here on a different mission; to protect Sarah and her son John(Edward Furlong) from a highly advanced terminator, known as the T-1000(Robert Patrick). This terminator is so elusive and so lethal, ingenuity is the main factor in order to stop it. Like the T-800, the T-1000 can't be stopped by bullets. The T-1000 kills John's foster parents. How did he kill the foster mother? I don't wanna know. Sarah's distrust in the terminator was easy to spot, when this tries to help, she was left with no choice but to trust him. And she did. When he stitched her up, her trust in it grew. And the battle scenes between the cops and the terminator was no contest. Not one police officer was killed. The way the could stop the T-1000 was obvious, liquid nitrogen and explosives. Even though, he couldn't self terminate, he had to be destroyed with the same liquid metal that did the T-1000. Simply because, regular ammunition would be a total waste. And furthermore, other super-geniuses could reconstruct it. So he went down, honorably!

The best Terminator in every regard,"After watching every Terminator movie, I can honestly say this one is the best: a sequel that surpasses the original, the landmark that sequels are compared to. The plot is tight, logical and constantly surprises you (compare to the plot problems in Terminator Salvation). T2 can even be seen before all others as I did many years ago as it stands by itself. The cinematography and camera shots are beautiful. Notice the color schemes particularly in the asylum (blue-gray) and the foundry (orange-red). The ""visions"" scenes are very inspired and memorable. The action is intense, engrossing and escalating as it should be. The visual effects are very impressive and were revolutionary back then, especially anything involving the T-1000. The actors are top-notch particularly Linda Hamilton who shines in the strong yet fragile, tough yet conflicted Sarah Connor, the role of her life.The terminators, supposed to be unemotional, are quite cool, menacing and relentless yet fascinating. The interactions between John Connor and the terminator are wonderful and add depth to both characters. After seeing T2 for the first time, I was so awed by Robert Patrick's performance that I kept looking for him in other movies. Everything is in the physicality and the deliberate movements with no small nod to the talents of the director. Compare the T-1000 to the terminatrix in T3 who for some reason was much less memorable. The music is much better and grandiose than the first (such a good percussive theme) and the sound effects are so good they won 2 academy awards. Let's finish by mentioning the powerful unforgettable ending that is not only moving but ties up neatly the loose ends. There's actually something big that does not make sense (darn time travel paradoxes) but even after seeing T2 more than once, it just doesn't bug you when you actually watch the film. It's definitely worth buying but be careful with the different DVD editions.Rating: 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films of all time,"Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a perfection. The action and sci-fi elements go together like bread and butter.

"So, is the movie a potential spoiler to the future?","This movie is my all-time FAVORITE film. I was being born as it was released. Maybe my parents went to the theater while the night of? I don't know. What I do know, is that this movie had a killer plot and a poetic styled script. Most of the people I know who have watched this movie think of it only as an action movie. They don't seem to grasp the underlining theme of love and what you would do to protect those you care about most. Like Connor said, ""The machine seemed like more of a father than any of the ten's of men I brought home trying to protect him"". This movie is moving, and YES, the action is groundbreaking. This is a ""Hold on to your butt's"" (Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park) kind of movie. Arnold portrayed a role he had previously done 7 years earlier but with more style and a sense of really embracing this emotionless machine who couldn't understand simple emotional functions. ""I know now why you cry."" was possibly the most memorable line for me in the entire movie (Considering ""I'll be back"" or ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" or the smirking ""Trust me""). This machine had been through so much with this future-rebel savior that he had just understood an emotion. It was like breathing for the first time. Every aspect of this film was portrayed fantastically, from the camera work, to the long hours of early-computer graphics work done in movies. It was sad to see the following installments not to be as compelling as Judgement Day. I can't believe I'm saying this, but James Cameron has always been at the top of his game, always including only the newest, most advanced CGI or graphics that were available. He's always able to pull it off in such a way that he has no competition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best action film in existence.,"Terminator 2 picks up many years after the first film. Sarah Connor is in a mental hospital, and her son John is a rebellious pre-teen. Now, a far more sophisticated robot has been sent back to kill him. However, another T-800 model has been sent back as well, only this time to protect John. Together, they rescue Sarah and go on the run to stop the upcoming nuclear war in its tracks. Not only is this film far superior to the original, but it is far superior to any other action film as well.James Cameron did a great job turning the first Terminator film into an action classic. He does an even better job this time around. It's obvious that this movie was made on a higher budget than the original, and thank God for that. The special effects in this movie are just awesome for what was available at the time. The liquid metal T-1000 looks amazing when he shape shifts. The action scenes are explosive and amazing to watch. The story and dialogue is all around better in this movie. What I liked most was how the human emotion element was used. John Connor grows attached to the Terminator sent to protect him, and he teaches him how to use phrases like a human, smile, and give high fives. The relationship between John and the Terminator, and how Sarah says ""out of all the would be fathers, this machine was the only one who measured up"", really makes the movie much cooler than the original.The acting in this movie is really good too. Edward Furlong is great as young John Connor. Arnold is awesome in the role he created. Linda Hamilton makes a strong improvement from the first film. She is more of an action hero this time around instead of a victim, and that makes her character better.Overall, this is a spectacular action film that anybody who likes action will love. This is far superior to the first film, and one of my personal favourites.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"I'm never really a fan of kids in movies, but Edward Furlong turns in some attitude here with his performance as the ten year old ""John Connor"". Turns out that he is the target of the the latest ""Skynet"" plot to destroy the resistance to their impending world domination (in a worryingly close 2029!). They have sent a new, improved, ""T1000"" (Robert Patrick) back in time to throttle him. Luckily, his future self has had the presence of mind to send one of the original models (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back on protection detail. As the devastation mounts and the bodies pile up, the young man convinces his protector to get his mother out of her secure institution - the authorities weren't convinced about her stories of futuristic ""terminator"" robots after last time - and also, to stop routinely killing people! It took James Cameron quite a while to put this sequel together, and it is almost as good as the original. Loads of action, some great visual and pyrotechnic effects as well as some quite engaging comedy moments that allow the story to deliver a surprising amount of characterisation for an action movie. You do feel just the tiniest bit invested in them, and though I did find the denouement dragged out just a little, it's a solidly entertaining piece of big screen cinema that allows a man who really cannot act to own the screen. Great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"As Time Goes By, T2 Only Gets Better.......","In my opinion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the best film of the entire franchise. Due to its involving and breath-taking story along with impressive performances. The plot even having some similarities with the first movie isn't remotely predictable or boring. The tension, the soundtrack and how the action scenes were shot provided a feeling of always look up your shoulder because something is after you. But the film is not only actions scenes, in the interval between the action scenes, the characters have their chance to be explored and developed making each one have a good and solid identity during the entire picture. One aspect which is new is the humour, the relationship between John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is responsible for this to happen. Other point worth mentioning is the visual effects, specially the makeup used in the T-800 is so realistic, at times there is a certain discomfort because you know that action would hurt, but as he is a robot, that is nothing.Regarding the cast, their performance was incredible. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) suffered a change both physically and mentally, she's no longer the naive and helpless woman from the first movie, now she is willing to do anything so John can survive. Arnold once again is great in the role, Edward Furlong plays a troubled and rebel John Connor. Throughout the film a bond is created between John and the T-800 and surely it's one of the highlights. It's so funny and amusing see the growth of the odd friendship, a man with a machine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An action flick with a heart,"This film has to be one of the more ""human"" action flicks out there. While most of them deal with the issue of good vs. bad, purely and simple, T2 introduces the concept of the villain in the first film being the hero in the second (T-800), while the innocent heroine (Sarah) of the first film transforms herself into the cynical person. All the while, the figure of a child (John) whose life has to be protected at all costs looms large, because this child wants to protect his mother and to befriend the Terminator.All this, and a villain that is absolutely relentless and cold-hearted. As I said before, while most action films are good vs. evil, this film confronts its principal figures with themselves:  John, who doesn't want to acknowledge his destiny as the savior of a future world, and risks his life for his mother; Sarah, who has transformed herself into a psychopath, and has to deal with the fact that her only hope is one of the robots that killed John's father in the first movie, and the Terminator, who tries to learn from his human masters the traits of honesty, love and principles.Who said Cameron's masterpiece was Titanic? =)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Tons of memorable lines and moments; in short, the writing is amazing. The action sequences are also outstanding.The acting is flawless too. This is probably also due to the fact that the actors fit their roles perfectly.The visuals are also really really well done.

The quality and restricted quantity stands as a prime example of they should be used, and they still look great 15 years after the films original release.

One of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is easily one of the greatest Science Fiction films ever created. Almost everything about this film from top to bottom, from the start to it's finish it's perfect. The direction is fantastic and it is unbelievable that this film was shot in the 1990s when the technology was so redundant, the action scenes and affects in this film are almost unbelievable for 1991. All the scenes are shot well and are interesting to watch, and they are pinnacle for the all the Sci-Fi action films that came in the future. Many Action Sci-Fi films could learn to base their action scenes off of this movie because it's that good.The sound affects and the music is also perfect for the times when it is played and the sound effects are loud and well orchestrated.It is not just about the action and the direction when it comes to T2:JD, the storyline is also interesting and it will keep you on the edge of your seat and the storytelling is also top notch and you are always wondering what is going to happen next. The film is not based on mindless action it is intelligent storytelling at it's finest and the Perfect follow up to and a perfect continuation of the first terminator movie. I was always on the Edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. The dialog is also interesting at all times and all the actors are almost perfect in their roles. They are so perfect that I cannot even imagine anyone else playing their roles.Arnold is fantastic in his role as T-101 this time playing as the savior or the good guy unlike the first movie where he played the antagonist. If you thought he did a great job as an antagonist in the first film. You will be blown away here, he is even better as a protagonist and is acting and his voice and accent are almost perfect to play a cyborg, it just works so well.Edward Furlong who was only a teenager at the time is just fantastic in his role, his acting, facial expressions, emotions and dialog delivery are all top notch and his interactions with both Linda (Sarah Connor) and Arnold (Terminator) are fantastic and memorable scenes.Linda Hamilton plays a different role than she did in the first movie, in the first film she was an innocent person who was victimized this movie show how her character has developed and how she has grown tougher and stronger after the first film determined to protect John and prevent the end of the world from coming. This is perfect character development in a movie and Linda does a marvelous Job. Lastly Robert Patrick who does not talk much is a great antagonist, he is silent and mysterious and cold and calculated as that serious angry expression on his face most of the time which works so well, the action scenes between him and Arnold are just a thing of beauty and perfectly shot. the rest of the supporting cast including Doctor Silverman pare also great in their roles. Almost nothing bad I can say about the acting in this film.Overall Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only one of the greatest Action Sci-Fi films ever made, it is one of the best films ever, it is a perfect balance of good storyline and good action which is a rarity for Hollywood nowadays. Add to that the perfect direction and brilliant casting and performances from almost the entire cast. You have got a brilliant film a one you can watch again again. This is the perfect follow up to the first Terminator Movie, the sequels to T2:JD which were Terminator 3: Rise of Machines and Terminator Salvation were alright but they did not live up to the first 2 films and were honestly not needed. The first two films completed the story they wanted to tell.Overall Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the Best Movies of All Time,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day stands tall as a timeless masterpiece that redefined the action genre. From its gripping storyline to its groundbreaking special effects, this film continues to astound audiences even decades after its release. The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, blending seamlessly with the jaw-dropping special effects that were ahead of their time. The musical score elevates every scene, intensifying the emotional depth and adding layers of suspense to an already gripping narrative. Arnold Schwarzenegger's reprisal of the iconic Terminator role is both riveting and endearing, while Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor is a testament to her strength and resilience.

Excellent!!!,"Mostly, sequels are inferior films, but I've compared the 2 movies and T2 is a bit better than the first.

It held such big promise. Where did it go all wrong?,"I thought the first movie was perfect.

How original. Why didn't they run Shortcut instead - No. 5 was much cuter! Then there's the misogynist streak, where the boy puts the mother in her place. Reminds you of Jesus, doesn't it? Then, you get the ""scientists are the problems"" speech. We all know that the H-bomb wasn't used, so why bring it into the picture? Why not discuss the fact that the only time nuclear weapons were used, it was used by America to intimidate the commis (not the Japanese) in a war started by a nation that revered their king as God (yes, the Japanese). In other words, religion, not science, started the Asian theater of combat. Why not talk about that?

The perfection in Hollywood exists,"As I commented in Terminator I (1984), this film is a legend. But this part contains everything that a spectator could expect. John Connor was Edward Furlong- it was a real pity that he was so crazy and didn't go on in his career because he is and will a great actor. The feeling about life is strongest that the first part, because in this occasion the own terminator learns that it can't kill whoever it wants because that produces pain and regret and it understands that a machine can replace a human for a lot of things but no to feel sensations. And a world without sensation isn't it a world, despite of, nowadays we are a little bit more insensitive. I was only 7 years when i saw this movie ( and i saw this part before the first). I understood that the life is so valuable. The role of Miles B. Dyson (Joe Morton) is special for this reason: in a low minutes he notices that is responsible for a lot of deaths for his own develops. He was so happy and so carried away about his job that he never thought about what could produce if the machines someday take control of everything. His wife, Talessa (Epatha Merkenson) (in a cut scene) did: she told him that a machine cant love like she did and their children.When the Terminator told John that is natural that mankind kill each other , John changed his point of view and in that moment he reaches the feelings that his mother wanted to transmit.But Sarah also learns something: she could became to a terminator (when she is ready to kill Miles at any expense) The role of T1000 (Robert Patrick) it was fantastic!

Good film - so wish the robots took over!,"There's not much that truly can be said about this film ten years after its release.

And the audio quality is nothing to sneeze at, either. An excellent demonstration of any sound system.Terminator 2: Judgement Day remains a remarkable film. Go in expecting lots of action and a classic Arnold performance, and there will be little to be disappointed with.

But I don't really count that because it was only a, what I call a worm coming out of the water. This movie has the T-100 walking through steel bars, changing into a police guard by just the makeup of his footprint, and when he gets shot, he refills the hole with his liquid metal.

As Good as Its Immediate Predecessor,"Although the cyborg assassin known as ""the Terminator"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was unsuccessful in its attempt to kill ""Sarah Connor"" (Linda Hamilton) in the last film, a new model called a ""T-1000"" (Robert Patrick) has since been built and sent back from the future with an entirely different target in mind--Linda's teenage son ""John Connor"" (Edward Furlong). This time, however, rather than sending a human to intercept this cyborg killing machine, the human resistance sends back a cyborg assassin of their own which has the exact same features of the one sent previously to kill Sarah Connor. But rather than performing its normal function as an assassin, this particular ""Terminator"" (played again by Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been reprogrammed to function as a bodyguard instead. The only question, however, is whether this obsolescent model is even capable of stopping the almost indestructible T-1000 from accomplishing its mission. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was one of those rare sequels that turned out to be just as good--if not better--than its immediate predecessor. The CGI was better, and the action was just as intense. So, viewers who enjoy action movies should have no problem with this one. Admittedly, there were a couple of action scenes that were somewhat repetitious. But I suppose that's to be expected in a film of this sort.

"Perhaps a tad overrated, but an impressive and entertaining action film nonetheless.","This film was released 20 years ago now, and looking on it now, it's still amazing they managed to make this then. Computer generated effects were not nearly as prevalent or as easy to pull off as they are today, and because of these facts, this movie is a really interesting piece of cinema history. And at the time, the effects were amazing, sort of like how many feel about Avatar today, but is this film really one of the best of all time? I'm going to say no, and in addition to that, the original Terminator which was done on a much smaller budget is a better film.So, it's been 13 years since the first Terminator, and Sarah Connor is now in an insane asylum after all of her nonsensical ramblings of Terminators got too much for people. Her son John Connor is living in a foster home and he's now a hoodlum. To top off all these wacky family dynamics, a reprogrammed Terminator is sent back in time to protect John, who, in the future, is the leader of the war against the machines. Sent to kill John is a T-1000 model shape shifter Terminator disguised cleverly as Robert Patrick in a cop uniform. After various plot developments, Sarah Connor decides she must assassinate the man who created the original Terminator so all of this could end. Chaos ensues.To start with the positives, this movie has some awesome action scenes. A motorcycle/bus chase in a drainage ditch is a pretty cool way to kick start the action in this picture. The special effects for the time are amazing, and still today, they look good. The characters are likable enough to get the audience rooting for them. Even Arnie as a robot gained audience support in his programmed quest. The movie at times, is funny, and many one liners that might have come off as corny, come off as tongue and cheek amusing. The final 20 minutes or so of the film are really good, and make up mostly for the middle lag. And Robert Patrick plays an excellent villain. His uncaring stare is very menacing.The negatives...well, how about that John Connor? Edward Furlong gave a good performance, but, perhaps they could've given the kid less corny lines of dialogue. From time to time, the kid came off as irritating, completely due to the dialogue he had to work with. The first half of the movie is really good, and action packed, and interesting to see how Sarah copes with living in the nut house. When Sarah decides to go kill Terminator creator Miles Dyson, the film goes downhill. Why exactly? Hard to say. Sarah Connor is only doing what she can to save the world, but she becomes somewhat unlikable here, and after the long opening where she and John meet up for the first time in several years, she leaves again. And she didn't even seem that happy to see her son, the supposed ""savior of the human race"" to begin with. It almost seemed as though when the T-1000 went off for long periods of time, the movie became slightly less interesting. And I'm not one who wanted Mr. Patrick on screen all the time, it just wasn't as exciting, and the characters weren't well written enough for the amount of time they were given for development (except for Arnold).The only specific scene that really irritated me was when John called for help as the Terminator grabbed him. He's screaming for help, and then when two guys come up to help, John chews them out. What a little punk. This boy who cries wolf better watch out or he's going to get killed by people trying to help him. This scene actually mars John's character a bit, but perhaps I'm just venting my extreme dislike of him pointlessly being a jerk.Overall, this is a great action film...meaning the action scenes were mostly great. The movie lags a bit in the middle, and the writing isn't as good as it could be (writing is clearly not one of Mr. Cameron's strong points), but overall, this is one interesting film. A must see for fans of Arnold, or fans of James Cameron. I liked the first Terminator better because it almost played as a character piece, while this is pure action. Either way, these two movies make for an interesting contrast, and definitely should be watched.My rating: *** out of ****. 150 mins. R for violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The one interesting idea is Hamilton's supposed conversion to non-violence, but this, like every other idea in the movie, is not thought through to its consequences. Indeed, there is a wholehearted enjoyment of explosive, slamming special effects which flatly contradicts this claim of turning away from violence, and makes the insistence that no humans be hurt seem, if not hypocritical, at least delusional.  Certainly this movie will not prevent its many fans from gleefully watching other action films where humans are blown apart and chopped to pieces.Probably the scariest aspect of the whole movie is that Terminator 2 is actually one of the best action blockbusters of the last couple of decades.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best film of all time,Superior to the first episode in every single way. In this episode a cyborg (T-800) is sent back in time to protect a 10-year old boy named John Connor. He will be the future leader of humanity that tries to resist the relentless killing machines. This action/sci-fi masterpiece is extremely cool but most importantly very smart. It is also very emotional and artistic. The words artistic and emotional don't apply to any other action movie but only to this timeless James Cameron masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Where terminator should had stopped.,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day, what could I say that it hasn't been said before for this masterpiece of action, science fiction and technological innovation? The film has it all and then some. But having already review the rest of the series I believe it is time to close with these movies and what better closing than the best?In short, for those who haven't seen it yet ( what were you doing in the past two and a half decades? ), we again follow Sara Conor ,who after the events of the first flick has become a total bad-ass amazon in order to prepare her son of the incoming apocalypse and then come not one but Terminator and one of then is seriously up-gated. So it is up to our heroes to survive.As for the actors everyone does an excellent job ,but Linda Hamilton is the greatest surprise for she changed markedly and now is unrecognizable, as for her son Edward Furlon is awesome to his role and it is a shame that after this role and American History X, he hasn't made a decent career, for real you had the potential to be a 5 star actor and you drop it!! As for the original Terminator, Arnie was amazing ,but a part of me feel disappointed that after that role he has become a parody of himself, pity but a bit expected, he isn't Stallone who has some talent, Mr. Governor made unfortunately a career on his muscles and he got old he couldn't continue.And not the the focus of the film the effects,even now in 2017 still amazing, will CGI seeming new and with many practical effects and stunts, with some of them for real putting the actors or the stunt doubles in danger. Ahh, well ,this why these kind of films always rock for everyone is giving his best for his role and doesn't use chip tricks.All in all in retrospective the series should has ended here and all would fine and good, but greed came in and had to ruin everything. Highly recommended and a must watch to everyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"One of greatest sci-fi films, ever!","Terminator 2 is one of few exceptional sci-fi films in the late 20th century. The writing, storyline, and casting were superb. There is little you can add or takeaway from this film that would have made it better. Rarely have I seen a sequel eclipse the original. Especially when the original is a great film for its time.Terminator 2 displays how to produce a truly fulfilling science fiction film. I can watch this movie yet again and be just as enthralled as I was the first time I saw it. What an amazing film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I love this.,"First sequel I've seen that impressed me as much as the first! The Acting- Edward Furlong is amazing in his film debut, although some of his normal speaking lines didn't sound as good all his screams and cries were so well done (his voice cracking from puberty helped him quite a bit). Linda Hamilton- Looking mildly like she had taken steroids, still impresses as a changed Sarah Conner. Robert Patrick is, I think, the scariest terminator out there. He hardly says anything but still terrifies. And Arnie.. well he's always been the terminator.Direction- James Cameron is always amazing with pyrotechnics, stunts and everything. Perfect. The special effects are amazing, even by todays standards.The Script- Moving, funny it's got everything.So, I give it a 10/10, also see the Special Extended Edition, the added scenes are great, (not to mention Michael Beihn returning for a small scene) - Hannah S. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Class apart from the rest...,"Terminator II, is without doubt the best action movie out there... The reason why this movie is SO MUCH BETTER than ordinary action flicks is because the villain (Robert Patrick plays the liquid terminator) is really tough. In fact, much tougher than Arnie. Unlike, ordinary action flicks where the villain is just literally blown away.Arnie is really stretched to the fullest and beyond to get rid of this guy. This is what really keeps you stuck at the edge of your seat throughout the movie, and as far as I remember, there is no other movie that kept me at the edge of my seat from starting to end like this one.Bottom line: If you have not seen this movie, you have got to be joking!

Great Action!,"First of all, back in 1991, this was the ""ultimate"" movie with spectacular f/x and action sequences. Nowadays, the movie does not look dated and still manages to shock me with it's surreal nightmarish post-apocalytic settings and monstruous robot action.The f/x are great, great but that's not the best thing about the movie; ""Terminator 2"" spends a lot of effort on the fantastic plot and character development. There's no need of extreme use of f/x because the characters have interesting backgrounds and you really get into them. The plot is simply great. It's a futuristic tale involving the end of the world at the hands of technology and at the same time, a war between humans and machines.The action is non-stop and lets you wanting for more. I couldn't have enough of Arnold and co., spectacular guns, amazing explosions, and memorable chasing sequences on the freeway, motorcycle, etc. This movie ranks high on the fun factor and entertaining factors.Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a kickass performance. Every time he says ""Hasta la Vista Baby!"", ""No Problema"", and the other trademark lines my skin crawls. It's part of pop culture and fits perfect for the movie's feeling. Linda Hamilton who is sexy as hell delivers a brave and solid performance. Special mention for Edward Furlong who delivers a great performance. But Robert Patrick steals the show as the villain. He was impressive.James Cameron created one of the best movies of all time and brings us the best possible action ever seen on movies. Also, there's room for glorious gore and non stop violence.Not else much to say but, I truly recommend it for everyone. It's one of those movies that will change your point of view towards cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The perfect movie.,"This is the perfect movie. It has always been my favorite movie because of everything about it. I'm a big 80s movies fan, and I believe this tops them all. Terminator 2: Judgement day follows Sarah, John and their pet/friend/father figure Terminator. In all honesty, I have a hard time liking John Conner because of his bratty attitude and terrible haircut, but the movie is so good that I can get past the unlikable character and still enjoy the movie. If you're a fan of this movie you'll know that the extended version of this movie makes it 1000000 times better! My favorite scenes were the Terminator and John bonding. I'm not the biggest fan of the action compared to these scenes. I wish there were more of that in and not in the extended version. There are a few cringe worthy scenes because of the acting, but most scenes are well thought out, and have emotion in the acting. I was born in the 2000s, and I still find the movies special affects ok. (Accept for the scene where the T-800 jumps off the truck. Oof.) the ending was good too. I liked the first Terminator bit if that's a classic, this is a masterpiece. Terminator 3, in my opinion as a Terminator fan, is not worth the watch. It messes up the timeline. Watch this movie!!!!

A Flawless Visual Masterpiece,"1991, James Cameron releases his sequel to the 1984 hit, The Terminator. This was an amazing film for then, and sill is today.

The story is great, Arnold is at his best, and the effects blow me away; this is one of the best sequels ever, heck it's one of the best sci-fi films ever. Yes the Matrix is good and visually amazing, but it doesn't have what T2 has. The original Star Wars films are my favorite sci-fi films, but Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is my second favorite film in this genre. This is a definite film for any DVD collection, it looks fantastic, and if you can, buy the special edition. It has a newly re cut version of the film adding sixteen minutes onto the original film, which do not diminish the quality of the film, but rather enhance it.

T1 it ain't, but I'm telling you the music and the scenery and the quotes and the SFX, and the animation, and Linda Hamilton's performance, and Edward Furlong's performance, awe. T1 was a dry, and better film in my opinion because their was no comedy, ' bad to the bone' music moments, it took itself seriously and worked because of one reason, Kyle Reese. See, I alway's liked the whole sunset boulevared setting, and the moments in the desserts, because it gave the film great scenery. But T2's music by Brad Fiedel is what compliments the film superbly. I love the terminator idea, except for terminator 3, cos although nick stahl is a good actor, he ain't John Conner, and Arnie is too comical in this film. T2 is the most powerful and memorable of the three, and still stands its test of time.Peace - C dog.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Good sequel,"John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) lives with his foster parents, while Sarah spends time in a mental hospital. John spends his time doing petty crimes with his friends, but then something happens: a liquid shape shifting android (Robert Patrcik) from the future starts to hunt him and another, older model (Arnold Schwarzengger) tries to protect him. It is now apparent to John, that his mother has always been right and so, he must bust his mom out and try to kill the liquid man, before it kills him.Plot it self doesn't actually have any other surprises besides Arnold, who now plays a good guy opposite of his portrayal of evil Terminator in the first film. Rest of the movie flows in safe routes to the predictable, yet still greatly directed and thrilling ending.Special edition, which is 20 or so minutes longer than the original gives some funny additional scenes, which won't move the story itself in a way or an another, but luckily they don't effect in the overall flow of the storyAs for sequels go Terminator 2 is from the better end, still not as good as the first one, even tough it did bring lots and lots of cash.Visually movie doesn't show any weaknesses, even tough it's made in 1991, when digital CGI effects where in their early ages. It shows, that T2 had biggest budget of it's era.Not the most original Sci-fi flick out there, but still pretty good one, with lots of solid acting from everyone involved, mixed up with neat specials and action scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Mind-boggling,"Seven years have passed since the first Terminator's release. It was initially a success, despite a low budget. Critics and fans loved it, and after seven years, the 90's have begun and the Terminator is back- and might I say, better than ever.The movie picks up several years later with Sarah Connor trapped in a mental hospital for claiming that a 'terminator' even existed in the first place. Her son, which is the whole reason any conflict arose in the Terminator series, has now been born and alive for 11 years (although he looks more like a 14 year old). He's a foster kid (punk), and he's living the way he wants to. But he is soon caught in the middle of a battle, and this is what the movie is all about.The movie is well-done, with an excellent format, a dark and brooding atmosphere that sheds some light (and tears) at the end. Robert Patrick does even better than Arnold Schwarzeneggar did as a baddie. This time, Arnie is the good guy, a Terminator programmed to protect John Connor, and Robert Patrick is the liquid metal Terminator set on killing John Connor. His character is done to perfection with its CGI.All the action in the movie is spectacular. The first half hour of the movie is quiet, followed by an edge-of-your-seat car chase that will leave you breathless. More events begin to happen, and twenty minutes later, another action sequence picks up in the mental hospital. Whenever you want the action, its there and in your face.The next half hour of silence (meaning no action sequences), is spent developing the characters further and adds the third dimension, whereas the first half just gave us a 2-dimensional development. By the end of this first half hour you know the characters by heart, and now you want the action again.The next hour is basically all action, involving lots of car chases and battles. It's almost non-stop with probably five minute breathers in between some of them. The hour feels like only twenty minutes because you're having such a good time, so the movie doesn't really feel too long. They couldn't have set it up better.The acting was great; Edward Furlong's character was obnoxious in the beginning but his character got better and at the end he really proved he can act. Linda Hamilton was at her best; a bit darker and definitely more pessimistic, but you can actually believe she is a real person thanks to her and the script writers.There's not much more to say about this amazing film, except the action is great, the music is well done, and James Cameron gave it his all in this film. Not once did I find myself disliking any portion of the film. It's practically flawless, and because of this, I give it a 9.7/10. Nice work, James!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"As far as the plot goes, I have two problems.","Technically, this is a superb film that combines excellent sets with exceptional use of computer graphics and photography to create a better feeling than Terminator 1. However, as far as the plot goes, I have two problems.Problem #1 is this conversation from the first movie between Kyle Reese and Dr. Silberman: Silberman: ""Is that when you captured the lab and found...the time displacement equipment?"" Reese: ""That's right. The Terminator had already gone through. Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the place."" Silberman: ""How are you supposed to get back?"" Reese: ""I can't. Nobody goes home, nobody else goes through. It's just me and him."" Therein lies the rub, as the Bard would say. How did the second Terminator get sent through by Skynet if its defense grid was smashed and the resistance had won? Now, to be fair, since Reese came from 2027 and the newly touted year in T2 is 2029, perhaps the resistance was premature in their boasting of victory and Skynet was able to rebuild the lab. But you have to admit, since we are talking about time travel, it does seem like a bit of an inconsistency.Problem #2 is a bit more profound. At the end of T2, we witness the destruction of all of Dyson's work, the broken chip from the first Terminator, and the meltdown of both the T-1000 and the Protector. Therefore, if Skynet is never built, there is no Judgment Day, there is no time displacement device, Kyle Reese is never sent back from the future, and John Connor cannot exist. This would seem to preclude the making of a third film, but when logic and fantasy conflict, fantasy usually wins out.There are a few other problems with T2, but they are not plot related. Edward Furlong, who was introduced in this film, does an excellent job of transitioning from budding juvenile delinquent to accepting his role as the destined leader of the resistance, but he is the only character that truly develops in the plot. Joe Morton and S. Epatha Merkerson do a fine job of portraying a family caught up in unbelievable circumstances, but overall this film relies heavily on the special effects and much less on the characters of the story. Somehow Cameron has lost the vision of Harlan Ellison and settled for the box office blitz as the purpose of the film. Rated R for violence and language, I would have to disagree and say PG-13. Collectible as the sequel to the original, by itself, not particularly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Terminator played by Arnold is a ""good guy"" here(T-800), sent back time from the future to save and assist the young John Connor from the clutches of an even more foe- the dangerous T-1000(played eerily by Robert Patrick). Terminator 2 has become such an important part of popular culture (thanks to its religious showing on every cable network everywhere on earth) that it seems strange to imagine someone who hasn't seen it, or knows the most famous scenes verbatim. Terminator 2 is what every sequel should be like. But then not everyone is James Cameron.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Groundbreaking for its time -- a consummate action film,"It's almost unfair to write this review in 2009, a shocking 20 years since this film was put into production, where the future that James Cameron imagined is much closer than before and the effects he did with computers are now standard action techniques. Kids growing up from here on out watching ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" won't even have a sense of ground this film broke, and consequently their overall enjoyment of the film will be a bit less. I give this film 8/10 when it's deserving of more in the right context -- these kids might go lower.But even the lowest of budgets can be better than a digital spectacle with a better story. ""T2"" has that story, brilliantly taking its iconic villain, The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) from the first film, and bringing him back as a good guy. Genius. This time he is sent back in time to protect a 10-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and leader of the humans in the future when the machines they create turn on them -- not kill him. That job is left to T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is made of shape-shifting liquid metal. Today, that's nothing, but 20 years ago, T-1000 joined the ranks of Darth Vader on the villains list and there he still stays in the minds of many.Much like 1984's ""The Terminator,"" one guy from the future is good, the other bad, and both are engaged in the life of a human who is pivotal to the future. Wherever one goes, the other follows. The difference is that James Cameron has turned the weapons and explosives scale up to a 15 on a scale of 10. Hamilton, once an '80s party girl, is now an angry and muscular 35-year-old who goes crazy on people; Schwarzenegger's shotgun is now on the puny end of his arsenal.James Cameron wows with the action. It sort of erases his attempt to tell a story about the differences between humans and robots through the relationship between John and the Terminator, but just about everything with a motor or a computer chip in it meets some sort of spark-flying combustible end.Plus, it all looks better than the first. Cameron has much better models of Schwarzenegger to beat up and he weaves them in more cleverly. The make-up is also superior. Talk about a visual marvel for its time -- all the Oscars for various effects and make-up are certainly well- deserved. Cameron decides that an action movie about the future isn't worth making unless it breaks ground. It's hard to disagree with the man.The acting could still be better, but believe it or not, I don't mean Schwarzenegger. He's actually much better now that he's got the English thing down -- or at least intelligible. Hamilton's Sarah is just too angry and a withered shell of her former self, which makes sense in the context of the story but makes her not too likable. Furlong, as young John, is kind of a whiny and obnoxious turd who desperately needs his voice to drop. Neither matter too much, however, because Terminator is super easy to root for ... and they're fighting to save the human race in the future, which is cool.Nowadays it's sadly easy to shake-off explosions and action stunts in movies like it's been- there-done-that, but also in the age of the move to 3D and miraculous CGI, it shouldn't be hard for the movie-goer who appreciates today's groundbreaking technology to consider the same for a movie made 20 years ago.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A film that really outdoes the original,"3 billion lives ended on August 29th, 1997. the survivors only lived to face a new nightmare, possibly one of the best movies ever.Set 10 years after the original Terminator, Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) Personal demons have landed her in a mental institution, under the care of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) With this she has had to give up her son to foster care. And with a lot of Foster kids, John Connor (Edward Furlong) becomes a young criminal, but at the same time, he's developing survival skills and bravery for the future.One day, 2 terminators are sent back, one is a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) a liquid metal cyborg whose job is to kill John Connor, and a T-800 (Arnold Shwarzenegger) whose job is to protect John Connor. The 2 of them will stop at nothing to complete their task, which makes a great action flick that even today impresses old and new fans of the series.Where this film really impresses is not the story, but the Special effects, more so the beginnings of computer graphics. Millions of dollars were spent on them, and they proved just how far they could go for 1991. even today it's amazing to watch how realistic a T-1000 looks turning into liquid metal and moving through metal bars.Bottom line, I Strongly suggest you check this movie out.

Father-absent series: Terminator 2.,"The moment T-800 took John Connor with one arm and bosom-ed him against his leather jacket, I knew it's cozy, safe to be in there. Why? Because my dad used to put me in his bosom and ride me home on his bicycle. If all the CGI and camera work made Terminator 2 way ahead of its time, then it was the stubborn terminator who refused to die again and again made this movie nearly timeless.This review along with other reviews in the ""Father-absent series"", intends to explore how the absence of fathers affects people's mind and spirits, in and out of movies.Terminator 2 is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love to see movies. As an enthusiastic fan of the series I bought DVD-9 deluxe set the moment it's released. After maybe 3-4 viewings it again bothered me as what did I own when I say I have this DVD. Do I own the 120 million dollars of budget making T-1000 alive on the screen? No. Do I own the finest hour of Arnold's career? Nope. Maybe even Arnold didn't really enjoy being Terminator after all. What I owned might be the chance to enjoy being chased by crazy cyborgs then being saved by a father-like T-800. It was timeless to me because it was cemented in my childhood memory. 30 years later, when some teenagers buy it in some ultra-definition format, they may not be entirely impressed by the SFX, but they'd be very impressed by their grandfathers' definition of a ""father figure"", or someone with impenetrable chest and belly muscles, a willingness of iron to protect his family, and an unconditional oath of alloy to stick with you.In this sense, Terminator movies are not only mindless Science fictions, but also a crazy prophecy about our status quo. The prophecy states that we as mankind already failed decades before our destined nuclear holocaust, because in our hands something superior was born. The terminator as the movie portrays, have all the desirable male qualities: versatile, strong, disciplined, and favorably indestructible, blah blah blah. This also reflects how the modern society, how the ""here and now"" philosophy teaches us about man. We are put into jobs to provide accuracy, efficiency in our performances. We are put into families to be an effective money-making machine. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against Capitalism. Ever since my primary school, my arts teacher used to call me ""examination machine"" because he was angry to see my excellence in doing examinations but dull mind in painting. But for some reason, I believed man stands for something unique, something to do with the greater good, something only man can stands for. It seems John Connor's puberty was also a lost journey to find out about man.The savior in the movie John Connor never met his birth-father, he was raised up by a overburdened, apocalyptic-fanatic mother who's given him everything except a father. Though the later stories about him were all about an ongoing struggle as a savior he may never come to be, Terminator 2's story might just be the most important part of John's life. What he lacked in flesh, the terminator made him up in machine, a perfect substitute of father. Even better, in Sarah Connor his mother's eyes, this ""father"" is better than any father he can have because ""he will stick with John in any circumstances"". Sadly, with his magic ""neurological CPU"" and ""progressive learning"", the terminator finally learned about human's feelings and love, and in his noble action to self-destruct, he completed his dedication to greater good, thus completed his way of martyr.I don't know about you guys, but I don't have ""Neurological CPU"" and ""progressive learning function"". That being said, my logic would never catch up with the Terminator's logic, so I can't find the answer about the greater good by calculating. Guess as a dumb student who was a ""examination machine"", I can only believe such a thing as ""greater good"" existed. Unlike Mr. Connor who found out about the greater good on a terminator, I find it on Jesus Christ. Also unlike many people's presumption, Christianity had very similar notions with the terminator story. The one that stood out was man's failure to carry on the greater good. The Bible told us mankind has failed their relationship with the Lord God, therefore even this species is going on to exist on the surface of the earth, every one of them can't escape the final destination of death. In other words, they failed before their actual ""judgment day"" just like in the Terminator movies. The difference between the point of the Bible and Terminator movie is just the question why humans failed. If you are particularly curious, please find yourself a copy of Bible to read deeper about it.John Connor in his 20s, need the harassment of terminators in all genders and all models to remind him of the urgency of apocalypse. Without crazy machines tailing us, what do we need to remind us such urgency? Are natural disasters enough? How about pollutions? Along with our own personal pains, health issues, emotional traumas, political insecurities, these pains of human can very well be our gift from the one who created us, ""a flag of truth in the fortress of sins"" as a great man once said.

Entertaining Retelling Of The Original Film.,"And really, this is what T2 is.  Giving Arnold the Kyle Resse role the time around to promote Schwarzenegger's then newer ""good guy"" image.  But downplaying that, this film definitely keeps the entertainment and wow factor.It's T-800 versus the shape-shifting T-1000 in another battle for the future and the fate of John Connor.  A more buff version of Linda Hamilton.  A supporting role from Sam of ""Diff'rent Stokes"" as John's punk friend.  Lots of explosions, gun fights and chases.  And still remarkably good special effects even by today's standards.  Schwarzenegger has charisma.  His acting range is best in two areas, acting and comedy, and this film allows him to do both.  His cyborg persona's attempt to understand humanity ranges from funny to surprisingly touching.  The plot is a retelling of the original film, but it's a secondary point for the sheer entertainment value that's delivered from this film.There's not much that truly can be said about this film ten years after its release.  It's a landmark film in the sci-fi genre, especially for its technical advances with CG effects.  The ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD released last year is a ""must get"" as it adds deleted scenes to the film (The Terminator learning to smile is well worth the price of admission), as well as the ""extras"" book and all the ""Behind the Scenes"" information.  And the audio quality is nothing to sneeze at, either.  An excellent demonstration of any sound system.Terminator 2: Judgement Day remains a remarkable film.  Go in expecting lots of action and a classic Arnold performance, and there will be little to be disappointed with.  With a ""T3"" in the works, it seems that not only the future of humanity is uncertain, but of this franchise as well.  Hopefully they'll be able to one-up the standards of sci-fi again, and not be out just to make a quick buck.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A quintessential action movie - T2 is a sci-fi roller-coaster that defined an entire generation of moviegoers!,"In my book, Terminator 2: Judegement Day was one of those rare flashes of genius Hollywood bumps into every once in a while. From the breathtaking visuals (that still hold well after 18 years) to the maverick storytelling (kudos to legendary director James Cameron for that) and genuine performances by the cast members (not just Schwarzenegger's Terminator, but also Linda Hamilton as one of the best female heroines ever, as well as Robert Patrick as the ruthless killer T-1000) - T2: Judgement Day was (and still is) a roller-coaster of movie making at its finest.Plot-wise, it advanced the series' cannon story of the apocalyptic future where robots rule the world and human resistance is strong yet outnumbered. This time around, the robots send the shape-shifting T-1000 to destroy Sarah Connor's future-leader-of-the-resistance, John Connor, at the tender age of 10. But their attempts to destroy the human defiance is met with a precocious John Cononor, his mother Sarah (who has since the fist installment) has turned into a lean, mean, killing-machine) and the aforementioned Terminator (the one and only Schwarzenegger), this time being on the right side of the resistance.When this movie was first released back in 1991, I was a mere 10 year old child (just like John). I remember watching it twice at the movie theater and being blown away over and over again each time. If there was anything I was ever close to idolizing as a kid, it was T2 (especially Arnold Schwarzenegger). I remember later dressing up as The Terminator for Purim and hanging a very big poster of the film over my bed. Those were good times, and i'm sure current-day viewers will have a positive experience watching this as well.P.S. - I also liked T3, but it was less loyal to the first two, which marked it a lesser film in my book (although it did include one of my favorite endings ever).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A great, fun sci-fi flick","Normally I eschew sequels, but I make occasional exceptions in the sci-fi genre.  And James Cameron makes the most of it on this roller-coaster action thriller.  I'm also not the type to see a movie simply for the special effects, but when they are exceptional, as they are here, I enjoy them.  The story is really what is good here however, and doesn't detract from the outstanding original.The film does have a couple of debatable aspects, namely the maudlin ending and parts when the cyber-guys don't act like machines (facial expressions when alone and obviously meant to impress the audience since no humans are around on the screen---and why oh why I ask you doesn't the bad Terminator just run after the victims in the plant at the end instead of just ominously walking?).  But I am more than willing to forgive those detractors as they add to the allure of the movie.  Overall an enjoyable piece of sci-fi filmmaking.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

It's quite the spectacle,"They couldn't kill his mom so now Skynet has sent a new Terminator back through time to kill John Connor, now ten years old. Well somewhere around ten years old anyway, the Terminator franchise has never been particularly good at establishing a timeline and sticking to it. Anyhow, as was the case the first time when Sarah Connor was the target, the new Terminator has not come back through time alone. The future human resistance has sent back someone to protect the Terminator's target. Of course the leader of that future resistance is John Connor. The Terminator's target is John Connor. So yes, John Connor has sent someone back though time to save John Connor. The first time around John sent a human back to save his mom and, no small detail this, ensure he would be conceived in the first place. Which makes very little sense if you think about it so I guess the best advice is don't think about it. Anyhow this time John doesn't send back a human to stop the Terminator. He sends back another Terminator. Oh, this is going to be good. Two Terminators from the future, a good one and a bad one, running amuck in Los Angeles. Lots of gunfights, lots of explosions, lots of beautiful mayhem.Arnold Schwarzenegger of course returns as the Terminator...with a twist. He's not the cold, ruthless killing machine of the first film. He's the good guy, John's protector. And he has more than met his match in the new and improved Terminator, the T-1000. If you thought the first film's Terminator was indestructible wait until you get a load of this thing. Shapeshifting liquid metal polyalloy, the T-1000 is an unstoppable villain. Robert Patrick, ordinary looking guy, plays the part of the T-1000 and manages to be more fearsome than big, bad Arnold ever was. But Arnold puts up a good fight. And, much more so than in the first film, Arnold actually gets to act. This time around his Terminator's got some heart to him. He's learning. He's almost...human.The conflict between the two Terminators is set up to be something spectacular and right from their first interaction the film doesn't disappoint. Schwarzenegger and Patrick both embody their killing machines wonderfully and, with the T-1000, the film's by now legendary visual effects add so much to the proceedings. Full marks to director James Cameron and his effects team for so brilliantly and seamlessly integrating their dazzling effects into the picture. They set the standard for generations to come.The film is not without its flaws. Edward Furlong never entirely convinces as young John Connor. Furlong gives a performance which gives off a spoiled brat vibe. Often it's very hard to see John Connor, as he is portrayed here, as a future leader of humankind. Furlong was new to the whole acting thing at the time and it shows. Throughout history we've seen plenty of mature film performances from child actors. This is not one of them. Linda Hamilton, again playing Sarah Connor, has a much harder edge to her than she did in the first film. Perhaps a little too hard of an edge at times one might feel but it's understandable for what the character has been through and for what she knows of the doomsday future. The two Terminators and John and Sarah are left to pretty much drive the plot forward by themselves, other characters serve as little more than window dressing. And at times the four main characters aren't enough to really keep the film moving along. Things sometimes get bogged down as we wait for the next inevitable confrontation between our two killing machines. Of course when those confrontations do come they are spectacular. Terminator 2 was in many ways a revolutionary film and, though not perfect, it is an enjoyable one. And for whatever quibbles you may have with the film there is no denying that it is a rather awesome spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

All time great sequel,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day explores fresh ideas whilst still delivering the action packed thrills of the original on a much larger scale. It's one of the best sequels of all time that confirms James Cameron as one of the greatest filmmakers for large scale action as well as a deeply emotional storyteller.Arnold Schwarzenegger is even better here, maintaining that robotic presence but this time he's given the chance to mature emotionally and use some of that movie star charm. Edward Furlong is always endearing as John Connor and the bond he has with the T-800 and his mum allows Cameron to explore his preoccupations with parenthood yet again.Robert Patrick is an eerily effective villain, his ability to communicate the terrifying nature of an emotionless killing machine with minimal dialogue is perfect. Linda Hamilton brings completely new dimensions to Sarah Connor, burdened with the gift of knowledge and trying so hard to maintain her humanity.James Cameron's direction is phenomenal, it's everything he excels at. Action that balances breathtaking practicality with groundbreaking CG and practical effects that doesn't stop once the initial chase starts. The score by Brad Fiedel is amazing, haunting with a metallic nature to it but a sense of humanity as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best sequel ever to grace cinema,"After the success of The Terminator in 1984, a sequel was possible but not really needed. But in 1991, the summer blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released and critics and audiences were amazed. Terminator 2 is often considered superior to the original film and quite better than Bruno Mattei's version of Terminator 2 (which I didn't know existed until a few months ago). The film is often considered one of the best action films of all time and one of the best sequels of all time. The film had a massive budget of about $100 million and made nearly fives times the amount back making it a box office hit.The film is set in 1995 where our main character John Connor lives with his foster parents. Skynet sends another Terminator (played by Robert Patrick) to terminate John Connor. But, the human resistance sends a protector in the form of a reprogrammed T-800 (played by Schwarzenegger). The film also features the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor who in this film is in a mental institution.While the story is a bit of a repeat of the first film, this film adds a lot of new things into the film that make the story better than the first. This film tends to be more action heavy than the first film which works in this films favor. The action scenes are all so badass and memorable that they give this film an identity. Throw in the state of the art special effects and you have some of the most beautiful action scenes that ever graced cinema. The CG effects on the T-1000 still hold up to this day and is quite funny to see how the sequels' effects just went downhill after this film. The acting is superb and, like everything else in this film, is better than the original. I love the relationship between the T-800 and John and is possibly one of the best friendships to ever (again) grace cinema. I love every scene with these two and it just makes the ending of the film even more emotional which is a truly amazing ending. Robert Patrick is truly menacing as the shapeshifting T-1000. (Though why does the T-1000 stick to the police disguise?) Edward Furlong surprisingly does an amazing job as John Connor and do remember this was Furlong's first film and possibly best. Brad Fiedel returns with the soundtrack to this film and, once again, it is superior to the original. It certainly fits this film due to the tone of the film much like the original soundtrack did for the first film. The main theme combined with the opening credits scene is fantastic. I can listen to this soundtrack over and over again. Plus, Guns N Roses has a song in this film! The length of this film is considerably longer being at over two and a half hours and like the original film, every scene manages to hold my attention and this film had better or it wouldn't be a good action film. We have a bigger sense of dread for humanity in this film and it is kind of sad.Now, I happen to own the Extreme DVD version of this film which includes the extended version of the film. The one thing that the original is better at is with the deleted scenes. In the original, the deleted scenes were longer and feel more important whereas the deleted scenes in Terminator 2 are shorter and don't feel entirely important with the exception of 2 scenes which include Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese and a truly funny but touching scene between John and the T-800.In conclusion, Terminator 2 is one of the best sequels of all time with truly spectacular special effects, action scenes, suspense, acting, and story. This is a film I have watched thousands of times and it never gets old and it gets better and better everytime I watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome sequel to awesome movie,"The original Terminator was a masterpiece, and a great example on how to make a great action movie with great special effects without a big budget. So when you make a sequel and get a much bigger budget, you can either make it bigger and better than the original, or bigger and not nearly as good as the original. Thankfully Terminator two is actually better, or at least just as good, but more entertaining than it's predecessor.Of course near the end we get the big plot hole with if they do mangage to stop the machine uprising, than John would never be born, and then a huge paradox would happen. Also John is a bit of an a##hole in the beginning, but he redeems himself. There are other problems of course but it's mostly nitpicking.The action scenes are fantastic, with some of the best practical and CGI effects ever. The pacing is perfect, that was one of the problems the first movie had, it was too slow at points, but this movie give you an action scene in just the right place so you don't become bored, nor does it seem like it's just a mindless action movie. The character's are likable, and at times actually pretty funny. And it does bring up good questions about weather you would kill one innocent man if that meant saving millions of other innocent lives.There are of course other good things in the movie, but I won't spoil anything, if you haven't seen the movie, just go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

My favorite action film...,"Sure, you may consider it to be science fiction, but it's not.  ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an action film in every sense of the word, for it delivers on the one promise that most action films don't: ACTION. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" has the most intense and audacious action sequences ever filmed.  Character development and plot exists too, although it is in a rather raw form.  The characters and plot are there only to give support to the action, and for that sense, the support is strong.  The film actually spends a large amount of time on it's characters and plot, but whenever there is too much, another jaw-dropping action scene comes along to save the day.  Note the helicopter and tanker chases on the freeways: if there has ever been a more stunning pursuit sequence ever filmed, please let me know.  Whoever thinks that violence cannot be beautiful has not seen this film.  The T1000, the villain, is superb--strong and intimidating--every film of this genre needs a good villain, for a good villain makes a good hero.  Ah-nuld, this time the hero, has never been cooler.  This was his peak, and he will never come close to making a film of this caliber ever again.Enough already: just sit down, ignore the paradoxes, immerse yourself in the action, and enjoy the most stunning 2 and 1/2 hour waste of $100 million bucks you'll ever see.9.5/10btw, the DVD version is the medium this film needs to be seen on.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is an exceptional achievement in cinema, directed by James Cameron. This sequel not only surpasses its predecessor but redefines the science fiction and action genres with groundbreaking special effects, intense storytelling, and a surprising emotional core.Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the Terminator, but this time as a reprogrammed protector sent back in time to safeguard John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance. Schwarzenegger's performance strikes a perfect balance between mechanical precision and burgeoning humanity, delivering some of the film's most iconic moments. Opposite him, Linda Hamilton transforms Sarah Connor into a hardened warrior, her portrayal exuding both raw determination and psychological depth as she grapples with her trauma and relentless drive to protect her son.Edward Furlong, in his debut as John Connor, brings a believable mix of youthful rebellion and growing responsibility, creating a dynamic relationship with the Terminator that serves as the heart of the film. Robert Patrick is terrifyingly efficient as the T-1000, a liquid-metal assassin whose relentless pursuit of John adds an unyielding sense of tension throughout.The film's special effects were revolutionary for their time and remain impressive today. Cameron's use of CGI for the T-1000's shapeshifting abilities set new industry standards, while the practical effects and explosive action sequences are flawlessly executed. From the adrenaline-fuelled chase through the Los Angeles storm drains to the climactic showdown in the steel mill, every scene is a masterclass in action filmmaking.What truly elevates Terminator 2 is its emotional depth. Beneath the spectacle lies a poignant exploration of humanity, sacrifice, and the power of choice. The evolving bond between John and the Terminator adds unexpected warmth, while Sarah's monologues about the fragility of human nature lend the story profound thematic weight.Brad Fiedel's iconic score further enhances the film, blending haunting electronic melodies with pounding rhythms that perfectly complement the tension and scale of the story.In conclusion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a rare sequel that not only expands upon its predecessor but surpasses it in every way. Combining thrilling action, state-of-the-art effects, and heartfelt storytelling, it remains a timeless classic and a pinnacle of science fiction cinema. Whether you're a fan of action, sci-fi, or simply great filmmaking, this is an absolute must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Is Judgment Day an improper title (meaning the end of the world of entertainment)?,"Franchisewise, Terminator II is of course a bridge between I and III. Entertainmentwise, it is merely a bridge from humdrum to nowhere. BTW Every other release is now a movie that is either a sequel or part of a major franchise. People complain a lot about the industry being nothing but reboots, rehashes, remakes, and sequels, but, as the box office shows, people are indeed pretty happy heading out to them. Why is that? I'm not happy. It is a taste thing (I hated Terminator II), but actually much more of a big picture thing. Franchises changed the Industry: Avengers, Infinity War, Black Panther, Captain America, Black Widow, Walt Disney Studios. Hollywood studios have always been a business, but it's in the last few years, where they have become part of big conglomerates, that have shareholders and must answer to Wall Street, that the studios have become risk averse to the point of only putting money behind big films. Nowadays, the studios only do award-baiting, artsy films, or 200 million dollar blockbusters. Most studios only look for blockbusters that can make more than 200 million at the box office, while there are no middle-cost productions, where new directors and actors can tell different, unique stories. In a nutshell, it is Money Over Art.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Sequel that Measures Up to the First Movie,"Imagine a sequel that is almost as good as the first original movie, or even better. That's not very easy to do. Most sequels are terrible, made only to bank on the original movie's ideas without introducing anything new.T2 Judgment Day is not an original movie because of its plot, or its idea but it is actually groundbreaking in terms of special effects. I do not like movies that rely on special effects alone for its appeal. There must be more to a movie than just special effects. And T2 delivers it.T2 is a special movie: This is, I believe, the first time CGI was used. Prior to T2, you could easily make out the image that was pasted to the film. The graphic image would stick out like a sore thumb, its contour easily traceable by naked eye.With T2, CGI (computer generated imagery) technique has evolved to such a level that creating any image and adding it to the film became possible. And this is done so well, there is really no way of telling it apart from the original film like you could do in movies prior to T2. Contour lines are no longer visible, they are much smoother and blend with the original film.As for the story, it is almost the repeat to the original movie and there are many parallel scenes. Again two characters fighting each other for the fate of Sarah O'Connor, wait, this time for John O'Connor (Sarah's son); that is one main difference. So we have a new character added to the story. We have a more sophisticated terminator, T1000, the indestructible liquid man - thanks to CGI effects. We get to see the character who is responsible for building the micro-processor that gave birth to SKYNET, the evil mainframe that declared war on humanity.One thing I would like to emphasize is the performance of Robert Patrick, the actor who portrays T1000. His acting is simply fascinating and, in my opinion, is the reason why this movie works so well. A lot of the people are impresses by the CGI, rightfully so, and forget to give credit where its due. Robert Patrick brought T1000 alive. Without his impeccable performance, the movie would fall flat, even CGI couldn't save the movie. His brute looks, his robotic but finely-tuned moves, his cunning ways were just what this movie needed.After T2, there were two more franchise movies, T3-The Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

You can not bring up the 90's without thinking about grunge rock, Seinfeld, pogs, ""No Fear"" clothes, Pokemon, X-Files, and Terminator 2.Aside from the impact it has had on popular culture, Terminator 2 is just one of those movies you can find almost nothing wrong with. Its nearly impossible to not like one thing about it or another.Anyway, back to the movie itself. The plot: A terminator (Robert Patrick) called the T-1000 is sent back to the present/past only this time its after John Connor (Edward Furlong), not Sarah (Linda Hamilton). The Terminator is also FAR more advanced here. Oddly enough, an older Terminator (Arnold), a recommissioned T-800 called the T-101 has been reprogrammed and sent back to protect John.The acting was all perfect, and the effects were top-notch. I loved the chase scenes and the future scenes. The movie had a little of everything to enjoy. Highly recommended for fans of the first.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This 31-old movie is still one of the best movies ever made,"Writing this review in 2022 - more than three decades after Terminator 2 was originally released - this movie still is one of the best movies ever made! And where a sequel is often lower rated, Terminator 2 is one of the few examples where the reverse is true.This movie is just a joy to watch from start to finish. There is not a dull moment in it. And the cast, script, action scenes, sound and special effects are all of such excellent quality that I personally think that this movie easily deserves 9 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Very Moving Experience,This is my favourite film of all time. I am 25 years old. I clearly remember when I saw it when I was 10 years old and the thing that immediately struck me even though I was only 10 years old was how artistic and brilliantly directed it was. The main reason James Cameron made this masterpiece was not because he only wanted to make money. All the greatest movies of all time deal with an important issue about humanity and T2 is no exception. It deals with how humanity has a tendency to destroy itself. This is a very important universal issue and it affects each of us when we turn on the TV and hear news about various wars happening around the world. This masterpiece works on so many levels that it's truly amazing. It contains some of the best visual effects and action scenes ever put on film. It is a thrill ride from beginning to end and the great character interaction and drama never stops. During each action scene you always feel that the characters are fighting for the fate of humanity. By far James Cameron's best film and that is saying a lot. It's much more emotional and dramatic than Cameron's overrated and disappointing Titanic. T2 clearly shows that James Cameron is most creative and artistic when he is making an Action/Sci-fi film. Anybody no matter what age will consider this a great film. It only gets better with time and I love it now even more than when I was 10 years old. Should be in top 10 greatest films list. A timeless masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Twice the fun,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator from the future, but this time he has come back to protect it from the T1-1000. This film provided a better look into that grim future the previous movie provided a look at. This movie had better action sequences and effects (that's to be expected when the budget is like $100 million and last film's was like $6.4 million). This movie came out long after Arnold became a big star, which was because of Conan the Barbarian and not because of the first Terminator or Predator, and he still gives great performances. James Cammeron once again delivers an amazing story that makes you sit in suspense and wonder what will happen next. Two thumbs way up!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
good sequel,"Terminators 2 is the follow up to T-1 with the continuing adventures of the cyborg, played with wry humorous by Arnold Schwarzenegger. John Connor is now ten and being trained by Sarah for his future as a leader against the enemy, skynet. A new terminators, t-1000 is sent to kill John, and in a role reversal, Arnold, the previous t-800 model is on hand to protect John.The t-1000 can change itself into different shapes and can also imitate humans. It takes the form of a cop and pursues John with murderous intent.The high point is a chase where t-800(Arnold) takes John on a high speed motorcycle chase from the new cyborg. Sarah finds out that skynet intends to create a nuclear war to destroy all of humanity. She and her son, with the help of Arnie, fight to the finish with the new villain.T-2 is much more sophisticated film then its predecessor and both are good action movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good sequel, though I prefer the original","There's no reason why I should prefer the first film in this series to ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Perhaps the original is more of a classic and a personal favorite to me. This sequel goes for more in-depth with plot and character development than the previous film. However, there are several reasons why this film simply cannot measure up to its predecessor. First, this is far more violent than the original. It seems that every couple of minutes someone is either getting shot, beat down, or thrown through glass. Also, I dislike the character of Sarah Connor in this film. She is shown as a far more aggressive and tough woman than in the last movie, which can be unappealing to many. The movie also drags on a little too long in the last couple of scenes and really could have ended sooner, with less action and fighting sequences. Nevertheless, the chase scenes in this movie are some of the most fun and exciting ones I have ever seen. After watching it a few times, it starts to become a classic. Most of the film's elements are masterfully done, right down to the classic scene with the Terminator entering as George Thorogood and the Destroyers' ""Bad to the Bone"" plays, as well as the well-known ""Hasta la vista, baby!"" Could be improved upon, but an enjoyable film that lives up to its reputation and a newer sci-fi classic.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Arnie's back,I always tend to avoid reviews prior to watching films and this really payed off with T2. The opening sequence is very much more dramatic when you have only seen the first film and don't know anything at all about the second film.It's about 10 years after the first film and John Connor (Furlong) is a young boy living with foster parents. Sarah (Hamilton) is in a mental institution as she struggles to come to terms with her knowledge of the future. This time we have two terminators sent back in time representing the machines and the resistance. Technology has moved on and whilst this was groundbreaking in it's time it now looks slightly dated. The directors cut special edition doesn't really add too much to the thatrical release and makes it seem slightly slow at times.Hamilton takes the acting awards with a good performance as Sarah. 8/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Awesome, awesome, awesome.","The differences between this and the first one are just night and day. The first one was good; very good, even, but this is just a whole other level of badassery. I'm going to have to divide this review into factions to explain it:The Action: The biggest feature here that everyone seems to talk about is the Liquid Terminator, or T1000, and goddamn if I'm not going to agree with them, because he is truly awesome. The action here is a lot of the time just proportionate to how create whatever the T1000 is doing is, with all of his metamorphic features. But there are still enough cool explosions here to satisfy me, too.The Story: A quite archetypal (and brilliantly told) tale of warning of apocalypse and action heroics, T2 also possesses an interesting moral qualm partially through involving human life and the intricacy within. T2 packs a little of just about everything, from action to science fiction to romance to drama, and it ties it all together in an explosive package that nobody should miss. There are a lot of cool little themes here too, like how the kid teaches Arnold things - and how the ""no killing people"" thing is carried through with such style - or the evolution of Sarah Connor's character from the first movie to this one, and all of this interspersed with the high-octane action makes for a hugely gratifying experience.The epic scope, vision and dynamics of this movie are just incredible. It does so much and yet never manages to lose the viewers at all like some other movies might. Terminator 2 is a superlative movie and definitely one of, if not THE, best sequels ever made. See it if you haven't already, and remember, you CAN change your destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"Terminator 2 is a very clear example of the hype becoming more important than the product. That's not to say the product isn't good, for it is certainly a better film than anything Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude Van Damme had been headlining at the time. The problem is that when one reads the commentaries after the fact, they expect to see a film that is as exciting to sit through as a ride in a Lamborghini down an autobahn. The reality is that for a substantial portion of its running time, Terminator 2 is anything but. Honor where honor is due - James Cameron managed to convince a film studio to give him a nine-figure budget to make a film, and it turned a not-insubstantial profit. That feat alone takes excellent film-making skills along with a good understanding of one's market. Combining this with the fact that Carolco Pictures was about to go bankrupt anyway, and the idea of publicising a film online was well over the horizon, makes the film's success even more extraordinary.The film slightly revises the story told in the original, but since this was necessary to make the new story work, we'll let Cameron off the hook for that. Not to mention that unlike the dire Terminator 3, the story still makes sense on its own terms. In essence, Cameron decides to put the machine created in his groundbreaking original against something so radically advanced that not even a machine designed to be invincible is assured of success in stopping it. Realising this new enemy was accomplished through a series of robotic, makeup, prosthetic, and computer effects. This is supposedly where most of the extraordinary budget went, and it shows. Sure, the scene in which we scene a Terminator with much of his skin missing telling a truckie to get out of his own vehicle was amazing, but Cameron really tops it here. When the ""get out"" line is repeated, we totally believe that it scares the helicopter pilot enough to make him leap sixty feet to the ground.The battle sequences in the film are exceptional, too. From the opening combat in the future to the small-scale duels that run through the rest of the film, the battles are exceptionally choreographed and executed. The absence of camera-shaking or, for the most part, far-too-close shots makes this one of the best films for battle sequences. The escape from the hospital and the siege at the computer manufacturer's offices are far-fetched at the best of times, but they set a cracking pace that leaves the viewer with next to no time to consider this. It is also good to see people spraying blood all over the place when they get shot, in spite of young Connor's ludicrous ""don't kill anyone"" directive. They could not have chosen a better actor for the new Terminator, either. Robert Patrick really gets the mannerisms shown in the original film down pat, and takes them to a new level. Although he is somewhat small compared to Ah-nuld, he has sufficient presence to not be totally overwhelmed by his massive co-star.Unfortunately, and this is what I have been saying all along, Terminator 2 is let down by a very tedious middle section. One could almost divide the film in two. On one hand, we have an exciting series of battle sequences that, while bridged by some dialogues, rocket the viewer along with a kind of glee. On the other, we have a film where Cameron wears his philosophical waxing on his sleeve, where the characters seem to do nothing but talk and talk. Not only that, but they often state the obvious in a manner that could be considered patronising. I am told that the segue in the desert only takes up about half an hour of screen time, but it feels like ninety minutes. This, and a daft, unnecessary, amount of effort to negate a future that seems already carved in stone by talking a computer scientist into abandoning his research, well, it works in the story, but one cannot help feeling that this film could have been pared down to ninety minutes without any real loss.In the end, The Terminator series should have stopped at one episode. This sequel is very good, but I just cannot help feeling the whole thing is redundant. One cannot blame Ah-nuld for wanting to return to the franchise that made him a household name, especially in light of the failures he had around this time, but one expects a bit more creativity from James Cameron. Still, Terminator 2 is worth watching once, which is more than I can say for a lot of other films I have seen in recent years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""T2"" review","In director James Cameron's first ""Terminator"" film, the story held that in the post-apocalyptic future of Los Angeles 2029 after a rogue super-computer called Skynet became self-aware and initiated a worldwide nuclear strike and waged a subsequent genocidal war on mankind, humans are on the verge of being wiped out by the machines that have taken over the world. However, a revolutionary leader named John Connor will rise to power and lead the human resistance to eradicate the machines. Since Skynet is on the verge of losing, however, it sends a cyborg assassin, called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back in time to 1984 to eliminate the man's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton).It failed.A few years later in Cameron's high-powered, special effects-laden ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" John Connor (newcomer Edward Furlong) is still a teenager, a wily and rebellious teenager, with the full weight of the future on his adolescent shoulders. Skynet, however, has one more card left up its sleeve: it sends another Terminator, an advanced prototype, the shape-changing T-1000 (Robert Patrick), to strike at Connor once again. The human Resistance reprograms another Terminator as a protector for John. It's only a question of which one will reach him first. So both Sarah and John are forced to team up with their cyborg protector if they are to avoid the T-1000 and the horrific future from which it came.Just to get this out of the way, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is in many ways superior to ""The Terminator."" Made on a significantly higher budget (at least 10x that of ""The Terminator""), Cameron employed many different ideas and special effects tricks that he couldn't do because of the budget limitations he faced on the first film. While I still hold that Cameron's original 1984 ""The Terminator"" is the greatest sci-fi movie ever - an unrivaled triumph of one ambitious filmmaker's fever-induced dream - ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a triumph of its own. Although for me problems arise with the setup and the repeating of plot devices from the first film, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" shows just the length of Cameron's vision as a filmmaker. His writing here, with William Wisher, is not as strong or as sophisticated as it was in the first film, but the ideas remain powerful enough to get his vision across.The film is still a technical marvel, though, with crystal-clear cinematography by Adam Greenberg and some pretty strong and convincing performances. Schwarzenegger, doing his best turn as a ""kinder, gentler Terminator"" (and surrogate father), does what could be considered his best performance as a machine, but for me, his best performance is that of the relentless Terminator from the first movie. Like the first film, you ""believe"" that he's a machine in human form. But here he's given a chance to learn as a Terminator, and not be such a machine all the time, which does allow for some touching and humorous interactions with the young John Connor. (I cannot believe I just wrote that about Arnold.) Hamilton continues the trend established in Cameron's earlier ""Aliens"" (1986) with strong female characters. Quite simply, this is her best and most memorable performance as well. She's one tough, beautiful, and formidable presence on the screen under Cameron's guidance. Like Sigourney Weaver, she helped to usher in a new generation of beautiful a**-kicking females. Most surprising here, though, is the newcomer child actor Edward Furlong. This is one of the most impressive debuts of any child actor ever, especially from one of absolutely zero acting experience beforehand. He finds the core of his character and truly brings the role of an adolescent John Connor to life brilliantly, and we're allowed to see shades of the brave future leader he is to eventually become.More to the point of why I love ""The Terminator"" and its following, is Cameron's vocal decrying of nuclear holocaust and the ascension of man-made over made-men. The first ""Terminator"" is a hot-bed of vocal opposition to nuclear armament with a strong anti-Cold War sentiment and the rising of technology in our society as we become more and more mechanical at an alarming rate. That to me, is what makes ""The Terminator"" such socially relevant science fiction. Unfortunately, though, this vocalization is much stronger in the first film than it is in the second one, which is more action-oriented (even though the film has received positive accolades for its horrific depiction in nightmare sequences of nuclear holocaust).""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a much more brilliant and more technical film than its predecessor, and for that I'm thankful Cameron was able to bring his vision to life with a capable cast of talent and special effects artists. The original ""The Terminator"" is still my favorite sci-fi movie ever and Cameron's true work of genius. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is still a brilliant exercise in high-charged sci-fi entertainment and nothing more.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF THE 90's!!! AN ACTION-PACKED SCI-FI CLASSIC,"""T2"" what can be said that hasn't already?Now I grew up watching bits Classic Terminator films & i love them both but if I'm honest i think the 1984 Masterpiece is my favourite.All i can say is it's one of the greatest films i was lucky enough to grow up with & i loved it & still do!!!I had all the Awesome action figures from the early 90's & i watched ""T2"" many, many times on video & what blew me away mostly about the Classic is how Amazing ROBERT PATRICK was as the scary T1000, the liquid metal unstoppable killing machine, his performance was chilling & he created one of the greatest movie Villains in Cinema history!!!Since then the usually underrated & under-used ROBERT PATRICK is one of my all time favourite actors ever.Also of course the all time KING OF ACTION, Schwarzenegger is fantastic as the protector Terminator & although he's a machine therefore still this emotional heartfelt beat to his performance & he's excellent.Of course also is the kick-ass hero of the movie, Linda Hamilton as the iconic Sarah Connor & she really gives it her all in a manic, energetic & powerhouse performance & probably the best of her Career?Everyone else is good in their roles & the special effects are AMAZING!!! For it's time & still special today. Stan Winston is the LEGEND behind that.The Music is exciting, Epic & Emotional, it's a superior sequel & movie & one of the times in Cinema history where everything just worked out perfectly & fit into place to create an instant CLASSIC.Love this movie, i miss the 90's & ROBERT PATRICK stole the show in my opinion!!!A true Classic, Masterpiece of Cinema with such memorable action scenes & moments that mean alot to us that grew up during the 90's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the Greatest Sci Fi Films of All Time,"Terminator Two is one of the few sequels that surpass the original. Intense action and Filming make this one of the best action flicks......T2 is One of the Greatest Sci Fi Flicks of all time, forget Star Wars and other movies for the kiddies that take place in a fantasy land, this movie is different for that reason, its not all that impossible, its what makes that opening scene so scary. A world where thermonuclear warfare has left the world black and macheines have risen from the ashes of that fire and have now begun a war against humanity. This is hands down one of Cameron's Best Films, Forget Titanic, this movie was his masterpiece. Hamilton is great, and the action is intense, to really aprechiate this movie, I recommend you see the Director's Cut, It contains scenes that make the movie whole and complete again, I highly recommend you also see the scenes that were removed from the final movie. One of Arnold's best movies too, He's been in quite a few movies, many bad, but this really his defining role, in the first one he was the bad guy, but its such a shame they made such a terrible third movie, T3 was such a letdown, don't waste your time with that waste of film, stick with the last two and you'll be OK.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The typing-error-with-muscles never did it better.,"This was one of those sequels - like 'Aliens' - that was superior to its excellent original. Far superior.For many years it set the benchmark in every aspect of science-fiction special effects and edge-of-the-seat action. Sound engineering aficionados tested their home-movie gadgetry on the basis of its tremendous sound score. Check out the moment when a terminator stamps on a human skull. You hear a heavy, ringing clunk of metal, a reedy crunch of bone, and a thumping impact as the foot hits the earth beneath. The sounds, in almost instantaneous succession, exactly interpret the imagery and the anticipation of the viewer. That's how it's done. It looks simple, but it's an art in itself.How to begin a movie about machines taking over the world? Simple; You demonstrate that it's already happened, with opening shots of multi-lane highways choked by ever-demanding vehicles. It's just what we'd do with robots - a theme taken up by the later and inferior 'I Robot'.Those few minutes of opening sequence are alone worth the price of admission. As credits roll we see a fire-storm in slight slow-motion to choreograph with the wonderful theme music. It doesn't sound like music for a horror film; it's a romantic composition that wouldn't be out of place in a Jane Austen period piece. It's a human theme. But slowly and surely, as the hideous muzzle of a cyborg condenses from the flames, the metallic tattoo of the original rises to dominate and usurp, foretelling human overthrow by their creations.A new terminator is on the case. This one's a shape-shifting mimic called a T1000. The 'Arnie' model is now old-hat. Once again this movie set the standard in CGI morphing techniques. Both cyborgs get to battle it out for the life or death of a child who will grow to destroy them in their future. Script is taut, brief and solid. Directing is flawless. Everybody acts their part with conviction - even the wayward kid. Violence is brutal and hideous. Destruction is magnificent. Trucks are wrecked as a matter of routine. A caterpillar-tracked robot of the future, briefly glimpsed in cameo before going-up in flames was reputed to cost $30,000 alone. It's a blank-cheque movie that deserved every penny.There's a poignant scene somewhere in the desert, where the heroine - played by Linda Hamilton - is seated in the balm of the evening. A westering sun mantles the world in a golden glow, kids can be heard laughing and playing, a Spanish guitar whispers peacefully. It's a moment of beautiful ambiance. But she slips into a doze and dreams a dream of nuclear holocaust depicted with such terrifying vividness as to be an object-lesson in nuclear disarmament. Everyone at Bombs-Are-Us should see their family depicted in this way.If you look close you may spot some faults; I didn't. And it's easy to argue about the logical impossibility of it all. But if this movie doesn't make you think and feel and wonder - then you must be a machine yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

There is almost no flaw to this movie and will stick with audiences for a very long time. Definitely worth seeing to anyone that enjoy watching movies should most definitely check this movie out. The villain this time around T-1000(Robert Patrick) is very intimidating and scary at times, in another words he is a great villain even if the T-1000 is silent most of the time. I remember seeing this film a long time ago during my childhood and it stuck with me.

"This is pure entertainment, this is what perfection could look like, this is... Terminator 2","Excellent. That's one way of describing what I call James Cameron's masterpiece. The original Terminator movie was kick-ass but it's sequel definitely kicks more ass than you'd ever imagined.The liquid menace called the T1000 is, for early nineties SFX standards a huge leap forward, even today the effects are quite seamless and still very believable. Watch this and you'll see the birth of CGI, the birth of a new era of SFX for films.Speaking of which, the TX from the third Terminator film will never come close to the perfect performance from Robert Patrick - Kristanna Loken may have had the help of even more improved CGI technology to back her up - it's the way you bring it that eventually makes or breaks you. And the T1000 never stops to make you feel comfortable, it's threatening from its arrival till its final morph. No, I won't give any spoilers here but the ending is totally different from that of the first film.

"Hasta la Vista, doubters!","Terminator 2The original Terminator, back in 1984, proved to be one of the best received movies of the decade, setting new standards for action films, and creating a defining role for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now, T2: Judgement Day proves to be one of the few sequels ever made which actually surpass the original in quality, bringing back all the successful elements which defined the first film, and re- creating them to a greater extent here.Director James Cameron proves to be one of the wisest directors around, as he takes what could have been a terrible gratuitous action movie, and turns it into one of the defining movies of the genre. The plot is paper thin: a killer robot from the future (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) who will grow up to be the leader of the resistance against the robot armies in the future wars against the robots. However, a different, more advanced model of Terminator (Robert Patrick) is also sent back with the intention of killing John Connor. Meanwhile, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escapes from the insane asylum she has been kept in, and gets tangled up in the mayhem.It's probably one of the simplest plots in film history, in fact, I summed it up to a friend of mine as ""Arnie is the good robot. The other one is bad. The bad robot wants to kill the kid, Arnie wants to protect him."" But the execution of this simple story has such an infectious sense of fun that the viewer can't help but love every moment of it. It's one of the few action movies one doesn't have to regard as a guilty pleasure, because it's regarded as such a classic. And after viewing it, it's no wonder why T2 has been widely proclaimed: ""The greatest action movie of all time!""Admirably, Cameron seems to know not to take himself too seriously, as shown with the opening sequence, as a nude Arnold takes out a whole bar full of bikers with the announcement ""I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle"". After claiming said clothes, he promptly snatches a pair of sunglasses and a shotgun from the astonished bartender, and is on his way, all of this accompanied by the song ""Bad to the Bone"". It really helps the film that it never takes itself too seriously, as it adds to the enjoyment factor, without any heavy life lessons being thrust at the audience. Cameron also incorporates numerous iconic shots, such as the Terminator stepping on a fallen rose, placing on its sunglasses for the first time, and the robot crushing the human skull at the beginning.The Special Effects would be considered mind-blowing if used for a current day movie, but considering the movie was made back in 1991, they should be considered nothing less than astonishing. All the effects around the T-1000's morphing properties are incredibly well done and 'real' looking - a remarkable technical achievement, which deservedly bagged the 'Best Visual Effects' Oscar. T2 also won technical Oscars for Sound Editing, Makeup and Best Sound. It's not every action movie that manages to win four Oscars - another reason the movie deserves its iconic status.But not all aspects of T2 are classic standard. As a whole, the acting leaves much to be desired - especially in the cases of Linda Hamilton and newcomer Edward Furlong. Neither give a particularly bad performance, but they each have so many annoying mannerisms, (Furlong's voice cracking adolescent screech and frustratingly blatant 80's haircut being the worst) that in many cases the viewer finds themselves wishing that the T-1000 would simply hurry up and kill them both. However, it's hard to go wrong with Arnold reprising his career defining role, and it becomes very clear that there was no better man alive to play a robot. (pause for comedic effect to set in. No? Alright then...) Schwarzenegger may probably have the least range out of any actor in Hollywood, but this was the role he was born to play, and every second he is offscreen, we desperately wish he was on screen again. Robert Patrick also plays a great villain as the shape-shifting T-1000. Though most of his part is dominated by special effects, Patrick still comes off as very menacing and dangerous - the perfect villain to counterbalance the equally stoic Arnie.So it's really no wonder T2 is considered the definitive action movie: the action sequences are superb, the special effects are remarkable, even for today, and there's this infectious sense of fun that allows the audience to overlook some of the movies shortcomings, most notably in the acting department. But all in all, T2 is a highly enjoyable and very strongly made film. Take it for what it is, and you should be suitably entertained. Which is all the movie really set out to do, so it can be considered nothing less than a rousing success. To all doubters of the movie's quality. I have only one thing to say: ""Hasta la Vista!""-9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I guess everyone who saw ""Judgment Day"" cheered for Arnie when he fought against the evil T-1000, using mega-weapons of which I and a whole bunch of people can only dream about. It's funny, however, to see that nothing can kill the bad guy. If you see it for the very first time, you get desperate in their place. T2 contains amazing special effects and more action than the first part. Too bad the whole movie is to much like the original one. I hate to sum up negative points about T2, yet I had to say it. The rest of the movie is OK. Like I said before: it's probably the best movie Arnie ever made - hey, this could easily be the best action movie of all time, and if not, this one has got a special place in my heart.

6.9/10 - An Improvement Over the Previous in Every Aspect,"*Note: this is a review of the director's cut*Terminator 2: Judgement Day follows Sarah and John Connor, 10 years after the events of the first film. The machines, apparently, sent one more Terminator to kill John - more advanced, cruel and merciless, he picks up where the previous Terminator left off, in order to shutter humanity's final hope. Meanwhile, John sent a reprogrammed Terminator to protect his younger self. How will this battle end? Is there a possibility for change, or is it all pre-determined by the greater forces of the universe?In my opinion, this sequel does everything its predecessor has done, only better. The action scenes are more thrilling and creative, both narratively and cinematography-wise. The characters, though not exactly deep, have enough of a personality to suffice in this kind of film.One of the best things about this film is Robert Patrick's T-1000. He's so *cold*, dude. Some scenes here actually have a light body-horror aspect to them, and it works so well. The stakes feel much higher, too, since the villain is much more effective and ruthless this time.There are attempts to touch the philosophy behind determinism and time travel, free will, all of that, but I think that they are rather mild in this movie. It never dives into it fully, only scratching the surface every once in a while. Not that I should've expected something else - it is, after all, a James Cameron blockbuster. It doesn't try to blow your mind with some hot philosophy, not as much as it tries to thrill and have dynamic, powerful action sequences. I just think that this film could've used more depth, both character-wise and philosophy-wise.Now, the whole thing with present John and the Terminator wasn't bad. It just wasn't as moving as it would've been if the characters were fuller. I'd say that they're definitely better written than how they were in The Terminator, but James Cameron still has a long way to go in order for me to be fully immersed in the character interaction.If I were to sum it all up, I'd say that Terminator 2 shows much improvement from the previous film in the series - it has fuller characters, much better action and cinematography, more creative battles and pretty solid flow. That being said, it still doesn't go far enough for me to be fully immersed. Maybe it's the surface-level philosophy, the surface-level characters. Nothing blows me away really, you know? Still, not bad. Nice, even. Feeling a 6.9/10 on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A hundred times smarter than its closest competitors,"This film has brains, an unusal occurance in action movies. Many of our greatest ""genre"" films often look like they are following that genre style, but incorporate a twist to give extra meaning. The ""extra meaning"" behind this movie is that those who have the power to kill others, should exericse restraint and choose not to.In Terminator 2, you'll notice the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenneger) doesn't kill a single person (he uses scaring/maiming tactics), yet the only people who kill humans are ironically, other humans. This idea is summed up at the end when Sarah Connor proclaims that if a robot (the T-800) can learn the value of human life, perhaps we can too. The whole plot follows the theme of ""save humanity from itself"", implying we are our own worst enemy. We also see Sarah Connor deciding to not kill Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) when she sees him up-close and surrounded by his young son and wife even though she had resolved to kill him earlier.The best parts of the movie is first and foremost the action, but the little details go a long way towards helping as well. One of my favorite small details were the physical brilliance behind both Terminator's actions. When Arnold had to drive the truck past the SWAT team into the building to pull out Sarah and and John, he swerved the car so the rear end would pull perfectly into the back allowing them to escape unharmed by the SWAT. This is just one example among many indicating the amount of work gone into writing the physical direction of both Terminators, and the logic involved really is just taken for granted but can be appreciated.This is a definite action classic because its incredibly smarter, on many more levels than other leading edge action films, such as John Woo's Hard Boiled. This film has brains because James Cameron is one our great cinematic geniuses. Get this on DVD!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I'll Be Back,"The long awaited sequel, T2: Judgement Day, was it worth the wait? Definitely! Is it better than the first? Not in my opinion. Is it still a classic? Hell yeah! This absolute monster box office hit took the world by storm in 1991 and to me is still the definitive 90s big budget (Sci-Fi) action movie, just as the original was very much an 80s movie this is very much a 90s film (in a good way, I don't view it as dated, it's of its time) and yet still holds up to this day.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton return in their roles along with some familiar faces from the first, and Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong appear in main roles.Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is no longer the target of Termination (her son is now 10) and she is institutionalised at a psychiatric facility under the orders of Doctor Silberman, in contrast to her bubbly upbeat persona of the first film, she is now a hardened and highly skilled warrior, frustrated at no one believing her as well as being denied release due to constant violent outbursts, determined to continue former lover Kyle Reese's mission and keep her beloved son alive, has to find an escape.Meanwhile her son John Connor (Furlong), a young delinquent, believing his mother to be crazy, is suddenly made aware of the importance of his existence (and realising his mother was not lying after all) when confronted by a seemingly murderous policeman (Robert Patrick), Arnie reappears as The unstoppable Terminator only this time he's been programmed to protect John Connor from a seemingly even more powerful Terminator (the liquid T-1000).A thrilling cat and mouse game occurs between The T-800 and Furlongs John Connor, and Patrick's Metallic Liquid T-1000 who has morphing abilities and immune to mechanical damage, how will they defeat a seemingly unstoppable foe who will stop at nothing to eliminate Sarah's young son.This is a classic sci-fi action blockbuster the pinnacle of its genre and one of the biggest hits of the 90s, and while not as dark and tension filled as it's predecessor (theirs more comic relief here and Arnies Terminator has almost been given a human makeover by the young future leader of the resistance), it is certainly more action packed, while I personally preferred the first (though both films receive a 10 from me), I can understand why some people prefer the 2nd, and these films are still held up very highly by fans of the genre, action as well as catchphrases galore, which many who were around at that time would remember well.Do yourselves a favour if you can and watch the Special edition Directors cut as theirs some great extra footage including a cameo from Michael Biehns Kyle Reese, a great film to rewatch once in a while too, so whether you've seen this or not, sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy, I've nothing more to add, other than this, like the 1984 original, is an easy 10/10, essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Memorable and timeless.,"This film is one of the action classics that has never left television since it premiered. And it is also a film that I saw as a child, and that I stop to watch almost every time it is on television, which happens regularly. It is also one of the rare and commendable examples of a cinema sequel that went far beyond the initial film and became memorable in all aspects.In this film, John Connor is a troubled and rebellious boy. He doesn't know, but one day he will be the head of a guerrilla that will fight for humanity in a war against machines. He discovers this when he faces a fearsome liquid metal killer, an Exterminator, sent from the future to assassinate him. But he will be able to count on the help of another machine: an older version of Terminator, like the one that, fifteen years earlier, pursued his mother, Sarah, and that he himself, in the future, will send to the past, aware of that it will save your life.If it is action that we are looking for, this film takes that expectation seriously: what it offers us is pure and hard action. And there are few action films that turn out to be so absolutely incredible. The film barely lets us breathe, and the way it develops is remarkable. We have mind-boggling pursuits in which a man on foot chases a car, we have shootings and explosions in almost every sequence and the sense of danger and tension that it creates is genuine and follows us to the end. Speaking of the ending... it's hard to imagine a more moving and emotional ending scene. In addition to the ending, the action sequences at the hospital and at Skynet headquarters are worthy of anthology.In this film, the star is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has built up an image of toughness and, in fact, he is tough like no other actor before him: he looks indestructible and has iron determination. Even so, there are moments when he gives psychological and emotional depth to his character, a killer machine, and that is enough to have a sense of the actor's quality. Linda Hamilton goes back to the role she already knows, but leaves behind the naive girl from the first film: here, she is a woman of arms, determined and with a colossal inner strength. Edward Furlong also achieves his most successful role here. He seemed perfect in the role of a rebel without a cause and has a perfect collaboration with Schwarzenegger. Robert Patrick is usually the actor that people stand out the least, but I think he was impeccable in the role of the villain and that he put a lot of effort in the role. Joe Morton, Earl Boen and Castulo Guerra also make a positive contribution in supporting roles.James Cameron ensures an inspired direction and achieves, with this film, one of the most impressive works of his career. Filmed and premiered in 1991, the film is extraordinarily up-to-date: if I didn't know what the film is, I could assume it is a recent production. Cinematography is magnificent, dark at the right times, and the sets and costumes are good. But it is the visual and special effects that transform the film into something even more impactful, especially with regard to the T-1000 and its liquid forms. They look like current effects, made with modern techniques. Before finishing, a word of praise for the main theme of the soundtrack, designed by Brad Fiedel and, undoubtedly, one of the most striking songs in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Sci-Fi in its truest form,"Not many films can describe the melancholy, brooding, metallic Sci-Fi futuristic sentiment that T2 does in virtually every scene. The opening L.A. highway scene (along with its slow, sinister music) is a brilliant signature that instantly and accurately sets the tone for this picture. Cameron teams up with the best people in the industry. 10 years later T2 is still in my ranking as 'one of' the best films made. Truly a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie.,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Cameron. Two ingredients that go to make a hell of an action picture. Cameron always seems to get that little bit extra out of an action sequence, something that's a bit different from all the rest. And Arnie...what needs to be said about him. He gets to use a mini-gun again, just like in Predator, but with far more effect.People have pointed out the ""inconsistencies"" in the plot, but that's just part-and-parcel of time-travel pictures. By it's very nature it's a paradox. So you have to give it a little leeway in the consistency department.Robert Patrick is suitably emotionless as the killer android, but I couldn't help thinking the fight sequences between him and Arnie looked a bit weird - Arnie is seriously larger than Patrick. But only a little bit. They carried it off well enough, though.Another minor niggle (now I've watched the film several times) is to do with continuity and editing. And that's the door to the SWAT van. As it's being chased along the street by the T-1000 (Patrick) in a helicopter, he fires at the van with an automatic weapon. We then see the door, with Linda Hamilton hiding behind it, firing back at the helicopter. The door has three big holes near the window. There's another exchange of gunfire, and cuts between the chopper and van, and the next time we see the door, it has loads of holes in it, but the three big holes have disappeared. Another exchange of fire/cuts and the van door is back to the three big holes only, again. It's a minor glitch, but it niggles every time I see it and ruins the scene for me now.That aside, the picture has everything you'd want out of an Arnie action flick. Gunfights, explosions, Arnie one-liners, the works.If you have a chance to see the extended edition it's worth it. Like with the Aliens special edition, it adds enough extra bits to make the movie more entertaining and worthwhile, but doesn't throw in anything that changes the plot much. There's a dream scene involving Michael Biehn (Reece from the original film) which is a nice addition, and some extra footage in the foundry at the end which better shows the problems the T-1000 had after being frozen.All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
decent,"I've been thinking and I came to the conclusion that T-2 is only a decent movie. There are some awesome action sequences. but the story itself is actually pretty dumb, for example the relationship between young john and the terminator is unbelievably corny, clichéd and predictable. people should watch T-2 and re-evaluated how good it actually is.but how about the comparisons between the scene where Linda Hamilton escapes from the mental hospital and the hospital scene in kill bill 1? anyone else notice that?Does not deserve an 8.2 or even to be on the top 250 list",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels ever made.,"James Cameron is a God.  He has to be.  There are so few directors that can make films the way he can.  In fact I would go out on a limb here and say that besides Spielberg ( who himself is a God ) no one can make films the way he can.  Terminator was a great film.  But T2 is really heads and shoulders above it.  Sequels don't usually surpass the original, but this one sure did.T2 explores so many of the same issues as the first one but it goes deeper into them.  It gives us more visuals of what a desolate future would be like after a nuclear war.  And it gives more reason to be pessimistic towards our own species.  "" We're not going to make it, are we? "" John asks the Terminator.  "" It's in your nature to desroy yourselves. ""  How chilling is that?  And how true?  As a sci-fi/action movie, this is one of the best. But this could also be taken on the same level as a horror film.  Just an incredibly expensive and well made horror film.What an idea to add to the first films paranoia by not just having Arnold come back to play a good Terminator, but to have the seemingly invincible T-1000 become the enemy added a whole new dimension to the film.This film has a bigger budget and it had higher expectations but it did not cease from being dark and intelligent enough to make us think.  It also has some great humour.  And Arnold doesn't disappoint, he utter the famous line "" I'll be back! ""T2 is a movie miracle.  It is so well made and enteraining while having a message that it is quite simply one of the best films ever made.  I love what James Cameron does when he is behind a camera and I loved this movie. It is a true work of art.  And one hell of an entertaining film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Just as good as the first,"After watching the first terminator film, it was no surprise that director James Cameron came back for another shot. But what did surprise me was how well this sequel was made. And it didn't take a few sequels in between to make it this good either. It was directly after the first.Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator (T-800) but this time he's on the good side. The whole idea of having the terminator switch roles was an interesting take. Because the terminator is on the good side now, there is so much room for character development and writer James Cameron and William Wisher Jr. made sure this occurred throughout the movie. To actually see a machine learn to be more human is always life changing and Schwarzenegger does it perfectly.Linda Hamilton's character, Sarah Connor has changed a lot too. We saw a glimpse of what her character had become. Here we see her doing much more: cursing up a storm, stabbing people and firing shotguns. Nothing like the Sarah from The Terminator (1984). Edward Furlong plays John Connor, Sarah's son who are on the run from a new terminator, the T- 1000. Robert Patrick plays this terminator and he's got a knack for it too. Patrick's eyes and face make a very menacing looking callous killing machine.The action sequences are also well staged, from scale models to live- action. All of it is believable and commendable. The special effects are the most amazing though, especially for 1991. This is beginning of CGI. The music by Brad Fiedel is also great too. It still sounds like the first and that's very much appreciated. Cameron has done it again.T2 is more involving and retains every element from the first film.

best sequel,"Honestly, I've seen many sequelled original movies, but of all that I've seen, one after the other, I go back and I say, that T2 is the Best Sequel ever created.I didnt like the first Terminator probably because I'm so spoiled by the special effects created in todays movies.They tried so hard to make it so realistic along with the plot of the story-which is excellent- although I didnt like that Future cop actor.None-the-less T2 made a MAJOR break through since the first. Now Focusing more on Character development and a stronger story that actually made sense abuot what the human race can accomplish can not only take us higher, but can also make us fall. That our success can actually create failure for the future.  A way better plot then all those retard alien or space movies they had at that time.The   LOTRs trilogy sequels, the Star wars trilogy prequels and sequels, will never surpass the breakthrough that T2 has made- Mainly because of one thing-  ORIGINALITY. LOTR is just a conversion from book to movie(still great but the Director was no the one that created the orignial story.
