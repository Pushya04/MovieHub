Love these characters,"Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) is trying hold this crazy family together. Her brother Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) is just released after his suicide attempt. Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker who is always talking about winning except he's a loser himself. Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is tired of his family, and has vow to be silent. Grandpa Hoover (Alan Arkin) was kicked out of his nursing home for misbehaving. Finally daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is so excited about getting into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.The reason this movie works is that I love these characters. I love everybody except for the dad. They are just so weirdly likable. They are the essence of an underdog story. I love this family, and it's not only for the cute little girl. I even love the VW van.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Best Film of 2006-it has aged extremely well.,"I am still shocked that this film wasn't nominated for direction at the Oscars and that it lost best picture to the overwrought The Departed. This is film captures far more of life as lived in single scenes than most films capture in their entire runtime. It is not just the great script that has great comedic bits and utterly real characters. It's not just the pitch perfect cast. This is a great *visual* film as well because of the traveling scenes and the quirky design sense.The direction is extremely tight. Whether it is how the opening dinner sequence delineates character and their relationships-via clothing and seating arrangements-economically or how they kept the interior of the van visually fresh the film is filled with splendid and meaningful images. I think the script and the acting are so good that people just didn't notice the visual niceties the film captures. There's even a couple of hard jokes to land-i.e. Porn in the trunk-that the directors managed to make work far better than the story beat does on the page.I think the film's theme around the cruelty of the rat race and the insane pressure we put on ourselves because of ""competition"" land better in 2022. Maybe I am just getting older but Richard is a bit of an jerk who did need to learn to chill. I like that the film isn't anti-competition per se but encourages us to keep things in perspective.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Bittersweet and almost unbearable, in every way.","I get so disgusted with Indie films about deep characters that have no real personality. Everyone says that they're real because they suffer, when really it's the audience that suffers most. Movies are not supposed to take two hours of my life and leave me feeling vacant and hopeless. I want to spend those two hours with good people who are flawed, like those in my life I love most.That's what Little Miss Sunshine has, and much more. In the beginning, you won't be sure whether you like anyone. By the end of the movie, you'll wish they were real so you could get to know them better. Their history and their dreams about the future. Bravo, Michael Arndt, for creating something truly memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"One Of The Best Movie ""Gifts"" I've Gotten This Year...","It is very rare to see a movie that can charm the hell out of an audience without the use of special effects, worn-out clich√©s and bombastic action set pieces these days. It's even more ridiculous to hope that you will see such a film for FREE. But that's exactly what happened to me tonight at a sneak preview of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.I ""discovered"" this movie right here at IMDb, having heard not a peep about it beforehand. By the time I finished watching the second trailer for the THIRD time, I was floored...and hooked. Luckily, the Bulletin Boards steered me toward the proper link to access sneak passes for tonight's showing, and all I can say is that it will not pain me one bit to pay for the privilege of seeing this gem a second time.Assembling the best and most unlikeliest of ensemble casts you may probably see all year, SUNSHINE on the face of it is a relatively (pun intended) simple story. Little seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) has one wish in life: to be considered for the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA. When her big chance comes at the most unexpected time, it's up to her unbelievably fractured family to pull themselves together and make it happen for her, no matter what it takes.And what it takes is a sad, painful, tragic and yet unendingly hilarious trek in a barely operational VW bus from Albequerque, NM to the Pageant. And although getting there is only half the fun and family drama, you have got to see what happens to believe it when they finally arrive and Olive gets to ""do her thing."" The strong cast sounds not a single false note, and when the more touching moments arrive, they don't seem forced the way they would in most other big-budget behemoths, because these moments are truly earned. But WHAT a collection of characters this is. Greg Kinnear is letter-perfect as Olive's judgmental, failed motivational-speaker father; Steve Carell finds new shades of darkest despair and human comedy as her suicidal gay uncle, a leading Proust scholar; Paul Dano does amazing things with little more than facial expressions as Olive's older brother who's deep into Nietzche and a vow of absolute silence, and Alan Arkin, though he has played this kind of role with both hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed, still shines like a crazy diamond as her cantankerous and hedonistic grandfather.And barely holding this motley crew together is Toni Collette, who amazes by playing a mother again and yet manages not to portray the role exactly the same way, (you might recall her Oscar-nominated turn as Haley Joel Osment's put-upon mom in THE SIXTH SENSE.) I'm not at all familiar with the work of the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer, Michael Arndt, but they have definitely raised the indie film bar with this effort. Not a single moment is wasted; not a single scene is in this film without having a reason for being there, and it's all character-driven. There's also nothing fluffy about it - commentary about everything from how twisted our pop culture can be, to how our drive for being #1 winners can blind us to all of the things that are the most important are all there under the bittersweet laughs and tears for the audience to discover.I can't recommend this one highly enough. And I can't wait to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A highly enjoyable ensemble road movie - funny stuff,"I saw Little Miss Sunshine a week ago at the Sydney Film Festival, and the audience I saw it with loved it. There was a lot of laughter going on - especially at the hilarious ending. And amidst the jokes it deals smartly with it's theme of the value of chasing your dreams and being one of life's 'winners' versus valuing what you already have. Or put another way, it celebrates the joys of losing in a culture obsessed with winning.I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, as the film hasn't been widely released yet. There are no huge plots twists, but I think you'll have more fun with this film if you don't know exactly where it's going.As the film started I wasn't so sure about it. All the characters (apart from Toni Colette's perhaps) seemed to be written as being amusingly quirky in a predictable indie-comedy way. But as the movie went on it became easier to warm to them. I think it helped that the actors appeared to be having genuine fun together. These guys don't feel like much of a family at first, and I wondered a couple of times why these people would bother sticking together, but as things progress the strengths of this particular family unit become obvious. And just as all comedies should, it gets funnier as it goes on. I was pleased to see the script stayed true to it's messages all the way to the end, and didn't turn preachy or maudlin. The whole cast work excellently together, and I hope this film has all the success it deserves once it's released.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Joy To Behold,"Conjuring endless joy & heartwarming feels by bringing together an array of flawed characters, piling them all up in a Volkswagen van and sending them on a road trip, Little Miss Sunshine is the story of a dysfunctional family rediscovering themselves & each other over the course of their journey as they learn the importance of being together through the thick n thin and reforge their relationships.Directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris in what's their directorial debut, this is a sensibly written tragicomedy that right away acknowledges the flaws of the family members yet provides ample room for all of them to help each other grow & evolve. Each one is intriguing in their own ways, and their interactions have an organic feel to it as well, which only makes the drama all the more effective & entertaining.The tone & treatment may be lighthearted but the story & characters packs enough dramatic weight & depth respectively and the filmmakers make sure both individual & collective on-screen efforts move things in the same direction, and the balance is sustained from start to finish. Performances are top-notch from everyone, including the young Abigail Breslin. And the climax brings the ride full circle with an amusing, uplifting & cathartic sequence.Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderful amalgamation of skilful direction, smart writing & heartfelt performances that promises a pleasant time to all its viewers and delivers it in spades. An impressive & promising debut for its directing duo, it is one hell of a roller-coaster ride that treats its characters' imperfections with compassion & understanding, and is effortlessly elevated by honest inputs from its committed & talented cast. Absolutely worth your time & money.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"""I'd like to dedicate this to my grandpa, who showed me these moves.""","I feel bad that everyone loves this movie and I thought it was just fun. I can see what they were going for, but for the most part I was felt depressed and a little anxious while watching it. That being said, Abigail Breslin is what made this movie for me! Her performance cracked me up, and the famous scene made it worth the wait.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More than a fresh ray of sunshine!,"Here is a film that lives up to the expectations of a very funny trailer. It's an oddball comedy, and it's dark, and it's funny, and it's touching, and it will charm the pants off many in the audience. Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser! The premise itself can lead to years of therapy for a family that should get a group rate in psychiatric care.Expert editing and superb comedic performances from all the principals involved will have many overlook the fact that the plot line is a little too contrived at times. The set pieces will have the audience howling with laughter as we see different characters trying to overcome some pretty irreverent obstacles. The scene at the gas station contains moments of deep sadness and offbeat humor, something that Carrell pulls off wonderfully, and none will be able to look at the trunk of a car, some dubious literary material, and highway patrol the same way after seeing the infamous scene in the film.The best is of course, saved for last, and by this time we are waiting for something outrageous which ""Little Miss Sunshine"" delivers unapologetically. A classic track will probably be recharged for a new generation, as the bonds of family precariously balance a moment that could be as tacky as they come.""Sunshine"" is one of the best things to come out of American cinema this year, an original film that relies on a script that understands the differences between generations in the same family. It doesn't explain why each character is as quirky as can be, and it doesn't build much background because it is not needed to make the film work. Kinnear, Colette, Abigail, Arkin, and Correll are a fine team and keep the film's feel fresh throughout the film. Here is a family that has no special qualities or powers, a family that will make us rejoice that creativity is still alive in Hollywood, a film that will provide us with plenty of much needed sunshine in an otherwise pretty dull summer.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"delivers in the most charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way","It would be unfair to limit the film to one adjective. But charming is the first one that comes to mind. I really don't know how they did it, but the screenwriter Michael Arndt and directing team Dayton/Faris (Jonathan and Valerie, that is) have managed to create a movie in which we are simply so connected to the characters it's frightening. This is a very quirky bunch, and while their traits can be found in everyone we know, they are certainly extremely weird and I certainly don't know any families who are quite as odd as the Hoovers. And yet, we forge such a strong bond with each and every one of them, right from the opening pre-title introduction sequence ¬ñ probably the best character introduction sequence I've seen since Magnolia. These people are just so real! It's unbelievable just how three-dimensional these characters are. They remind me of The Squid and the Whale ¬ñ another recent movie that comes to mind when I think of this type of character development ¬ñ these are just normal, regular people, and the filmmakers developed them as such in the most in-depth, well thought-out and just ingenious way possible.That brings me to the second adjective: Realism. If you've seen the film you know that some pretty wacky things go on in it, but in the end, these people are just plain real. They are real human beings ¬ñ at least we the viewing audience come to believe. If they weren't so incredibly well thought out and detailed and rounded, we wouldn't forge such a strong bond with them. But fact of the matter is, the Hoovers have quickly become one of the most memorable cinematic families. Their traits. Their flaws. Their dreams and ambitions. Their dynamics, mannerisms, nuances. Every tiny little detail about these people is just so incredibly portrayed.Obviously, it would be unfair to say that a comedy isn't funny. When Little Miss Sunshine gets funny, it's hilarious ¬ñ we're talking pitch-black dark and very quirky comedy, but it works admirably, reaching sort of a peak in the infamous, hilarious and totally wacky traffic cop scene.The acting is. Simply put, amazing. You won't see any Oscar moments here, no characters that have some particular traits that require various forms of ""method acting"" to perform. This is simply actors playing a bunch of people who they are clearly quite unlike, but playing them as if they are. The shining star is young Abigail Breslin, who out-acts pretty much all of her older cast-mates. How she can embody a completely other character at such a young age is completely beyond me ¬ñ and she's been doing it since age 6! Dakota Fanning, watch out! Paul Dano, the other young actor, also delivers an amazing performance. Myself being fresh out of that period of my life, I can say that his portrayal of a frustrated teenager ¬ñ specifically in the scene where he just explodes (those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about) is just so true and realistic. Arkin is brilliant as the old grandfather, who is at once quite annoying and vulgar and at once the most human of all the characters. The three adult leads also deliver wonderful, nuanced performances ¬ñ Toni Colette, who has quite a streak of wonderful performances in various films, particularly impressed me.But what makes the film so special is its message ¬ñ and even more so, how it delivers it. Basically, the film's message can be summed up in one brilliant line delivered by Arkin's character, Grandpa Edwin: ""A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try."" This is a family who see tragedy after failure after disappointment, and it's just so, so sad to see them so down, because we love them all and we know that they don't deserve it, despite all their flaws. Seriously, this movie is absolutely brutal to its characters. But ultimately, it's absolutely inspiring. Because despite disappointment after tragedy after blow to the stomach, this family just keeps their head up and say ""so what; we'll find another way"". Their determination and devotion despite all the obstacles in their way, and their ultimate removal from their anxieties and un-winding is simply and absolutely inspirational, and extremely heartwarming.The flaw of many independent films that carry a message is that they insist upon themselves. Sometimes it works admirably ¬ñ a recent example I can recall is The Fountain; it's undeniably pretentious, but by fulfilling its own expectations it works as a message film. Little Miss Sunshine delivers its message in simply the most incredibly, charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way you could ever imagine. It's just so¬Ö pure. And that's really the single most engaging and appealing aspect of what is already an amazing piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The story of a young girl who wants to be in a beauty pageant.,"I went to a screening of this film at Sundance earlier this year, and this is what I wrote about it immediately following:This was a little less indie, cast-wise, but was jarringly real in a way that Hollywood rarely fosters. The story is of a limply-functional family, whose good leg is dysfunctional, and of the way that their love for each other is solid, somewhere underneath the varying shades of crazy. This film. Oh, this film! I have never laughed harder, and at such true-to-life comedy--nothing silly or goofy or forced or fake about the lines. It felt more like watching a documentary (minus all the familiar faces) and every time the laughter became almost unbearable, a little dash of agony or melancholic sadness was thrown in, and spawned aching tears. I sigh still, thinking of how completely in control of my insides that cast, that writer, that director all were. They owned my ass, and I will love them forever for it.I can't wait to see it again. Do NOT miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An amazing cast where a 9-year-old is the best part - unheard of,"It's a big risk when you base your movie around a child. Nine times out of ten it will end in an annoying disaster. The likes of 'Home Alone' are the exception. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a rare case of getting it oh so right. Abigail Breslin was fantastic in this movie.Sure she has an amazing cast of adults around her. But in a way that only makes her performance even more impressive. She is not only holding court with them, she is often showing them up and stealing scenes.There's a tremendous balance of uplifting and heavy material in this movie. It's a feel-good, but it isn't afraid to pull at the heart-strings either. Very few movies find the intricate balance between these two gears as well as this movie does.It's taken me 16 years to finally see this movie but I'm glad I finally did. It is a treasure. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

No HUGE stars (though Kinnear and Arkin are famous and perfectly cast) This film has just great characters, unusual but perfectly understandable circumstances,fantastic dialog, wonderful actors,stunning cinematography, effortless direction and seamless editing.This film was very well received by the audience I sat with. I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried. I heard that this film only cost three million dollars to make...it just goes to show that tens of millions need not be spent to get a treasure. Go see it and be thoroughly entertained. This is one good old-fashioned movie for everyone over 13 (if you preempt the grandfather's language, which is really part of his character).

Probably the best comedy of 2006.,"Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy (""Cheaper by the Dozen"") or dark and abstruse (""The Royal Tenenbaums""). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is ""Little Miss Sunshine"", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.The title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of ""Signs"") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.But ""Sunshine"" is far more than the slapstick of ""Vacation"". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.""Sunshine"" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.Rather crude at times, ""Sunshine"" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.Bottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Vastly over-rated,"We all know comedies have their unbelievable moments, but if they are done well there is an internal logic that papers over the cracks or a cheery momentum that plugs up the plot holes. Not here, unfortunately.If the girl had been in pageants before, why were they so surprised at what the competition involved or what the other competitors were like? Why had they not taken any interest in the girl's talent routine? Why had the boy not noticed his colour blindness earlier, had he never used crayons at school?Then you've got the uninteresting, unsympathetic characters like the grouchy old man, depressive gay man, sullen teen...all stereotypes who grate quickly. You can't knock the fact the film is well-made, with a strong cast and some amusing lines...but Oscar-worthy?? No way.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Makes you Think!,"Most people have commented on the brilliance of the acting in this movie. I agree with all they said. Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin are as good as we would expect them to be. Add sensitive and characterful performances from Paul Dano & Steve Carell. Spotlight the amazing Abigail Breslin as a believable little girl trying to break into the Child Glamour Business through pageants like ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It was when I contrasted her less than movie-star appearance with all the adult-glam of the other lacquered and made-up girls that I realized the subliminal message here.Olive's striptease is an honest (but disturbing) expose of what these pageants really are. It's only when Olive's family join her in making this into a game that we can begin cheering for her while being horrified by the hypocrisy of the whole pageant-thing.A brilliant movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a big hearty smile,i entered the cinema after reading all these reviews thinking great I'm gonna see something that is great well it fell short of great but not by far. The most touching parts being the end which had me bent over laughing the whole time and the part between olive and her grandfather where as in the trailer it said am i pretty anybody who has a little sister cousin or child will relate to her as being what you would like your child to be full of life and while impressionable independent. i loved the ice cream bit and her clothes cracked me up one of the best parts was frank and the teenage son walking in to the pageant and walking straight back out again. an enjoyable film which will be remembered for its ending id pay to see it again :D,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ridiculously Overrated,"I have to admit, I was drawn to this movie because of the great cast and a lot of positive word of mouth. I watched the movie in a very good mood and when it was over, I said, what is the big deal? I did not laugh, I did not cry, I did not feel anything, except that I had seen this movie a dozen or more times already. It really was nothing special. Arkin's comedic performance was a rehashed role that I have seen others play. I remember a film called ""Flirting With Disaster"" which was kind of a road movie as well, it was better than this. ""Raising Arizona"" was much funnier than this. The so-called side-splitting ending with the dance to Super Freak was so tipped in commercials that you knew what was coming. Moreover, the dance just keeps going and going, it got so tedious and unfunny. I'm sorry, I don't want to be a cynic, but this film is just being played up way too much and I cannot believe that it was nominated for Best Picture, it was a weak year, but not that weak.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious!  I loved this fun, but slightly dark comedy","We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)The story follows little Olive, a normal child, who by a fluke wins her way into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The family decides they must accompany her in their old VW bus, so a road trip ensues.The final third of the movie, which deals with the actual pageant, is by far the funniest part of the film. It illustrates, with great hilarity, the frightening people who are involved in child pageants. You can't help rooting for Olive, who is refreshingly normal amongst the frighteningly plastic other contestants.(After discovering that I was in the (opposite of loved it) category on IMDb, I changed my subject line, because this was one of the best movies I've seen all year!! I LOVED IT)This is NOT a movie for children. After reading through some other user comments, I have to say I'm dismayed by the amount of people complaining about the F word. This movie is rated R, mostly because of its frequent use of the F word, along with some drug use. If you do 5 minutes of research before you go to a movie, you should educate yourself as to WHY a movie is rated the way it is. If you are offended by swearing, then, if you go to a movie that is rated R because of language, be prepared to be offended! Okay, I'm off the soapbox. This is NOT a movie for children.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A little sweet sweetness¬ÖLittle Miss Sunshine,"Keeping up with the recent buzz-worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. After loving crowd favorites Primer (2004) and Hustle and Flow (2005), I wasn't quite sure if the hat trick would be made. Sunshine seemed to have the cast, and direction (the debut of husband/wife team Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, who have helmed some of my favorite music videos including the Smashing Pumpkins' Tonight, Tonight and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Otherside), but the big question would be if it had the laughs to sustain the quirky indie comedy from not being overwrought and boring. While the film definitely has a couple moments where I was about to be lost, everything ends up happening for a reason; emotions are on a roller coaster ride and the lows always come out with meaning and momentum for the highs. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut-bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece.The co-directors set us up for what is to come in a very nicely designed opening sequence by going character to character, showing us each person in a small vignette of their personalities. This is the quintessential messed-up family with good intentions. Mom and Dad are bickering on how to tell their young daughter about her uncle's attempted suicide, while he sits and stares in a strange melancholy next to the mute, troubled son, (on vow of silence in honor of nihilistic mind Nietzsche), while grandpa spews profanities about the lack of dinner variety. I mean this is the epitome of every family function I've ever been privy to. There is so much a viewer can relate to in each member, allowing for a certain amount of compassion for the views of all involved and seeing that each really does want the best for one another, even if they have a messed up way of showing it.Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are wonderful as the patriarchs, proving as always that they are probably two of the most under-appreciated actors working today. Very rarely do you get to see them in a starring vehicle, and even though this is an ensemble through and through, they definitely carry it as the driving force. Alan Arkin does his kooky, quasi-angry, sarcastic yelling that he is known for, kind of his role from Edward Scissorhands but r-rated and un- pc. Everything he has done comes to a surprising result at the eponymous beauty pageant for the biggest laughs of the movie, really great stuff subverting the grotesque surrealism surrounding any pageant of this kind. Paul Dano is great as the troubled teen, trying to find a place in the world for himself, and coming to grips with the need for struggle in order to grow as a person, and Abigail Breslin is phenomenal as the happiest girl alive. Once she finds out she has won her regional on default, (those primary school children and their diet pills), she is on cloud nine as the family makes the road trip all for her. She has the acting range of a pro and actually does the Dakota Fanning, but better, as she can act while still being a young child and not an adult in a child's body. Her emotional reactions are spot-on and she has remarkable presence and a self-effacing nature that allows her to be who she is and not be ashamed about it, which is the main purpose of Olive Hoover.The real revelation to take from the antics on screen is a career-role for funnyman Steve Carrell. I've always liked his na√Øve, teddy-bear persona used to successfully in the Daily Show, The Office, and as the only funny part of Anchorman. Here however, he shows that he has the acting chops to not be pigeonholed and typecast in the over-the-top, lug roles his peer Will Ferrell will never be able to breakout of. Carrell has genuine talent and his suicidal, top Proust scholar in America, uncle is the shining moment of the film. He maintains the dejected quality throughout; even when doing something for the family, doing good, he is always a beaten man. That kind of character is what is needed for all his sharp, dry sarcastic retorts thrown about. He barely outshines the prop of the year, though, the family's yellow VW van. You will not see better prop-gags as the van takes a licking and keeps on ticking although the tick is faint and slowly fading away.Little Miss Sunshine lives up to the strong buzz that surrounds it. It is heartwarming and funny at every turn. There are some dark moments, though, as there are in life. This film is a slice of reality, heightened just the right amount, for all to enjoy. While definitely in the vein of films such as I Heart Huckabees, Thumbsucker, and any Wes Anderson film¬óit wears its indie cred on its sleeve¬óit is still accessible and hopefully with the drawing power of Carrell will garner an audience that would not otherwise see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A black comedy with a Little Big Heart,"The world of Independent film-making is definitely a tough one, as often the difficulties of getting a good budget or a good cast can become a difficult test to even the best directors. For that and many other reasons, it's always good to see a good independent films receiving the praise and recognition they deserve, proving that the support of a big studio is not necessary to make a product of high quality. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" certainly has been luckier than most Indies in terms of budget and cast, but it still is a modest black comedy that takes advantage of its own limitations and relaying only in great acting and a lot of heart, makes more than the hundreds of comedies the big studios make in a year.The plot is the story of the Hoover family and their trip from New Mexico to California, in order to take their little daughter, Olvie (Abigail Breslin), to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. However, the Hoovers are not a very functional family, the father, Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a neurotic motivational speaker obsessed with winning, so immersed on his book that is barely in contact with his wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette), and always is arguing with his own father (Alan Arkin). Sheryl is no less neurotic than her husband, and her troubles increases as her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a literature professor, recently attempted to commit suicide and is now stuck at the Hoovers' place. Dwayne (Paul Dano), Sheryl's teenager son, is the mute (by his own choice) witness of this debacle, as he tries to live enough to get out of the house and make his dream come true: to be a jet fighter pilot. The road trip will prove to be a test not only to Olive, but for the rest of the family.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the very first work by writer Michael Arndt, and for the most part he makes an amazing job in setting up what's basically a character driven road movie. Arndt's script may not be very original (and that's probably the film's biggest problem), but he uses the conventions of his genre in a very clever way, mainly by focusing on his different characters and letting them and their own personal stories to carry the main plot. This approach to the character development makes it so realistic that one can't help but feel identified with at least one of the Hoovers. Sure, it's an overtly exaggerated portrait of that dysfunctional yet lovable family we all have, but this delicious black comedy it's done with such charm and heart that it actually works, and even makes the story feel fresh despite not having a really original plot.This movie not only marks Arndt's debut as a writer, it's also the first feature film by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, a team of music directors famed for their work with rock bands across the 90s. It's kind of surprising that, unlike most former music video directors, their transition to film comes with a really subtle film that focuses on the plot and the characters instead of the visuals. However, this doesn't mean that visually the film is unpleasing, on the contrary, it features an excellent cinematography (Tim Suhrstedt) coupled with a subtle score by Mychael Danna and Devotchka that work perfectly to set the tone and mood of Arndt's little story. The subtle approach taken by the Dayton-Faris tandem succeeds in giving life to this charming story by letting the actors to completely own their characters and be the most important part of the film.""Little Miss Sunshine""'s magic would not be possible without one of the best assembled cast in years. The entire group of actors that play the Hoover family really show big chemistry together and deliver a believable portrait of this dysfunctional family. Starting with Greg Kinnear, who makes the best of a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional cartoon. Toni Collette really shines in her role, and is one of the film's best surprises. The experienced Alan Arkin tackles with dignity and funny enthusiasm on the role of the grandfather, delivering another of his excellent performances. Steve Carell proves that he is more than a mere comedian in a complicated, yet essential role for the film. Abigail Breslin is literally the film's heart, bringing her spark to the film in a wonderful performance. Comparatively, Paul Dano comes up as the weakest link, but that has more to do with the high quality of his cast-mates, as his work is still effective and worth of praise on its own.Many have criticized the way ""Little Miss Sunshine"" remains too close to the road movie formula and its use of overused clich√©s, however I find that to be unfairly harsh, as well as misdirected, as it's not really the plot what matters in the end, it's how the characters react to the situations that this trip presents them. Exaggerated or not, the characterizations are really believable, and that's the element that makes the film to stand out among other similar films. The characters here do have a soul, and as the family gather the necessary strength to push the old VW van, they gather the courage to overcome their inner personal demons. While probably predictable, few movies of this optimistic feel good style could carry its plot keeping the same energy from beginning to end.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the little big surprise of 2006, a black comedy that attempted to do a lot with very little, and that for the most part succeeded in its attempt. The young talent here shows a lot of promise, and hopefully will keep delivering works as good as this one in the future. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" may not be the most original film of the world, but this little jewel can easily be considered among the best of the year. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun,"An American road trip movie about dreams, failure and losers. The tone is cheerful yet depressing. Every character in this movie is basically a loser, despite all that the movie still finds a way to make it funny. The acting is really good it was near flawless, every single actor nailed the emotion. The shots are surprisingly good in some scene. I'm not a fan of the beauty pageant scene like everyone else, but all around a fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Heart-Felt 2006 Film,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" cleverly critiques society's obsession with appearances through its satirical take on beauty pageants. Celebrating uniqueness and embracing imperfections, the film challenges norms and highlights the stark contrast between the industry's artificiality and the genuine nature of the Hoover family. Visually captivating with vibrant colours and picturesque locations, it balances humour and drama, leaving audiences touched and amused. A beloved gem in independent cinema, it reminds us of the importance of family, acceptance, and embracing our true selves.With its heartfelt performances, well-crafted screenplay, and thought-provoking themes, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" stands as a poignant and entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A little SUN shines in the black sky of the family!!,"I saw that movie yesterday, and i am telling you i have been through all the emotions you can imagine. you see on the start of the movie a small family everyone is busy with his interest, now you think this family is falling apart, but some how they are involved in a situation that keeps them together putting all the problems they face behind, they do all that because of a little girl ... a little sun that shows them the connections between them , as these connections are falling apart they fight to keep that little sun shining on their black sky. The casting isn't full of big names but the performance was brilliant, i cant forget that scene when (Dwayne) discovers that he is a color blind , its one of the best scenes i ever seen , it simply made me laugh and cry at the same time!!!

U can touch this!,"I have seen many movies about dysfunctional families, but rarely if ever have I seen one as good or as funny as ""Little Miss Sunshine"". It not only shows the fictional Hoover family's messed-up existence, but shows how daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the least damaged; maybe it's because she's the youngest, so there's hope for her.Anyway, the family. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) hosts pep talks where he reminds people of the nine steps to becoming a winner (because, as he puts it, winners know that they're going to win); none of his steps really seem to amount to anything in his own home, especially with the advice that he gives Olive. Mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) tries to be a homemaker, but is clearly unsatisfied with life. Son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence in hopes of becoming a jet pilot. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) prides himself on his perverted - but quite hilarious - lifestyle. Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) recently tried to commit suicide and seems to have a slight form of Asperger's Syndrome, making it hard for him to read social cues. And daughter Olive, she's participating in a beauty contest.When they have to drive to Redondo Beach for the beauty pageant, they have an experience that they never could have imagined. Each one gets to see just how messed up s/he is. Even though they all seem weird, we can't help but admire each of them. But the beauty pageant itself is the highlight. It affirms that there is definitely hope for Olive, and not the kind that dad suggested! Anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough. It's one that you just gotta see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Freaks,"Its a simple strategy. Introduce us to some damaged folks, folks that seem way beyond what we would accept. Then spend some time with them in such a way that we get to know them. Then at the end, compare them to ""ordinary"" people so as to trick us into grounding ourselves in the ""weirdos."" Along the way, give us quirky vignettes, alternately endearing and humorous.This complies in gentle ways, following the template so closely it might have been designed by a committee. This is where successful independent films are now, I guess. Sad.In normal circumstances, I'd just relax and go along for the ride, like I did for, say ""Miss Congeniality."" But there's a nagging reminder that something here isn't fair.The denouement of the story ¬ó the place where we actually see the rest of the world ¬ó is a kiddie beauty pageant. This is the place where all the talk about dividing the world into winners and losers is embossed on us. What we see are horrible little people, absolutely revolting freaks. Its a truly damning thing. And it works as intended. We immediately realize where our own lives are centered ¬ó or where we would like them to be.But look closer. What we are revolted about is the cult of little-girl-cuteness. It isn't as deep a cult in the US as it is in Japan, St Petersberg or Thailand. But it is in movies here and essentially everywhere. We are charmed by girls. Its one of the most reliable parts of the cinematic vocabulary. I saw this film paired with ""Forbidden Games,"" which is a truly wonderful experience.So here we are given a show that celebrates the cuteness of little girls and we are repulsed. But what have we been watching for over an hour? A family disaster that revolves around the cuteness of our little girl. Its a relentless cuteness show, which we allow in part because we know our actress has been made less ""pretty"" by over-sized glasses (another movie shortcut) and a prosthetic belly. But its cute that we are sold.So in the damning at the end, I damned myself and felt dirty coming out. Movies do this a lot, especially teen movies that poke fun at teen humor and then have all the jokes dependent on that same humor. More clever ones do it with heavier subjects. ""American Psycho.""But this is just too much. The writers give us an escape hatch. We can pretend it isn't cuteness and innocent charm, but a more prurient interest we are damning. The contestants we see do try to look sexy and our girl's routine is targeted at blowing that up. So we can pretend it is sex that is the reversal. But be honest. It isn't.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Comedy
I liked it!,I liked this film! It had many funny situations and dealt with real problems that people face. I would have voted higher but for the dance routine of Olive at the end. I thought it was highly inappropriate for a girl of her age to move and dress like that. If they would just take that routine out I would have given the movie a 10.The film touched on many parts of life. A gay Uncle that is very smart and almost commits suicide because his life all but goes down the drain. And then you see him in many scenes with his straight nephew that is a classic goth type yet is in to Nietzche.The fathers self help step spiel was a riot. Yet one more person with a method to achieve anything that no one will listen to.It was touching how the whole family was willing to back this little girl.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

the best movie of 2006 period and my favorite so far.,"Little Miss Sunshine reviewPeople see film to be entertained and forget about life for a bit. Other go only for thrill of what going to happen next, others go to fell in love again with their couple. But there certain crowd that growing increasingly this few years this crowd goes to the theater to be blow away not for big explosion or insane car chases. But With imaginative clever design that is rarely shown every year I I included in this group. Every year few movies cause that impact on this people last year was Slumdog Millionaires, the year before Juno the incredible story of pregnant women trying to live life as simple as possible. This movie captures the attention and imagination of millions not because of heart pumping action, laughter or anything between. The reason is so simple clever writing and excellent direction that so few can achieve.This category movies are view like art not like a piece of entertainment. Back in 2006 a movie emerge from nowhere, it came from the most unexpected places. That movie is called little miss sunshine. At first it looks like different movie with no impact that was fairly common in this time, it took the theme of a dysfunctional family that isn't a common theme for many reason. One of the reasons is not so easy to elaborate but that wasn't for screenwriter Michael Arndt, many say that it was taken from his life and that all character where from there he, himself confirmed that when he won the Oscar for best original screenplay. Little miss sunshine went and sold 100 millions worldwide, in the united state it sold 59.8 million , from that standard this movie sold really well because the movie budget was only 8 millions and it was sold to fox search line for 10.5 to recover all it production money. But no one expected to be such a success this movie was nominated for 4 Oscars of those it won 2 of them including best original screen play and best actor in support ion role and many more prizes. This movie was so usefully for many reason one was the excellent cinematography, the great cast that all of them where Oscar worthy and from my stand point by far was the best movie in 2006.But what make this movie truly epic was the sincerity in part from all the cast, especially the connexion between the grandfather and Olive Hoover that you can feel the bond between the two of them. Also Steve Carell give and outstanding performance he demonstrated to everyone that he can make comedy but he can excellent piece of dramas. The direction in this movie was truly outstanding it unique feels is like nothing you ever seen before. The original score of the movie give it a flavor and taste that was truly remarkable. To sum up little miss sunshine is by far the best movie of 2006 it was worthy of every it was nominated but sadly the academy are more commercial than true critics. This movie taught us something that we don't to see picture of fantasy or adventure to be truly amazed like most of the people think. But the true story that causes an impact in our heart hearts are the ones that comes that come from the real life mix up with some clever ideas that to me is little miss sunshine is one of the best achievement in cinemas of all time.--Goyolap",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Like A Ray of Sunlight,"'Little Miss Sunshine' tells a fascinating and hilarious story of a dysfunctional family that includes a cigarette-addicted mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), her suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell), her voluntarily mute son Dwayne (Paul Dano), her obsessed-with-winning husband Richard(Greg Kinnear), his eccentric father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and her 7 year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin). I usually enjoy movies and shows about dysfunctional families, perhaps because my family's that way and it is this dysfunctional quality that makes them more fun for me. Directors Dayton and Faris do a good job as they stick to the main story. 'Little Miss Sunshine' can also be watched as a fun road movie where we are presented with some beautiful landscapes and some of the dialogues during the characters' journey are of laugh out loud quality and yet it keeps the authenticity of the relationships and situations intact.The film consists of a delightful ensemble cast. Toni Collette, as the mother and wife who tries to keep the family together is amazing. Alan Arkin is brilliant as the father who doesn't give a damn. Greg Kinnear too is superb as the judgemental moron and he's great in displaying his character's vulnerability. Steve Carell is excellent, especially in showing Frank's transformation and his dialogue delivery is impeccable. Paul Dano holds his own. And, Abigail Breslin is the surprise package. This little girl is breathtaking. The scene where she has the last conversation with her grandfather and breaks down because of her fear of losing the pageant was very moving and of course there's the climax shot.About this particular shot, many have labelled it as child pornography and this is an ignorant statement. That scene was not meant to be pornographic in any way. It was supposed to be hilarious and it got me rolling on the floor laughing (not literally but you get the idea). The importance of that scene was that it was a punch in the stomach to the parents and all those associated with the children's beauty pageant. We are shown little girl's (as young as ages 3) with heavy makeup, wearing these revealing outfits, doing these provocative moves on stage (this was one horrifying sequence)...all in the name of talent, self esteem and whatever. Olive's act stresses on the hypocrisy of this ridicule and the young actress does a fine job.On the technical front, the cinematography is good and the soundtrack is brilliant. But, it is the characters and their relationship that makes 'Little Miss Sunshine' a treat. It starts off on a gloomy note where all the characters, except Olive, are more or less depressed but as the film proceeds the layers unfold and as the story is told. Not a single moment is wasted on irrelevant trivia. By the end, the experience is very positive, like a ray of sunlight entering the lives of these characters.",,Anonymous,Comedy
What was all the hype about?,"This was a decent movie, I will give it that but it really didn't deserve all the praise it got. My local newspaper gave it nine out of ten. You find reviews of it that say it is hilariously funny. Sure there are a few funny moments but when you see it you are not going to walk out and say it is a comedy. It is worth seeing but don't have very high expectations of it because it won't meet to the standards that some of the reviewers have given it. The acting was nice and the story was good enough to sustain the movie. Not the best movie the world has ever seen. Over all I would prefer to rate it out of five and if I could you would be looking at something around three out of five.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Aren't indie flicks supposed to be original?,"With all the hype surrounding this film I went expecting to see the best movie I'd see all year, but nearly two hours later when the credits rolled I felt cheated. Following yet another road trip taken by a dysfunctional family, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is at times painfully predictable and sadly unoriginal. The family itself is so generic in its dysfunction: there's the the ineffectual motivational-speaker dad who hates losers (meaning he secretly hates his family), the stressed out mom, the chubby 7-year-old daughter with beauty pageant dreams, the brooding Nietzsche-reading teen, the suicidal gay uncle, and the drug-abusing horny grandpa who decides he's old enough to say whatever he wants. As you might expect, EVERYTHING on this trip goes wrong. Along the way to the beauty pageant, each family member is confronted with expectations and rude awakenings. What is supposed to be an ensemble piece about a family never quite comes together and we are left with a series of scenes meant to showcase a particular cast member's talent, but the problem is no one really reacts or relates to anyone else. The one sweet scene between Grandpa and 7-year-old Olive is a relief, but also feels glaringly underlined by the director. As an audience member I didn't miss any of these heartfelt scenes, but I didn't buy them either. So that I don't sound like I'm trashing a film that I almost enjoyed, I should give credit where credit is due. Part of the film's obvious irony is that depressed Uncle Frank (played by Steve Carell) is the only person who can see how weird this family is, but watching his calm bewilderment is a delight. Toni Collete is also so darn likable, but I was bored with just about any scene that focused entirely on father Greg Kinnear's character. The finale at the beauty pageant exaggerates and replays all the lessons that have come before: such competitions are superficial, and displays of love come in all forms. The family embraces its loserdom and becomes winners by showing how grotesque the child beauty pageant world is ¬ñ wow, now that's a fresh idea! The film saves its one big laugh for the end, but it was too little too late. While it had its moments, Little Miss Sunshine isn't as wacky or clever as it believes itself to be and this ticket holder walked away disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a few years. A great portrait of real family life. Greg Kinnear is also just perfect in his role and does a spectacular job. Toni Collette is always good too. Everyone in this picture was just fantastic and endearing. A wonderful family movie for adults and young adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Totally joyous, funny, fun, fast, and more mainstream than indie overall","Little Miss Sunshine (2006)What a wacky, funny, sweet, feel-good movie. It's fast, well made, well written, and fresh faced all the way through.What else do you need from a warm comedy? The star has to be the little girl, who is in fact the title character, Olive, played by Abigail Breslin. She is the real deal, a great little kid with a heart and with smarts and cute and talented, too. And for some reasonable reason she wants to compete in a beauty and talent contest, and her loving and doubtful family give her total support. Of course, the genuine things that Olive represents are the exact opposite of what is encouraged by beauty pageants, so a kind of crisis is inevitable.But you know it'll be a funny crisis, and not quite like the comedy in the adult version of the film from six years earlier, ""Miss Congeniality,"" with Sandra Bullock. Because Bullock has the goods to win, despite her outsider sensibility. Olive is set up to be a geeky, cute but not a bit glamorous or fakey kid.Her grandfather, played by Alan Arkin, is also the real deal, a nutty caricature, for sure, but funny and a great perk in the movie. The parents are fun but for me in a more expected way, and the brother of one of them is fun and funny in a Ben Stiller kind of way.Production involved some quirks in filming, such as the use of five different yellow microbuses, and the genuine use of headphones by the little girl (as shown) when Arkin is swearing his head off. And the whole thing was a fairly well budgeted indie with a debut at Sundance. And a huge rise to the top of critical and popular charts.So it's easy to like this movie and even to love it. For serious movie lovers you might find it like other feel-good, well made, but in some ways ""in-the-box"" movies (another that comes to mind is ""Shawshank Redemption"") so it won't strike some people as exceptional. Just exceptionally fun. Don't expect anything truly moving or thought provoking or experimental or probing. It is what it is, which is pretty much self-sufficient.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Total Surprise...One of 2006's Best Films,"A father looking to sell a ""9-Step"" program, an avowed 'winner.' A beleaguered mother with unflagging hope in her daughter's potential. Her troubled, homosexual brother, fresh out of the hospital after a suicide attempt. A Nietzsche-obsessed brother who has taken a vow of silence. A porn-ogling, foul-mouthed grandfather regretful of having ""not f--ked a lot of women"" in his lifetime. A precocious little girl determined to be the winner of the titular pageant. If I had read a description like this, I would have written off ""Little Miss Sunshine"" without a second thought--it looks and sounds like a standard-issue, deliberately 'quirky' road-trip comedy where the standard-issue dysfunctional family bonds and learns an Important Lesson at the denouement. And you know what? It is. But it is also laugh-out-loud hilarious, brilliantly acted (would someone please give Steve Carell a Best Supporting Actor nod?), and genuinely moving (the climax made me want to laugh, cry, and cheer, all at the same time). The feature debut of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (known previous for music videos, including The Smashing Pumpkins' 'Tonight Tonight') plays with the style and attention to character of a Wes Anderson film (though with a lot less inhibition in its comedy), and the breezy humor and hard knocks of, say, ""The Squid and the Whale"" (another excellent dramedy).

An amazing roadtrip-dramedy.,"Little Miss Sunshine is a movie I have wanted to watch for a while. And when I finally did, I loved it. This is one of the best dramedies I have ever seen.The best thing with the movie, is how it can be at times very funny, and at other times very dark and emotional. It's basically a drama with a lot of humour. A dramedy.I love the cast in this movie. I like both Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents. Steve Carell is also extremely good. He's the funny guy from The Office and Anchorman, and this role is pretty dramatic. He plays remarkable well (for a comedian). He's also funny in this role, but a lot more dramatic. Alan Arkin plays the funny grandpa who's everything a grandpa should not be. Paul Dano is probably my favorite as the brother who refuses to speak. The main role is played by the amazing Abigail Breslin. This is one of her first main roles, and she is fantastic. I was amazed by seeing the younger Abigail Breslin before Zombieland and Ender's Game.This is a very good movie. It's one of my favorite movies, and when I think of this movie, I have a strong association with The Way Way Back. They have a lot in common. Both movies depicts the sad part of being a teenager, they both star Toni Collette and Steve Carell (who is even more dramatic), and they're both a dramedy. There you have it.

Heavier than I expected,"I expected this to be a typical road comedy and couldn't understand why it was getting all those nominations and awards.

I disagree (respectively) with the reviewer who said that Breslin owned the movie. Nobody did. Each of the actors had his or her moment, and they all deserve immense credit.I do think that Steve Carrell was more deserving of a supporting nom than Alan Arkin, but that's not too big a deal. Arkin was good, I just thought Carrell was more commanding. In fact, I found his character and Dano's the most compelling ones.I'll say nothing about the plot other than what you already know, that the movie centers on a trip from Albequerque to Redondo Beach, California, for a juvenile beauty pageant.

Consistently funny even if some of the jokes are retreads,"After the regional winner of the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant is withdrawn, young Olive Hoover (splendidly played by Abigail Breslin) is invited to Redondo Beach, in order to take part in the national beauty competition for pre-teens. Only she has two problems: (a) her family are too broke to fly there and (b) due to various circumstances, the road trip requires all barmy combatants of the family to travel as well. Among them includes the heroine-addicted grandpa (Alda), older brother Dwayne (Dano), who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of becoming a navy pilot, and her suicidal gay uncle Frank (Carell, playing against type) who has to be monitored at all times. And, of course, they encounter any number of problems and mishaps along the way. Whilst the movie ends on a misjudged elaborate comic set piece, for the most part Little Miss Sunshine is consistently funny, if not nearly as acerbic as it could have been.

Little Miss Sunshine,"With the Pathe membership pass on hand ¬ñ I started to study the Pathe web site and studying the movies that are running in theaters. I came across good reviews of this movie.

It is the oldest Pathe Theatre. It has historic looking wooden interior.

In the midst of the death scene also one does not stop laughing ¬ñ but reflecting back ¬ñ one does not get convinced with the situation.The ending of the movie is the most inspiring and sends out a strong message against ¬ñ the relevance of beauty pageants and humans have started considering everything in life like beauty pageant. This is reflected in a very lovely exchange between the professor and the young boy ¬ñ who says that ""everyone's whole life is like this silly beauty pageant"".At the end of the movie it is so pitiful to see the young girls of 5-10 years being tortured to act and behave like beauty queens ¬ñ and it tells the story of today's times.A very good movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Highlight of an enjoyable evening,"I enjoyed this movie very much last night. Today I came to IMDb to read what others thought. A wide range of comments! I think it boils down to this: The movie leaves you feeling good. All of the acting performances are really good. I cared about what was happening. I laughed hard several times, smiled most of the time, felt sad a few times. It is worth the price of admission. I'm glad I saw it.The little girl actor (Abigail Beslin, I think) surprised me. She is perfect. Without spoiling anything, she embodies the theme: sunshine, dreams, and hope. It is echoed, in moments, through all of the characters.In a way, this is a movie through a child's eyes. An example, when Olive puts her arm around Dwayne and, without saying a word, changes his mind. She never doubts the outcome in this scene (and probably doesn't even understand it). It just happens and it makes sense, even while the adults are doubting.I've read several cynical reviews of this movie, mainly mentioning clich√©s, particularly of the movie National Lampoon's Vacation. I think the intent is there in this movie and it is pretty obvious the writers of ""Sunshine"" are in on this joke, perhaps the way writers for the Simpsons, Hedwig, and Family Guy are in on their jokes. They expect you to ""get it"", not criticize it in the name of realism.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little Miss Sunshine,"My husband and I had watched this film in the U.S.A. and it was a great opportunity to a different kind of movie. We had a lot of fun and the film is so sensitive. To watch this you'll need special lens of your soul. In our opinion this film should have more awards to incentive this way of production. We are Italian descendant and for us the film was almost like an Italian family, all they have problems but they are all the time together. The characters are all brilliant into their roles that sometimes we had the sensation that it was real and not a film. It really deserves the success it has made here in Brazil because it is not a casual film, it is just a Great film. Congratulations Little Miss Sunshine!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Vrey enjoyable Saturday afternoon,"This film is both funny and well delivered, but it also has its darker side.If you are looking for a light, funny flick this is a great way to kill 2 odd hours.There is some satire in there but at the end of the day it' just a funny character in odd situation story laid over a road trip.While I watched the denouement I cried my eyes out - I was in the right mood and it really is a funny punch line.The lasting impression it has made in my life however is the introduction of paper plates to family gatherings.Definitely worth renting.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sad Comedy,"Little Miss Sunshine is a funny and entertaining independent movie about a strange and ambitious family called the Hoovers who take a road-trip. Their 7-year year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) enters the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California. The Hoovers can't afford to fly so they drive an old VW bus from their home in Albuquerque.The Hoovers are a family with big dreams who seem to lack the talent or ability to realize them. Richard (Greg Kinnear) plays the dad, a motivational speaker who specializes in telling people how to become winners. Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the mother, who tries to make sure everybody is happy, but is becoming disillusioned with her husband's lack of success. Her brother Frank (Steve Carrell) is recovering from a suicide attempt. Frank is a gay, Proust scholar who believes he is the leading U.S. expert in his field. His boyfriend has just left him for a more successful rival. The teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) reads Nietzsche, and wants to become a jet pilot. He has not spoken for nine months and communicates by writing notes. Richard's father (Alan Arkin) recently got kicked out of his retirement community for swearing and snorting heroin. When Grandpa dies he is thrown in the trunk. Olive is a short, overweight little girl whose beauty queen ambitions are at odds with her physique.The Hoovers start the movie unable to communicate with each other. Their VW has a broken clutch and to get the vehicle going they have to push and leap into the moving van. Somehow the absurdity of their situation helps bring them together. Once in California the Little Miss Sunshine competition seems like a grotesque freak show. Underage girls perform adult dance moves and look and dress like drag queens. Olive performs an unfortunate dance routine choreographed by her Grandpa. The Hoovers are appalled by the misguided dedication and professionalism surrounding the competition.Most family members end the movie with their hopes and dreams crushed. After sharing numerous humiliations they learn to bond and realize they at least have each other. The smart and witty script by Michael Arndt seems to pose a number of questions about the destructive power of ambition for those with no talent. You conclude the Hoovers might be better off if they tried to just live ordinary lives without the striving to be winners.The movie has a talented cast and Carrell gives a memorable impression of a gay man running for a bus. By the end of the film you care about the Hoovers and although they seem happy, you worry about what will become of them. The film was directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris who do a remarkable job on a production budget of $8 million.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A life lesson and my favorite film ever.,"I can say it's my favorite film of all times, the first movie i loved as a teenager confused with life. i won't get to deep in it, because like all those things we love, we don't need to over anlayse or dig them to understand why we do so. However it is beautiful on every level, production, cinematography the soundtrack with sufjan stevens, but most importantly the story and the charachters. It's a road trip on the quest for the true meaning of life and self-discovery, beyond artifice, plastique perfection and self-help poison, a film that resonates now more than ever, a life lesson about embrassing life with it's flaws, imperfections, sadness and illogical twists and linving it honestly free from the need of approval, because you know we live once and tommorow is a new day. Every charcter on this film will make you grow as a human. Personally i saw my self in every character and that's why this film holds a very special place in my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ain't no sunshine ...,"Well I have to admit I never understood nor do I think I will understand the need for very young girls to be displayed and taking part in such competitions like the mentioned ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Our main kid here is quite excited about that competition and she is so good in this movie. You may have seen her as adult or grown up before you watch this, but I reckon it was obvious from this one, she had acting talent.But she is also surrounded by quite the ensemble of actors. The script is also really good - and the extras on the disc make clear that also some nice ad lips add to the overall excitement. There are so many things that have to work, for a movie like this to be in the right lane - no pun intended. It's such a tightrope thing that you have multiple endings that were shot. But the one they ultimately used is the best one (imho).If you like dramas that feel and are real to life (with annoying behaviour, with characters that have to develop and have to overcome certain flaws) ... this is one of the movies you have to watch!

An actor's movie,"This movie was highly enjoyable because it depends on situations and acting. It sets up some very tough situations which requires the actors to be pretty creative in the way that they portray their roles.Each of the major characters and the bit players all play their roles as if they were the star. So there is no part of the movie that really lags behind in quality. To me this is a sign of respect for the audience, as well as a respect for the movie as a whole. There are no throwaway scenes.Like all good comedies, there are both happy and sad elements, yet through them all, the characters make us laugh.Go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Winner of a movie about Losers,"A dysfunctional family takes a road trip in a run down VW van so that the 7 year old daughter can participate in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and along the way they learn about themselves, each other, and change their perceptions on life in general. Sounds about as good as Hope Floats or National Lampoon's European Vacation, right? But this is dysfunction taken to extremes and dealt with with just the right balance of humour and sensitivity, and so a movie that could veer dangerously close to schmaltz and sentimentality instead reins itself in, becoming as deeply funny as it is moving.The family that squeeze themselves into that van comprises of Sheryl (Tonie Collette), working mother and sole breadwinner; Richard (Greg Kinnear), her husband and wannabe motivational speaker; Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrel), a gay, pre-eminent Proust scholar who's just failed in a suicide attempt; Sheryl's son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), who, inspired by Nietszche, has taken a vow of silence until he's accepted to train as an fighter pilot; Richard's father (Alan Arkin), an oversexed pensioner experimenting with heroin; and Sheryl and Richard's daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), a beauty queen obsessed 7 year old with a truly idiosyncratic fashion sense.These descriptions may sound like a ragbag collection of depressed caricatures, but the performances by the cast prevent it from lapsing into emotional parody, and truly a star is born in the form of Abigail Breslin to whom this movie entirely belongs. Surrounded by veteran scene stealers like Collette, Carrel and Arkin, she effortlessly transcends the film in possibly the most honest performance a child actor has ever delivered on screen. Her bemusement at her despicable father's sneering dietary insinuations when she orders ice cream for breakfast and subsequent lack of appetite almost made me cry.This movie is painfully truthful and yet shockingly funny, and just when it seems it couldn't get any bleaker, it suddenly swings round and turns out to be the ultimate feel good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Broken horn,"When the movie started, I wasn't sure from the feel of it that it was going to live up to what I thought it would be. However, as the movie progressed and everyone's personal and familial problems began to surface and resolve, I was very impressed.Not to mention the 'broken horn' scene. I honestly do not think I have laughed so hard at a specific scene in a given movie. There were tears running down my face. I'm not sure if this just struck a cord with me in particular, but I think my fianc√© was laughing at the fact that I was laughing as opposed to what was happening. It was very refreshing.See this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Love and pain and the whole damn thing...,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" is ostensibly built around a road-trip to a junior-miss pageant, yet the character-oriented film, at its core, is about dreamers--specifically dreamers who aren't successful, but who have enough drive and delusion to convince themselves otherwise. An unconventional family in New Mexico valiantly attempts to get their little girl to a pageant in Southern California, with each member of the group struggling against his or her own insecurities. Both an edgy comedy (with its foundation in manic-depressive humor) and a sentimental drama with hard-shelled pathos, it walks a fine line between exhilarating and excruciating--but the remarkable cast usually keeps it on the winning side. That said, I didn't quite buy the ending; I'm glad the film doesn't resort to clich√© and turn young Abigail Breslin into a pint-sized Barbie doll, but perhaps a little more heart might have been worked in. Otherwise, a finely-tuned valentine to family neurosis, and the love inherent in pulling together as a familial unit. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Humanly and morally repugnant,"I believe that humanity and morality of a movie are valid aesthetic and artistic criteria,and among the most important . My rating of this movie reflects the fact that I find it repugnant. The rating is reinforced by the fact that it is technically so well made: garbage is bad but garbage in a pretty dress is even worse. Why do I find it repugnant? I need only mention the real hero of the movie, and the character portrayed most sympathetically--- the Grandpa: a lascivious, promiscuous, foul-mouthed, coke-sniffing out-of-control addict, foisting vulgarities and teaching his under-age grand-daughter inappropriate dance moves. Didn't YOU get totally sick watching the little girl trying to perform lewd dance moves like she is a hooker?

Tragicomedy with bittersweet tone,"It is one of the best examples of Tragicomedy. Even though the genre of the movie is comedy-drama, it has a very bittersweet tone. It feels unbearable as soon as it starts, and both the characters and the interaction between them are also unbearable. It can be difficult to get past that first stage, but as it progress, the film opens up. The events that happen to the characters break their concrete thought patterns and this leads them to become more attached to each other. Their own breaking points come when they confront the fact that they are wrong. The more they confront themselves, the more they become ""real"" characters. The movie, which starts off as unbearable, ends in a heartfelt way. Sometimes it is necessary to push life, then to chase it and jump into it, only with this way can we truly enjoy the life.8- Very Good.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth Watching Just to See the Ending,"I saw this with a group of friends who didn't know much about the film. After about 30 minutes, one of them commented, ""Is this suppose to be a comedy?"" That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.The family is extremely messed up. It felt like we were visiting a home where we were seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing. It was painful and compelling at the same time because you could tell that everyone cared for each other very much but all their personal S**t was getting in the way of them making healthy connections to each other.The youngest of the family, 8 year-old Olive, gets into a beauty contest and the whole family embarks on a trip across country in a decrepit Microbus to support her dream of being Little Miss Sunshine. Olive is adorable, but not cutesy at all. Her father is so hard on her to be a winner that he even starts getting her to hate her body and be thin so she can become a beauty queen. Olive isn't fat at all. She looks like a normal kid. This isn't light humor, but biting commentary about society.The middle part of the film is a bit like the movie ""Vacation."" Unfortunately, there are some plot problems that couldn't be ignored so I took away a star.Once the family reaches The Little Miss Sunshine Pagant, be ready to be hit over the head with some of the funniest comedy I've seen in a long time. My friend who first asked, ""Is this a comedy?"" couldn't stop laughing.I felt like we had listened to the details of a very long joke and were finally given the punchline.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent acting and script,"This film is about a highly dysfunctional family's road trip to California in order for the youngest daughter to participate a beauty contest ""Little Miss Sunshine"".This film is very special, because it entirely relies on the script and the acting to keep the viewers interested. There are no special effects, no grand set designs or extravagant costumes. Acting by the whole cast is excellent. The script shows one dysfunctional argument after another. The arguments are interesting and non-superficial. The events that happen are bizarre and comical, such as the car breaking down and subsequent pushes for the car to start, or the removal of a dead body. These comical events are presented seriously, so it creates an interesting contrast between the events and the prevailing mood of the film. This film is very memorable!",,Anonymous,Comedy
On the road to the sun,"When American films want to examine itself, it tends to do better as Independent films. This is a film about a dysfunctional family with an all star cast but Abigail Breslin as Olive is the centre holding this film together.Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) is an overworked mother of two kids in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Her brother Frank (Steve Carell) is a scholar who is depressive over a failed loved affair with a male student and has tried to commit suicide. He is temporarily living with the family.Sheryl's husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) wants to be a motivational speaker although he seems to have had no business success on his own accord to be such a speaker.Her 17 year old son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has been on a vow of silence for some months and will remain so until he becomes an air force pilot.Richard's father, Edwin (Alan Arkin) is a foul mouthed drug user who is also staying with them after being kicked out of a retirement home. He is close with Olive his 7 year old granddaughter.The film is essentially a slapstick comedy road drama as they head for California so Olive can enter the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest.Along the way they encounter mishaps, tragedy but also bond as a family especially when the camper van breaks down and needs to be pushed started each time.The screenplay won an Oscar and after nominations stretching back several decades, Alan Arkin won the best supporting actor Oscar.The ensemble cast really bring the characters to life and bounce off each other. Although they are dysfunctional and there may be occasional conflicts, they are there for each other and work together to pull through.This is highlighted in the beauty contest when Olive's performance turns out to be a little too daring and the others join in.These themes about families have been touched on other films but Little Miss Sunshine is more successful.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A beauty!,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" is easily the most light-hearted dark comedy ever made and one of the best movies of 2006. Not only is it painfully funny, but it has an unexpected moral about the real difference between winners and losers.The Hoover brood certainly appears to be the biggest bunch of losers you ever saw. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a pathetic, wannabe motivational speaker who has squandered the family's money on his idiotic program (""9 Steps to Success!""). Mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) tries to be the levelheaded voice of reason, but gets easily frazzled by all the chaos surrounding her. Son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a teen aged misanthrope who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into a flight academy. Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is a gay Proust scholar who has recently survived a suicide attempt. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a heroin addict with a heart of gold. Then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin¬Ö yay! A Hollywood child star who's NOT Dakota Fanning!), a sweet, bubbly ball of energy who has recently been chosen for the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant, thanks to dance training by good ol' Grandpa. This a triumph for Olive that spells financial hope for the Hoovers, so they load up their dilapidated, mustard yellow VW bus and head for Los Angeles.Along the way they encounter all sorts of mishaps: the bus breaks down and has to pushed in order to start, the family quarrels, each family member is forced to face a cruel revelation about themselves, and tragedy even strikes. Yet Olive remains a positive presence, and being the glue that holds her family together falls on her little shoulders.""Little Miss Sunshine"" addresses a widely ignored fact: that there are two types of optimism. Richard represents the desperate, blind, phony optimism that infests the self-help section in any bookstore, where winning is the only representation of success, not the fact that you were bold enough to try in the first place. Richard also has a habit of speaking in a series of buzzwords and platitudes, such as ""sarcasm is losers trying to bring winners down to their level"". Here is a man who refuses to admit that he has any faults or insecurities, so he lashes out at people who are up front with their human frailties. In one of the most painful scenes in the movie, Olive innocently orders ""waffles a la mode"" at a diner, and Richard, thinking he's being helpful but in fact is being a jerk, lectures Olive on how ""ice cream turns to fat"", much to poor Olive and Sheryl's chagrin.Olive, on the other hand, is real optimism personified. She believes in herself, keeps those bespectacled eyes on the prize, and dares to have faith when others seem doubtful. The Hoovers do indeed make it to the pageant, but I will NOT, under any circumstance, spoil the movie by revealing whether Olive wins or not. What I will say is this: win or lose, Olive is truly the most beautiful of her pint-size competitors.The entire cast is just about perfect. Breslin is simply adorable, and she's the least annoying child actor to come along in ages. Collette is glorious as the world-weary but fiercely devoted Sheryl, who through even the most trying times stands by her family with a mother bear's ferocity. She also looks like a real, lower middle-class mom with her K-Mart wardrobe, love handles and boring hair. Carell was unfairly overlooked at Oscar time¬Ö he nearly steals the movie as Frank, who slowly develops an ""I'm a loser, but I'm okay"" attitude. Frank is a passive, yet sardonic observer to all that's going on, and he becomes a surprising confidante to antisocial Dwayne. Carell also demonstrates his knack for physical comedy, creating Frank's ridiculous run that indicates someone who never got picked first for teams in gym class growing up. Arkin, Kinnear, and Dano are also good, making each of their characters sympathetic and all too real.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is really a beauty of a comedy. Don't miss it!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An sharp and clever comedy satire,"Little Miss Sunshine manages to balance comedy, drama and satire in an incredible way, all that balance gives rise to a high-level dark comedy, which manages to talk about many themes that define american culture, it is a film with uncomfortable comic situations, is a sharp and dangerous comedy, but incredibly smart.This movie plays with the premise of the dysfunctional family, a premise that has been exploited to the point of exhaustion in Hollywood, but let's remember that what matters is the way you tell the story, Little Miss Sunshine is original and raw, unlike other movies about dysfunctional families this movie gives a different portrait of what we already know as the basic american family, each of its members is at the same level of depth and personal conflict, they face suicide, obsession, failure, to despair, frustration and death, throughout the film each of them deals with their own fights but by the end of the story, they are fighting as a family, it doesn't matter if you don't have a good relationship with your family this movie is probably not going to fix it but it is a lovely portrait of family ties.Like any good satire, you can notice the social comment that the film makes on different topics, whether it is from the hypocrisy of society and the bad education that is given to children in a quite stressful scene in which little Olive is shown Under the pressure of deciding between her beauty or enjoying his ice cream, this enters a different context when we analyze that Olive is a 6-year-old girl in full development of learning.This movie feels like a real journey, a journey through American culture and finds a way to satirize it all, beneath the laughter hides a charming depth.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Little Miss Sunshine,"Alan Arkin might have got the Oscar but it's Greg Kinnear who steals this for me. Talk about a pain in the proverbial! He is ""Richard"", a rather pompously self-motivated man who is trying to sell his nine point plan for success to ""Grossmann"" (a fleeting appearance from Bryan Cranston). Meantime, his young daughter ""Olive"" (Abigail Breslin) is continually practising for the eponymous pageant under the aegis of her foul-mouthed, cocaine-snorting, grandfather (Arkin) and beside her whacky brother ""Dwayne"" (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence and hates everyone and everything. He just wants to join the air force. There's also a surprise guest in their home. ""Uncle Frank"" (Steve Carell). Now he's just got out of the ER having tried to kill himself after his student boyfriend dumped him for another Proust-spouting, but wealthier, scholar! At the helm, trying to keep this family from complete self-destruction is ""Sheryl"" (Toni Collette) and that task becomes distinctly more difficult when young ""Oilve"" is awarded a spot in the national finals - in California. Dad can't go, mum can't drive, brother couldn't care less - but ""Olive"" is determined so into a clapped out VW camper-van they all reluctantly pile and off on a mini road trip. This entertainingly addresses plenty of their demons, allows for a little tragedy to galvanise attitudes and ultimately, for me anyway, demonstrates clearly the ghastliness of those hideous ceremonies that stink of precociousness and gushing parental aspiration. The journey on four wheels is as much a metaphor for that being taken by all in their push-start jalopy, and with Kinnear really getting under my fingernails at just about every turn it's a much quirkier and more thought-provoking comedy that leaves very little out of bounds. Collette also looks like she is having some fun as they deliver a pithily delivered script that does entertain ( and begs the question: why would she ever have married ""Richard"" in the first place?).

Pierce Pagent.,"After a lengthy break, I'm back after the IMDB 2007 Oscar's badge with ""Little Miss Sunshine"" which won Best Screenplay and Best Supporting actor for Alan Arkin at that year's ceremony. I hadn't seen this one before and, whilst I can't see me revisiting it too often, I did certainly enjoy it.Having survived a suicide attempt, Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) moves in with his sister Sheryl (Toni Collette) and her somewhat dysfunctional family. Sheryl's young daughter Olive (Abigail Breslan) wins a place in a beauty pageant and the family reluctantly decide to travel to Los Angeles in a broken-down VW Camper van so she can compete. This includes Sheryl's husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) who is looking to clinch a book deal for his self-help range, teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin), Olive's coach.My fears for ""Little Miss Sunshine"" were that it would be too heavy on the sadness than I was really looking for, but in actuality its' not that at all. I enjoyed it quite a bit, it's full of funny characters that slowly build through the madness of the trip as they are beset with problems from the beginning. It's not quite a ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" level of disaster that befalls them, but there are certainly a number of major coincidences. What a cast it is too, each one a star in their own right, and picking Carell, Dano and Breslan out at the start of careers that would prove some excellent work from the casting people. Arkin is great though, and it's easy to see why he was the best Supporting actor that year.I would say that it ends rather abruptly, though at a point where the family are hopefully headed to a better place. It's maybe a little bit too vignette-y for me to come back to very often but I enjoyed this viewing quite a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Little Miss Sunshine,"Thanks to little misssunshine, I met me when I was tired and bored with nine to five and three to one. Little Miss Sunshine didn't tell me anything, didn't let me sink into the roof, and didn't use profound philosophy to get through my two veins of Ren and Du, and let my inspiration for life gush like a spring. Even it is in the process of uncertain future. I thank it because it makes me see so many people who have not been labeled as successful, who are living so hard and beautiful, just like all living beings, just like the world?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Touching, lovely and surprisingly funny!","What a fun,funny and lovely tale to provide warmth to the heart. All the actors delivered fantastic performances. Loved and most importantly enjoyed every second of this movie. Beautiful cinematography too. The only reason I gave a high score of 9 instead of a 10 is that i personally did not resonate with the approach, the direction the movie took on the events happening chronologically. The directors pushed the envelope too hard and too quick on every unfolding event on this journey. I wouldn't mind watching it longer. Yes my complaint is exactly how it sounds. To me this is a short movie that did not reach its peak and full potential because of it. Very entertaining. Very! I would recommend it to anyone of any age because it is that good.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Tragicomedy, Cry and laugh.","This movie is the definition of tragicomedy. While I was watching it, it felt uncomfortable even when I laugh because the movie itself is really sad. Little miss sunshine tried to show us that even through rough times the family is going to be there. Maybe the movie is too much sad and that just dulls the movie, making it hard to watch and giving a feeling of detachment with the movie. . But overall is a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Insipid,"Wow.I'm stunned.Every once in a while a movie comes along that is jaw-droppingly horrible to the point that it leaves your mouth hanging open. I lack sufficient terms to express how trite and repellent I find this simpering movie. It's an exhausted ""human spirit"" movie so cloying that it needs to be taken off life support. From the first time I saw the TV commercial which featured the hackneyed ruse of getting the whole family in one vehicle for the duration of a movie, I suspected the script would have difficulty making that premise believable. It certainly fails there, but that's the least of its problems. But still, the wealth of good reviews drew me to buy a ticket. My initial reservations were right. This script is an inept piece of garbage long before you evaluate it on moral grounds, where it collapses spectacularly.The family here is a mix of characters so drippy and dense that they never realize their dumpy, uncoordinated, bespectacled daughter isn't the Junior Miss type. It takes them exactly one pageant (following a needless cross country trip) to figure that out. The same family doesn't realize that a heroin-snorting, horndog grandfather shouldn't be the one teaching their adolescent daughter her beauty pageant dance number. Why not go all the way and include a ""funny scene"" of grampa molesting her? The setup is practically there; a scene so distasteful feels like it's just off-screen (or on the cutting room floor) in this wholly objectionable movie.Long after a ridiculously unbelievable ""chance meeting"" in a gas station, long after paper-deep villains have been thrown at the screen, long after the annoying Murphy's Law plot line is exhausted, comes the most sick, saccharine, crappy moment in all of film history which involves a family attempting to redeem their seven-year old daughters failed, inappropriate talent routine (a strip tease) by joining her on stage. Sexualizing a seven year old girl without her being developmentally able to understand it... mmm, that's comedy gold. This ""edgy material"" is about as palatable as a cup of bleach.I'm not one to look for messages but here we've got something like ""Let's all support each other as we swim up the cr*p river of life!""I'm sure it's supporters think I've missed the point and that the humor is just dark. It's not dark. Making a dark comedy is an art. This comedy has no edge in it's delivery. It's filmed straight. It's acted and presented ineptly. It's about as edgy as a smutty episode of Seventh Heaven. This is the rotten family-values homily to end them all. Drawing big saccharine payoffs to support a family values theme also places this squarely in mainstream whitebread entertainment.It makes perfect sense that idiotic Hollywood would nominate this tripe for a bunch of Oscars, but I can't believe I respect people who like this atrocity. The Oscars have become so gratingly self-impressed, and the nominees so limp, that all you can really do anymore is root against films you don't want to have any further influence on the culture. I am so glad it lost the Best Picture award last night; Today it starts a long descent to the bottom of time's toilet, exactly where it belongs, where it will be forgotten.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Amazing Family Comedy-Drama,"30 August 2006. This dynamite of an R-Rated family movie with plenty of swearing (like real life) has a powerful bang of both drama and comedy in such a short space of time, it's a fun balance between laughter and crying. Surprisingly, the stereotypical characters are well-suited to each other and never really overused. The storyline is solid, the acting entertaining and meaningful. The characters are symbolic of many of us. The only weaknesses would be the height of riotness of the action sometimes takes one aback, the lack of consequences at times, and the perhaps unrealistic final sequence (even though it had a nice consistent and involving twist). Silence is golden is well portrayed in one scene. Death is handled well in another. This is a delicious little bit of sunshine even in the worst of times. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Fun, absolutely entertaining, has a lot of delightfully strange characters.","It is rare to find a comedy as well done and interesting as this one. Generally, horror and comedy are the poor relatives of cinema, as they are usually low-cost productions of questionable quality. In this case, the film breathes quality. The script is extremely simple and based on an interstate trip that a very crazy family has to make so that Olive, the youngest of the clan, can participate in a child beauty contest that she loves.Comedy mostly depends on the unusual situations that the characters go through on their journey, which looks like an odyssey. And everything happens here, from problems with the van to a death. The movie may not even make us laugh out loud and it certainly won't, most of the time... but it will make us laugh. As important as the good construction of the comic scenes is the way the characters were thought and developed. And here the script was great: the family man is a motivational therapist who is terrible at what he does; the mother is honest, sincere, dedicated, but she is completely lost and desperate. Then there is the gay uncle who is a Proust fanatic and attempted suicide after being abandoned by his boyfriend, the older brother who is a enraged teen who hates everything and everyone, the brazen and perverse grandfather that no nursing home accepts and finally the sweet and gentle Olive. Oh, and we still have the yellow and white VW Type 2 van, which causes so many problems throughout the trip that it almost ends up becoming an addition to the cast.The actors were excellent and everyone put in a lot of effort. From the cast, where I immediately notice notable names, I would particularly highlight the excellent work of Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Toni Collette and Alan Arkin. Abigail Breslin, for me, is on another level. The film is truly hers. She is the protagonist, and she has done such a good job for a child actress that it is difficult to imagine that she will not have an excellent career in cinema if she continues to strive. Something that deserves some attention in this film are the dialogues and the lines. Despite the regular use of heavy words, the dialogues have real pearls, worthy of quote.The film won two Oscars (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor, for Alan Arkin), but was still nominated in the categories of Best Film and Best Supporting Actress (for Abigail Breslin, although she is the main actress in this film, I think ). It is a film that, in addition to everything I have mentioned, has very regular sets and costumes and also a decent cinematography, despite not being, notoriously, a film that draws attention by the production values.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Joyful ride 6/10,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a cute and beautiful movie. Of a family that is mostly broken, and that one ride across the country will help them fix their relationship and collect the pieces back together. A fun, funny, emotional and crazy adventure full of excitements along the way. When I first saw ""Captain Fantastic"" and later compared the two movies together I noticed how similar they are: a family crossing the country and facing challenges while also facing each other. The scene I loved most was the last dance sequence of the little girl Olive (Abigail Breslin). How she dances while her family joins her all together. It really gives a satisfaction to see this family reuniting after the quest they've been through. It also gives the movie somewhat of a closure. Tony Collet and Steve Carell are perfect and great actors. Alan Arkin has a great role and his lost gives the movie a turning point. For both the plot and family. I wasn't a big fan of the film but it took me a while to appreciate it. It is an emotional and good family story about breakdown and rebuild.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One Of The Best Movies Of Year,Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderful movie that is very touching and very hilarious. The best part is the characters and the acting. They earn all of their jokes and their chemistry together is just perfect. This family is so funny and the classic road trip set piece is pulled off very well with lots of good twists and turns. I saw it in a packed theater and people clapped when it was over. Lots of big laughs. All the jokes are earned and the script is excellent. Paul Dano has a great part and Greg Kinnear actually does a wonderful job as the Dad. Steve Carrell stands out in a large supporting role and a few parts got me choked up between the brother and the sister. It's a wonderful movie and very very enjoyable. Bravo!,9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

2006's Napoleon Dynamite!!!,"LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 2006 (TONI COLLETE, GREG KINNEAR, STEVE CARELL) DIRECTED BY: JONATHAN DAYTON & VALERIE FARIS ~ THE RUNDOWN: 'Little Miss Sunshine' is possibly the year's funniest film; a highly entertaining social commentary of originality and realism made with care. ~ When it comes to quirkiness and unintentional laughter it doesn't quite pack the wallop of Napoleon Dynamite, and even though the movie's funny in a satirical, realistic way instead of being goofy, it is comparable due to the pure originality and style of it in an increasingly formulaic genre plagued with clich√©s and stupidity. Also, it's really well shot and visually appealing. ~ It's true that people love to laugh at themselves; the best humor comes from simply observing ourselves, our families, our friends and the situations of the world that we live in. And, that's what 'Sunshine' does; as this family embarks on a troubled journey to help a family member take on her dreams it acts as a mirror that, through dialog, emotions, and comical situations, realistically reflects the silliness of our lives and the so-called horrors that haunt us on our road to death. Of course, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is indeed a little on the unlikely side at times and does side with conventionality quite a bit to get the necessary laughs, which isn't a bad thing because there's no reason to rely on quirkiness alone when you have brilliant acting and ingenious writing at your disposal. However, the only real negative aspect of the movie that comes to mind is the fact that it really is too depressing at times; this is after all a comedy, and its dramatics interfere too often with the film. ~ There's no doubt about it - this is a special movie...the type of movie that only comes around once a year on average, and is the type of the movie that when you see it, you know you're watching something unusually good. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, and depending on who you are, it'll be worth many more.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Winners Don't Give Up,"In Albuquerque, the housewife Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) brings her suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell) to the breast of her dysfunctional and bankrupted family. Frank is homosexual and expert in Proust, and tried to commit suicide when he was rejected by his boyfriend and his great competitor became renowned and recognized as number one in the field of Proust. Sheryl's husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is unsuccessfully trying to sell his self-help and self-improvement technique using nine steps to reach success, but he is actually a complete loser. Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence as a follower of Nietzsche and aims to be a jet pilot. Dwayne's grandfather Edwin (Alan Arkin) was sent away from the institution for elders Sunset Manor and is addicted in heroin. When her seven years old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) has a chance to dispute the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach, California, the whole family travels together in their old Volkswagen Type 2 (Kombi), in a funny journey of hope of winning the talent contest and make a dream come true.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a delightful comedy, supported by an original story about losers in the essence of the word, and alternating hilarious and dramatic situations. Greg Kinnear is amazing in the role of a man that does not walk the way he talks and ironically tries to sell a procedure to become what he is not able to reach: successful. His lines are simply excellent (I loved ""- Sarcasm is the refugee of the losers, trying to put the winners down."").

Simply Amazing,"This is a very original, enjoyable movie. It's typical indie cinema, with its flawed, realistic characters, the dark humor, the way it includes a lot of drama, it's a critic to our society and is unpredictable. The screenplay is simply amazing.The characters are all so well written, you easily rot for them and can identify with at least one. The dialogs are brilliant; you can perfectly see real people saying that, but at the same way it's so satirical and funny. The storyline has been seen many times, but the twists and the characters make it different from anything you've seen before. The introduction of the characters is so fascinating and beautiful that you immediately like them, despise all their flaws. The pace makes you be so hugely entertaining that it will seem that the movie took 5 minutes. The ending is just amazing, one of the best I've ever seen; so funny and dark.The direction is great, too. The wide shots on the highway are beautiful and full of life and energy. The close shots are really cute and some perfectly brilliant (Olive's introduction), and others very touching (Olive comforting Dwayne) and others satirical. The cinematography is full of light, but dirty too, which makes it look real. The music is perfect, as is its use.Now, we get to the acting. Abigail Breslin is the best. She has a screen presence, comic and dramatic timing, delivery of lines and an ability to touch you that are really unusual in a child actress. Besides, she looks like a real person, and that makes her character believable. Steve Carrel is very enjoyable, and even if his character is not really nice he makes you like him. His comic timing is brilliant, and you can feel his emotions in a really touching way. The third best was Alan Arkin. so funny, with such an original character stretched to the limits. You can only like him. Greg Kinnear is really funny, Toni Collette is realistic and equilibrates the movie, and Paul Dano has a perfect way of expressing emotions without barely speaking. This one is recommended.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Existential aspects of Little Miss Sunshine,"I first saw this movie before 3 years and comprehended it as a feel good movie, but then after a rewatch, I got to dissect the philosphical elements in the film. The movie explores loneliness, depression, suicide etc. The characters of Steve Carell (Frank) and Paul Dano (Dwayne) at the beginning condemning the suffering and hardship of life is transcended by them celebrating and coming in concordance with the suffering of life towards the end. The existential philosophical aspect of Nietzsche is employed in the film. Paul Dano's character inculcates Nietzsche's ubermensch principle and has his own unique moral rules transcending him from the common being. Steve Carell's character brings into limelight the fact that suicide is not the solution for the material sufferings in the world. He embraces the absurdity of life.Life is an austere amalgamation of joy and sorrow and the film towards the end explicitly portrays this. The idea of never giving up and kicking life in the ass is strengthened and catechized repeatedly by Greg Kinnear's (the father) character.The interconnectedness of humans and the notions of love, suffering and family are very much explored in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sweet, Clever and Modest","Little Miss Sunshine is a good-natured comedy with some decent laughs. I don't see any dark side to it, unlike some other reviewers; it never really develops true seriousness. Yet it does manage to avoid cheap laughs and stock gags. The film it most reminded me of was National Lampoon's Vacation. Not exactly Keaton or Tati, but on the other hand, if you want to make a funny family comedy you can do a lot worse than to channel Vacation. Notable performances by Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin, who are good individually and develop a lovely rapport. Also very good in the film is the running Proust-scholar business, which is exactly preposterous enough to be hilarious.

Great cast, great writing, patient directing (especially coming from two music video directors, although their videos are some of my favorites like Janet's ""Go Deep"" and all the Red Hot Chili Peppers videos they've done).Not to mention the directors were there for a Q & A at the promotional screening the other night. They are lovely people, and capable filmmakers and I hope this film does really well so they can have carte-blanche with their next film.

"Dark, with Steve shining","Sometimes it is worth watching a movie to experience aspects of its construction, even if the final product leaves one wanting at the end. This movie delivers on many counts, led by the acting by each of those cast in key roles in this dark comedy. Cast as one who recently attempted suicide, Steve Carell may surprise those who have come to expect him in over-the-top roles in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty and 40 Year Old Virgin. His portrayal of one who has hit the skids if fabulous. Little Abigail Breslin as Olive also holds her own alongside a cast of veteran actors.There's a kind of Napoleon Dynamite quality to this film, in the sense that it captures well the tedium (and humor) of everyday life for those who on the verge of falling through the cracks. The movie suggests that through all their faults, these family members stick together and continue to move forward. But their cohesiveness is required to be taken more on faith, than truly demonstrated in the story.By the end, one doesn't necessarily have the feeling that the characters have emerged entirely victorious over their demons, although they might have scored a few points in the battle.Back to the original point, this film strives for a level of complexity that few will. And it scores well in both the goal and most of that execution.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Truly, truly wonderful","Little Miss Sunshine is in a word, fantastic. If you want in more words, it is the story of a family's journey together; helping each other through their ups and downs and showing that although you may not have everything you want- that does not mean your required to be unhappy. It centres around the family of Richard Hoover ( Greg Kinnear ); a man whose '9 steps to becoming a winner' program is not only a job for him but a way of life. He is truly someone who brings his work home with him; much to the chagrin of his wife, Sheryl ( Toni Collette ) and his children Olive ( Abigail Breslin ) and Dwayne ( Paul Dano ) who has taken a vow of silence before he reaches his goal of becoming a pilot in the air force. Their world is turned upside down when Sheryl's brother Frank ( Steve Carell ) attempts to commit suicide, thus bringing him into the family as a precaution. Also there is Richard's dad ( Alan Arkin ) who was kicked out of a retirement home for snorting heroin.When the family's at the dinner table, the news comes that Olivia is invited to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California- which involves a road trip across the country.However this movie really proves the saying that the journey is as important as the destination, and it is proved by a great cast. But particular credit must go to Steve Carell as Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne- their scenes together seem to just move so naturally.Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that will help you out of whatever doldrums your in.

She normally doesn't enjoy dramas, so we both opted for this comedy, Little Miss Sunshine. What a delightfully cynical, yet ultimately big-hearted movie this was! Perhaps not hugely original in all its aspects (for example, Greg Kinnear's was a bit of a stock character...), though still very fresh, very funny and unexpectedly in the end, heart-warming without the least bit of schmaltz or manipulative slyness. It got better and better, culminating in some classic sequences by the last quarter.I left the cinema smiling at its ultimate message, a modern and more sensible twist on the usual ""American dream"" message (one of success as a means of measuring one's ultimate worth as a human being). As the suicidal, Proust-scholar uncle and his Nietzsche-loving nephew tell each other at one point, this movie believes that what ultimately really matters is that one should end up doing the things in life that really make one feel happy. A simple, but valuable message - one that could avoid so many neuroses if it were truly grasped by the vast majority of the world's population. Also, many of the movie's characters learnt that if it turns out you're not good enough for something - say, something you've been dreaming of achieving all your life - it usually means that that thing isn't actually good enough for YOU, and that you should hanker after something that's right and worthy of you. Basically, you can't fit a star-shaped peg into a heart-shaped hole. We can all be misled by the wrong dream, and it's all just a part of living this life to learn this, and move on - seeking out something that's more right for us, for the individual that WE are.The little girl actress who played Olive was adorable and never in a precocious brat kind of way - this is saying something, as I often have a problem with child-actors for this very reason. The characters were generally all great - and oh, the grand-dad! He did crack me up, as well as my grandmother! And the final scene in the last 10 minutes, with the whole family dancing to Olive's tune at that grotesque beauty pageant was good enough to give you a natural high, like visual cocaine. Here in Rome where I watched the movie, it had the whole cinema in stitches - and I went to the mid-afternoon showing with my grandmother, so it was mainly other grannies who were there! But even to them, that scene was exhilarating. An intelligent, fluffy yet non-superficial feel-good movie with a core of unexpected wisdom.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Equal Parts Heartwarming and Heartbreaking,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" is billed primarily as a comedic film, which does a disservice to the more dramatic aspects of Michael Arndt's brilliant script. And it takes the combined acting talents of Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, Steve Carell and young actors Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin to make this film one of the funniest and most heart breaking films of the year.After the standing beauty queen has to step down and not compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, seven year old runner-up Olive Hoover (Breslin) is asked to take her place. She has to get from Albuquerque, NM to Redondo, Calif. in order to compete. Her struggling self-proclaimed self-help guru father (Kinnear) drives their broken down VW bus with his wife (Collette), heroin snorting father (Arkin), suicidal, gay brother-in-law (Carell) and voluntarily silent step-son (Dano) in tow to get Olive to the pageant.It really says something when the most powerful and engaging performance in a film littered with such highly respected actors came from the 23 year old unknown Dano. And he had no lines till the last half hour. Dano's Dwayne Hoover embarked on a vow of silence till he was accepted into the Air Force flight training program, and at the time of the movie, he's been going for nine months. He's able to emote so much with just his facial and body expressions, and his little notebook. And then he just breaks your heart. It's so incredibly moving. I almost cried.But beyond the praise due to Dano, the whole cast worked together to construct a family that is forced to grow together during the 800 mile trip. And they all do. Kinnear shows us his tremendous range as an actor in one of his finest performances of his career, and the tremendously underrated Collette gets to showcase the talent that few of us have known for the past few years. But Carell, above them all, is worthy of praise. His career is following the same path of Jim Carrey, and I can only hope he's more lucky with the Oscar voters than Carrey has been.Arndt was able to resurrect a dying sub-genre of comedy, throw in some drama and score a hit with his first script. He constructed his script in a way that it was equal parts emotionally moving, uproariously funny and adorably heartwarming. It can do all of that in a span of 20 minutes. And luckily, he was able to pull that off, where as several before him failed.It's one of those films that is like a jigsaw puzzle. It only works because every aspect fits together. The writing works because of the fusion of drama and comedy, the acting works because the characters were the right ones for the actors to portray, and vice versa, the directing works because they had so much to work with. To have this film done any other way, but any other person or group of people just wouldn't have worked. The coming together of all the pieces is what made this great.From the actors to the writer, the film is littered with impressive rookie performances. But none more impressive than the feature film debut of Grammy winning husband-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They cut their teeth on music videos back in the early 90's when it actually meant something, and have patterned their transformation into the cinematic world after such new wave auteurs as Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry. If they don't fall into the Academy's good graces with ""Little Miss Sunshine"", they will eventually, I'm sure of it.I must fault production designer Kalina Ivanov for perpetuating the annoying trend of making the time setting ambiguous by mixing modern technology and culture with archaic and anachronistic set dressings and costumes. It was funny in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (barely) and two years later it's just sad.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Formulaic, But Very Funny.","For some reason, these kind of low-budget, indie comedies always remind me of Australian cinema. I had a similar feeling about 'Transamerica'. Maybe it's the suburban location shooting, or the broad slapstick comedy, or the idiosyncratic tackiness of the characters, or the dysfunctional family dynamic being played for laughs, or the feel-good 'heart of gold' ending, but all these films seem to be built around a comedy template established by 'Muriel's Wedding' over ten years ago. The presence of Toni Collette only reinforces the impression. It's not a bad thing, just something I'm reminded of every time I see the latest Sundance indie comedy.'Little Miss Sunshine' doesn't really offer anything new to the 'Muriel' template, but it is funny, often laugh-out-loud funny, which is no small feat. Beneath the often downright crude belly laughs is a social commentary of sorts reflecting on America's obsession with turning every aspect of life into a competition that by its very nature will have more losers than winners. It is this insight, and the genuine warmth and humanity with which it is delivered, that manages to make the sight of a seven year old girl doing a sleazy Superfreaky striptease hilarious, rather than disturbing.There have been several more powerful contenders for award recognition this year, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' represents the kind of feel-good, warm-hearted ensemble piece that the Academy often responds to, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if a few of those involved are reading their acceptance speeches in a few weeks time.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Little Gem.,"'Little Miss Sunshine' is the perfect antidote for all the homogenized films flooding the multiplexes at the moment. Directed by first-timers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and written by Michael Arndt, the film is constructed around Hollywood clich√©s, such as the underdog, road-movie, dysfunctional family, but remains fresh, honest and genuinely funny and touching. This is due, in no small part, to the fact happy endings and overt feel good statements are brushed aside for truth and awkwardness.Toni Collette is perfect, as one would expect, but it is Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear who show acting talent beyond expectations. Alan Arkin provides another solid performance as the wise, hippie grandfather, but it is the new guard of actors Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano who shine in my opinion. Breslin brings raw emotional honesty to her role of Olive and one never forgets she is a child, unlike if Dakota Fanning had tackled this role.'Little Miss Sunshine' is about family, identity, the search for meaning and purpose and how these fit into and relate to contemporary life. This is a film full of small detail which remembers to deal with the larger stuff. Unsentimental, but extremely moving, You'll leave the cinema feeling a little bit better.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disappointing,"I can't quite understand where this is coming from. It was listed as a comedy, but it really isn't funny at all - and in parts it's quite disturbing with it's portrayal of child beauty pageants. It is mildly amusing in parts, but no more than watching mad people walk by your window. The ingredients are all there - great cast, nice camera work, interesting characters ... but they've all been thoroughly over-produced. The film is bland, almost sleep-inducing. The only edge to this comes from the VW camper.I can see the quality behind it, but the end result just doesn't deliver. I was very disappointed, but I can understand why some people would love it. It's just not for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best dark comedies around,"Little Miss Sunshine is a little drop of sunshine of 2006. With a year that saw some of the best films to be released in awhile (Snakes on a Plane, The Wicker Man, and Bloodrayne just to name a few) Little Miss Sunshine stands helplessly against these awesome films. Little Miss Sunshine is a smart, delicately crafted, dark comedy about the common dysfunctional family of America.Olive is the only normal one of her family. Her brother has taken a vow of silence, her father is constantly obsessed with succeeding, her grandpa is a heroine addict, her uncle is suicidal, and her mother just tries to live through it all. All their personalities are thrown together when they must reach Los Angeles to get Olive to a beauty pageant.The story is very strong when presented with the right characters and actors. For an independent film, the strong cast brought together of no names and big stars a like is surprising. The story, which is predominantly inside the VW bus the re driving cross country in. There are no dull points however even with the characters restricted to their seats. There are some hilarious moments of awkwardness and just flat out funny scenes between Alan Arkan and the rest of the cast along with one particular classic moment between a cop and Greg Kinnear on the highway.Steve Carrell gives, in my opinion, his best performance to date as the laid back suicidal uncle. Everyone thinks of Carrell as a no-talent actor who just does comedy. It's a bad trend going on these days thinking comedy actors can not act. He proves with his role as Frank that he can act and still be funny.Alan Arkan is not an actor well known to me, I remember him from And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself but that was about it. Alan Arkan's character is the best of the film. He is dirty, he is strange, and he is hilarious. I wouldn't mind seeing Arkan in a lot more roles in the future.All the actors deliver great performances along with Carrell and Arkan. The little girl, Abigail Breslin, gives a great performance that has earned her an Osar nod. A lot of adults and teenagers a like will enjoy the dialogue between many of the characters and learn a lesson or two about being a family. Warning: this is not a film for families. The word f*ck is present numerous times. Do not show to kids under 14.Little Miss Sunshine. 4.5/5 Stars",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Some familiar trappings still can't tarnish the sunshine,"Taking the current crown for dysfunctional family ensemble work, Little Miss Sunshine is the most warped fun you will have with an eccentric clan since Family Stone or The Squid and the Whale. A little more predictable then the latter, slightly less naturally paced then the former, LMS still manages to be morbidly sweet in it's stereotypically indie manner. Following the exploits of the bitter unit, we are invited along for a road trip that will take this extended family 800 miles across the country in order to enroll their youngest daughter into a child beauty contest, essentially portrayed as a final bastion of hope for the ailing camaraderie between the members. Modeled, perhaps a little too closely, after the classic first National Lampoon's Vacation movie, Little Miss does sometimes suffer from these parallels as well as the predictability that all of these fractured personalities bring to the table. To see the fine cast working together to create this completely modern portrait of family though nearly compensates for any of the generic trappings the concluding part of the script might have succumbed to. Anyone in the mood for a dark comedy with it's fair share of heart will be far too entertained to point out the few but obvious flaws that forbid this movie from becoming another true inept family classic; the bus is leaving-get on in.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What is the point of this?,"This is the worst kind of by the numbers Hollywood junk saved only by a handful of competent scenes & some good acting from 2 of the cast. This is a pity, especially given the presence of Greg Kinnear who has shown his talent in the past.For a start Alan Arkin shaves his head, scruffs up & plays, a scruffy, bald Alan Arkin. He's the same in every movie I see him in & he bores me to tears. Will this guy ever take acting lessons & play a character for once that ISN'T him in jeans/ T-shirt... suit....army fatigues.... etc etc? Greg Kinnear plays a motivational speaker who's so afraid of ""losing' that he is unable to win. Sadly this is a common theme in the US today, few, if any, such saps stop to think that not everyone can be a millionaire (because your millions will become devalued by the cash all the other millionaires are throwing around) & not everyone can rise to the top (who would clean the streets & stock our supermarket shelves?) etc etc.The saddest thing about this pile of horse poo is it follows the same, old, tired, sexist line. See how all the male figures in the group are flakey in some sort of way. The son doesn't speak, the grandpa is a coke head & degenerate, suicidal Frank is... well suicidal, dad Richard is delusional about his motivational guff & so on. Only mommy holds things together, in a quiet, suppressed screaming way kind of way.It is completely to very tired & highly sexist formula.Olive, the daughter, seems almost like a doll dragged along, completely without any direction of hr own. Anyone can guess the outcome of her pageant appearance. Boring! Also predictable is the device of the dead body. This has been done a thousand times before & often a lot better, most notably in that laugh-until-you-need-oxygen Fawlty Towers episode.Correll as Frank shows some talent, completely different from any of his previous appearances (something Alan Arkin could learn about). Dano as Dwayne must have had a hard time not talking on camera his face having to carry much of his emotions, but his lines must have been real easy to learn. His eventual implosion/explosion was impressive too.Othe than that I see nothing new, it is an assembly of threads & scenes all seen & done before. Why on earth this is up for an Oscar I'll never know.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Wonderful Film,"I had been yearning to see Little Miss Sunshine for quite a while and was thrilled when it came to the theater at which I work. They usually send us mainstream blockbuster crapola, and snub their noses to independent films, but succumbed to the rave reviews and high demand for this one.Those rave reviews are well earned, as Little Miss Sunshine towers above nearly every other film I've seen this year, across all genre boundaries. It manages to be dark, hilarious, and touching and uplifting, and surprisingly, none of these moods conflict or step on the other's toes. It shifts gears (pun intended) quite well among themes.If you know absolutely nothing of the plot and wish to, stop at the end of this paragraph. Everything said below is revealed in the first couple of minutes of film, if not in trailers and TV spots.The basic plot follows a somewhat dysfunctional family. Greg Kinnear plays Richard Hoover, a father of two and struggling motivational speaker. His wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette) takes in her brother, Frank, a top Proust scholar after his failed suicide attempt. Dwayne is 15, and a mute by choice, and Olive is 7 and finds out that due to a beauty pageant scandal, she has been crowned the winner of the Little Miss Chili Pepper Pageant in Alberquerque, and is eligible to go to California to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. Her grandfather (Alan Arkin), a loud, somewhat crass and oddly insightful old man helps her craft her routine. The bulk of the film takes place on the ensuing road trip taken by the six family members in their old, broken down, yellow VW Hippie Bus.This film is really nothing short of spectacular. It takes a good hard look at a family so different from each other, but so strongly united by both blood and events. That look also happens to be hilarious, but the film would have probably worked if they worked the screenplay as a drama as well. It is amazingly well written, clever and original. It works a lot of pretty deep themes with some cheaper gags. One of the best revolves around the clutch of the VW Bus. Alan Arkin provides some of the films funniest moments. His character is great.The Bottom Line: Go see this film, now. Everything about it clicks, and I doubt there will be a better dark comedy this year. You can thank me later for recommending it.Seriously, I expect written thanks.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
And I thought my family was dysfunctional.,"I don't think anyone can watch Little Miss Sunshine and think their family can be dysfunctional. Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet marvel. It's written very realistically when it comes to family, Although, the script isn't not a perfect script. Some things feel too forced and Sundace film festival-ish. Very good, funny script, but I think it tries too hard at times. Even with some cheesy plot points in the script, the direction makes it realistic (in the present). The acting is terrific from the entire ensemble. Steve Carrell steals the show here. He's used to the obnoxious comedy we see on The Office, but he dials down here and turns in a fantastic performance that should have been nominated at the Oscars instead of Arkin. Arkin does a fine job, but I feel like he is victim to a one-note role. Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are also quite good here as well. Overall, it's a nice little comedy that leaves some good after-thought; A Solid 8.",,Anonymous,Comedy
An Innocent Little Movie,"Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that only functions because of its characters. The plot is simple, the setting is simple, and there are no camera tricks--but the characters are real. From the first scene, the film already influences the viewer into forming conceptions about each character, judging them. But then, the movie is about a girl whose family travels from afar for the sole purpose of having her judged. As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that each character has both serious flaws and valuable social qualities; save for Olive, who is very young and has not yet been corrupted by her peers. The viewer should feel somewhat mixed feelings for many of the characters as he/she reexamines the preconceived judgments from the beginning. The final parts of the movie brilliantly display Olive's innocence and how her family attempts to preserve it. Because Olive's situation is known to the viewer, the viewer can empathize with the family at the end of the movie and realize the arrogance of the judges, as well as the lost innocence of the other ""Little Miss Sunshine"" participants.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

You see those around her, eccentric, mean and very fallible family members and friends. This is also a film about family. No Hollywood ending here, actually pretty real as real can get on film. Also what's real is the little girl, I just loved her because she WAS a little girl and when you see this film that's one of the main things that stuck in my head, especially after she gets to the beauty pageant.Warm, remarkable, slice of Americana and the illusions of wishes, fame, and trying with all of your heart for a positive outcome in a negative, every man for themselves world.

They are not alike. AT ALL. They are not even remotely similar. I disliked Napoleon Dynamite, but that is besides the point. I cannot stand it when people start comparing two things that certainly do not fit into the same category.Anyway, this was a good movie in my opinion. It was very entertaining, and it is an exaggeration of something most people can relate to. It is cute and witty, and it won't kill you to give it a try. Litttle Miss Sunshine is one of these movies about a dysfunctional family, and it contains a funny clich√© cast of characters, each with their own unique and identifiable symbolic qualities. There is the gay guy, the chubby little girl, the emo kid, the dad who tries to live through his children, etc.. The comedy in this film is not aimless and idiotic. It all revolves around a clear storyline with a simple start to finish plot that is easy to follow while you sit back and enjoy the comedy.When you watch this, if the first comparative movie that comes to your mind is Napoleon Dynamite, then you are probably thinking about Napoleon Dynamite while you eat your breakfast and go to work as well.

The best road movie in years,"Don't be put off by the title. This comedy about a dysfunctional American family, (father, mother, grandfather, gay uncle, son who has taken a vow of silence and the tyke who wants to enter the eponymous contest), is anything but cute. If the feel-good factor goes all the way up to ten, the yuck factor is a pleasing zero. The precedents for this film aren't those appalling Adam Sandleresque comedies about errant dads bonding with kids left on doorsteps but the best American TV comedies going at the moment, such as ""Curb Your Enthusism"" and ""Arrested Development"".The Hoovers are the family in question and they are thrown together at very close quarters when they take to the road in a battered VW van on route to California so their youngest can enter the Little Miss Sunshine contest for which she is being coached by heroin snorting granddad, (Alan Arkin, brilliant). Inevitably things don't go as planned, (the film takes a nicely dark turn about midway through), but in the course of the journey lessons are learned and people whose lives were previously lived in isolation suddenly find themselves bonding in a very unlikely manner. But as I've said, don't let this put you off if, like me, children, animals and the American nuclear family are high on your hate list. Thanks to a cracker of a script by Michael Arndt, nicely observed direction from newcomers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and a terrific cast, this hits the spot every time.As the parents at permanent loggerheads, Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are on career-best form while Steve Carell as the suicidal gay uncle manages to create a completely believable, likable, living, breathing, hurting human being totally devoid of caricature and as the little girl with hopes of finding herself in the big bad world of kiddies' beauty pageants, Abigail Breslin is a revelation. Best of all, not only is ""Little Miss Sunshine"" the best 'family' orientated comedy in years but it's also a very welcome addition to that recently defunct staple American genre, the road movie.

Chasing the American dream in a van with a bad clutch,"Abigail Breslin hopes to be ""Little Miss Sunshine"" in this 2006 film also starring Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, and Paul Dano, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.The story concerns the efforts of the Hoover family to get the younger child, Olive (Breslin) to Redondo Beach to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. They can't afford to fly, nor can they leave Uncle Frank (Carell), the gay, suicidal brother of Sheryl Hoover (Collette) alone; they certainly can't leave him with Dwayne, Olive's brother, who hasn't talked in 9 months; Sheryl can't drive a stick shift; profane, porn-loving, heroin-snorting Grandpa (Arkin) has to go because he's coached Olive in her routine. So the whole family piles into the van to drive the 700 miles with dad (Kinnear), who pushes and preaches a program called 9 Steps to Winning, at the wheel.With an absolutely absurd, hilarious, and wonderful original script by Michael Arndt, this small film (costing $8 million) proved to be a mega-hit, and deservedly so, as the Hoovers realize that through all the dysfunction and disappointment, there's love, loyalty, and a sense of togetherness. The performances are fantastic. Toni Collette, as the mother who tries to keep it all together, again proves she should be up there with Meryl Streep. Greg Kinnear, as a frustrated, broke loser trying to sell his 9 steps to a publisher, gives a poignant performance, conveying the impression of being down - but never defeated. Arkin is hilarious. As the two odd men out, Paul Dano and Steve Carell are great, both realizing that despite abject misery and heartbreak, they're not as alone as they thought.As Olive, a normal-looking little girl with a paunchy stomach who wants to be a beauty queen amidst a sea of what looks like miniature hookers, Abigail Breslin gives an honest, sweet, and natural performance. Grandpa told her she's beautiful, and she is.A don't miss film that proves that sometimes, even without the material trappings of success, you have lots more than you think.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

You don't get better suffering than this,"Melodramatic comedy has developed a new subgenre - the dysfunctional family film. Sure, there have been precursors to The Royal Tannenbaums, the Turnblads of Hairspray, The Addams Family and the Hoovers of Little Miss Sunshine, but with the advent of the euphemism ""independant film"" film-makers can now at least pretend to deal more openly, intelligently and humorously with taboo subjects that you'll never see on The Brady Bunch. Even if it now seems necessary to make a film with an 8 million dollar budget appear to be independent.Little Miss Sunshine is a really nice little film. It follows the misadventures of a family on the brink of bankruptcy, divorce, suicide, death and general angst as they journey from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach to enter their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) into a beauty contest. There are several very funny moments, but the film reaches deeper levels than most comedies and thankfully avoids insulting its audience's intelligence like most contemporary comedies do.The script is exceptionally good. The directing and editing are fine and the cinematography is excellent.The ensemble cast is terrific and each character is very carefully written. Although the characters are very consistent they are anything but shallow and one-dimensional. You will probably feel as if you've met them - and this feeling is one of the keys to enjoying this film.About 28 years ago, a friend of mine said to me that ""everybody's problems are the biggest problems in the world to them."" Taken in its proper context, this simple truth has helped me understand the structure of personal tragedy - which is the philosophical core of this film - nicely summarized by Steve Carrell's character in his discussion of Marcel Proust near the end of the film. And I don't just mean that what does not kill you makes you stronger. This film packs a better, simpler, and more profound message than this clich√© can express.Recommended - especially for people who sometimes forget to enjoy their lives.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why didn't I like it?,"I didn't like this movie. There, I said it. I feel better now. This movie came highly recommended and I had big expectations. Maybe that was the problem.Movies like this are character driven. We must care about the characters. We must believe the characters. The only character I believed was the little girl. The rest seemed contrived: Crazy grandad, neurotic mom, disassociated brother, depressed uncle, blah, blah, blah. Seen it a hundred times before.I'm really surprised indie movie nuts liked this. Are we forgetting what good character development is?",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Winning isn't everything -,"Amongst other things Little Miss Sunshine is a delicious satire on the Western (and especially American) cultural obsession with winning at all costs. The American dream says that you can be born in a log cabin with nothing and through your efforts become rich and famous ¬ñ especially famous. The culture of celebrity and success is so powerful that it has created a complex tiered hierarchy of achievement and at every level there is competition. There have to be winners and losers. So at the beginning of the movie we have Richard's banal and cringe-making seminar on the ""Nine steps to winning"" and we learn that for him the world is divided between winners and losers. Ghastly though this over-simplistic and shallow pitch is, those of us who have worked in the business world know that it isn't very far removed from the reality of much management training. There is always another snake oil salesman around the corner! A quick Google search finds ""Nine steps to building a winning sales organisation"", ""Nine steps to better Telecoms service"", ""Nine steps to managing change"" and many more such magic solution guides! The trouble with Richard's programme is not that it is vacuous, but that he can't sell it ¬ñ the book deal is elusive and he is on the point of bankruptcy. The teacher on ""winning"" is about to become a loser.I have always thought that one of the reasons that soccer has never really taken off in the United Sates (unlike the rest of the world) is that soccer games can end in a draw (a tie) and that unless an artificial tie-breaker is introduced there does not have to be a winner in a soccer match. In all American sports winning is everything ¬ñ as American Football Coach Vince Lombardi said ""If winning isn't everything why do they keep the score?"" Well if you keep the score for the Hoover family then they don't come out too well. Richard is a business failure, Sheryl a divorc√©e, Dwayne hasn't spoken for nine months and is lost in Nietzsche, Grandpa is a foul-mouthed drug user, Frank a failed suicide ¬ñ only seven-year-old Olive is an achiever. Victorious in the New Mexico ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest she now wants to go to the national final in California and the family decide to go together in their clapped out camper van. The events that take place on the road eventually bond this dysfunctional group of no hopers into a team ¬ñ they work together at first because they have to, and then because they want to.When we eventually get to California and the full horror of the talent contest begins to be seen we view that horror through the eyes of the family. For the contestants' parents, the audience and (above all) the organisers they see is nothing wrong in dressing up little girls in adult clothes so that they all look like Barbie dolls each of who has a barely disguised, and wholly inappropriate, ersatz sexuality. That Olive is different and that, despite her family, she is a refreshingly normal child serves to show up the amoral hideousness of the ""winning is all"" society ¬ñ especially when it is applied to young children.The dichotomy between those like Richard who thinks that winning is everything and his father who is older and wiser is shown in their different approaches to Olive's wish to go to the contest. Richard says to her ""There is no sense in entering the contest if you don't think that you are going to win"" but Grandpa says ""A real loser isn't someone who doesn't win¬Öit is someone so afraid of not winning they don't even try"". But the true winners in the story are not the individuals but the family unit. Their individual values, priorities and behaviour may be questionable but in the end they triumph in spite of this. As co-director Valerie Faris says the film is ""¬Ö not about family values, but about the value of family"".",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The inspirational effect of ""Rocky"" combined with the irresistible charm of an early-season Simpson episode ...","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is one of these unexpected gems like only Cinema can produce and definitely, one of the most defining and endearing films of the last decade.I so would have loved to see the independent-spirited underdog win over the conveniently acclaimed Scorsese's ""The Departed"" but 30 years after ""Rocky"", times have changed, and there's no place for 'little' movies anymore. But since I learned one thing from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is to see the bright side of life, I'm confident that in 30 years, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" will be regarded as an immortal classics with the same appeal than ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Back to the Future"" and the picture of the family running and jumping in the yellow Peugeot van as one of the most iconic of American cinemaWhen Family films were reduced to a bunch of sappy moralizing dramas or brainless comedies where kids outsmart the parents, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" resurrected the genre with a sweet, touching and intelligent comedy-drama involving a dysfunctional but united family, the Hoovers and an inspiring but not patronizing message about 'winning'. I hope the non-fans won't take the comparison too literally but I found that the film had the same appeal than a touching Simpson episode from the earlier seasons, and I guess my reference is also inspired by the heart-warming yellow that defines the film's sunny mood, putting a little sunshine in our hearts with so many touching moments. More than the triumph of a film, it's the triumph of a spirit, conveyed by a beautiful score and a clever Oscar-winning script.What's the secret of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", the special little thing that makes the difference? I believe the movie's greatness relies on the performance and the characterization of Olive, by Abigail Breslin, so naturally balanced between smartness and innocence that the perfect note was found to provide a character the kids could identify with. Breslin plays a little girl excited to be selected in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest, which might be surprising because this kind of competitions are infamous for having girls posing and acting like 'little women'. But Olive is determined, she prepared a secret number with Grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin), Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) preaches the concept of winning in his conferences and Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the kind of loving mother that would do anything to please her daughter. Olive is the emotional core of an order that would collapse without her.Indeed, without Olive, the whole unity and solidarity of the family is undermined, the grandpa is a foul-mouth and pervert old man, the father is alienated by his own theories, Dwayne, Olive's brother has made a vow of silence to fulfill his dream to become a pilot and expresses the thoughts of his implosive anger in a notebook and Frank, the step-brother, played by Steve Carell, is a homosexual literature expert with suicidal impulses and as he loves to remind, the number one fan of Marcel Proust. And it's up to Sheryl, the mother to deal with all these personalities in the road to the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest, and the plot is so well constructed that they all must go together, starting a touching road movie in which all these egos, all these stories' arcs will converge with each member of the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" family having one moment to shine, through laughs, cries, breakdowns ¬Ö poignant outbursts of strong and vulnerable humanity.And this leads to the other secret of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", it's a movie for outsiders. In the road, it's hard to imagine that this cute chubby girl with glasses stands a chance in a beauty pageant, but in a way, we don't really care about the result, since we already have in mind that the film isn't about winning, it's about letting your little voice be heard. And in the family, each one represents a part of human personality that finds something difficult to communicate, the frustrated number two, the insecure teenager, the blinded know-it-all, the grumpy old guy, they are less stereotypes than representations of the little differences that poison the lives but enrich the world, or vice versa. And when Olive is confronted to the girls in the pageant, we realize how the girls all look identically 'artifical' while Olive is clearly the only visible one.""Grandpa, am I pretty?"" candidly asked Olive. This question touched something deep in my heart as it summarizes our own fear of not being accepted. Olive is confronted to a double dilemma, losing because she wouldn't be pretty, and disappointing her father, Grandpa's answer is simple, and remains as one of the truest words of wisdom ever spoken in a film. A loser isn't someone who doesn't win but someone who doesn't do anything because he's afraid of losing. And with that idea on mind, we're already confident about little Olive, and only wish that she would have the opportunity to express herself in the pageant, the result doesn't really matter ¬Ö didn't I mention the similarity with ""Rocky"" by the way?But all the inspiring messages of the world would be meaningless if they didn't have great movie moments to immortalize them, and like the iconic finale of the 1976 Best Picture, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" ends in an apotheosis, when we finally discover Olive's secret number. The musical climax is the movie's highlight and the best illustration of its positive message. At the end, all the members of this unforgettable Hoover family have corrected some aspects of their life's conception, and so we did.To conclude, whether it's about winning and losing, one thing the movie would surely win is your heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little Miss Sunshine,"The six members of the Hoover family, Sheryl (the over-worked, stressed mother), Richard (the failed motivational speaker obsessed with winning, and Sheryl's husband), Dwayne (the avowedly mute Nietzsche-reading son with aspirations to be a pilot), Frank (Sheryl's homosexual, suicidal Proust scholar sibling), Grandpa (the heroin-snorting grandparent) and Olive (the beauty queen wannabe who is a contestant in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant) must travel from Albuquerque to California in a struggling canary yellow mini-bus.As you can see, the characters are an elaborate set up for the most dysfunctional road-movie family ever, and a chance to milk some hefty laughs from the audience. The characters are played respectively by Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin. Now, there are some reasonably well-known faces in that list, which, initially, makes the family less believable as a collective. As the film progresses, the family becomes more believable as a unit.Now, I thought I would lay out the main criticisms of the film for you, to help you make your decision on viewing this film:The set ups - The ridiculous situations the characters get themselves into. The film's classification as dramedy (drama/comedy) allows for film to switch between hysterical situations and poignant moments at a second's notice. I've read comments on IMDb that say the film was desperately trying to pack two years worth of drama and belief-suspending comedy into two days, which is how the film feels, with its emotional state fluctuating constantly.Grandpa's habit - Grandpa has been kicked out of his old folk's home because of his habit, and that's why he is along for the ride in the film. Little does the Hoover family know, Grandpa has brought his habit with him. Some people aren't aware when they watch the film that the rest of the family *doesn't know* that Grandpa has heroin with him. Now, Grandpa is very close to Olive, his granddaughter, after all - he taught her the moves for her dance piece at the pageant.I've read many complaints here that Grandpa is the most irresponsible and sick grandfather, because of his addiction and why didn't the family confiscate his heroin? Well, they didn't know for a start. Next question? What kind of parent lets their heroin-addicted father share a hotel room with their daughter? Well if you don't know that he is still using heroin, then it seems okay to let them stay together - especially if the grandfather is her coach and closest family member.I think this film was so over-hyped that people find fun in its flaws, even if the flaws can be accurately explained. The same thing happened to 'Titanic' - people hate it when a film gets too popular, because somehow increased popularity equals decreased credibility?Anyway, the message of the film in the end is life-affirming, and if you've relaxed during the film, you'll walk out with a smile. The film is not a masterpiece, that's why I rated it 8/10, but it certainly isn't bad and 'Little Miss Sunshine' deserves all its critical praise, simply for being a quality movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

But the musics stay pretty cool.Abigail Breslin (Olive) plays perfectly the r√¥le of the harmless child.We recommend this film because it's a great film. That's an uncomplicated movie.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Sometimes the simplest stories make the best films,"Music video directors Jonathan Dayton's and Valerie Faris' film debut is fun family fluff at its best ¬ñ albeit hardly top 250 list material. I was going to give Little Miss Sunshine a ""7"" when I returned from the theatre, but then I saw that it had departed from its position on the prestigious list and I therefore feels it deserves an ""8"". That is hardly a very balanced way of rating a film, but just this once I hope you see where I'm coming from.Certainly the simple plot outline should be cemented in everyone's mind by now from seeing so many trailers of a swooshing yellow van that is literally unable to slow down because of a manual shifting problem that there's neither time nor money to fix. In the front seat is the eternal optimist dad and the responsible mom. Cut to the backseat where the cynical suicide-attempter and Proust-scholar uncle sits, along with the 'difficult' teenage son. Then there's a sex-crazed old grandpa who has been kicked out of his retirement home for using drugs. Oh, and then there's Olive. Their goal? Reach the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California.It seems as though the vast majority of mainstream moviegoers have crowned 'Little Miss Sunshine' their top movie of the year. Although I would not go that far, it needs to be said that it is often viciously funny, sweet, touching and quirky. Dayton and Faris blend kooky indie and mainstream entertainment with deft strokes. It is owing to this fresh mix of highlights that the film is able to channel considerable warmth in the midst of tragedy and for that I applaud it. Paul Dano in particular cater to the emotional part, and he does it better than anyone else. By contrast, for comedy, there is the ever-reliable and hysterically funny Steve Carell. No description will do his deadpan humour justice. He is the film's comedic goldmine.If you want to nitpick, Little Miss Sunshine occasionally falls prey to predictability, arguably owing to its simple template plot. Never does it stray from the latter; there are no twists, turns, detours or diversions that truly jump out and grab you, aside from perhaps the grandfather storyline. My theatre audience was also highly unresponsive and the subconscious bandwagon effect resulted in many jokes to fall flat. This would not have been an issue with a flawless film. But alas, these minor shortcomings do not detract much from an otherwise solid and fun little film that, best of all, makes no pretense about its status.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little Ray of Sunshine,"This film made me smile, laugh and cry, filling a satisfying gap between a flamboyant feel good comedy and a gritty family drama. For fans of comedy/adventure, this film is the one for you and is a must-see if you enjoyed 'Millions' or 'Son of Rambow' as it blends the different shades of genre into a beautiful sunny yellow film. It will brighten up your view of the world and let in a ray of much needed happiness into your life.The Hoover family is a cleverly created, dysfunctional family by Michael Arndt, Jonathon Dayton and Valerie Faris, who intrepidly go on a seven hundred mile road trip in desperation to take their daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) to a beauty pageant. The family, combined with Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) a brilliantly played suicidal businessman who's Sheryl Hoover's brother and Dwayne Hoover, portrayed amazingly by Paul Dano, Sheryl's son, who has a burning hatred for all his family and refuses to speak, battle their way through an army of problems, all for one goal. But will they get there in time? 'Little Miss Sunshine' combines a variety of non-diagetic, instrumental music throughout the film to successfully shine a picture of carefree optimism onto the storyline, often being used in place of dialogue to create a refreshing atmosphere. This technique is used especially well right at the beginning of the film when the characters are introduced through a series of close ups and expert extreme close ups, to make the audience instantly aware of them. Introducing the characters without having them talking makes the beginning very effective.The realism of the film's narrative also burns interest: many of the problems the family encounter boldly reflect the lives of you and me, enabling people aged between fifteen and forty five to relate some of their experiences to those of the characters. But what makes this film really stand out from the usual crowd of perfectly packaged productions, is the fact that none of the characters have their acting talents crushed under a mountain of disguise. They are portrayed as ordinary human beings and the actors represent them as naturally as they live, unlike most films which constantly churn out polished plastic dolls.Without the characters, the film would fall flat on its face. Each one seems to be amazingly crafted to fit together into a captivating film. Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is portrayed as a young girl whose dreams are to win beauty pageants. Her colourful costume combined with her blissful sanguinity of the world around her, complete the narrative of the film and gives it a purpose and something to revolve around. Her character makes the film a must-see for reformers as she offers a different view on the world that not every adult can see; lighting up otherwise dark situations.At the start of the film, you are plunged right into the centre of the storyline, which completely disorientates you. But this problem is ingeniously solved by the introduction of the character Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) who, like the audience, acts as an observer of the family who adds a subtle blend of comedy as he goes along.The happy rays of light that the film casts are quite often punctured by the bad language which tumbles out of the characters' mouths, which slightly damages the feel-good, happy genre the film creates, but it does show that not everything in life is perfect; the film included!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, unusual movie ...","I really didn't know what this movie was about beyond that it had something to do with child beauty pageants. Very quickly the movie with its unusual characters grew on me and I was anxious to see where it would end up.The movie is basically about a family driving their daughter to a regional kiddie beauty contest - it's a real long drive and the family members (grandfather and uncle included) are all dysfunctional. It's anything but smooth driving!This movie is more drama than comedy. There are lots of amusing moments throughout the movie, but they are all against the backdrop of disconcerting family situations and pent-up emotions. The mix of the two is very well done. The movie is both funny and intense.Without a doubt, this is a character-driven movie and the characters are all interesting and very well acted. In fact, they are very unusual characters, but that made them all the more over-the top and interesting. Within the first 20 minutes, I realized that I was really interested in all the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them next. The all-star cast was really worth it.If you're in the mood for good humorous character-driven drama, this will fit the bill.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Before you ask, yes, I'm the control freak father, OK?

The little girl in this is simply divine. I still can't work out how someone who's seven in the movie (so, what? a young-looking nine-year-old?) can act so well.

Definitely a ray of sunshine,"This wry, subversive and amusing take on the American family and child beauty contests is 100 minutes of sheer enjoyment. It's also proof of the saying that good art does not come from nowhere. The directors, husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, have never made a feature movie before, yet have had 20 years experience making commercials and MTV programs. There is no really big-name star but the actors are mostly very experienced (and well chosen) - even 9 year old Abigail Breslin as Olive is an experienced child actor. The production history was convoluted and the picture came very close to not being made on several occasions. The result is an almost perfectly realized comedy with hardly a surplus line which leaves a warm afterglow in audiences.There were dysfunctional fictional American families before the Hoovers and the Hoovers themselves are not particularly freaky. It's actually seven-year old Olive who wants to be a beauty queen. Mum (Tony Collette) is pre-occupied with the welfare of her brother Frank (Steve Carell) a Proust scholar who recently attempted suicide after losing his lover and his job. Dad (Greg Kinnear), a struggling motivational counseller, doesn't spot Olive on his emotional radar until he sees her as a way of proving the effectiveness of his nine-points to success program. Crude old Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is supportive, and does some coaching, in between snorting heroin. Teenage brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), aspiring USAF pilot immersed in a Nietzschean silence, is an unwilling passenger on the VW Microbus to the grand contest at Redondo Beach, California. So we have a family comedy, a road movie, and a sharp dig at the American obsessions with youth and success, not to mention the authoritarian bureaucracies that infest the land of the free.Despite the fun in getting there, via the interstates, gas stations and highway patrols, the climax of the movie is undoubtedly the pre-teen beauty pageant. Here the directors managed to persuade real contestants in real such contests to do their stuff, and some of it is frighteningly professional ¬ñ at least one gymnastic act by an 8 year old would qualify for the Olympics. Olive's act is not in the same class, but she brings the house down nonetheless, to the great discomfort of officialdom. Needless to say she doesn't win, but the family walks (or rather runs) away together, more united than before.Pre-teen beauty contests are an ugly business and the murder case of Jo-Benet Ramsay was a reminder of the unwholesomeness of it all, but the film-makers here play it straight ¬ñ what you see is what the fans get - and you can form your own view about what these contests tell you about American popular culture and mores. But you needn't worry about the message ¬ñ there are enough pure laughs here to justify the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Cute without ever really committing itself to anything, the film enjoys its diverting road movie approach and  its quaint laughs but is difficult to get too excited about.","Six people in a bright yellow VW camping van, each of them as wildly different to the next, travelling and therefore forced into being thrust together as they journey to California for something. One's a suicidal academic; one's a disgruntled elderly man; one's a rebellious, frizzy haired adolescent who's refusing to speak; one's a middle of the road housewife; one's an easy-going, likable husband and father who's just trying to do the best for those he loves and one's a girl of about ten whom thinks the world is her oyster. There you go, there's your pitch and such a wildly uneven premise to a film is only fitting given how sporadic and only mildly diverting Little Miss Sunshine really is. The idea is you pick the character you see most representative of you, and map onto them as they all plough on together.The film is good natured but it's ultimately a little flat and uninvolved, relying on comedic content that I didn't find so comedic and a rich amount of symbolism representing what these people are thinking and feeling, the kind of which we are all able to figure out anyway. Take the instance early on, for example, in which Frank (Carell), housewife Sheryl's (Collette) suicidal brother, sits deathly alone in a hospital area after a recent bout of suicidal ideation; the camera situated so as to capture how it is he feels and where he is in life; or later on, in which, whilst meeting a business cohort by a swimming pool somewhere, father and husband Richard (Kinnear) talks of how he's struggling but really trying to wade through all the issues and problems his life skills company has hit as a completely unrelated person swims by, or wades by, in the water, systematically representational of his own plight. The film likes the idea of linking commonplace places and events onto a wider spectrum of struggle, manifested within its lead characters.I think I was supposed to feel surprised; be humoured; feel angered and then rather pleased at most of what happens in Little Miss Sunshine, throughout. The film sees young Olive (Breslin), youngest of the Hoover family based in New Mexico, pine to be an entrant into a beauty contest in California; something that everyone eventually all agrees in heading off to. Being a road movie of sorts, the film is given all kinds of reasons to have all manner of wacky items crop up to bulk out the runtime and deliver a few feint laughs along the way. Yes, they get partially lost; yes, they're pulled over by the police and yes, the van does indeed break down, that then resulting in a rather annoying reoccurring gag that sees them have to keep it in a consistent state of motion so as to avoid having to kill the ignition. Once you've mapped yourself onto either the screwy, oddball, Nietzsche reading son Dwayne (Dano) if you're of that ilk; or the toothy, smiley, beaming Sheryl if you're of that ilk; or the disgruntled elderly gentleman Edwin (Arkin) if you're of that ilk, then there's no limit in the manner of fun you may or may not have in watching these wacky misadventures unfold.Despite it having its characters roll along toward their destination, the film is almost certainly circular in its structure; allowing a number of the characters to progress from various states to otherwise different. One character is alive and well prior to the trip, but dead by the time it's concluded; the same with another character of whom remains mute for most of the duration, but undergoes a discovery and we observe how that changes him whereas someone else has a definitive dream at the start but realises they were well out of their depth when the time comes to live it. The respective arcs are sweet enough, harmless in their basic establishing; evolving and then placing into a newer order but it's little more than mildly engaging. The writer, a certain Michael Arndt, is, I think, a little worried that all the wavy, messy content will bury what it is he wants to say and that's highlighted in a scene between two characters whom share the piece's moment of pure exposition: a sequence in which, standing on a pier with the wide open ocean behind them, they speak of life and life being what you make it and that one needs to suffer in order to journey or learn. The seemingly endless ocean behind them acting as a clear representation of the great unknown, a link to what unknown delights await you within the vast mass of everything.The film is a wavy and sporadic effort; desperately wanting the quirky fact they're all travelling to where they're going in a bright yellow VW van to attain a sort of instantly recognisable, if not 'cult', status. Along the way, the film will provide a range of wacky scenes which ought to feel more heartfelt than they actually are when Edwin, the eldest character, who it's established is a drug addict, passes on advice to the youngest in Olive and takes on a kind of mentor role but it just comes off as a little creepy more than anything. The film tackles death as an issue and how it affects families when a certain character is removed from the text but does so with a pinch of salt rather than with a full blooded exploration of any kind. In short, it's a mildly diverting road picture hybrid which is a little off colour in tone but with a few laughs; certain instances contained within demonstrate directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' eye for film-making and this was clearly a project that they were really up for, but the film does too much if anything; wildly chopping from one locale to another and cramming too many characters doing and experiencing too much, all of which mysteriously combines into something rather underwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Proof that it's OK to be different,"God, I am so glad I let my guard down for this movie, when I saw the poster for Little Miss Sunshine at the movie theater, it seemed like a lame movie and when I saw the excellent rating here on IMDb, I figured it was one of those movies that only the artsy people got because I hadn't seen any of the trailers for Little Miss Sunshine, so I didn't want to bother. But when I was renting movies I guess I could just give the movie a chance, like I said, it was such a good rating on IMDb, for the most part, some of the movies on the top 250 are pretty good.Little Miss Sunshine is about this family who has just brought their suicidal relative to live with them and when the little girl, Olive, wins by default to be in the Little Miss Sunshine contest in California, the 9-step obsessed father, the nice and honest mom, the silent son, the perverted grandpa, the hard working little girl, and the suicidal man all take a bus cross country to get to this pageant. But of course there are always... well... little bumps along the way.Little Miss Sunshine was such a terrific movie because it wasn't just the acting, but it seemed like the real American family that everyone could relate to in one way or another.

Comedy is forced and the plot implausible,"In real life dysfunctional families can cause immense pain to their children which may last a lifetime. In the movies, however, dysfunctional families are just eccentric rogues who, beneath their harsh exterior, can be as lovable as puppy dogs. No matter how dysfunctional they appear at the beginning, we sense that by the end of the movie, they will be dancing in a circle. Case in point ¬ñ Little Miss Sunshine, a heartwarming Indie comedy by first time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris which has received much critical acclaim. The film is a funny and entertaining romp which tackles America's obsession with winning and, in the process, targets crass pre-teen beauty pageants, motivational speakers, moody teenagers, emotionally unstable professors, and cantankerous old men.While its heart is in the right place, its bullets are mostly scatter-shot, only occasionally hitting their targets and the film does not develop its ideas to the point where they have a hard edge. The dysfunctional family in question is the Hoovers (a Kentucky Fried Chicken in every pot?) whose home is in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The family all strive for something beyond their reach in pursuit of happiness in a society that bestows no garlands for second place. Like any good television sitcom, each character is molded to type and fits neatly into the film's message. Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker without anyone to motivate.The opening of the film shows him giving his lecture that he calls ""Nine Steps to Success"" to a half-empty classroom (he might say it was half full). Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the long-suffering matriarch of the family who tries to pick up the pieces after her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a scholar of French writer Marcel Proust, fails in a suicide attempt after being given the boot by his gay lover who happens to be a student. The moody teenager Dwayne (Paul Dano) hasn't talked to anyone in a year and has vowed to remain silent until he is accepted in the Air Force Academy. Why an iconoclastic young man who reads Nietzsche would want to sign up for the U.S. military is one of those incongruities that will be better left to others to explain.The center of the film, however, deals with seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), a sweet but plain and not too attractive young lady with a pot belly who wants to become a beauty queen and her relationship with Grandpa (Alan Arkin), a lecherous cynic. When Olive places second in a beauty contest and the winner has to vacate her title because she took diet pills, the little girl begins eligible to compete in the national ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest in Redondo Beach, California. The film then becomes the road trip from hell as the family packs into their broken down VW bus running on two gears with contrived breakdowns in each character's life. Little Miss Sunshine reaches its maximum impact, however, at the beauty pageant where the directors show us overly sexualized children who strut their stuff and grotesquely parade in front of admiring family members in their pursuit of the American dream.Quite hilarious is the pasty-faced emcee who sings America the Beautiful into the children's ears. While the energy of the direction and excellence of the acting produces sympathy for the appealing characters, the comedy is at times so forced and its plot so implausible that even the excellent ensemble cast cannot save it. Little Miss Sunshine has a ""subversive"" feel to it and it correctly hints that intention is the key ingredient in achieving your goal, yet ultimately it is a pretty safe and comfortable ride and its message that winning isn't everything and losing has its rewards feels shopworn to the point of banality.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Are you kidding me?,"I sat through this piece of garbage trying to find either something redeeming or funny. I found neither.After reading the reviews here, this seemed like it would be a fun movie with a moral to follow you dream. This movie was just so dull, drab and predictable that I kept hitting the display button to see how much time was left. All the while I was watching, I kept saying ""it's got to get better"" **SPOILER** IT DOESN'T GET BETTER.I believe in encouraging your children, but within reality. This film is akin to making your 5 foot 2 inch high schooler believe he is the next Michael Jordan. Get real..This movie seems to try to have everything that National Lampooon Vacation had. It tries to have a dysfunctional family and a dead relative, but it just does not have any humor. Save your time a money.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Delightful,"Because it got such good reviews, I thought I'd be disappointed, but actually I really enjoyed it and strongly recommend it. Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet, subversive little movie. It's about a family of heroic ""losers"" on their way to a mini-Miss America pageant. That the grandfather in the film is played by the inimitable Alan Arkin, who should delight us forever with his adorable crankiness, is a good indication that the heart of the movie is in the right place. Little Miss Sunshine is a road movie with a VW van that barely works, a father, wonderfully played in all his optimistic, pathetic obtuseness by Greg Kinnear, his long-suffering wife, Toni Collette, excellent as usual, the ever surprising Steve Carell as the suicidal world's number one Proust scholar, Paul Dano as a Nietzsche teen freak on a vow of silence and the lovely, talented child actor Abigail Breslin as the Little Miss Sunshine contender. The movie builds up to a magnificent finale of American grotesquerie that is biting and true and gleefully perverse. It is a conventional comedy about highly individual, unconventional people who triumph in all their flawed, vulnerable, weird glory. Very well written, wonderfully directed, very delightful and one of the best American movies I have seen this year (which is not saying much, but there you have it).",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Fully Engaging, start to finish, a Lovely Short Story","I just saw Little Miss Sunshine at a premier showing. I had heard bits and pieces about the movie and saw that Steve Carell was in it, so we decided to wait in line to see it. And we were not in the least disappointed. This fantastic little movie is a complete short story, picking up at the addition of Steve Carell's character to the crazy family headed by his sister (played by Collette) and her husband (played perfectly by Kinnear as a frustrated self-help presenter). The family includes the quirky and somewhat overweight 8 year old, a by-choice speechless and frustrated 15 year old, and a drug sniffing angry grandpa (Arkin). Arkin steals every scene he's in. The movie plays out like a typical ""odd-group-thrown-into-a-small-area-and-must-overcome-together"" situation, with a dilapidated VW bus as the key obstacle. But it's the little moments of subtle humor that bring out the smiles in the audience at every step of the line. Carell has a 5 minute sarcasm bit, and you will never forget his style of running. The humor is never forced, the dialog seems very realistic, the sentimentality is never over the top nor yawn producing, and the finish was not only unexpected, but the most hilarious thing I've seen all year. Everything about this film seemed to fit together; from the music choice, to the pacing, to the subtle placement of scenery and odd cinematography shots; the acting; the dialog; to the storyline, with its set up, pitfalls, and timely finish. To conclude, I would say this film is perfect movie-going entertainment without trying to say too much and be anything more than it is. This movie fits no standard profile, probably won't be up for any Oscars, and won't make a star of anyone, and yet it will not disappoint any viewer from age 8 to 80.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The ""Little"" Movie That Could","Each summer has a breakout film. With the exception of the inspired absurdity of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", as well as the delicious charm of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", I have loathed most of them. ""March of the Penguins?"" Dull. ""Bend It Like Beckham?"" Duller. But this is an indie I can truly stand behind, a dark comedy with wit and energy to spare. A cluster of semi-stars (Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin), bring the cardboard characters to breathing, believable life. ""Sunshine"" takes a look at the lives of the Hoovers-a sex-obsessed grandpa (Alan Arkin), a calm and reasonable mother (Toni Collette), a suicidal Proust scholar (Steve Carrell), a snobby motivational speaker dad (Greg Kinnear), a silent teen (Paul Dano), and a giggly child (Abigal Breslin), who is competing to be the Little Miss Sunshine of the title. So they all set off in a microbus to reach California. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris give the movie pizazz, but Michael Arndt's script is the real success here. The running gags (the microbus's fault engine) work well, as does the dialogue. The actor's really are enjoying themselves here, especially Carrell and Dano, and the poppy score by Devotchka is excellent. Little Miss Sunshine is a surreal (and frighteningly realistic) comedy, and the most refreshing movie of the summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Welcome to America's funniest family!,"Little Miss Sunshine is a rarity among US comedies (Alexander Payne and Wes Anderson not included). Because of all the hype surrounding it (enthusiastic reviews at the Sundance festival), you expect something really good. For once (and that's the rare thing), the actual film might even exceed expectations. This is one of the funniest, most original movies I've seen in a long time.The film gets it title from a beauty contest for five or six-year old girls. One of the participants is Olive Hoover (Abigail Preslin), the archetypal sweet little kid who just wants to fulfill her dreams. Unfortunately, she has to go to California (where the competition takes place) with her highly dysfunctional family: her father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), has invented a nine-step program to succeed in life, only no one listens to him (think Tom Cruise in Magnolia minus the charisma); brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) has recently discovered Nietzsche and made a silence vow, which will be broken once he gets to join the Air Force; uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is Proust-obsessed, gay and suicidal (and he's the most normal family member); Grandpa (the scene-stealing Alan Arkin) is infatuated with the F-word (""Again with the f**cking chicken!"") and has been thrown out of a retirement home for snorting heroin; and finally, mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), who has to take care of all these people. Thought the Simpsons were a weird family? Not anymore...The film's charm lies in its straightforwardness: first-time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris bring Michael Arndt's superb screenplay to life without any hidden messages or subtexts. They don't judge their protagonists, but use them to make us understand what doesn't work in America (okay, so there is a small subtext after all). During the last half hour, Little Miss Sunshine is a poignant critique against US show business, particularly its need to exploit children for ratings' sake. The Hoovers are a perfect tool to cruelly hit that target, thanks to an amazing ensemble: Kinnear and Collette are on top form (the last time the former was so funny was in 1997's As Good as It Gets), while Arkin and Carell (playing a more ""mature"" character after the likes of Bruce Almighty and The 40-Year Old Virgin) provide most of the movie's best moments (the scene where Frank exposes his quirky situation to the rest of the family is priceless).Those looking for good laughs just have to see Little Miss Sunshine. I can't recall ever laughing so much while watching a recent comedy, and that's really saying something.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Pleasant, Humorous Addition to the Top 250","A girl and her family travel across the country to have her compete in the Little Miss Sunshine competition. The family, with a genetic ability to lose at everything, is determined to see that in the end they're all winners in one way or another.When this film came out, I didn't know what it was. I saw a preview or two and heard it was good, but I was under the impression it was going to be some pretentious indie film and I wasn't in the mood for that. Some days I am, but I just wasn't feeling it. Somehow I didn't notice it had Greg Kinnear (whom I love) and Steve Carell (although he wouldn't have sold me on it). And so I just let the film pass me by, with plans to see it much later.Well, ""much later"" finally arrived on Christmas 2007. And i must say I was pleased -- the humor is there, and of a dark, sarcastic nature I can really appreciate. Death, failure, suicide and misery are the punchlines here (or at least the warm-ups) and I couldn't be more pleased. Most of all I was pleased with Carell, the suicidal uncle. Carell has somehow become seen as something of the new Jim Carrey, which I think has hurt him. Following ""Bruce Almighty"" with ""Evan Almighty"" and now appearing together in ""Horton Hears a Who"" are probably mistakes. But in ""Sunshine"", he's not wacky -- he's just honest and plays a good, solid character. It's quite likely he will never have a better role.And truly, the ensemble cast is pretty cool. I wasn't a big fan of the brother. But the grandfather was hilarious, the father alright and the mother a good matriarch. The daughter really did run the show, and I'm glad they were able to find such a decent young actress. They could have cast Dakota Fanning or her sister, but luckily they avoided that like a Clay Aiken concert.I also want to say that for having two directors, the film is pretty seamless. Generally, two directors is a bad sign. You have competing visions, or sometimes you have one director simply picking up where the other left off. Here, it worked fine -- a feat that really can only be shared with the Coen Brothers. So, you're in good (and limited) company, gentlemen.See this movie. The Oscars it won are well-deserved, and you'll appreciate this (and maybe your family) after you see it. It's nice to see a film that isn't just raunchy humor... it may be morbid, but it's intelligently morbid.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Deeper Than It Looks,"This is basically the story of a pre-teen girl who is competing in a talent contest, and her dysfuntional family.But like some simple films and books, this one runs pretty deep. It's a comedy that runs from hilarious to bittersweet to outright bitter. Some of it is very funny, some of it is just plain painful to watch, because this is really a film about losing and what that means in this country, the US of A, where winning is everything. It could have been a feel good movie, with whatever ending, and it is actually very close to a formula movie, but what sets it apart is that everyone in this film REALLY is a loser, and coming to terms with that is shown to be both a relief and upsetting. It's possible to make peace with losing on the one hand, because as Dwayne and Frank say of the pageant judges ""We don't want those people judging Olive!"" and on the other hand, there might not be a game out there that's worth winning.As for the literal deeper philosophical implications, regarding Nietzche and Proust, having read neither, I have no idea, and the filmmakers don't give us much of a clue. It did prompt me to think of checking them out, and that's a real achievement for a movie. I haven't had a movie stimulate my curiosity like that since the Matrix trilogy.So I highly recommend this flick if you want a new take on an old genre, and you like to think some about what you've seen. Everyone in the theatre enjoyed this film the day I saw it, and in fact it got a round of applause at the end. (I saw it in Berkeley, so actual results may vary.)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Good American Comedy!,"Little Miss Sunshine is better than I expected it to be. Even though this movie was nominated for Best Picture, I did not think that this movie would reach my expectations. Boy, I was wrong. This isn't the comedy that most people are accustomed to, this is a dark comedy that will have you laughing then in tears.The story is simple. It's about a girl who wants to win the beauty pageant in California. Her family then decides to drive to California. Of course, the family is dysfunctional. The grandpa is a foul-mouthed drug user, the uncle is gay and suicidal, the mother is pro-honesty, the dad is all about being a winner or a loser, and the brother won't speak a word at all.The cast did a great job. Alan Arkin deserves the Oscar for his performance. Steve Carell has a nice career blossoming. In short, everyone did a great job. The thing that amazes me is that this movie took three million dollars to make. The box office gross is almost 20 times larger. Overall, this is one of the best comedies made recently. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What the... Terrible!,"I don't know where to begin with this one. It starts off well enough, and goes on that way for fifty minutes or so. Never great, I'd say, but it's a perfectly acceptable little indie comedy. Alan Arkin and Steve Carell are both excellent, and Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are fine, too. But then it takes a majorly wrong turn (think grandma from National Lampoon's Vacation, miscalculated at an astronomical level), follows that up with some incredibly forced bits and ends up at one of the most outrageously appalling climaxes I have seen in a long time. I went from moderately enjoying it to downright hating it. It's too bad, too, because I do like some of the things it's trying to say, some of the things it's trying to do. But what a disaster! I guess I'm the only one who feels that way, though. My movie-going companion (whose opinion I respect, I should add) was enamored with the picture all the way through, even laughing uproariously at what I thought were some of the most cringe-inducing moments in some time. It's already ranked on IMDb's top 250, though that's hardly a sign of high quality. Oh well. I'm happy enough in hating it. Easily the worst I've seen so far this year.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Exuberant and touching comedy,"Why can't I give this movie more than 10 stars? What a wonderful, funny and joyous movie! Storytellling at it's best, Little Miss Sunshine begins with little Olive's eyes as she peers into a beauty pageant on video over and over. We are skillfully introduced to the characters---all robustly interesting---via quick, snappy shots of the camera. It is enough to draw me in hook, line and sinker. As they all converge in the dining room, mother, father, son, little Olive, her grandfather and uncle, we suddenly realize that we are not just observers but participants---cleverly being engaged into investing emotionally with the family that we suddenly find disturbingly familiar. Before we realize it, we are taken on a hilarious 'roadtrip. But lest I give you the impression that this is a roadtrip movie, (it's not...) let me just say that every turn this movie makes is a revelation---a new and refreshing metaphor of dreams and hopes; of that journey that we all want to take--- the one that leads up to the summit of our innermost desires.The cast is perfect. Duane, the son, has taken a vow of silence and is turned on to Friedrich Nietzsche. The grandfather, recently kicked out of his retirement home after being caught snorting coke, is played by the wondrous Alan Arkin who gives the character its heart. He is perfect in the role. The uncle, Frank, has just been released from the hospital for a failed suicide attempt. Played by Steve Carell, we were transfixed by his mesmerizing performance---a man full of hurt, disappointment and loss but never losing that comedic quality perfectly pitched to make us fall inlove with him. The father, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, is a 'motivational speaker' intent on reaching the summit of success but sadly, does not have what it takes to get there. The development and evolution of his character is an Oscar worthy tour de force. Every tick, every wrinkle, every tilt of his head is magic. We clearly see what goes on inside. We can almost hear him talking to himself. When the movie reaches it's joyous pitch perfect denouement, Greg Kinnear shines the brightest as his character lets loose. We want to root for him. I found myself laughing and then crying joyously with him and his family as they all unite in a sweeping gesture of solidarity, pride and joyous opposition. Toni Collette, who plays Sheryl, Olive's mother, is phenomenal, as usual. She is the glue that holds the family together.Watch for two of the most poignant and unforgettable scenes in the movie. The first one, between Olive and her grandpa, the night before the big pageant. Beautifully nuanced, the characters seem to jump right out of the screen and into your heart. The second, between Olive and her brother, played by a gem of an actor, Paul Dano, as brother and sister whose magical connection to each other is so palpable, you'd swear you heard some dialogue. Then you realize there's none. And yes, what you clearly hear is simply the beating of your own heart as the audience holds its breath in utter tenderness. It would be a travesty if this movie eludes multiple Oscar nods. But then again, I would not be surprised.Little Miss Sunshine is rated R for language and some reference to pornography. Some may find the pageant scenes offensive. They would be looking at the glass half empty for this movie is full of heart, soul and magic. They rightfully do not deserve to see nor enjoy the beauty and pathos that this wonderful movie carries in spades. This one's a definite treasure trove of art expressed in the images of fine movie-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too Close To Reality,"Funniest, and most ""they can't go there"" film I've seen since American Beauty. Realistic drug references and profanity unfortunately mean I can't recommend it to as many friends as I'd like, but that's also part of what makes this a standout story. It's easy to skewer little girl beauty pageants -- done here perfectly -- but who would think an old VW bus could be the object of both affection and derision? Trapped in a dysfunctional family? So is half of America. A washed-up Proust scholar? Okay, that's a stretch but also a wicked jab at pretentious scholarship. A old geezer who lets it all hang out? Just visit the nearest senior citizen center. A middle-age man hung up on possibility thinking? Actually, that's a perennial theme going back to Sinclair Lewis' Babbitt. A sullen teen who doesn't talk? Look at the house next door. A vulnerable little girl who just might survive the madness? One hopes so. And the most delicious off-handed comment is at the end.

A great family dramedy with excellent performances all around,"I saw the trailer months ago, but it never clicked in my head that Little Miss Sunshine was the big film from the Sundance Film Festival. It looked like an Indie, but not to the point that the usual batch of Sundance films do. But I waited anyway to see it anyway, and after opening wider within the past few weeks, I finally got the chance.Little Miss Sunshine is basically a road movie revolving around a completely dysfunctional family on their way to a beauty pageant in California. The family includes the father Richard (Greg Kinnear), a motivational speaker who is always pumping his 9 step program while waiting for the book deal to come in; mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), who is unsure of what to do with herself as the family faces financial ruin; Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrell), a gay Proust scholar who just happens to be suicidal; Grandpa (Alan Arkin), who is obsessed with porn and snorting heroin; Dwayne (Paul Dano), the son who is taking a vow of silence; and Olive (Abigail Breslin), the daughter who is getting ready to act in the titular pageant.The characters may sound like they were tailor made for a sitcom, but they work brilliantly on screen. There is an electric presence between these six actors, and it only gets more intense as the film goes on. Their chemistry together is absolutely awestriking and is exactly what every film studio hopes and prays for from their actors. And they deliver here in masses. It is a totally dialogue driven film, and every actor pulls their weight here to make it as enjoyable as they can. While they handle the comedic elements of the script with the most perfect finesse, they handle the dramatic elements all the better. This is a family dramedy in the truest sense.While each of the actors are great, Carrell and Dano stand out as the best of the bunch. Their performances are put together and acted to the point of being so smooth, that it becomes fascinating to watch. While Carrell's career is only going to continue to soar from here on, Dano's looks to be headed in the right direction. He is definitely going to be one to watch in the coming years. However, if he was given more screen time, I think Arkin would have been the best of the bunch. He steals scenes from everyone in the cast, and proves his worth as a veteran actor. More time on the screen could have only helped his performance become so much better than it already is.While the characters are great, the plot really does not deviate too much. It stays fairly straight forward right until the end, and mostly allows for character interactions and not much else. There are a few supporting turns, but most of them are basically cameos, as each has less than five minutes of screen time a piece. While it sticks to realism (and really gets heavy and satirical when the pageant comes closer), there were more than a handful of completely ridiculous and absurd sequences, and a few that felt like they belonged in another film entirely. It does not take away from the film for the most part, but felt a little strange in context with the rest.If you like dialogue driven comedy, then this is a definite must-see. It is hilarious and dramatic all at once, and the main six actors are just fabulous in their roles. Do not be surprised by a Best Original Screenplay nod and possibly more come Oscar time.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie was TERRIBLE! No stars!,"""When the sea was calm, all ships alike showed mastership in floating."" -William ShakespeareThe summary was what I said, verbatim, after leaving a theatre in Portland with some dorm friends. Choosing to do so at such an early point in my college friendship career, (everybody else loved it and I therefore was outcasting myself) was an unfortunate decision I still can't come to terms with. The movie was embarrassing because it was aiming for some Todd Solondz lugubriousness while maintaining a pop cadence. I didn't feel any of the visceral depression and longing for suicide while being intellectually provided enough to realize that it would all be for the attention that Solondz gives me. I just thought it was cute. Welcome to the Dollhouse and Happiness, and really whatever film Solondz makes is worth the severity, this film seems to me to be complacently on the fence between authentic experiential loss and the let's go dancing and then get the car washed type facade that I respond to in such vivid disgust. Valerie Dayton and Jonathan Faris are good filmmakers, I think the video for the Smashing Pumpkins' 1979 is the best of its genre. But what we have here is some imitatively dysfunctional, yellow-colored Sufjan Stevens sounding celluloid bilge. Could be for you, though.

The film that will turn you on to Proust,"Funny how any movie that doesn't completely suck gets put in IMDb's top 250 list right quick. ""The will of the people is strong, but their ability to forget is insurmountable"" (or something or other paraphrased from Mein Kampf). Democracy! Yay! In other words: people rush out to vote for films based on fleeting emotional tangents which would be more strongly evoked by older movies that did it with more class.Not that this is necessarily the case here. Little Miss Sunshine is decent -- sufficiently heart-warming and bittersweet. You know, one of those movies about how we have to love the people we're with even if we don't like them or get along too well on a personal level. It demonstrates how these familial bonds are tested in stressful and depressing circumstances, but these are the only bonds that can survive such circumstances. I can jive with that message.Or maybe I'm just reading into it. REGARDLESS, the cast works well together and the pacing is good and there are some genuine laughs along the way. I didn't cry and call all my friends after watching it, but it is affecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quirky and Sweet Comedy-Drama,"I quite enjoyed this film. It felt more like a novel than a movie with its complex characters and their changing attitudes of one another. The material is nuanced and handled with deftness by the directors and the excellent cast. The filmmakers had enough trust in their actors (and the audience) to leave a lot of the characterizations to simple looks and fleeting expressions. Such restraint goes a long way towards softening and humanizing otherwise over-the-top characters and is welcome indeed.Arkin is great in a showy, easy role. Kinnear--perhaps the one with the biggest arc--underplays nicely. Dano conveys much with expression and body language. Breslin doesn't hit any of those false line-readings so common in child actors and seems completely genuine and adorable. Carrell has the most complex role and plays it with a soulful conviction that, unfortunately, he rarely gets asks to do anymore. Collette has the thankless, underwritten Mom-role but brings such life and emotion to it that you're sold. Even the bit parts are well cast with famous faces and each does an excellent job inhabiting a fully realized character in the few minutes of screen time they're given.I could have used a bit more humor, a bit more heft to the plot, and perhaps a bit more resolution. But these are ultimately quibbles. The movie finds its quirky sweet spot early and stays there all the way to the end--to entertaining effect.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The cast is good, particularly Arkin in his Oscar-winning role of the foul-mouthed patriarch. Breslin is cute without being cloying.

My date happened to like it though, and it came highly recommended to her, but when I asked her what the point of the film was she told me i don't know several times.

"Very Emotional and Surprisingly Impressive Performances,","Little Miss Sunshine is a brilliant movie with a great,however very depressing and emotional storyline and a fantastic cast that suit their roles perfectly.I don't think Alan Arkin deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role,he was good in it,but he was barely in it and I definitely didn't consider his performance Oscar worthy.I think that Steve Carell should have at least been nominated,I know hes usually in comedies,but e plays his character brilliantly all the way through and I was much more concerned for him rather than Alan Arkin's character,he was definitely snubbed.If your a fan of drama movies,but also like when there's plenty of comedy,you'll definitely enjoy this movie.Olive,a young girl who's dream is to become a pageant girl,heads off cross-country with her family to be in a popular pageant,but the journey causes a lot of drama and conflict with her already unhappy family.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Dysfunctional Family finds Common Ground in Supporting a Girl and Her Dreams,"A innocent little girl of a dysfunctional family seeks to pursue her dreams of winning ""The Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant amid the personal woes of a Grandfather with a drug problem whom was kicked out of a retirement home, an Uncle whom has come to stay in the wake of a suicide attempt over a failed gay relationship and loss of his job, a brother whom uses the teachings of a great philosopher to avoid his family and set his sites on an improbable Air Force career, and two parents whom are battling with their own problems which includes a Father whom is on the outer fringes of dreams of success, and a Mother whom acts as a referee for the rest of the family to help all get along and having no time for herself or goals of her own.In an impromptu chance to compete in the pageant, Olive finds her rather fractured family come together to support her and her dream while being able to forget their own problems along the way as they make a mad dash from New Mexico to California. Her dream becomes their dream of sorts, and common ground is found as they rally around Olive to compete.It's a movie that touches the heart, brings laughter, some pain, and reveals the human condition on many fronts while never losing the message of hope and how a little girl's own dream can unite a family when all the odds are against them.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A delightful black comedy with a lesson for all,"Little Miss Sunshine is a black comedy about a dysfunctional family who are on a road trip to California where the daughter will compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for young girls, which is her ultimate dream and for which she has been practicing for a long time.Each family member contributes to the dysfunctional aspect; which includes an eldest son who has taken a vow of silence until he gets to go to flying school; an uncle who is gay and suicidal; a perverted grandpa who is addicted to heroine and was thrown out of the old aged home when he was caught sniffing it and a father who is obsessed with winning and the mother who tries to hold the family together.On their way to the beauty pageant secrets are revealed and lessons are learned in this laugh out loud comedy.The film features a perfect cast, which includes Steve Carrell from The 40 Year Old Virgin but in serious mode.All the characters have unique personalities that are colourful and funny.

A Ray of Sunshine in a Dreary Genre.,"Every kind of movie genre has potential for greatness. I have to remind myself of this from time to time. The is a certain hopelessness you feel when you watch dozens of trashy horror movies or pretentious art house films without finding a great one. But it's films like Little Miss Sunshine that convince you to keep searching. This movie plays like a lot of would be ""feel good"" indie pictures. A happy little goofball of a film complete with an offbeat sense of humor and an eclectic group of quirky characters. Those are dangerous waters. Way too often does ""quirky"" give way to cloying. Except these characters are quirky like real people are, not like overwritten movie characters. And this movie is real and affecting, not tongue in cheek or sarcastic. Little Miss Sunshine is a winner.The film could be classified as a road movie (another dangerously corny genre), following the extended Hoover family on a road trip to a child's beauty pageant in California, where Abigail Breslin's Olive dreams of competing to be Little Miss Sunshine. The group escorting Breslin there are mom Sheryl (Toni Collette), dad Richard (Gregg Kinnear), sweet gay uncle Frank (Steve Carrell), aspiring Air Force pilot brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), and wise-cracking grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin). What follows is a delightful series of gags, many of them featuring a beaten up yellow VW van, that slowly build to something emotionally impactful.The acting from all six of the main players is brilliant. A case could be made for any of them to be nominated for Oscars. Alan Arkin won an Oscar for his prickly grandpa Edwin and Abigail Breslin received deserved acclaim for her winning turn, but the best performance of the film comes from Gregg Kinnear. His character has the widest emotional range, and Kinnear has a deft touch at every step. It's a classically restrained acting job. I have to also mention Toni Collette, who delivers a particularly stirring monologue at a crucial point in the film.The gags and one-liners could all end up so precious, so self-consciously offbeat. That is death for indie movies. I can't stand it when it's done wrong. So what a surprise it was for me to find myself caught up in this particular group's story. It's because supporting all those fine performances is direction that is restrained and natural. Never once do directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris push for laughs. There is a humble quality to the humor. A ""we hope you'll enjoy it, but that's up to you"" attitude. And underneath the comedy is sincerity. Faris and Dayton treat these characters as people. People who are susceptible to grief, anger, and sadness, just like the rest of us. They aren't sock puppets speaking the writer's stand up material.I don't like road pictures or indie movies or quirky comedies. I sometimes find it hard to believe there could be a truly great example of any of the three. But Little Miss Sunshine is special; a great example of all those genres. It's a wonderful movie about family and the special connection they have to all of us. It's hilarious and touching and quirky, yes, in the right way. Little Miss Sunshine may look like other cutesy darlings, but give it a chance and you'll find it a genuine delight.94/100",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The feel-good film of the year.,"In fact, film of the year full stop.It's the sort of film where you can forget all your troubles for an hour and a half or so, relax, and get lost in the moment.It's essentially a comedy, but there are one or two serious, yet beautiful, heart-stopping moments, helped in no small part by BFCA winners (for this very film) Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano.I've never heard so much noise in a single cinema auditorium caused by pure, side-splitting laughter - especially during the classic ending. The only downside to this whole film is that the ending doesn't have quite the same effect when watching it at home on your own.The soundtrack is also superb.

Steve Carell is an amazing actor, who I actually really liked seeing in a more serious role for much of the movie coupled with a few comedic moments later on.

Maybe it's just personal taste, but I found myself laughing at many parts of the movie just politely (as opposed to falling out of my seat laughing). I'm not quite sure why I didn't think this was the funniest movie in a long time, but maybe it's the implausibility of the setup (how dysfunctional can a family get?) or maybe the jokes are too intelligent? Anyway, I don't want to slam this movie, as it is very well made and I loved all the actors in the film. The scene at the end is priceless, as it glaringly shows the hypocrisy of these ""beauty pageants"". Overall, a pleasant film that won't disappoint!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The hypocritical form of the American dream exposed,"In ""Little Miss Sunshine"" the Hoover family is a peculiar kind of family consisting of:Father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker whose career is in the doldrums. In the beginning of the film we see him performing for a nearly empty hall.Son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is an adolescent who has stopt talking a half year ago and only communicates with written notes.Daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is 7 years old and dreaming of becoming famous.Grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin) lives with his son because the retirement home has kicked him out for sexual harassment.Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) lives with his sister because he can't live alone after a failed suicide.Mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) desperately tries to manage this household of lost souls.At home it is already a chaos, but this doesn't improve when the family sets out on a journey (in a nostalgic Volkswagen Transporter) to a beauty pageant Olive wants to participate in.There are two camps within the family. Father Richard and Grandpa Edwin are in favour of the beauty contest. Grandpa Edwin because Olive wil perform a dance she has rehearsed together with him.The motives of Father Richard are more complex and worth considering in more detail. As a motivational speaker he believes in what I will call the ""strong version"" of the American dream. Not only is it possible for a newsboy to become a miljonair, success is guaranteed as long as you try hard enough. Success is a choice and from this it follows that failure is your own fault. His philosophy is well represented by the following quote: ""There's two kinds of people in this world, there's winners and there's losers. Okay, you know what the difference is? Winners don't give up."".Sheryl, Frank and Dwayne have a more realistic view on the beautu contest. They know that Olive, being an ugly dugly, doesn't stand a chance and is in for a big disappointment. Arriving at the location of the beauty contest their fear seems to be coming true. The other participants are living barbie dolls wearing clothes that would have been spicy if they were ten years older. In a brilliant performance, of which so don't understand the symbolism at all, Olive exposes the hypocrisy behind the beauty contest.In a way ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a bit like ""Nebraska"" (2013, Alexander Payne) in that a will-o'-the-wisp of the lead character sets in motion a very entertaining road movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Contrived but fun,"I went to this sneak preview really wanting to like the movie. I really like Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, and Steve Carell. The plot was deliciously dark: a dysfunctional family goes on a road trip so the young daughter can participate in a beauty pageant.But, the problem is that the movie screamed ""I'm an indie flick."" From the poster to the commercials, I should have been warned that it would fall into the traps that these independent films generally do. But, I had high hopes.Nevertheless they were somewhat dashed. Little Miss Sunshine is indeed a darkish comedy of sorts, but only of the most contrived sort. The family in Little Miss Sunshine neither feels like a family nor acts like they are connected by having lived together for years. The family includes:Olive, the young daughter who asks all the good questions that need to be asked for the movie to develop its plot.Richard, the over-talkative father who spouts self-help while calling everybody losers. He is depending on a book deal that may not come through.Sheryl, the working mother who is impatient with the whole situation.Dwayne, the Nitzche-reading son who has taken a vow of silence until he can get into the air force to fly jets.Grandpa, the perverted old man who snorts heroin and is also Olive's coach.Frank, Sheryl's homosexual brother, fresh off an attempted suicide after a failed relationship with his grad student.At the beginning of the movie, Olive is given the Sunnydale regional Little Miss Sunshine title due to her placing second and first place was forced to drop out. The last-minute nature of the phone call sends the family into a flurry of action leading to the decision that everybody will be in the VW van for the road trip.The road trip consists of many odd and stupid contrivances in order to set up for repeated jokes and motifs. The van's clutch drops out, which causes everybody to push it in order to drive it. Phone signals drop out at inconvenient times, and chance situations all pile on top of each other. Add to these contrivances the fact that none of the family reacts like people who have known each other for years. They act and react like characters in a cheap play.The only one who moderately pulls it off is Toni Collette. Thankfully, Toni has the timing and grace of a truly caring mother trying to hold the family together.However, the comic aspects of the rest of the performers are all spot on. The movie isn't all bad. When it is funny, it is frequently hilarious. Especially when it is believable. When the situations aren't so constructed to seem like they were written solely for laughs, Little Miss Sunshine really shines. When it isn't believable it is tiresome and stretched.Paul Dano also shines in the first half-hour of the movie when he acts like a child who is tired of the family. But, by the end, he just isn't trying nearly as hard as he was.Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear also flex their comic timing muscle in the movie as they can. They make their jokes work even when they aren't working.For the dark humor that the movie gets right, it is an enjoyable movie. It isn't bad, it just isn't great. It just doesn't click.B-",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Little Miss Understood,"I spent more than a few minutes reading the ""hated it"" reviews by folks here. The criticisms seem to suggest that this is a tasteless film that promotes drug abuse and child molestation. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a quirky comedy filled with interesting characters - and despite the common themes it has with other road films (most notably ""Vacation"") it manages to do what the best satire usually does; make you think and laugh.The family on the fringe consists of a porno-loving, horse-sniffing grandpa, an emo teen who wants to be a USAF pilot, a Dad who is a failure in business, a stressed-out Mom, and her gay, jilted, suicidal brother. Holding this diverse family together is a chubby little girl who dreams of winning a beauty contest. The road trip that they take to get to the pageant reveals the characters flaws and insecurities. The only one who seems to have some sort of inner peace is Olive, the girl who has her eyes on the prize despite the wacky goings-on during the trip.Stop right there. Does the synopsis of this film seem believable to you? Of course not. These characters only inhabit Hollywood films. I haven't seen many John McClain's at the Dunkin Donuts while patrolling the streets but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy ""Die Hard."" Any road film in this day and age is going to be derivative of earlier efforts. What distinguishes this film is the accurate representation of the role that family plays in our competitive society today. How many thousands of miles do today's soccer parents log taking their kids to games? Dance recitals? Music lessons? Did anyone even consider for one second what the parents did for Olive was excessively indulgent? I know I didn't. She was a sweet girl who had a dream. I would have done the same for my kid. My Mussolini-serving, fascist-loving Dad (and he is indeed a real character) would have given up his other trigger finger to get his grandkids what they wanted. This is America today. Win at any cost and make sure you look good doing it.Which brings us to the amazing final scene. Many found Olive's risqu√© dance to ""Superfreak"" disturbing and highly sexualized. As a parent who has attended many dance recitals, I can tell you that there was nothing even remotely sexual in this routine when compared to real performances I have seen from little girls the same age as Olive. Olive's dance is a REJECTION of the the beauty pageant, it's over-made-up little tarts, their usually fat mothers, and the tacky Vegas-style revue that it resembles. The little girl is having fun - she is shaking and grinding it because she likes to dance. Her infectious spinning around during the dance, and her family joining her to support her amidst outraged Stepford parents, is a strong an affirmation on family-values as I have seen in a while. ""Sanford Babbit?"" Would you want to be his kid for even one second?"" asked Tom Cruise in ""Rain Man."" That was another road film with an unlikely cast of characters that evolved into a touching tale of family love. Contrived? Maybe. But at least it wasn't misunderstood as this fine film was, despite the same message.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A cynical and heartless movie.,"This movie is cynical, heartless, boring, derivative, and insulting.It is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. During one of the big scenes, I actually walked out and stood in the hall for five minutes, not because it was terrible, but because it was so boring and I couldn't care for the characters.There are no real characters, just sets of quirks who behave out of no conceivable self interest. Most of the actors do a great job of trying to turn these quirks into humans, but they are sabotaged by the ridiculous script at every turn.Everything the character do seems arbitrary and exists only to disgust the audience or move the plot forward towards its big ending -- an ending that is exceedingly derivative and clich√©d yet comes as a breath of fresh air after the preceding couple of hours of fake dysfunction.I know that many people like this movie, but I honestly cannot fathom how anyone could.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Very rich on its characters.,"It's funny that while this movie was really liked and praised at the time, there are more and more people now days who are dogpiling on it, in a negative way. I guess it makes this movie a case of you'll either love it or hate it. I for one absolutely loved it!For me this is how a Wes Anderson movie should be like. Wes Anderson movies are independent ones with a very subtle and minimalistic/realistic approach to its comedy and feature all kinds of odd and just plain quirky characters in it. It's the same sort of style and approach that this movie uses, only difference is that in this movie it actually did work for me, as opposed to Wes Anderson his movies, which I more often just hate- than like to watch really. In that regard I also have some sympathy for those that did not like this movie at all. When it's not your type of movie, it simply isn't your type of movie. The comedy, the subtlety, the story, the situations, the characters, it all might be something that some people just aren't able to appreciate or like about this movie.Key to me as to why I liked this movie, as opposed to Wes Anderson movies for instance, was the movie wasn't being pretentious at all about its style and wasn't showing, what I would like to call, any independent film consciousness. It was simply being a very honest and straightforward movie, about the simple little things and what makes things so beautiful or tough to live through at times.This in itself of course would not had been good or interesting enough to create an entire movie around but luckily the movie managed to throw in plenty of subtle and somewhat dark humor, as well as a whole bunch of very well written characters. Everybody in this movie has so much depth and all of the main characters are some real likable ones. They have great, though also very exaggerated, personalities that keep the movie going at all times and is also what makes the movie such a rich filled, warm and likable one.For what its worth, this really was a movie that made me feel happy, though the story in itself is not a very happy one. It was more the way the character's dealt with all of their issues or crazy problems they ran into that made this movie a very heartfelt one. It's a real family movie, not in the terms of that this is a movie you can watch with your whole family, but more that this is a movie that is all about the family bond and unconditional love for each other.The movie was obviously very dependent on its characters, in order to let the overall story and style and approach of the movie to work out. And it's not just thanks to the writing or the directing approach that they indeed all work out but also really due to its casting and cast. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that everybody got perfectly cast in this movie. Even actors who I'm normally not very impressed with, such as Greg Kinnear, simply did an amazing job. I was also really surprised by Steve Carell, who didn't played a goofy comedy role for a change but a far more subtle one and he was absolutely great at it. It makes you wish that he would do more movies and movie roles like this and stop wasting his talent on lame comedies. But like I said, every actor in this movie deserves lots of praise and it also would eventually be Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin who would be nominated for an Oscar as well. Alan Arkin was the only one that eventually also won. There was an Oscar as well for its script, which I'm also really happy about and think this is something this movie truly deserved.The only regret I have was that I didn't watch this movie any sooner.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

the right to be a loser,"'Little Miss Sunshine' is not at all my kind of movie, and yet I enjoyed watching it. The story is about a gathering of characters who call themselves a family, each bringing his or her own combination of dreams, stereotypes and disappointments, trying to make their ways in the context of the very American competitive system to which none seems to fit very well. When the little daughter in the family wins the right for a hopeless participation in a kids beauty pageant the family embarks in a trip that would make them maybe see where the right value of their lives lies.The nice thing in this movie is the freshness and sincerity of acting. First time directors Dayton and Faris succeed to make the characters alive, distinct and likable from the very first minutes and so they remain for the whole duration of the movie. There is a lot of talk in the film about how not to be a loser, and apparently the characters as individuals and the family as a whole seem to be super-losers in the real world, yet on the human plan they end by being winners, and so they are in the hearts of the viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hitting the Pavement,"I'm guessing that I've started to revert to a concrete-operational level. Or I just don't like the ick that passes for art.Little Miss Sunshine is just that, icky. There's a good message involved in this flick--""Losers are those folks too afraid to try."" Yet, by the end of the film, you've been exposed to some of the more unpleasant characters you're going to see for awhile and you're going to want to shower, repeatedly.I'm so middle class dull that I have trouble putting myself in the position of a viewer who found this film much more than ugly, a story of a highly dysfunctional family on a road trip to put their youngest member, a second grader in a beauty pageant. I find the whole concept of abusing children by making them up like dwarf-hookers nauseating, and that's not the main reason Little Miss Sunshine gave me the creeps.Am I missing something here? Should I put my Middle America, Red State sensibilities aside and embrace LMS as . . . art?

The comedy movie you wanted to see for years,"Let me put it straight. At the very first instant when we are shown the close-up of Olive(Abigail Breslin)watching a beauty pageant, we come to know that this story is based on dreams and your determination to fulfill it.The storyline is simple and cleverly written and tells us how a little girl has an ambition to become a beauty queen one day and shows us all the trails and tribulations she along with her family has to go through. It is a story all of us can relate to very easily. It is more of a drama yet you feel it has comedy written all over it. That's the beauty of the movie and its execution.The cast starring Kinnear and Colette in the leads and very well supported by Abigail, Carrell, Dano and Arkin all manage to bring out sincere performances individually. But the real star of the movie has to be Alan 'Grandpa' Arkin who definitely deserved the Oscar for his eccentric performance he manages to put up for us. He brought out loads of madness and stupidity on screen thorough his role.There are some extremely funny lines in the movie and the dance sequence by the whole family is extremely hilarious. Special mention to Carrell's performance. I don't know how to describe it but the way he runs throughout the movie cannot stop to make you laugh.All in all, a very brave effort by first time directors Jonathan and Valerie.

The film's core message is a moral I wish was imposed on me when I was younger, and something I think it's important to learn even when you're old, too. It's okay to not be okay. And it's okay not to win. It's all arbitrary.Steve Carrell stood out to me in particular, I really love seeing him in serious roles. I know he's always going to be our Michael Scott, but he's such a talented actor in so many other genres and characters.This film is just one of the most raw displays of love I've ever seen, and watching this was one of the first times I ever remembered seeing my dad cry.

The Winner Is...,"TL; DRIn the end, through all of the oddities that unravel, through all of the discomfort and eye-bulging moments, through all of the tears, doubts, and bouts of bad luck, it remains feel-good.I can say with great confidence that Little Miss Sunshine is one of the best movies ever made and I strongly recommend it to the appropriate audience. (As harmless as it may appear, it's definitely not a kids' film.)Extended review:Every aspect of this film is incredible. The characters are each so individualistic and the actors play their roles and dynamics so perfectly, it doesn't even feel like acting. Abigail Breslin offers a shockingly good performance for a child actor as Olive and was rightfully nominated. Alan Arkin won for Best Supporting Actor as Grandpa Edwin, as he should've. Greg Kinnear was highly effective in his balance of d**k wad try-hard and a genuinely trying person. Toni Collette, my favorite actress, was amazing as Sheryl, of course. Paul Dano gives my personal favorite performance of his as Dwayne and Steve Carell truly transforms into Frank. The directing is solid, the writing is so good I can't even put it into words (and I'm a writer), the color scheme is bright and beautiful, and the cinematography is fantastic. I feel privileged to have introduced this film to people in my life. I firmly believe that everyone should watch this movie at some point in their life. It's quirky without indulging in clich√©s, grounded in familiarity and the authenticity of being alive in several different stages of life. I think everyone in the audience can relate to the characters in some way or another.Little Miss Sunshine is a life-changing, eye-opening film that may just leave you glossed or spilling with tears.There isn't much more to say except for please go watch it if you haven't and if you have seen it, this is your sign to spend another hour and forty-one minutes watching it. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Well acted comedy drama,"'Little Miss Sunshine' is a well acted comedy drama. The script may be contrived but the fine cast makes it feel fresh. Alan Arkin is a memorable foul-mouthed grandpa. Greg Kinnear plays an unsuccessful motivational speaker(!) Paul Dano is effective despite being silent for most of the film and Steve Carell is good in an understated dramatic role. While the usual life lessons are learned by everyone, there are also some hilarious pot-shots aimed at junior beauty pageants where kids as young as eight or ten take part. While hardly worthy of it's Best Picture nomination, the film is worth watching.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Volkswagen Commercial Ever,"One of those movies that will grow on you over time. Also, your sympathy for (especially) the bus and the characters it carries, will increase with every viewing.Great to see Steve Carell stepping outside of his office and virgin roles by portraying a more serious character with depth.Whether people find enjoyment in this movie or not, one thing is certain: the popularity of Volkswagen buses have increased because of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sheer perfection!,"This film works and I am not sure why, giving it an almost elusive quality. On paper, the storyline of a family of misfits traveling across the United States so a girl can attend a beauty pageant seems thin and almost dull. But make no mistake, this film is anything but dull. The characters are all fleshed out with every detail making them feel realistic and easy to relate to. Toni Collette is remarkable and a true credit to Australia representing us so greatly on the big screen. Little Miss Sunshine makes you laugh and cry and everything in between. It's gauntlet of emotion as an odd-ball family tries hard to make sense of it all.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little Miss Sunshine,"The movie disappointed me. I would have expected it better. The movie was funny in some scenes especially at the end, but the movie was just like any comedy movie.

The atmosphere that is created in this film is wonderful. A mix of emotions is going through me. I cried and i laughed at the same time. This is definitely a movie i want to see again and again. I went to see it without any expectations and what i saw blew me away. From the moment the film begins, you're captured by the music and the images. And once you're introduced to the actors and get a taste of what you're going to discover about their characters, you just know you're going to like everything about the film. Okay i didn't give it a ten, but that's because there are movies like the godfather that i want to preserve it for.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
loved it!,This may be one of the best movies ever! It never fails to make me cry yet fill me with an overwhelming sense of joy and hope every time i watch it.The characters with in it and the relationship ships they have with each other are so complicated and realistic at the same time. The way it displays love is moving and powerful!It discusses and proposes serious topics in a way that doesn't make a mockery out of it yet does not seem too heavy or take up the entire plot of the film!Additionally the soundtrack is one of the best and the cinematograph is pretty good too with colours like the yellow bus used throughout really making it enjoyable!Overall an amazing movie that i believe anyone can enjoy and should watch! Loved it so much and rewatch it at least once every couple of months!,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not your typical trip to a beauty pageant.,"As the movie opens Sheryl (Toni Collette) is picking up her brother, Frank (Steve Carell), from a mental hospital, after his failed suicide attempt due to a recent breakup with his boyfriend. Sherl's husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is bankrupt and trying to create a new career for himself as a motivational speaker.When Sheryl brings Frank into her home, he is forced--after being discharged from the hospital--to bunk with their son, Dwayne (Paul Dano). Dwayne is in the midst of a self-induced vow of silence in partial preparation for his goal of getting into the Air Force Academy.The rest of the household consists of Richard's incorrigible father, Alan Arkin‚Äîwho has been kicked out of Sunset Manor--and Sheryl and Richard's seven-year-old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin).With the dream of someday becoming a beauty contestant. Olive has been working on her talent routine with grandpa. When she learns that the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California has an opening, she wants to compete.The adventure begins when the entire family reluctantly gets into their old bright yellow VW bus to go from Albuquerque to LA. As the trip progresses, everyone becomes increasingly committed to getting Olive to the contest on time. The mishaps along the way are unexpected and interesting. But, this is no National Lampoon-like vacation-type movie.The movie gives us an irreverent jab at child beauty contests and presents us with grandpa's sage advice to his dysfunctional family--- concisely shouted to his grandson, Dwayne while on the trip‚Äî'Screw every woman you can get your hands on!!' (But, he didn't use the word, 'screw.') (Olive has her music headset on so she is the only one in the bus that isn't within earshot of grandpa's advice.) The cute seven-year-old Olive wins your heart over as she helps to bring her family together by trying to do the impossible: win the Little Miss Sunshine contest without any rehearsals.I'm not sure if this Sundance-sponsored movie is destined to become a classic. But, I found it to be entertaining and fun. Much of its humor is irreverent or gallows humor, and I found myself laughing out loud many times. I think that one of its greatest assets is its unpredictability. I guess I am not alone in my love for this movie. It has also won several critical acclaims, in several categories",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Wee Piece of the Sun,"Little Miss Sunshine is a film that shines in every facet of the word. Opening with a little bit of introduction to characters you presumably do not know, Sunshine seems to draw you in with a bit of wonder. This is the story of a girl who wants to compete in a massive beauty contest in California, and is given that chance by the sheer luck of coming in second at a previous contest. The winner of the former contest is forced to drop out, and Olive, the little girl, gets her chance to be Little Miss Sunshine. Olive's seemingly dysfunctional family sets out on a road trip in an iconic yellow 'VW Minibus.' Each of the family members has some unique story, and state of mind, that makes each one very interesting to watch as the film progresses. A homosexual uncle who's on suicide watch, an overachieving father, the estranged mother who's desperately trying to stop the seams from snapping, the silent brother, and of course, the heroin addicted grandfather. The trials that each member of this family goes through during the course of this flick is. on paper, very tacky. With that being said, this movie is far from tacky, and that is credited to the great writing, and the absolutely perfect cast. Steve Carell is the biggest star, and pulls off his role with the utmost class, and his quirkiness completely sells the believability of the character. There was no bad performances, however, at least two more must be noted. Paul Dano is as good, if not better than his more experienced counterparts, as the aphonic Dwayne... and considering he doesn't speak for a majority of the film, that's quite the achievement. The best actress in this film is undoubtedly Abigail Breslin. This girl outplays every single one of her co-stars, because she brings such a natural and sheer believability to her character Olive.When it comes down to it, this movie is so fantastic, because it doesn't rely on big names, special effects, or huge budgets to communicate a heartwarming, yet sad, believable, realistic story and sacrifices nothing. The sheer genuine feeling that flows through your body at the end of this awesome flick is reason enough to see it. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Exactly how I remember it,"It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. Movie is too focused on plot so a lot of characters are just space-fillers. With the exception of Olive, and partly her grandfather, the whole cast seemed neither here nor there. And I can't stand her brother, I guess every year that passes makes me less and less sympathetic to the whole teen angst nonsense. And in spirit of the ""like father like son"", every time Greg Kinnear spoke I had to stop myself from gauging my eyes out (reaction similar to the one I had watching him in ""House of Cards"".However, the second half of the movie is good enough to even make you chuckle once in a while, so you hate those characters a bit less. All in all, this is a cute movie for a night-in with the family, but it's a far cry from ""timeless classic"" some claim it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Funny and motivational""","The portrayal of an average family's life and playing a focus on the question of what is important in life and how we live it is the motto of this film. In my opinion it is more than what it looks like if we truly go deep inside it. The film starts with the focus on a little girl about how she is very much excited about a miss sunshine competition. The family decides to go to the venue on their vehicle. The portrayal of the family shows us that they are not poor but a little below the average family and their entire hope lies on a deal which the husband is to make. Than we have a son whose entire aim is to become an air force pilot. There is an old man in the family who is always foul mouthed and has experiences from his war which makes him see life in a different way. There is another man, newly inducted in the family who is the brother of the wife and has suicidal tendencies. And finally we have the husband who always thinks of some rules to follow in life in order to be successful. The stories of all of them are initially unlinked but by the end they leave us thinking about life in general because all of them merge at one particular point. Although every time the focus seems to be on the little girl and all others are actually doing everything for that girl. But inside they all are also struggling with themselves and by the end it becomes clear what they all had been fighting within.The film teaches us a lot on the behalf of life. Every other aspect of filmmaking helps properly to tell this great story which is funny and inspirational at same times.MESSAGE: ""Life has many fruits.""VERDICT: ""Highly recommended.""",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Absolute Winner,"Olive (Abigail Breslin), Richard (Greg Kinnear), Sheryl (Toni Collette), Dwayne (Paul Dano), Frank (Steve Carell), & someone simply known as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) all make up the Hoover family. Together they are traveling in a run-down yellow VW bus from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach in order to get 7-year-old Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, where she will hopefully be crowned the winner. As simple a task that may seem, the trip proves to be a difficult, yet enriching one. On their journey the family must deal with heartbreak, shattered dreams, & even death, all the while learning to support and trust one another no matter what life throws their way.First time directors, Faris and Dayton, have created a remarkably and genuinely excellent film. From the amazing cast and their splendid performances to the hilarious screenplay written by Michael Arndt, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is hands down one best films of the year.The great thing about each character that is apart of the Hoover family and featured in the movie, is that they're all so very realistic. The most distinctive and memorable members of the family would have to be Olive's older brother, Dwayne and Grandpa. Dwayne presents the characteristics of what many kids today consider themselves today as ""emo"". As the film advances, we learn he is actually just your average teenager that's simply misunderstood and not ""emo"" at all. Then there's Grandpa; wisecracking, heroin snorting, kicked out of the retirement home for sleeping around Grandpa. Arkin does a terrific job with this role. He brings not only the character's written personality to life, but adds his own flare as well with his great facial expressions that only fuels the entertaining hoopla presented in 'Little Miss Sunshine'.The hilarity doesn't seem to stop even when death tries to darken the movie's comedic stance. Grandpa's rantings alone make the movie worth seeing. The irony that Olive's dad, Richard, is a motivational speaker who day in, day out informs people about how to achieve their goals, yet he himself can't accomplish anything is just of the several added bonuses.After changing my mind three times; first deciding to see 'The Illusionist', then again to 'The Black Dahlia', and finally agreeing upon 'Little Miss Sunshine' I'm really glad I did. There's not a funnier or better cast film out right now. The bottom line is 'Little Miss Sunshine' is an absolute winner and one of the few must-see films of the year. The only reason not to see it would be because it's no longer playing at your theater. In which case you then find another theater in your area that is.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Maybe it was different with an audience in a dark theater. *shrug* Haven't we seen an old vehicle that has to be pushed to start and everyone has to run to jump aboard a few times before? Have we seen a grandpa who is foul mouthed and mean but lovable? A troubled family member who won't speak? Yeah, bits and pieces from a lot of old films are slightly altered and put into this mishmash.And is it just me, or are children's pageants just too creepy.

"A very grim and dark story told in a most adorable fashion, Little Miss Sunshine is a charming little film with heart but flaws as well","Little Miss Sunshine went from a tiny personal independent film to one of many of the ""little films that could"" back in 2006. Working on a small budget and not much press, it would emerge as a sleeper hit at the box office and would prove to be a highly-praised effort by the well-known directing duet Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. Mixing comedy (quite dark actually) with a heavy hint of drama, Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare decent dark comedies and a rare decent road trip movie. But, despite all that, its not perfect. Billed as a comedy but coming off much more as a depressing dramedy, Little Miss Sunshine suffers from an unbalanced blend of genres, a few slow moments, and an ending that doesn't really complete the story. As a matter of fact, the ending just screams indie and could have been seen from a mile away. At this point, the conclusion may have just been spoiled, if you've seen enough of these lower-budgeted, ""unformulatic"" films.In Little Miss Sunshine, we follow a very dysfunctional and depressed family full of oddballs that are hitting bumps in life. Whether its depression, divorce, long vow of silence, drugs, or lack of motivation, there is almost every kind of unfortunate scenario and situation within the family. The glue keeping everyone together is the adorable daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who just happens to be able to enter a beauty pageant for smaller kids. The rest of the family unites together, despite their anger, frustration, and tension amongst each other to help Olive attempt to claim her moment in the spotlight.Running the show is the superb acting from practically everybody. From veterans Alan Arkin and Greg Kinnear to up-and-coming stars like Steve Carell, Paul Dano, and Abigail Breslin, excellent casting and even better acting runs Little Miss Sunshine and is its standout feature. None of them truly stand out, but they all blend in together with the chaos and drama going on throughout the film. It was fascinating how in one moment, they can make you laugh, and in the next moment make you cry.Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are excellent directors in the field of music videos. Within the past decade, some of the better music videos come from them. With Little Miss Sunshine however, their creativity and usage of visual effects isn't utilized here, but instead their skills in terms of capturing emotion is used at full blast. Capturing scenery was no problem, as the duo made art out of everyday backgrounds. They kept the pacing quick and consistent, and refrained from taking any long shots unless its bits with no dialogue.The problem with this movie is the writing and the story in general. Dark comedies can be hard to find, since accidentally crossing the line past dark comedy leads to drama. Little Miss Sunshine aims to be a cute and charming film, but with so much gruesome drama and so much cynical humor, it ends up becoming a gruesome look at life and a rather grim tale of everything going wrong when it shouldn't. Its dark comedy is hard to laugh at sometimes when the dysfunctional family continuously hits roadblocks on the way to the pageant. Kind of like the main weakness of Pursuit of Happiness, Little Miss Sunshine suffers from way too much drama. But, unlike Pursuit, the film has practically no closure in any of the subplots and the bad news that keeps charging into the film every couple of minutes. Topping all the grief is lack of closing as the film ends very abruptly.Bottom Line: Great directing and great acting couldn't save the movie from having a rather bittersweet taste towards the end. What was a decent story in the beginning disintegrated into an incomplete body of fiction that screams indie and a potentially unnecessary sequel. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare films that is cute and dark at the same time, like a Gothic Red Riding Hood with big innocent eyes. We see a lot of careers rising out of this, and directors successfully crossing into another field of entertainment, but not an instant classic that shall be adored for generations. Best Picture nomination? How did it get that? Little Miss Sunshine: Good, but not uber fantastic.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A virtually flawless triumph of character development,"Pleasant, charming, witty, fantastic, emotional. These words don't even begin to describe how great of a film Little Miss Sunshine is. It's the best picture nominated winner of two academy awards (Best supporting actor and best original screenplay) that follows a quirky and strange family across the country in their VW bus as they head for California with dogged determination to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. The oddball family includes Olive (Abigail Breslin) the youngest of the family and who is entering the pageant. Her parents are Sheryl and Richard (Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear), Olive's suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell), Olive's silent brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), and her jaded yet loving grandfather Edwin, played by Alan Arkin in an academy award winning role. Together, this family provides us with some of the most charming laughs and some of the most tear jerking, heart wrenching moments of true human emotion that will bring a tear or a smile to your face.This is a film that is all about the characters and their relationships that develop over the course of the film, and they are, each and every one of them, fantastically written characters. They are so incredibly human that you believe every word and every action that occurs on the screen. When the film begins all of the characters are drastically flawed people. In fact, none of the characters are even all that likable. Richard is full of himself and tries to force his ideas on everybody around him. Sheryl is under constant stress and can't get her life together. Dwayne comes across as nothing but a whiny punk teenager who hates the world. Uncle Frank is a pretty pathetic loser who seems to have given up on himself. And Grandpa Edwin has nothing but love for his granddaughter, but resents everyone else. He constantly complains about his past and at first seems like nothing but an angry old man with nothing to live for.But the character we immediately fall in love with is the adorable Olive. Her heart is full of nothing but innocence and sweetness and she is in fact what brings this family together to share this love and compassion. And through her we are able to fall in love with all of these characters by the end of the film. It is character development magic at work, and it works perfectly. The more we learn about these characters the more we enjoy them, and the more they learn about themselves the more they love each other. It is incredibly moving to see a family that begins the film so detached from each other come so far and so close together that by the end of the film they are all new people. Their perceptions of each other change so much for the better, as does the viewers perceptions of these characters. It is a practically flawless developmental arc.There's something about this film where even if something happens that doesn't seem realistic or seems a little too over-the-top you just don't care. The film makes any and all of its absurdities work and there just wasn't a moment of this film that I didn't enjoy. In fact I adored almost every moment of the film. Everything that this film tried to accomplish worked stunningly well. It is such a touching story that provides an excellent balance of clever laughs and tears that aren't forced upon you by an easy script. This isn't a film that tells us how to feel. It is just done with such wondrous talent and pure emotional integrity that we can't help but fall in love with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movie had a lot of language, sexual reference, and things like that. There is really *tons* of language that I thought was disturbing. It made me wander..why?

The good acting, all the weird and ""different"" characters.. it all falls to dust because the story is actually lacking the essential spice to get the viewer to the end with a feeling it was worth the sit.It happens so often with American indie type movies.

"Works as a drama, but a disappointing comedy","Little Miss Sunshine works well as a drama, but the comedy doesn't appear until the very end of the movie. I had expected Little Miss Sunshine to be more of a comedy and its disappoints if laughs are what your looking for, but it is a good drama with great acting.This movie is about a slightly dysfunctional family from Albuquerque. The children's uncle just tried to commit suicide, the grandfather was kicked out of his retirement community for heroin use and the father is spending all of his time trying to sell his idea for a book (which is not going well). The main story is about the little girl in the family, Olive (Abigail Breslin). Her dream is to be in a beauty pageant. Within the first few scenes we find out that Olive has been accepted into the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant for children. The rest of the movie depicts the entire family traveling from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach in an old yellow VW for the pageant.The comedy in Little Miss Sunshine is subtle but there is some, particularly in the last few scenes. Throughout the entire film there are lines which are funny, funny enough for a chuckle, but not a head-rolling howl. For example, the grandfather preaches to the son about how important women are, and that he should have lots of sex in his life. When the father says 'hey', the grandfather replies something about him still having Nazi bullets in his skull. Most of the other jokes are darker, but can be funny if you're in the right mood for it.The acting is perhaps the best part of Little Miss Sunshine. The father (Greg Kinnear) is an annoying character, but the acting is still good. Olive is cute and Abigail Breslin is perfect for the role of the innocent little girl. The brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is strange as he doesn't speak for most of the movie, but once he opens his mouth his scenes are quite powerful. The mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) is good, so is Steve Carrel as Uncle Frank. However, the best performance is arguably that of Alan Arkin as Grandpa, his performance his funny and full of satire. Arkin now has the Oscar trophy to prove that he did a great job on this film.Little Miss Sunshine is a dark comedy with a happy ending. The great acting is very believable and the cast has great chemistry. The story itself is pretty good and the script was well written. If you feel like a dramatic movie with the occasional laugh, you know, Sundance Film Festival kind of movies, then I would recommend Little Miss Sunshine. If you prefer comedies like The Hangover, then you probably wouldn't like this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great, Heartwarming Film","I love this movie. It'll make you laugh, cry, and curse at your screen, keeping you constantly entertained. Combine that with some great acting and you've got yourself a perfect film to enjoy with friends.There's definitely some darker moments, but the film doesn't dwell on them for too long. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it shows a realistic family. Not fully happy and perfect, but with a lot of love at the core.This movie also has a great soundtrack that really adds to some of the less dialogue-heavy moments.

Comical but tedious,"Before I watched the movie, I had hear a lot of good things about it so I was really looking forward to watching it. However, it was very difficult for me to watch it until the end. The story line was pretty easy to predict and tediously slow. There was nothing in particular in the movie that was outstanding or interesting. It wasn't particularly attractive visually, nor very humorous or touching.But still there were some unexpected parts that could be entertaining or touching after you think about it again. The characters were all very distinct and familiar in real life, and the few darkly comical scenes made me smirk. Also, the acting was great, and I was especially impressed by Paul Dano's acting. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, but I wouldn't necessarily watch it twice.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very very very funny!,"My life is all about movies, I have seen pretty much every single movie ever released in the USA since 1998. So, If I tell you this movie is funny, you can trust me - it is to me anyway.I can diminish the ""very very very funny"" to a ""really funny movie"" to be fair to it. The actors and story plot will nail you, the funny scenes are funny (something hard to see on a lot of comedies out there), you get a ""cheese"" story but serious at the same time. I say I can put this one among a few rare funny movies from all times.I don't know if I think of this as a funny movie because I am a fan of the TV series ""the office"" and the actor of (funny guy) is on this picture, so, maybe I am corrupted, but overall go and check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Silly Little Movie,"I went to see the preview last night with an open mind as I had not heard much about this movie. I was not familiar with most of the cast, with the exception of Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin and Tonni Colletti, who were all very good in their parts. The brother and the Uncle were equally as good in their part. It is a story of a family who at the last minute hear that their daughter Olive has won here beauty contest and qualifies for an entry into the Little Miss Sunshine contest being held in California. This is the story of their adventures traveling from New Mexico to California in an old Volkeswagon bus. The sound track was hard to hear as there was so much laughter during the movie. My recommendation is if you don't want a movie with a long message and just want an evening out with not to much thinking this is the movie for you. Enjoy",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A spicy comedy-drama teemed with sunshine,"I wasn't so impressed right after I watched this movie. But next day I kept thinking about what its seemingly anti-climax ending truly means. One thing is sure: this is definitely not an ordinary comedy. It distinguished itself from ""cheap"" laughter-invokers in that you know things are not that simple while you were laughing. Neither should it be labeled as a ""dark"" comedy. It is ... a spicy comedy-drama teemed with sunshine.But on a second thought, is it really sun rays everywhere? Shortly after the opening scene we realized that our main characters, the Hoover family, is besieged by so many troubles that the only reason it didn't fall apart is due to inertia. Oh, and our little miss sunshine, of course. The best part of this insecure family is that it is almost a typical specimen of the prevailing social problems: divorce, poverty, indifference, drug-abuse, suicide, homosexuality, pride & prejudice, etc. With the development of the story, we tend to be more and more anxious about the outcome of Olive's trip to the child beauty pageant and put all these ailment off. In the middle I was tricked to believe that this is a Shirley-Temple Clone. It offers more than that. Surprisingly, after the Hoovers left the scene in the yellow VW bus, nothing seemed to be solved yet everything is now sunshine.My favorite quotes from the movie: Frank: ""You know Marcel Proust? ... Yeah. French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Unrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads. But he's also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he uh- he gets down to the end of his life... and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered- Those were the best years of his life, 'cause they made him who he was. All those years he was happy? You know, total waste. Didn't learn a thing. So, if you sleep until you're 18... Ah, think of the suffering you're gonna miss. I mean high school? High school- Those are your prime suffering years. You don't get better suffering than that.""And, of course this: Grandpa: ""Listen to me, I got no reason to lie to you, don't make the same mistakes I made when I was young. F**k a lotta women kid, not just one woman, a Lotta women.""4 Oscars nominated. How many will it win? Let's see.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Comedy"" is almost misleading","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is thoroughly enjoyable. Of the greatest importance: this movie is not a ""family comedy,"" but the -other- kind of ""comedy."" If you've seen Duncan Tucker's ""Transamerica,"" for example, you will be familiar with the feel of ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It's more interested in making you cry than laugh. When humor emerges, it is dark and tinged with other emotions. And like ""Transamerica,"" ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is both involving and satirical as a portrayal of how modern Americans relate to one another.The screen writing is mostly good. From the very first scenes, I was drawn in by the quirky yet identifiable characters. Even more importantly, the main cast tackled these roles with verve and honesty. Olive (played by the remarkable Abigail Breslin) is a believable child with actual feelings, quite rare in comedies (and movies in general, really). And it turns out Steve Carell -can- take on a role demanding subtlety.""Little Miss Sunshine"" works best when it's not taking itself too seriously, keeping me engaged with the subtleties of the characters, their relationships, and the pacing of the story. The film has its misses where it overreaches. There are a couple serious scenes that are too slow -- slow enough that I was allowed to become aware of how thin and fairly unimaginative the plot really is. After all, the storyline is based around a road trip that brings together its participants; that's not exactly re-inventing the wheel. On the other hand, I can't tell you how refreshing it is to finally see a road trip comedy that -doesn't- retread all the tired conventions of the movie style. Yes, there is car trouble, but it's not employed as an overwrought plot device, and the family doesn't end up walking in the rain and falling in mud. Yes, they argue en route, but cutesy ""Mom, he's touching me!"" moments are mercifully absent. By balancing lightness and honesty throughout, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" ends up more bearable than 75% of the ""comedies"" that get churned out today, Hollywood or independent. Check it out -- just don't expect to laugh too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A simple yet beautiful film,"I never usually write reviews yet for this film I feel I should, each character has such a unique personality in which almost everyone will be able to relate to at least one of them. Despite the difference of character they still all come together to help one other, which I believe is the purpose of the film. They all eventually realise there's more to life then there own problems and in helping each other they found joy which is what the makes this film so beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Who's to Judge?,"There are two plots going on in this film. The first is like the movie Clockwise or a bad dream which you have probably had in which you have a deadline to meet in some other place but every possible obstacle seems to prevent you from getting there. Part of the dynamic is that at every stage the protagonists are faced with the choice: do I keep trying to get there or do I give up now. Every time you choose to keep trying the stakes are raised, so that eventually the incentive to quit, no matter how strong, cannot outweigh the investment made in carrying on. ""We've come this far; we can't quit now"" trumps every objection, even those based in breaking the law or standards of propriety.Once the Hoovers reach their destination, a new plot situation takes over. Now we are at the competition where our hero (or in this case our heroine Olive)is the underdog facing overwhelming competition. Ah, we've seen this situation before, haven't we? Rocky, Cool Runnings, The Mighty Ducks, Seabiscuit, Sister Act II?The thing is that while the road part of the plot was going on the assumptions which support the competition plot have been steadily undermined. At the start the father Richard represents the hackneyed standard American attitude to winning and losing: life is about winning and losing and if you're a loser you have only yourself to blame. Again we see this in Frank's suicide attempt because he might not be the number one Proust man in America. We see it also in Dwayne's love of Nietzsche (the philosopher who said that winners have the moral high ground) and his determination to cause himself pain in order to get into flight school. Richard supports Dwayne, but it doesn't take long for us to start to really dislike Richard and what he stands for. Our dislike for Richard makes us like the grandfather more (more than we probably should, as we ultimately realize) because his character is so strongly contrasted with Richard's.By the time they get to the beauty contest Richard's philosophy has been beaten to bits. Both Dwayne and Frank have come to the fore as spokesmen for a new philosophy which we hear in the line, delivered to try to persuade Sheryl to pull Olive from the contest, ""I don't want THEM judging her."" There is no reason to submit yourself to the judgment of others, especially as their qualifications to judge may be dubious. In the face of the new philosophy, we are not rooting for a clich√© ending.Clearly, this film is not a typical comedy; indeed, I would recommend that people go into it not expecting any humour at all. People who are painfully struggling with the fundamental principles of their lives are not all that funny. The characters are dealt with more thoroughly, the themes considered more fully, than we usually get in comedies. The solid acting throughout keeps the viewer interested in the people, especially the heroes Frank, Dwayne and Olive. I don't think that it should be ranked as one of the top 250 films of all time, but then isn't the IMDb top 250 just another beauty pageant? Does it matter whether this is number 251? Not really. I think the film tells its story and makes its point which is all that should matter. Check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Darkly quirky sunshine,"It's become a sort of tradition now. Every year, there comes a small independent movie that's so well received by audiences, it becomes as popular as any mainstream Hollywood film, a ""little movie that could"", if you will. Previous examples of this sort of film include 2004's ""Garden State"", and 2005's ""Hustle and Flow"" and ""The March of the Penguins"". This year, there's no doubt in mind that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" perfectly establishes that mantle.One of the main reasons behind Little Miss Sunshine's success is its ability to be quirky, dark, and ultimately relatable all at the same time. The screenplay follows a sort of formula of meticulously blending dark, dysfunctional family issues with subsequent emotional and comedic payoffs. It's a rather ""Royal Tenenbaums-esquire"" tactic, and nevertheless, a hard one to pull off. Yet, the screenplay proves to carry out this style with great ease. An ease that pushes the film thorough its first two acts, and then lets it flout on its own two legs for its finale.The film focuses on an average American family, and a dysfunctional one at most. From its opening scenes, we are introduced to each of the character's main goals and inner demons. First, there's Olive, a youthfully innocent little girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant, even though, at first glance, you'd think she'd more likely be the bispectacled winner of a spelling bee, instead. Then there's Olive's brother, Dwayne, a teenager who longs to escape from his family's dysfunction with hopes of getting accepted to an Air Force Academy and prepares by constantly exercising and taking a vow of silence. The father of the two, Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a devoted winner and business overachiever who can either be the peacemaker of his family or the over-commanding chief. The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette) is, of course, the warm heart that everyone leans upon. This position places Sheryl in a rather stressful state, as she's always trying to communicate in order to help her and her family make their way out of the work-case scenarios. Then there's Frank (Steve Carell), brother of Sheryl and uncle of Dwayne and Olive. A highly intelligent scholar, Frank is recovering from his suicidal case of depression, after learning that the man he loves is, in fact, in love with another man. And last, but not least, there's Grandpa, an aged hippie who follows a rather adventurous and eccentric philosophy for his lifestyle, fueled with sexual innuendo and heroin. For Grandpa, every moment of life should be worth living.Everyone argues because of his or her various differences and inner-demons. Grandpa offers bad advice to his grandchildren, Richard stresses his family over the egotistic concept of winning and losing, and Sheryl just wants her family to be free of its mess. So, once Olive is accepted to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, the road trip that the Hoovers embark upon shall lead to their discovery of the true meaning of ""family"" and how they should learn to accept who they are, for better or for worse. This may sound like a sappy little movie with a crystal clear message; yet, it's far from it. Although it can indeed be heartwarming, the film doesn't touch those elements until it emerges out of the dark shadow of its character's issues. Everyone has personal obstacles to face and it's only a matter of time before they learn to overcome them. This is the secret behind Little Miss Sunshine's success, it's its ability to communicate exuberantly with its intended audience. And, it does so by presenting us with characters that are so real and somewhat disturbing in nature, we can't help but realize their quirkiness because of the fact that we've seen them before in our every day lives. In other words, it's the nature of the story and the characters that leads to the quirkiness.The script is a work of beauty, as it presents each character with subtle ease. No one is too dysfunctional or too dark, but, contains just the right amount of realism to connect with the viewer. The situations and predicaments that we witness all help bring out the best of these daunted human beings. For instance, when her brother is in his worst state, Olive is always there to put her head on his shoulder, ready to cheer him up. It's scenes and situations like these that form the quintessential of the human heart, the true key behind the film's success.The performances given by the ensemble cast are equally real and unique. Although everyone delivers a raw amount of realism, Paul Dano is the true standout. When he plays his quiet character, he allows the audience to feel his emotions through his daunted facial expressions and various nuances, which is then multiplied by ten when he actually does talk.I also cannot conclude this review without giving praise to the directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who capture every single aspect of the film's beauty. Considering that Little Miss Sunshine is indeed a road movie, it succeeds in presenting us with the gorgeous landscapes of the California cross-country, indulging in the vast sunshine. Yet, visuals aside, Dayton and Faris also accomplish in capturing the realism of the film by utilizing in a sort of ""documentary"" feel, using hand-held camera techniques that benefit to the overall believability of the film.All in all, Little Miss Sunshine is one of the year's best, and it wholeheartedly deserves its wide range of acclaim. In a year that's been full of lukewarm efforts, Little Miss Sunshine carries the biggest, and most refreshing of hearts.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Earnest Family Film About Embracing Losers,"While many movies celebrate the idea of becoming a winner, it's sometimes a lot more interesting to see the perspective of remaining a loser. In the case of the 2006 indie hit Little Miss Sunshine, this critical darling of a tragicomic road film proved how just being yourself means a whole lot more than trying to push for nothing. As this film won best original screenplay for Michael Arndt, it shows how earnest this feature is in deconstructing society's false ideology to condemn losers over winners. Does that mean the feature has stood the test of time since its release? Only one way to find out.The film stars the dysfunctional bankrupt Hoover family as they embark on taking the youngest to compete in a child beauty pageant. In the context of each family member, Richard Hoover is an overly competitive motivational speaker whereas his wife Sheryl is an overworked mother having to put up with her silent teenage son Dwayne aspiring to become a fighter pilot. Meanwhile, Sheryl's gay brother, Frank, is an unemployed suicidal scholar of Proust and Richard's foul-mouthed father, Edwin, is a drug addicted degenerate who coaches him and Sheryl's daughter Olive to be a true beauty queen. On top of being forced to live with each other in their low economical situation, they all have to deal with their own problems in trying to succeed in an otherwise highly judgmental world. Throughout the runtime, it is through Olive as the most optimistic of the family that the theme of realizing to just be yourself despite what others say is where the emotional pathos shines the most, especially at her young age. As this film put it best, a real winning attitude comes less from arrogance than from nobility.As for the factor of the film mainly taking place on the open road, the choice to go from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California allows for a nice contrast between the real miserable situation the Hoovers reside in and the glorified LA scene common in beauty pageants. The choice to have this focus on the family as characters rather than pale tropes works well in its favor, especially with Richard being too overbearing on Olive to be a winner. That mentality Richard steers is based on him being a loser himself, both as a life coach and an honest father to his daughter and step son, whom the latter is increasingly detached from his family alone. The social pressure of acceptability is what burdens the family when they should be accepting of one another for who they are. On top of that, the cast bring all of their characters to life, including Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin, and especially Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano as Olive and Dwayne respectively. It's no wonder this film highlighted these otherwise cherished people in a film of not so cherished losers.Despite mostly taking place out on the open road, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris made the most out of the limitations. The yellow Volkswagen van the Hoovers go to California in not only symbolizes them coming to terms with their inferiorities, but it visually becomes as broken as they do, thus having them all come together as one collective team with a winning attitude. Subtle choices in editing help too depending on how intense a scene gets based on the minor obstacles the family has to endure in just trying to get from place to another. Tim Suhrstedt's bright cinematography paints the film with a calming presence that often gets contradicted within the themes of expectation over reality, and can sometimes look grim and moody depending on the scene's tone. Although mostly a pretty somber feature, Mychael Danna's score adds a nice touch of comfortability when the tone calls for it. By embracing the smaller budgeted productional values, the filmmakers elevated the themes of accepting one's misfortunes just to appreciate who you are by doing their best.By humbly honing in on the timeless themes of being yourself despite what others perceive, Little Miss Sunshine remains a delightfully engaging family film from start to finish thanks to its earnest tone, flawed yet relatable characters, phenomenal performances and strong small filmmaking qualities. If you're yet to check the film out or even have seen it for years onward, then it's good to check it out once again on its own accord. In overcoming our own weaknesses and hard times, films like this have a special place in our hearts to remind us how there will always be similar people who we can resonate with.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not the funniest movie of the year,"I don't know what it is about Little Miss Sunshine that makes it so appealing to so many people. I was first introduced to the movie while on a flight during the holidays. I didn't watch the movie at that time but I don't know if it was the movie or the alcohol served on the plane but there were so many people laughing throughout the entire movie. I thought to myself this must be a really funny movie so I thought I would like to see it down the road. Well low and behold on the flight back from my little holiday trip the movie was on again, so of course this time I did watch it and I was a little disappointed. I thought the movie was cute but I wasn't laughing nearly as much as everyone else on the other flight. To me the movie took on some challenging story lines and I applaud the writers for their script. At times the movie moved a little slow for me and I needed to have a little more development of the family together. I didn't know how long they had been married, what happened to the kids Dad. I don't want to give away spoilers but what I will say is if you like really dry humor you will probably like this film. There are certainly some laugh out loud funny moments but not nearly as many as I was anticipating after listening to the passengers on my flight laugh all throughout the flight.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

the ice cream scene,"I really didn't like how Richard was telling Olive she would get fat by eating ice cream. Why tell a 7 y.o. girl she's destined to be fat just because she orders ice cream? But anyway, when the mom tries to console her, I think she misses the point completely; she basically tells Olive that she could be fat or skinny, whichever she chooses, as long as she's happy. She doesn't even mention anything about ice cream. But I think it would have been more appropriate to make it clear that having ice cream sometimes does not result in obesity or even necessarily fat. Poor Olive! The mom just really missed the point in trying to console her daughter, and should have smacked Richard around a little for constantly damaging his child's self-esteem.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Little Miss Plagiarism, but  still OK.","Firstly it is an amazing film, I think my mum would love it, but for me it just reminded me of the pain of growing up and how dysfunctional families can be. Telling the story of olive who so badly wants to win the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and the wacky road trip that her family take to get her there. The thing that I didn't like about the film was the lazy film-making stealing bits from 'National Lampoon' to 'Napoleon Dynamite' amongst others; you will see what I mean when you watch it. So they are arranged into a new story of sorts but the plagiarism is blatant, maybe someone who doesn't watch a lot of films wouldn't notice but for me personally it spoilt the viewing experience a little. The family dynamic is portrayed well with some great performances from Toni Collette as the mum trying to hold together the rabble, Steve Carell (fresh from being the American 'David Brent') as the suicidal gay teacher Frank and Greg Kinnear as the dad always trying to prove himself a success. Add to this the son who won't speak and the drug addicted granddad and you've got a right mixed bag of characters all travelling along in a knackered up VW van to California. As you can well imagine it isn't all smooth running and from the go get you can let the laughs commence thick and fast. A mixture of script based and slapstick gags it never really lets up and isn't typically preachy or moralistic for an American film, although there is a bit of the old family bonding nonsense in there, well how could there not be? Not disturbing enough to be ranked alongside a Todd Solondz movie, but just weird enough to make a fifteen certificate. If 'Sideways' was for the dads then this is definitely a film for the mums.

Misses a little in box office shine,"The producers of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" would like you and their fellow Hollywood liberals to know, up front, of their disapproval of the Bush Administration. They've built this modestly-entertaining rehash of plot innovations found in National Lampoon's ""Summer Vacation"" and ""American Beauty"" around that important political point. Actually ... I'm exaggerating almost beyond belief, as a mind game just to imagine how it would seem to any liberal to encounter in a Hollywood movie political snideness gratuitously directed, even in a brief scene, at their own liberal pantheon of political heroes! But as we all know, that will most assuredly never happen, so it's pretty much a moot exercise. Seriously, this film would be okay as TV re-run fare if you're not paying for it and have nothing more stimulating available tonight at the local video shop. The cast professionally serves up black humor American-style, using American society's ample lampoon-able aspects. Too bad, though, about the so-so ending: it could have benefited from some extra effort on the part of writers perhaps too pleased with themselves at sneaking in the prescribed quota of partisan nastiness.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Saccharine Sentimentality, Artfully Sour-Coated","I felt angry that I liked this movie. It was clearly formulaic: from the stock characters (Foul- Mouthed but Heart-of-Gold Grampy, Long-Suffering Voice of Reason Mom, Angsty Teenage boy) who follow fairly predictable story arcs, classic situation comedy moments (verging on slapstick, as though National Lampoon kept on trying to get into your quiet dinner party) poorly justified, and the consistent ratio of feel-good sentimentality to lightly-twisted. The overall feeling is of something painfully sweet that has been calculatedly sour-coated, as opposed to something sour which has been sugarcoated. And yet the script keeps you guessing just-enough (about how they will do something, not what will happen next), and the predictable is artfully sidestepped or twisted ever-so slightly, so that one is left with very little concrete to complain about. In addition, solid performances by an above-average cast (Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin often sell lines that in lesser hands would sound like they were written by a maudlin computer program) save the day. In a sense the whole film seemed like what you would get if you forced Wes Anderson to follow all of the rules of a beginning scriptwriting class. It is a feel-good movie packaged and seamlessly designed to be digestible to movie snobs, and, infuriatingly, it succeeds, like a sweater you really like and are ashamed to admit comes from... the Gap.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hopeless, Depressing and Predictable","I was quite disappointed with Little Miss Sunshine. From the trailers, to the critics reviews, to the incredible cast, I expected this to be a movie that I would have enjoyed just a bit more. I suppose we are meant to sympathize with the losers in this movie, but I just found the whole theme of the ""lovable losers"" to be exasperating. This compounded with the fact that the outcomes for three of the characters were so easily decipherable that I checked out half-way through the movie, makes Little Miss Sunshine only worthy of a Sunday afternoon HBO waste of time. Lastly - Steve Carell is not the same actor we've been seeing on television and other movies as of late. I understand that comedic actors often try to bust out of their proverbial mode, but I almost felt as if he was holding back his usual wild antics, or they were otherwise edited out of the film. Bottom line: if you're looking for a comedy that makes you laugh because you are uncomfortable with the characters, see this movie.

Heartwarming and extremely well performed!,"Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming and well-rounded film. Each character's arc is dynamic and has a satisfactory ending; every character is so well-fleshed that it's difficult to isolate a single main character.The film follows young Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) and her dysfunctional family as they drive to California so that Olive can compete in the beauty contest of her dreams - the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Olive's family, despite their mutual dislike, is forced to work together for the sake of the little girl they all love. In the cramped van is Dwayne (Paul Dano), older brother, who doesn't speak and hates everyone; Grandpa (Alan Arkin), who snorts heroin; her parents (Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear), who are struggling financially; and Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), who is recently separated from his boyfriend - and recovering from his suicide attempt.Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano capture an adorable sibling relationship with their impressive performances. Breslin, despite her young age, depicts a timeless story of self-acceptance and self-love; and Dano gives that of a caring older brother, compelling even with his character's vow of silence.The direction of Little Miss Sunshine (by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris) is tolerable, if a little underwhelming. There are quite a few impressive wide shots that capture the whole family, but the filming itself lacks depth and awareness. There are barely any shots that feel intentional or moving; the acting is surely what makes the film great.Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that features captivating storylines, adequate comedy, and remarkable lessons in life and morality. Rated R, the intended audience is a little more mature than what would be expected - but the never-ending use of strong language certainly informs this rating. Anyone able to handle mature language will be sure to find some aspect of this movie to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Adorable, dark and funny","I love this film so much that I did a case study and analysis during college.There are so many underlying messages that are not only thought provoking, but also at times hilarious.Some of the scenes will make you cry from profound sadness but other scenes cause cry-laughing from the chaos of what is happening on screen.The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful.Even the opening title sequence is a visual masterpiece, showing a glimpse into their wild version of normality.Life is a mess, but that's okay.Something to learn from this is that it's hard to be human.If you get a chance, I recommend watching the deleted scenes; there are some cheeky silly ones that I assumed were filmed just for fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Heartwarming and Clever,"Little Miss Sunshine saw the film debut of the directors and the writer. It is very heartwarming and has positive messages of family. All the performances are great, and they all have their unique personalities. They all change for the better, the little one Abigail Breslin is fantastic. The story is really clever and there are a lot of funny scenes. There are also many emotional scenes, like with Paul Dano's character. Steve Carell surprised me with a somewhat emotional character. I highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A dark comedy that has aged perfectly,"Every main actors put on a great performance, the chemistry they had together was beyond perfect.WARNING: Very sad parts, mental health issues but that's what makes this film very very realistic.Watching this film as anything younger than an adult will kind of be hard to get the meaning and point of it. And would even probably seen as two different type of movies cognitively to the two different age groups.This is a film you'd enjoy if you're into indie/non mainstream films which is why it's so ground breaking and why people enjoy it.HIGHLY recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A laugh-out-loud comedy,"One of the unique things about independent cinema is, if you live outside the City of Angels, the Windy City or the Big Apple, you need to wait weeks before an ""indie"" film comes to your area. These cities have the audience and are proved testing grounds for this type of cinema. Indie films thrive in disassociation with the large film studios because it would limit their ability to be unique and produce cinema that some might call controversial. Few copies are made until the film proves it can stand on its own. Once that happens we all get to see them. With the use of satellites the emerging digital film distribution systems should assist in making these films available faster in the coming years.Little Miss Sunshine has been playing to rave reviews in those cities for weeks but that doesn't necessarily make it a great film. You might remember the screenplay ""Brokeback Mountain"" an indie film with a huge advertising budget yet the movie stunk up the place.""Little Miss"" stands taller than the hype. It's a story about a father/grandfather thrown out of a nursing home; a dad who bets everything on his 8-step to success theory; a teenage son who decides not to speak; an uncle recently released from a psyche ward for trying to commit suicide over a gay lover; mom, the only sane one in the bunch; and little Olive wonderfully played by Abigail Breslin. The family decides to take a road trip in a VW bus from New Mexico to California to enter Olive in a JonBenet Ramsey type beauty pageant named, Little Miss Sunshine.It's a laugh-out-loud comedy which avoids every predictable humorous scene shown in so many comedy films. Instead of the predictable the film provides you with so many hilarious and unexpected surprises. Because you never know where it's going your enjoyment is greater. Near the end of the film you find yourself laughing so hard you can't hear the soundtrack but who cares the images are so funny that it's not needed.If you consider yourself straight-laced or think you have it all together chances are you won't enjoy this film. But if you're are like me - slightly twisted, partly dysfunctional, and can enjoy 101-minutes of steady laughter, you can't afford to wait to see this on DVD.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Cute summer fare,"LMS is a good summer-quality movie with most of the humor in goofy sight gags occurring on the family's long and trouble-filled road-trip. The real fun was in the goofy characters and their many Keystone Kops antics.Greg Kinnear did a great job as The Dad, as his straight-as-an-arrow American Dad looks made him the perfect straight man all the others played off of for laughs. He was annoyingly funny as an unsuccessful, 9 step program motivational speaker, and he drove the family nuts by spouting his 9-steps whenever the family found itself in crunch after crunch on their trip, as he dimwittedly believed that following his 9 steps would solve any problem. Thus, he was the chosen family doofus as they travelled from New Mexico to L.A. in an quirky(typical)VW bus, where they intended to enter their daughter in a really tacky, little girl beauty contest. Those nauseating contests really do exist, believe it or not.The hilarious Alan Arkin played the off-the-wall, heroin-addicted, and profane grandpa to the hilt as usual, and Tony Collette as the wife and her very odd, vow-of-silence son were good too. But Steve Carell of The Office was outstanding as the morose, suicidally gay uncle taken along on the trip so the family could keep him from killing himself over a failed job and romance. His acidly sardonic remarks were some of the film's best moments. But their 7 year-old Little Miss Sunshine contestant daughter was the real star of this movie. She was a natural and showed just the right spunk and guts for a beauty contest entrant, even though the choice of her talent act reflected more of her sex-obsessed grandpa rather than her normal little girl self.Sounds really sick, but it was funny in context. I did wonder afterward why our national child protective services didn't comment about the provocative sexual content in her act as it related to a little girl, but guess they considered it ""humor"" and not serious enough to make a fuss about. But, the creepy pedophile in the contest audience was truly scary, as he could have been based on reality. Uggh. Think of JonBenet Ramsey.But, aside from that, it was a very entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Abbreviated comments due to this late entry..Aug.27,"I've now read comments ranging from our external reviewers ;where are James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert when I want them? from July through August 26..We went to see the flick last night, after weeks of my procrastinating,due to the apparent' content. You've had prior opportunities to read summarizations of the plot,so I'll skip this.Personally, I did not laugh during most of the flick, whereas many in the audience laughed or giggled in many of the scene appropriate moments, including my partner,leaving me to wonder why I felt 'emotionally flat' with a few exceptions. I enjoyed seeing Alan Arkin's role as Grandpa, but realized later how absolutely despicable his character was, and how several ,but few critics, point out how naive or ignorant the parents were of exactly what Gramps was doing behind closed doors in their home, and with their daughter. That Gramps was addicted to profanity, sexual fantasies, and heroin seemed only an ' annoyance' to the family. That they had NO clue what dance ""routine"" he was teaching Olive, and seemingly what won her acceptance into the Sunshine contest in Redondo Beach is 'unbelievable',if not incredibly ignorant, given the source of the routine. As several pointed out, there is the obvious comparison to, or subtle reference to Jon Bonnet Ramsey, and her Mother's motivation to relive or recast her own dull life by grooming her daughter for a Beauty Contest which robs children of their innocence,and which arouses vile passions in some Karr's to exploit more than the momentary fame and fantasy. Horribly, this Satire portrays Grandpa's foisting his aged,drug induced fantasies upon the only 'innocent' character in the story, Olive, while all others, so obsessed with overcoming their own feelings of failure and inadequacy , eventually succumb to the Passion of getting Olive to Redondo, to enable her to become a winner, not losers, as they are, and ,in so doing, fulfill Gramp's dying wish, to have his Granddaughter become his real,live Fantasy Tramp; as he warns his grandson, to fornicate with every young girl he can before it's too late, seemingly the ultimate lesson he has learned from his dissolute life and the guiding principle he gives to his posterity. One might just wonder if behind 'closed doors', behind the parents' backs, he did more than teach Olive a 'trampy dance routine.' And this is the legacy he bestows on his family, which unites them in their 'humorous' efforts to rush Olive to the Sunshine of Redondo Beach, or is it to the ""Little Miss Bitches"" contest. Or, possibly the above is all 'sour grapes', since I could not exalt in the laughter of witnessing a family's descent into the despair of worshipping 'false idols'. YES, optimistically, we may foresee a brighter future for the Hoover's, if Mama, Papa, Uncle, son and daughter have learned anything from their travail-travels, and from burying a decrepit Old Addict, or will the Hoover's have to await a Roosevelt to imbue 'social responsibility' into their morally and apparently financially bankrupt lives.. My, My! Wasn't this a hoot? But go to see it anyway, and judge for yourself, exactly what is some damn funny in this tragic tale..",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"One step further, 'Little Miss Sunshine' could have turned into soap opera but it manages not to overkill. Thanks God, I'm so glad.","Every family is quirky in its own way, and 'Little Miss Sunshine' is the movie that reminds us that what a family truly means. Things can get ugliest in all the way possible because you are yourself around the family, and familiarity turns into disrespect sometimes. However, when it becomes hard, each stands up for one another and tries to be there by one's side. I was laughing at one moment and crying a moment later, and I like how 'Little Miss Sunshine' keeps the balance between bawling off and bursting into laughter. I cried the most not when a grandfather passed away which is supposed to be the most tragic if it is in real life but when a family comes together as one and dances off at the stage which is supposed to be the most joyful moment in real life. Making audience cry at the sad scene and making them laugh at the comical sequence are easy, but arousing so much deeper emotions cannot be done without delicate screenwriting. The pace of the story development is tactfully managed as well. To simplify the film, it's the story of separate family members uniting as one body, a supportive organization. How they communicate and understand one another and become close is so subtle, and nothing in the movie even hints the progression or interferes concentration. So natural and quiet but powerful as the water flows a river. Ensemble cast is so adorable, and they look like a real family. Each member is unique, and each has his or her own story. It is cute, heartwarming, and long-lasting.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Makes the average Dysfunctional family seem normal,"I saw this movie at a special pre-release screening at a drive-in theater with about 100 VW buses in attendance (including mine). It was a local LA radio station (KROQ) promotion.I had heard the buzz about this film and watched the trailer so I had some expectations going in. While I enjoyed the story and the characters, with great performances by Alan Arkin (grandpa), Steve Carell (Frank), and little Abigail Breslin (as Olive), but I felt that a little more character development and emotion would have given the plot more punch.The VW bus personality and quirks known so well to us bus owners made it fun to watch. Whenever something broke or malfunctioned the crowd at the drive-in cheered and applauded. If anything I recommend this movie to VW bus owners. For everyone else, you might want to wait for the DVD release.In summary, I liked this movie but expected a bit more. Most of the funny scenes are in the trailer. Good acting, especially Alan Arkin (he needs to do more projects these days), But a soft plot and a lot of build up to an anti-climactic (weird) ending left me a little flat.~Randawg.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little Miss Boredom,"This was very much a ""nothing"" movie. Too little plot, too little real acting, too little charm, too little to hold any interest. The movie was not funny. There were no laughs, though maybe a small chuckle - when the funniest moment in the movie is when the door falls off the bus, it is sad. Which is more what this movies was about and what the movie was like. It was sad. If the movie had any message, it was that dreams get squished and there isn't anything you can do about it besides move on. In the movie, everyone's dream is destroyed, and they show no end in site, no remedy, no better future for anyone. Overall, the movie was tedious. It is hard to understand how anyone would like this movie at all, much less really think it was even good.

One of my favorite movies of all time,"I first watched this movie back when it came out around 2007 and I've watched it on and off the last 12 years. I'm just now getting around to a review as I watch it again and with my partner has never seen it. I think everyone who watches this can relate with the characters in some way but ultimately what I like are the different themes of dysfunction, sadness, joy, emotional anguish, plus so many more. It's a great look at a dysfunctional family and how through all their setbacks and traumas learn to come together in the end. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll cheer. It's heartwarming and engaging.Right from the beginning you can just feel the tension within the family and all their struggles, heartbreak. They are family divided and broken. And on their journey to California to have their daughter compete in the little Miss sunshine pageant they find a way to come together through all the loss, heartbreak, and pain.

This movie wasn't awful, but I don't know how it got an 8.2 either. I kept thinking it was set in the 70's or 80's by the way they were dressed and their vehicle. The only thing that kept setting it off was the father's flip cell phone and then in the hotel room, Bush was on TV. Parents who have kids who need glasses...don't make them get the kind this poor little girl was wearing! And, I'm sorry, I have a 5 year old daughter and wouldn't let her look like she did. There is no way she would be in a beauty pageant. You won't believe how they make the other little girls look! They were more beautiful and sophisticated than I could ever feel!

"Unfunny, Derivative Indie Trash","Little Miss Sunshine is about a dysfunctional family on a road trip in order to take the daughter to a beauty pageant. The description sounds typical, and it only gets worse. The characters are as unoriginal as they come, straight out of sitcoms and stock-character heaven, from the loser father to the foul-mouthed granddad. The script is injected with flat drama, stuff that would have, strangely enough, been used for laughs in a superior comedy. It may be clever at times, with a structure that's at least decent, but it's too short on laughs. A few chuckles can't redeem this derivative, unfunny piece of aggressively indie trash.Contains: Some Strong Profanity, Snorting of Heroin, Occasional Sexual Images",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Emotional, Fun, Deep & Refreshing","I loved the movie.I loved how it faced deep themes in an unusual, stimulating way; how one single theme - pain, suffering, malaise in all its ambiguous forms - connected those brilliant, well-thought characters who progressively get to the viewers' hearts.On a pure technical level, the writing was phenomenal, from the characters to the little details that contributed to the greatly built pacing of the story. You can tell the writing is impeccable when all
the questions are answered by the end. And they were not just answered, but taken to the next level with a stylistic but simple writing style. Every little thing in the script is there for a reason, and throughout the story each plays a minor but crucial role (from the eye test to the bus mechanical problems), and that was satisfying to feel and watch, when it all comes together. All the expectations I had during the movie were magnificently satisfied by the ending, which does not feel predictable in any way. I wish the movie lasted more to see where the characters end up doing.The essence of this movie can be summarised with one of its own lines. As Marcel Proust said, it's our suffering which form who we are, not our happiness. That's what this movie is.To suffering and more movies like this!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Typical"" Independent Movie","I want to start by saying, Little Miss Sunshine is not an entirely bad movie - it's just not my kind of movie. Everything comes down to a dysfunctional family putting aside their personal problems to help support the little girl, Olive, in her trip to the beauty pageant. On the way drama and awkwardness ensues, and while everyone starts out a little unhappy at the beginning of the ride, at the end of the day they're all in a good mood despite the crappy events that occurred. I guess the key theme in this movie is ""Optimism"", or something of that nature.The acting is alright, but nothing that you would necessarily call 'remarkable'. Steve Carell made a very believable suicide-attempter (though I don't know why they made him gay, to be honest his sexual orientation didn't really matter) and you could sense his uneasiness with the group early on, Alan Arkin did nice work portraying the perverse, drug-addicted grandpa, and even Greg Kinnear had a notable role as the father who was really into his job but failed to realize that the reason he wasn't doing well selling the program was because he was a nobody.I did not, however, care for the acting of Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano. I had a hard time believing that this little girl was as charming as everyone said she was, and the teen kid was just very fake. I liked the girl's scene with the grandpa where it showed his softer side and that he really cared about his granddaughter, and I liked Carell's scene with the teen because he had someone he could finally talk to in the family without seeming weird around. When Olive finally did her pageant act it was funny, but that kind of ties into her grandfather's influence on her.There's a couple of funny moments here and there, but it's mostly drama, and drama emphasized through action over words much of the time. I don't want to listen to people swear their heads off at each other and then get quiet and hug for two minutes. A lot of it just came off as being forced, it's like this movie tried too hard to be a regular independent movie. I can't see myself watching this a second time, and definitely not a third. It's pretty much overrated.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Olive is obsessed with beauty pageants and wants to become a beauty queen. Richard has a Type A personality (in other words, a very difficult person to get along with). And in the middle of everything is the Mother, Sheryl, who just wants to keep the peace.

Needless to say, you can rest assured you're in for a hell of an adventure! Especially also since the VW Bus has mechanical problems, and needs to be moving at least 20mph before they can put it into gear!Along the way tensions will rise, and off course there's loads of humour, fun, adventure, action and yes, even tragedy.

Unbelievably Awful,"I find it hard to understand how people enjoyed this movie. There is nothing remotely entertaining about it.The characters are all weak and hugely stereotypical. The family unit that exists throughout the film is so dysfunctional as to be unbelievable, mainly due to the father character who was such a loser that no wife or family would remain with him. The son who takes a vow of silence for 9 months (kids that age would never have the ability to pull that off). The grandfather is the only remotely funny character but he is so argumentative that he would not have been allowed to stay (he was thrown out of a home, but they would have found him another by then).The major problem that I had with this film is the ending. The whole film leads up to a moment, which was far too long in coming and as a consequence I really didn't care when it arrived, but when it did I was sickened and disgusted. To think that kids that young are paraded around like that made me feel physically sick. Then the dance at the end. Even the fact that it was supposed to be humorous. I found it gut-wrenching even to watch it.Overall 1 out of 10. I would recommend everyone watching this however because the rating of this film need to be lowered.

Too Much Laughing At Our Sitcom Setup Selves?,"Saw this film quite some time ago (well three date movies ago, but that's dog's years for a couple with twin four-year olds.) Trying to find frames of a movie that will satisfy both of us in our time-squeezed frames of minds has become comically complex for us.This film is anything but comically complex, indeed both my wife walked out afterwards thinking that it was sadder than we expected. Don't get me wrong, we laughed when we were supposed to, as did the audience. And anyone who has ever push-started a car has got to appreciate that revolving gag (by the way I think it is funny for several reasons, one of them being that it is actually a bit of a dangerous undertaking...so nervous laughter helps out.)Again, there were some funny moments, and for fans of dysfunctional humor, this film is aimed at you. It's just that it seems a bit too focused on that target at the cost of more interesting characters and less easy humor. I did enjoy the use of Sufjan Steven's track (more than the Devotchka through-out), what a beautiful song, and the scene it accompanied provided a nice updraft of hope that is generally missing here.Oh well, I can use this as a filter for me; people who give this 10 stars won't connect with my ratings either, so it's a two-way filter!

Character And Comedy In a Winning Proportion,"I don't usually write reviews, but felt this warranted one.I just attended a screening in Indianapolis and, wow, this movie exceeded every expectation I had.For one, the cast is amazing - so dynamic in their roles and as a dysfunctional whole. It's hard to single out individual performances, as they all mesh so well. Each character is disillusioned or caught up in their own ways, only finding solace and togetherness in the innocence and beauty of their daughter Olive.Admittedly, the first act starts out a bit slow. But watch out, because like the family car, once this movie gets rolling it isn't stopping with the laughs! A good deal of the comedy in this movie revolves around the parallel between the family and their VW Bus they're driving the Redondo Beach, which provides many of the memorable gags throughout. Surprisingly enough, none of these gags ever seem to wear thin and, if anything, become better as they become more absurd. The film builds up to a great third act, where Olive provides an impromptu quote that seems so fitting for the film.It's funny, pointed, twisted, clever and confident, a film driven by the strength of its characters...literally at times.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little Miss Enjoyable.,"The movie was a mild surprise to me. I have heard the movie was good and read the ravishing reviews, but I never thought that it would be a mature movie. This is not a movie to watch in theater, so I waited for the DVD and watched itThere is a family, who can be termed as 'losers'. The story is about their trip in pursuit of a 'Little Miss Sunshine' Crown for the kid girl. Father is a loser, Son is a loner, Grandpa is a stoner and Uncle is suicidal. It doesn't look greener and does not get any greener.The script is smoothly written and the movie has a flow. Although a drama genre, you will never feel bored during the movie. Humor has been inserted in appropriate places. Acting is real good. Each and every artist has out done others. I love the start of the movie.This is a dark comedy, but leaves a good impression. It has a lot of family values, like father being there for the loser son, brother for sister, mother for the family, and everyone for the kid sister. Must watch movie. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My new favorite movie,"This movie could simply not get any better. I am not going to try and sound like a film snob by saying big words. This movie is real in the midst of it's ridiculousness, it is hilarious, and it is emotional on a level that I have never seen before in a movie. I didn't know whether to sob or fall on the floor laughing as it ended, as I was sort of doing a combination of both at the film's culmination. I have honestly not laughed so hard at a movie since I saw 'Home Alone' as a third grader. It makes many insightful, funny, wise and at times 'sickens you as you ponder what your country values' comments, but it's the overall statement that will stay with you. Don't mistake it for a movie promoting mediocrity. On the contrary, it is a life affirming movie that reminds us that in spite of all the darkness of life we have to just keep dancing through, or it's all for nothing. Best movie this year, and in my opinion, ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best blend of comedy and drama I've seen in a long time.,"I recently had a chance to see this movie at an advance promotional screening, and I was absolutely blown away. My friend who joined me said it was the funniest independent film she had ever seen, and I completely agree with her. By focusing on real situations, and finding the idiosyncrasies within real life and it's strangeness, the movie creates a hilarious atmosphere that often put everyone in the theater into hysterics. What is most appealing about the movie is the extremely diverse and utterly hilarious family. To break them down into their stereotypical roles (the potty-mouthed grandfather, the suicidal professor uncle, etc) does not do the writers justice. Some of the comedy based on mere conversations between these differing characters offers more laughs than any of the recent slew of bad comedy.But where the movie pulled itself apart from the pack is the dramatic scenes. While the comedy offers major laughs, some of the moments in the movie caused audible gasps, and definitely some tears -- such as the guy next to me bawling his eyes out. Each of the characters are hilarious, but also well fleshed out, and amazingly acted, so when they're serious, it resonates, rather than any part of it sounding cheesy. They're the realest fake family I've ever seen, which just makes the beauty pageant all the more hilarious.An amazing movie, I applaud all involved. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wow...,"This movie was flawless. Do yourselves a favor and watch it. At first, I expected nothing much out of this film, however, it turned out to be one of my favorite films this year. The acting, plot, setting, and humor of the film is engaging. I would definitely see this movie a second time and would recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it. The movie, for me, was fast paced from beginning to end and there was not one dry moment. It's one of those films that you cannot dislike because it is to darn cute. I do see this movie getting nominated for some academy awards and possibly winning some. Abigail Breslin was breathtaking as little Olive and she might be the youngest actress to win an academy award. Everyone else was just as good. Do yourselves a favor and watch ""Little Miss Sunshine"", you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Possibly the best movie in the history of cinema!,"Go see this movie! Don't wait for DVD! Little Miss Sunshine is a comedy, but unlike most comedy's it delivers on many different levels. You'll laugh, you'll cry - you'll get really angry. This cast is so wonderfully put together - obviously there is a chemistry with this group. I'm shocked there is not more hype to this movie. Perhaps because this summer has produced so many Blockbuster flops everyone has just given up. I came to see this movie by fate I guess...... (a water main burst in my neighborhood leaving me without water, so there was really nothing else to do......)

Good,"Little Miss Sunshine (2006)*** (out of 4)A family of losers, including a suicidal uncle (Steve Carell), a cocaine addict grandfather (Alan Arkin), a failed father (Greg Kinnear), his wife (Toni Collette) and their two children hit to road for a beauty contest but things go from bad to worse. The story of a dysfunctional family going on a road trip certainly isn't anything new and in all honesty the film really didn't make me laugh as much as I was expecting but for some reason it still worked for me. What I enjoyed most were the performances by Carell and Kinnear. Both men are extremely sharp with the comedy but they also do the drama very well. Perhaps I went in expecting more laughs than the film meant to give but I felt the drama aspects went a bit too far. I found the ending somewhat disturbing but for the most part the film worked well.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Where's the Beef?,"I watched Little Miss Sunshine because of the buzz generated by the Golden Globes and Oscars. I expected to see a movie that was beyond the normal comedy. It's not.I enjoyed the movie. It's truly funny - at times hysterically funny. The cast is great. But Oscar material? I don't think so. It's very similar to previous dysfunctional family tales, like National Lampoon's ""Vacation"" series, that would never be considered for Best Picture honors.The film is very entertaining, but simply doesn't live up to the over-the-top hype.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A hysterical satire on beauty competitions and family,"Well worth the nine dollars it took to get in to see this under-appreciated gem. I saw it yesterday and found that it was already in the small theater with a small audience opposed to the large, crowded one it deserved! The entire story was interesting and cleverly plotted, but it was the last twenty minutes that made the whole film for me, I swore that I burst a blood vessel and I could barely breathe properly. Steve Carell is brilliant as usual as uncle Frank who had just attempted suicide and father Greg Kinnear makes you wish you could hit him square in the jaw. Though I am usually opposed to any goth-like character, Dwayne made the film fresh and was a definitely a highlight in the story. The cast was sparkling and brilliantly acted, including Olive, the young daughter who aspires to eventually become Little Miss Sunshine. If this movie does not win any Academy Awards I will be sorely disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Coming from somebody who loves feelgood, uplifting, and powerful films - this is overrated, and really isn't as good as so many people on here seem to think it is.","It's an average film that has garnered excessive praise and ratings by a lot of these reviewers. The story is unimaginative and predictable, and the scenes are quite often, boring. I feel as though the ending definitely saved it, but again, still a very average film.But seriously, people on here are going on about how amazing the production, the message, the acting, and everything else was. Sadly, its really, really not the case. There's nothing novel about a dysfunctional family being forced to spend time with each other because of certain circumstances, and certainly nothing new about that very same family coming together by the end, due to a collective realisation of just how important they all are to each other and what really matters in life.The sad or emotional scenes ultimately seem out of place, and delivered in the midst of the monotonous journey to the end destination. I'm not saying that it's an awful film, but there's nothing different or poignant about a film that is clearly supposed to stir some emotions.If you want an uplifting film - watch the intouchables, forrest gump, remember the titans, life is beautiful; you know something different. Not this film that delivers nothing new, nothing powerful, and rarely anything funny or memorable. The ending is quite funny and cute, but is really not that great, and I'm genuinely quite confused about the hysteria in some of these reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The unlikeliest, funniest crowd pleaser ever...","This movie is hilarious.Here you have a gay and discredited former college professor who fails at committing suicide, a Nietzsche-reading teen observing a self-imposed vow of silence, a heroin-snorting, smut-loving grandpa, a worn down and stressed out mom, and a motivational speaker who cannot see what everyone else always has - he's a self-delusional idiot. And a little girl who looks up to them.Sound like a formula for a feel good comedy? Amazingly, it is. In fact, I laughed out loud so many times that by the end I was wiping tears from my eyes.But this movie surpasses other situational road trip flicks - it gives you lots of twists and fiascos to laugh at, AND offers three-dimensional characters you can relate to and identify with. You end up feeling a part of the clan.A true achievement of independent film making.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best films for ages!,"I absolutely LOVED this film, and left the cinema with a headache from laughing so much! It had an absolutely perfect cast (I couldn't say which of them was best: it was a real ensemble effort and wonderfully balanced), a brilliant story, and an excellent balance between humour and pathos.I wouldn't want to put spoilers into this: I saw it with only the vaguest idea of what it was about, and part of the joy of it was letting it unfold as a wonderful surprise! If you missed it at the cinema, though, it would lose nothing being watched on TV: its visuals were great, but the story was paramount, and would work just as well no matter how it's seen. If it's not nominated for AT LEAST 1 Oscar, it'll be a total shame!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What are you still doing here?!? Go see the movie!,"I saw this with my mate three weeks ago and we're still both trying to get over how good it is! ""Everybody, pretend to be normal"" has become part of our everyday dialogue along with ""He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy!"" and ""Can someone toss me a fricken' bone here?!?""The main plot is that the family set off in their big yellow kombi from New Mexico to California so their daughter can be in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. Sounds harmless, doesn't it? Except that this family is off the wall: Dad is a motivational speaker, Mum is trying to keep them all from killing each other, older brother is border-line emo who chooses not to speak, little sister is just oblivious to the insanity of her family life, Uncle is a suicidal gay scholar and Grandpa is a druggie.The story is just sooooo good. You'll laugh with these characters, you'll cry with these characters (beautiful bit when little Olive, who's not on the thin side by the way, asks her grandfather ""Am I pretty?""), you'll get ticked off with these characters and you'll celebrate with these characters. The cast is also absolutely brilliant. In the morning before I saw this movie, I'd seen Paul Dano (brother, Dwayne) spit in burgers and Greg Kinnear (Dad) nearly vomit in 'Fast Food Nation'. My personal favourite, though, was Steve Carell, the uncle. Whouda thunk the 40-year-old virgin would get so bummed out? The dude deserves an Oscar!!!Anyvay, if you haven't seen the movie, why are you wasting your time reading my ramblings? GO SEE IT NOW!!!

Touching,"This movie was incredibly well balanced in terms of comedy and drama. If you are a normal person who doesn't typically fit the Hollywood mold, you will definitely identify with the characters in this film to some extent. Perhaps it is the believable, damaged characters, or the imperfect circumstances, but this film touched me. The broken father figure is such an important one for this day and age. In a world where you can't bring home money with your bare hands, fathers increasingly feel powerless in the fulfillment of their and their family's desires. In this film, all the father could control in the end, was getting his daughter to the beauty pageant. Dwayne is also interesting as he represents the increasingly typical high school student trying to figure out who he is. However, instead of portraying him as a typical emo kid, the film shows inner strength, and tremendous resolve to attain personal goals. Although all the other characters are very complex, I thought the suicidal uncle impressed me the most. Unlike the 40 year old virgin, ""Frank"" has nothing to live for, until he realizes the joys only a child can see. I think that's all I should say without giving too much away. THis movie is simply incredible. There is no corny part, and there is no cop out. Go and see Little Miss Sunshine. If you have an ounce of humanity in you, you will enjoy this.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Heart-warming movie,"Although containing profanity, portraying family dysfunction and surfacing symptoms of fallen human nature, love comes through in the midst of harsh realities. My laughters at Olive's dancing moves turned into sobs until the movie ended. There is nothing more precious than a pure trusting heart of a seven-year old girl. She performed her ""routines"" with such dedication to ""my grandfather who taught me the moves"", completely unaware of the meanings interpreted by the audience. The love that may have been hidden but strongly weaves underneath all dysfunction carried Olive through the performance.The irony was that displays of sexuality by other contestants, which are much more explicit because those girls know what they were doing, were deemed acceptable by the beauty pageant.I greatly recommend this movie as a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

it was okay,"I didn't enjoy this movie a lot, but it had certain good qualities. Like it had the right actors for the right parts. That is a complete must for a good movie. I thought it lacked a complete ending. I know that it wasn't supposed to end on this final thing, but when it ended it felt....empty. Like it was only halfway through the movie. Yeah, it was probably supposed to have ended that way, but it made it seem so undone. It seemed like it had no climax in the movie. I also think that it wasn't as funny as everyone claimed it was. Sure it was pretty funny, but it wasn't ""laugh out loud oh my god I gotta tell everyone I know about this movie"" funny. It was ""ha-ha whats the next joke"" funny. It was exceptionally funny, but something was off, something is missing. I must admit that Abigail Breslin did a fantastic job and made that movie ten times better.

A Word or Two About Paul Dano's Oscar-Worthy Performance,"After 230 plus reviews here, you get the idea: it's a really good movie. I'm one of those people that's very wary of hyped-movies actually delivering what's been promised. This one does.This very funny ensemble piece is a delight from start to finish. I have the impression that when I see it again on DVD, I'll find layers of subtler humor that I missed on first viewing. In the initial dinner scene, for example, there's a lot more going on than just sharp dialog. It could easily go unnoticed.I want to say a word or two about Paul Dano's performance. Even though reviewers have praised him, in the context of this ensemble of extremely accomplished actors in showy roles, his work is a tad under-appreciated. If anyone ever deserved to get nominated for a supporting actor award, it's Paul Dano for his interpretation of Dwayne Hoover's teen angst.Dano does more with one simple sly look from under his dyed-black bangs then de Niro, Pacino, et al, do with an entire monologue. Even though you can barely see his eyes, they communicate meaning by the boatload.In a group scene your eyes are drawn to him, partly because his non-speaking role compels you to watch him to see what he's ""saying."" A storm of dialog can be going on around him and he's fully participatory without uttering one little syllable. You watch him because you want to hear every word he's NOT saying. It's an absolutely mind-blowing performance.Toward the end of the film, when he finally explodes into vocalization, it's letter perfect and utterly real. Afterwards, when he succumbs to his sister's simple gesture of love, he returns to the family fold with exactly the right exhausted tone of someone who's just unleashed months of suppressed rage. It's a five-minute arc of emotion that is astonishing.All the performances are top tier, but Dano is mesmerizing. Toni Collette again rolls out her superb comic timing. You laugh just hearing her interject her husband or brother's name in a hopeless effort to curb their inane and inflammatory remarks. She does it in a dozen different ways, and it's funny every time. For me, Allan Arkin was the weak link. It was a good performance, but no different than the cranky roles he's played before. His character would have resonated more if it had been cast against type. Think about Bob Newhart or any nice-guy actor in the part and you'll realize how much funnier it could have been.Above all, what I admired most about the movie was its dagger to the heart of child beauty pageant pedophilia. Absolutely brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I Loved It!,"I thought this movie was excellent. Not only was it laugh out loud funny at points but it was deep and serious at others. The best part of this movie was that it was real. It was so real it was relateable and even though I in know way was like any of the characters I could still relate to them. There were points in the movie that were so funny that I was crying but as funny as it was there were just as many times were is was crying out of sadness for the characters. While I was watching the movie I kept recognizing people. I would be like hey there's Hodges(the character) from C.S.I., and Mary Lynn Rajskub from 24. There was a great cast for a well written funny script. I would change a thing about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Easily the best of the first half of 2006.,"So far this year has definitely started on a weak note with films coming out. Sure there have been plenty of entertaining popcorn flicks like Talladega Nights, Superman, and Pirates Of The Caribbean 2. And the horror film genre has made leaps and bounds with releasing Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes, Slither, and The Descent which are all a major step forward from the recent crap in horror films that have come out over the previous 3 years (and yes the Descent doesn't really count cause it was released in Britain last year). But then comes along Little Miss Sunshine and completely renews hope in a better last half to the year.Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed plenty of the theatrical releases so far this year but Little Miss Sunshine is definitely in a league of its own compared to the others. The basic story follows a very dysfunctional family on an eye opening journey across the country to enter young Olive into a pageant contest.What I found most impressive was that the movie not only managed to be extremely funny regardless of its sometimes very dark themes, but the performances were phenomenal. Especially those of Steve Carrel, Greg Kinnear and Paul Dano. Carrel has without a doubt proved his potential as an actor with this one. When you first see him in the film its utterly shocking as he is sitting in a hospital chair after just having attempted to commit suicide. As the movie unfolds he obviously unleashes his humor but it is very sophisticated, natural, and professional. His oddball characters of Brick Tambland from Anchorman and Andy Stitzer from 40 Year Old Virgin pale in comparison to what he's created with Frank. Of course his other roles have been hilarious and great but in Little Miss Sunshine he really outdoes himself. Greg Kinnear was also very surprising. At first you hate the guy as he present himself as a very egotistic, mean, and somewhat uncaring man but as the story unfolds he takes this character and makes him something great. Then there's Paul Dano, the son of the family and textbook depressed teen. Yet again a character that is funny but seems very typical and kind of boring until about the midway point when he unleashes an amazing performance in quite possibly one of the most emotional sequences in the film.So make time for Little Miss Sunshine. If you've seen all the big releases for the summer or even if your just looking for something dynamic and interesting, a change from the popcorn flicks, then make this the movie you see for the evening. Simply put its great and shouldn't be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice but a bit by the numbers,"Having read a lot of comments here, I didn't realize the similarity between this film and a National Lampoon's film (Summer Vacation?). I've seen part of that film but I'm not versed in its popularity and certainly didn't know it well enough to identify the similarities shared by ""Little Miss Sunshine"". This is a decent film. The acting is really top-flight. Greg Kinnear is astonishingly underrated. He is great in ""The Matador"", ""As Good As It Gets"", and certainly in this. Alan Arkin is at his acidic, grouchy best. As another commenter noted, he could have done this in his sleep-but it doesn't make his performance any the worse. Toni Collette is brilliant. She is as consistent as Kinnear-check out ""About a Boy"" for a fabulous performance and of course ""The Sixth Sense"". Also, she was really really good in ""Priscilla's Queen of the Desert"". Abigail Breslin-well, as children's performances go, I think this is an excellent one. She does not attempt to play up her cuteness-and this just makes her all the more lovable. I'm not an expert on actors, but it would seem she has some great acting instincts. Paul Dano is very very good if a bit underused. Steve Carell I knew was very very talented from the range he showed in doing fake news reports on ""The Daily Show"" and also the realistic undercurrent to ""The Forty-Year-Old Virgin"". He is very good here too although to me his character seemed a little stereotyped. I would say the same thing for Kinnear's. C'mon-a motivational speaker who...surprise surprise....isn't as good as he thinks. Wow. I'm shocked. Shocked. The encounter of Carell's character with the man who had been favored by his crush, and whose rejection had prompted Carell's character's suicide attempt seems unlikely to the extreme. I think we, if we live long enough and have fairly eventful lives, might meet someone we know a little, perhaps in an unlikely place, but, in the middle of nowhere to meet the person who was with the man who had something to do with your suicide attempt? Really really really pushing the grounds of credibility.I must say that I wanted to dislike this movie. However, the acting is so good that if you can tolerate the cardboard thin stereotypical ""indie"" characters I've mentioned and some other rote situations, the quality of the acting and the conviction which the actors bring to their performances should at least win over some of your good will by the end of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Well crafted movie with nuanced (often hilarious) take on our narcissistic culture,"Don't let the title fool you, this is not a kiddie movie. From the moment Alan Arkin appears on screen you realize immediately you're in the presence of master. Arkin is, as some of my younger clients say, ""off the chain."" Surprisingly enough, Abigail Breslin (who plays Olive)is up to the task and the scenes with these two are priceless. Both could easily be nominated as supporting actors and in a just world they would! While there many moments of hilarity, the movie is also a look into the culture of narcissism, where everyone involved is too busy with the ""me, me, me"" mindset of our hyper individualistic world to actually see what's going on in the present moment. This situation leads to both high comedy and moments of poignancy. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Everyone is different...,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a movie in which we watch a family that try really hard to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant. In this family we have a father who wants to succeed but he can not, a mother who works to feed them all, a crazy grandpa, an uncle, a son who wants to be a pilot and of course a daughter who wants to participate in this contest.I liked this movie not only because of the plot which I found really great but also for the messages that we can take from this movie. Another fact that I liked in this movie were the interpretations of Alan Arkin who played as Grandpa Edwin Hoover and he was a nice entry which gave a different feeling in this movie. Another interpretation which I think that it had to be mentioned is the interpretation of Steve Carell who played as the uncle Frank and he was really good at it.Finally I believe that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a great movie from which we can gain many things and we can think many of those after we watch it.

The best comedy of 2006!,"When telling a friend to go see Little Miss Sunshine, it is really hard to convince them to see it simply because of the plot, because it is kind of contrived and has that done-before feeling. What makes the movie is it's wonderfully flawed, colorful characters, and the tremendous writing, and the ability to keep humor in a potentially tragic moment.In the first five minutes of the movie, we meet all of the characters. We first meet Olive (adorable little Abigail Breslin) glaring at the audience. We soon find out that she's watching old beauty pageant videos, and practicing her reaction to when she finally wins the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Next, we meet her father, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, who's done some of his best work in 2006. His character, Richard is an inspirational speaker, whose ""Nine Steps To Success"" have brought him very little success. Then we meet Olive's teenage brother Dwayne, played by Paul Dano, whose performance might be the best one in the movie. His character reminds me of myself in my teenage years, and the way he plays it is just to die for. Dwayne hasn't spoken a word in nine months because he's taken a vow of silence until he becomes a test pilot in the Air Force Academy.Then we meet the grandpa, played by Alan Arkin. In his first scene, he is showed snorting heroin, and we soon find out that he got kicked out of his retirement home for his outrageous behavior. Arkin is very, very funny in this movie, and his performance is not to be missed. And then we meet Sheryl, played by Toni Collette. She is terrific in the part, although there isn't enough of her in the movie. She plays Olive and Dwayne's frazzled mom who is just trying to do the best for her children. That's pretty much all there is to her character. And last we meet Sheryl's gay suicidal brother Frank, who tried to off himself after being dumped by his lover.In a nearly 20-minute scene at a dinner table where the family eats fast-food fried chicken, we learn everything about the Hoover family dynamic. And then we listen to a message from Sheryl's sister, telling Olive that there's a place for her in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and after some initial hesitation...road trip!I really can't tell you about all of the priceless comedy that goes down on the way from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, because I couldn't possibly ruin the wonderful and twisted laughs in this movie. In conclusion, it's the funniest movie I've seen in years, and possibly the funniest movie I'll see in a long time.

You might have seen the previews-- she gets a call that ultimately results in the entire family driving across New Mexico, Arizona and California in their beat-up VW bus, which can only start in 3rd gear. I must say I was expecting more laughs than I got, but this movie was so touching it didn't matter--besides, the parts I laughed at, I CRIED laughing at. Steve Carell was perfect as Frank- those who are used to seeing him play Michael Scott might be a bit surprised. He is hilarious and fatherly and wise in this movie... in fact, I think the casting is just about perfect.I must say that even though I usually don't see the point in seeing comedies in a theater, it's interesting with this movie just to see at what point people laugh. This movie is similar to the twisted comedy in movies like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Squid and the Whale, which both feature hilariously dysfunctional families that screw themselves over really badly, but somehow come out okay in the end. The difference in this movie, though, are the mixed emotions, especially at the end-- in one of the final scenes I was laughing so hard I cried, but then started to cry out of sadness or who knows what-- the first time that has ever happened to me in a movie.There are a couple scenes that seem forced or awkward for extra laughs, and some places where the script is less than perfect, but I give this film a huge cheer for its heart. I absolutely loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One Of The Year's Best!,"I have looked forward to this one for months, and finally got around to seeing it last night. I found it to be absolutely hilarious, and at the same time absolutely depressing. There were very powerful messages about beauty and love. I think it is a movie that kids and adults should see. It was an excellent reminder to be proud of what we have, even if it isn't exactly what other people have. (i.e. our bodies, our families¬Ö) It was one of the most accurate portrayals of a family I have seen in ages. The performances were amazing, especially that of Abigail Breslin. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh, or can just relate the typical dysfunctional family. Well worth the money, you WILL laugh out loud!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A bit over-hyped but still a good film,"Little Miss Sunshine seems to be a film with very polarized opinion considering most people seem to either love it or hate it. Well, I belong to that small remaining category of people who appreciated this film but expected more out of it.The film has an interesting message and once they arrive in California this message is worked out really well, however the road trip it takes to get there isn't as interesting as I expected. The events that occur aren't that compelling nor are they that funny, making an actual road trip far more interesting than watching this family doing theirs. I believe it's a missed opportunity here, although I nevertheless think the ending saves this film from being forgettable. With a different ending, I would probably have rated it a 6 at most.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Just go see it, everyone will be talking about it soon.","Little Miss Sunshine The movie opens as Frank ( Steve Carrell ) the preeminent Proust Scholar in the US is released from the Psych hospital after attempting suicide. With no place to go, since he should not be alone, Frank's doctors arrange for him to live with his sister, Sheryl played by Toni Collette.Sheryl is married to a Richard Hoover, a Motivational speaker on the verge of his big break through. Richard is played by Greg Kinnear.Richard's father, Grandpa played by Alan Arkin was thrown out of the old folks home for snorting cocaine, so he also lives with the Hoovers.The Hoover's have two children, Dwayne a 15 yo, is so focused on being a fighter pilot that he has gone without speaking for four months. He has vowed to remain mute until he gets his appointment to the Air Force academy.And then of course there is Olive, who we meet last. She is seven.Sheryl brings Frank home just before dinner time. In preparation for dinner Grandpa heads to the bathroom to take a hit. Richard comes home eagerly awaiting news of the big book and promotion deal. He is ready to hit the road as the next big motivational speaker.As dinner starts Olive is told that there is a message about little miss Sunshine on the machine.It turns out that the winner of the local pageant had been disqualified for using diet pills. So Olive the runner up in the local Little Miss Sunshine pageant gets to go from New Mexico to California to compete.Grandpa has been coaching Olive so he has to go. Frank cannot stay by himself so he has to go. As it turns out the entire family heads out from New Mexico to So Cal in a rickety VW bus.What follows is totally funny. The AFI Silver Spring write up notes that the movie is about a dysfunctional family who learns that they need to trust and support one another. This movie is quite a bit more than that. While the comedy is dark at almost every turn, it is one of the funnier movies you will see.This movie reminds you of the movie where Alan Arkin plays the patriarch of a dysfunctional family. That had Maria Tomei in it, and some recognizable faces that have no names. Little Miss Sunshine however makes you laugh at things you never thought you would.I don't believe that this review contains spoilers. However, I suppose that any clear description of the characters could spoil something. The words written above cover only the first couple of scenes. So, have at it.Joseph O.

A piece of advice : don't miss the little sunshine,"Why don't you talk?...Is that Nietzsche [ in that poster on the wall ]? ... You don't talk because of Frederich Nietzsche?"" --Frank (Steve Carell), Little Miss SunshineIt's been a while since I've seen Little Miss Sunshine, the latest amazing Sundance Crowd Pleaser ready to take the movie-going-public by storm, and I've been reciting the above quotation to everyone I know who hasn't heard of the film. To say the least, I haven't been successful in making them laugh at the line, let alone motivating them to go see the movie. And, as I stubbornly typed it at the heading of this review, I discovered why. It's because Steve Carrell's delivery of the line makes it the biting piece of hilarity that it is and, because of its unique brilliance, this delivery is impossible to imitate. In fact, the same could be said for the whole of Little Miss Sunshine; its carefully crafted plot and dialog could have, in the hands of less-skilled actors, seemed conventional and nonchalant. But because there is not a single weak-link to be found in film-making husband-and-wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' cast, their picture comes together in a way that is magical, true-to-life, and beautifully uplifting.Little Miss Sunshine follows the dysfunctional Hoover family as they drive in their broken-down VW-Microbus Van from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California to attend a beauty pageant that their youngest member, Olive, will be competing in. Olive is a hopeful dreamer who brings out the positive in each member of her family, even if they're constantly at war with each other. Anything but the typical superficial children's beauty-pageant participant, Olive is lovably dorky, quirky, and curious. While the film does have a lot to say about the type of contest that she competes in, it's more about the coming together of her somewhat clueless family. Olive's dad, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a motivational speaker trying to sell his Five-Step Plan in a book deal, losing sight of what really matters to him. Her mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete), is too concerned with working, keeping her marriage together, and and putting Drive-Thru Fried Chicken and Iceburg-Lettuce Salad on the table for dinner that she doesn't have time for much else. Also along for the ride across the Southwestern portion of the United States are Grandpa (Alan Arkin), who is addicted to cocaine but shows Olive the kind of compassion that she deserves; Brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a Fighter Pilot; and Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), a gay college-professor who is the family's ""care"" after attempting suicide.Unlike in many other character-driven works, no one personality takes the spotlight here. The Hoovers are viewed as a family-unit throughout the duration of Little Miss Sunshine; this is more of a movie about characters' relationships and how they are affected by internal-conflict, rather than solely the later. Each performance stands out in its own way, accentuating the authenticity of the given Hoover while still maintaining the script's satiric edge. Viewers will be able to objectively (and comically) look at the characters' faults, but also deeply identify with their normal qualities, developing both sympathetic and empathetic feelings for them. The movie is both hysterical and heartfelt, both dreamy and realistic. I loved every moment of it, and I hope that it finds a huge audience as it rolls out into theaters across the country. Little Miss Sunshine is one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Above average, funny movie - with a dark side","Both me and my daughter enjoyed this engaging movie. It's an adult comedy and although the humour is mostly gentle, there are some laugh out-loud moments - with a truly hilarious ending. There is a dark side to this movie - the junkie grandfather and... well, some of the other characters are not what they appear. And that's what makes this movie a little different. The grandfather has some great advice for the teenager in the family (speaking about drugs): ""Stay away from that sh!t. Someone your age is mad to touch it. Someone my age is mad not to."" The acting is uniformly excellent - with the little girl taking the prize. She's wonderful. And the music is good too. My only criticism is that it drags a little in the middle. But the start and (especially) the end, make up for this slight lull. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An ensemble cast and great writing bring the 'Sunshine',"Fox Searchlight's 2006 surprise indie hit 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a film that accomplished one thing more than anything else - it got audiences to feel better about their own families. Set in the American southwest, we follow the Hoover family as they race to Redondo Beach in their VW van to have 7-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) take part in the stereotypically scary ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant. Cue the crazy.Between the heroin-addicted patriarch (Alan Arkin), the suicidal uncle/brother (a 'The Office'-era Steve Carrell), a purposely mute nihilistic teen (Paul Dano) and a hopeless, wannabe motivational speaker (Greg Kinnear), it's a lot for the arguably only sane person in the family - Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) - to handle. There are so many ridiculous antics that unfold during the 800-mile trek, from their beaten down VW suffering mechanical troubles to an awkward roadside diner breakfast that every family can relate to.What really makes 'Sunshine' work is the writing. Written by Michael Arndt, the quirkiness comes through in every line in the script, without feeling forced or gimmicky. There's also a lot of emphasis on character development - something that's crucial for a film that relies so heavily on an ensemble cast - and the dysfunction almost seems like an art form. It's no surprise the writing resulted in an Oscar for best original screenplay.It may not be the best comedy ever, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a fun, zany ride through the challenges of family life and a commentary on the fact that beauty really is skin-deep.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Road trip film like you've never seen before,"Running gags that work, self-involved characters that work with each other, and a near-perfect blend of drama and comedy. All of these things make for a movie-going experience like no other. Say what you will about these characters: the parents are too lenient, the grandfather too raunchy, the kids left to their own devices are not developing as kids should. This is what American families are, folks. If this does not sound like your family, go to any diner in America and look for the first family unit you see. Sit close to them and listen to their conversation. Guaranteed you will hear something like the conversation the screen family has at the diner. People's concerns lie in strange places, and this film is doing nothing if not drawing them out and forcing us to look at them. Dysfunctional for a purpose.True, if you look at it from a certain perpsective, the characters can be seen strictly as caricatures. However, even with this treatment, the filmmakers are not trying to disguise this fact like most films made in our country about Americans. We are all like Olive in some way, naive but somehow strong. We are like the uncle, sad but solid in his beliefs. We are like the father, struggling to hold onto the American dream, discovering the dream will turn out the way you imagine. Like the mother, not considering what can happen when we think we are doing the right thing by allowing others to make mistakes. Like the son, determined to do what he wants at any cost. Like grandpa, throwing all cares to the wind and just letting things come as they will. We know, see and have been these people. This is what it is to live in this country. Don't knock it until you admit you've tried it. Most importantly, through the whole journey, you will come to a conclusion about what you have seen before you that makes all this somehow okay, and in the end, the true American spirit shines through.And you really will laugh so hard it will hurt!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I liked enough to be seen once,"DRAMA/ COMEDYOdd kind of road picture centering on a family that includes, mom Sheryl (Toni Colletti) her husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear, Sheryl's gay brother, Frank (Steve Carrel), teenage son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), young daughter, Olive

a dysfunctional family road trip,"This is not a slap stick comedy, but it is entertaining and amusing. It was one of the better movies of the year. Olive has a chance to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. It is a very long drive from her house to the pageant. Her dad, mom, brother, granddad, and uncle all make the trip in VW that they have to push in order to start it. The granddad like to cuss and is a heroin addict. The Uncle was just released from a psych ward after attempting suicide. The brother has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the air force. The dad is motivational speaker who is trying for a book deal. The mom just tries to keep the family together.Of course, this road trip has many obstacles to overcome. Grandpa dies and they steel his body out of the hospital. The dad finds out he didn't get the book deal. The uncle runs into the guy that made him attempt suicide. The brother finds out he is color blind, which may be the best scene of the film.And once at the pageant, it is quite apparent that Olive is not a beauty queen. And disaster strikes when it's her turn for the talent show.FINAL VERDICT: Good, not the best film out there. But entertaining with interesting characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't waste your time,"I just got done seeing this movie. I ordered it from my Netflix account. Let's just say that I am glad I didn't go waste my money to see it at the theater. First and foremost, I was appalled at the foul language and sexual references that the movie could have done without. Also, while the movie was playing, it was just ""okay"" form the beginning. I kept waiting for it to get better as the movie went on. But it didn't. When the beauty pageant scene came on, I thought ""oh great, now the movie is going to get better"". Nope--that is when the movie took a turn for the absolute worst. And as I mentioned before, the rest of the movie was only barely bearable to sit through. I couldn't believe that I wasted 2 hours of my time watching this movie. If you believe that you can spend 2 hours of your time doing something better than listening to foul language, crude and unnecessary sexual references, for a movie that isn't great to begin with, an overall ""1"" movie on the 1-10 scale, I would say you ix-nay this movie and you will be better off.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

wonderful!,"i saw the movie last week in cologne, Germany and loved it. before i entered, i was awaiting some family comedy in the wes-anderson-way. but even it was quite different, more deep and realistic, it captured the surreal touch of royal tenenbaums or life aquatic. the first thing i have to mention is the wonderful acting (especially the kids, paul dano as dwayne and abigail breslin as olive), it keeps it all moving. the story works quite good as a family drama and comedy with some slapstick elements (here we go the surreal way). its funny and sad but always authentic and last but not least a quite dark satire on the American way of life with an absolutely exciting final. after the film ended, the audience applauded spontaneously and i thought by myself, how long it's been since this happened to me the last time. go see it, i will do so once again!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

My friends and relatives,"It's rare for me to see a movie and feel like I know the characters as friends or relatives, that I live among them. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rarities. I was particularly impressed by the reality portrayed by Toni Collette as Sheryl, the mother who keeps the dysfunctional family from total destruction. She's an archetype we all know and love: a mother earth without whom families would not exist. Everyone else is along for the wonderfully-scripted, screwball comic ride: the desperate, fumbling father seeking to lead, the tormented son, the fantasizing daughter, the zany-cum-senile grandfather, and the chronically depressed uncle. We learn to love each of them as the family finds coherence and truth.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quirky BS? Perhaps. Not as good as everyone says.,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" is borderline quirky to the point of irritating. The characters are crisp and original, but the premise is seemingly one-dimensional and the conclusion is thought provoking, but in a boring way. It isn't a bad movie but for me it failed to move me, or really entertain me that much. Many will disagree but the movie got good when Paul Dano's character started telling people off. Before that time it just seemed like a drag to a unexciting finish.Little Miss Sunshine is not Oscar worthy. The actors do quite a good job, but they are only as good as the quirky, even pretentious script that was given to them. You want a really good independent film? See Juno...THAT is a great film.6.5/10, decent but flat.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Reaffirming the real sunshine of life,"A cute little girl wants to win a beauty pageant. She and her family set out on a road trip of many hundred miles on a rickety bus. The challenges and imperfections of life mock on the faces of the characters and they stand by each other as a family. That is pretty much the plot. Does the little girl go on to win the pageant? Find out for yourself.It is so much a story of everyone of us that we want to see and hear it more eagerly as the film unfolds. As it usually happens, the journey always so much more than the destination itself.Little Miss Sunshine, of course, falls into the category of 'feel-good' films - films that you think about while driving back from the cinemas, or on waking up the next morning, and the thought leaves a smile on your face. It talks about family, honesty and being yourself - virtues that'll never go out of fashion. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris pull of something that is probably most difficult in film making - tell a simple story about ordinary people.Abigail Breslin is no less a sunshine herself - brilliant and natural. She carries the film the way even veterans struggle to do.The final stage scene reminded me of my first time on stage. It was an extempore competition at school and I must have looked just as nervous as Olive. Only that when it was my turn to perform, I was not even an inch as confident as her. Obviously, I sucked big time. But Olive, she rocked.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unashamedly honest,"A family sets off on a journey to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant with many difficulties and challenges affecting their personal lives along the way.Little Miss Sunshine is one fine drama. The real life issues, the hard characters and some established direction make this cult film a classic and a worthy Oscar winner.The film starts with the tragic scene of Steve Carell living with his sister after trying to kill himself. The drama consists with Toni' Collette's struggle to raise the family, Alan Arkin's drug problems and Paul Dano's attitude towards life, in particular his family. The combination of issues including drugs, life and religion reflects many views continually debated in current media and society and not only does this film preach but it entertains on a consistent basis with fine twists and performances.The inclusion of Abigail Breslin as Olive was a master class of casting. Oscar nominated Breslin plays an ordinary girl who has that rare upbeat personality and a fine connection with the world and its issues. The fact that this young character questions what to eat, how to dress and how to act, begs the question of the message models and celebrities are sending out with the ending a debate amongst many.Breslin shines but it is Paul Dano and Alan Arkin who are the stand outs. Dano's ability to hold his tongue and convey that emotion of hate makes you believe he has you on his target list. Arkin's factual and honest Granddad is a worthy Oscar winner in any book with that smart ruefulness and cunning edge.The comedy side of this 2006 picture is interesting. Very articulate and accurate in its approach, it flows from the situations the family find themselves in, such as when the van breaks down and Olive's spirited questioning of situations. Though the descriptions describe it as hilarious, it is more dramatic and black comedy with the real life issues taking centre stage. This is what independent films should be.The story flows on the personal situations each character finds themselves in and whereas Dano's is the most intriguing, Greg Kinnear's depiction of the positive steps towards winning is interesting. His character can be almost as annoying as Patrick Swayze's in Donnie Darko but there is no question of the topic's importance.Little Miss Sunshine is a film to be loved for its unashamed approach to real life, including some black comedy for good measure, rounded off by fine acting",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dysfunctional humor is rarely funny....,"Laughing at dysfunction is like enjoying daytime TV. The one constant is feeling better about yourself in comparison to what is presented on TV, despite it being presented as ""entertainment"". It's quite possible I may have liked this more ten years ago, but I feel like there were new dysfunctional characters, but the same conflicts are the source of the humor, not the characters themselves. The end pay off is great, but fizzles halfway through and doesn't justify the quirky direction and forced reconciliations. The lighter moments were highlighted by seeing our little family centerpiece in the backseat of the old VW bus tying to reconnect the squares of the travel puzzle in the proper space to form a smiley face. It was quick but captured the movies point in three seconds. Unfortunately, the movie last a lot longer. When ideals clash in dysfunction, the casualties can always be found in the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
As perfect as a movie can be...,"Little Miss Sunshne is the best film I have ever seen. I laughed my head off and I cried my heart out. This film is not only splendidly written, but it is also superbly acted. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the father who comes of as a rude, uncaring jerk, when he is really just a man trying to accomplish his goal. Toni Collete as the ""pro-honesty"" mom is wonderful and has such charisma with everyone in the cast. I never thought that Steve Carrell would be able to pull off such an offbeat role, but sure as I am standing here I was wrong. He pulled off his suicidal Proust scholar with such delicacy, and I applaud him. Paul Dano's character inspired me and stole my heart with his stunning amount of truth and depth. I became infatuated with his character because I honestly never knew what he would do next. Alan Arkin was magnanimous in this role of the heroin-snorting, foul-mouthed grandpa. He added the perfect amount of pizazz to this already obscure family and did it wonderfully. And last but certainly, certainly not least is Abigail Breslin, the seven-year-old daughter who dreams of becoming a beauty queen. She reminded me of a friend I might of had when I was seven, and it thrilled me to see the honesty and concern in her face that was true not only to her character, but also seven-year-olds around the world. The acting, as I have just assessed, was phenomenal, but it could not have been done without such an incredible touching and hilarious script.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a film about a family who seems absolutely crazy, but when looked at deeper, is really just an average family with its little quirks trying to unite.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another indie triumph over Hollywood garbage,"Hollywood needs to wake up. It has been generally decided that this summer film season has been predominantly disappointing, but I am going to have to disagree. Not because I think that any major studio has pumped out anything remotely respectable, with the possible exception of the beautifully photographed Miami Vice, but because I saw some of my favorite films of the year this summer, it just took some looking.That said, I have added Little Miss Sunshine to my list of films released this summer that not only should have made more money than every major studio release, but should also have been played in every theatre in the country.I have waited months to see this comedic gem. Released on July 26, following the Best Feature award from the 2006 Sydney Film Festival and a standing ovation at the renowned Sundance Film Festival, it has been one of the most talked about and critically acclaimed films of the year.The Hoovers are a deranged family that, because of personal issues, can barely handle spending dinner together. Their tolerance for each other is tested when Olive (Abigail Breslin), the younger of the two siblings, qualifies for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo Beach, California. Because of financial and personal complications, the entire family is forced to embark on a two-day road trip in their clunky yellow VW bus so that Olive can follow her dream of winning the pageant.While this may sound like the beginning of your ho-hum family adventure flick, the foul- mouthed drug-addicted grandfather (Alan Arkin) alone is enough to make Clark Griswold blush.That is where the film succeeds. Because of its unrestrained vulgarity and general absurdity, it is not only personally relatable but also satirical towards the films that it calls to mind.Any time that the film is tempted to get overly touchy-feely, it restrains itself gracefully and reminds the viewer of its ludicrous bearing.Especially notable is the way the family is forced to work together every time that its bus needs to start moving. Because of some complications with the gears, the bus must be pushed until it is moving fast enough to be put into third gear, whereupon said pushers must sequentially run ahead and jump into the opened side door.A superb cast could only have pulled off such acts of both physical and emotional comedy. As the strongpoint of the film, its spot-on cast carries it above and beyond an otherwise failed attempt at a wonderful script.Greg Kinnear perfectly portrays Richard Hoover's capricious personality as he fights back his shortening nerves with the advice of his own nine-step program on how to be a winner. Steve Carell delivers his most touching and subtly hilarious performance of his career as Toni Collette's post-suicidal relationship-troubled homosexual brother.Every scene of Little Miss Sunshine humbly and hysterically leads to the incredible final sequence, which will no doubt be remembered as a classic moment in film.It's about time that a truly great film this summer is starting to get national recognition and distribution. Sadly, generally dismissed achievements like A Scanner Darkly and Scoop will probably get lost in the shuffle, and we can only hope for the best for the unlikely success of the wildly funny Strangers With Candy. Hopefully, Little Miss Sunshine can act as a wake up call to the film industry to recognize the ever-present superiority of independent films.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Rewarding on every level,"Finally, a movie that is rewarding on every level.I walked out of the theater with light tears in my eyes, while laughing, and I told my friend that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is quite possibly one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Definitely better than any movie I have seen in the last year.The acting was stellar from each of the main characters, especially Paul Dano, I believe. He had the hardest role in which to portray real emotion.What I liked about this film is that it explores the range of emotions -- happiness, sadness, loss, disappointment, insecurity, judgment -- but none of it is blatant. It is merely suggested and the viewer makes up his or her own mind about the message they are to perceive.It's not a dark comedy, but it's definitely not your standard comedy. There are no obvious jokes and punchlines, and each laugh comes with a twinge of realness as if you can feel what each character is going through when he or she speaks. It's comedic introspection at its finest.Brilliant. I am definitely going to buy this when it comes out on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More of a drama than comedy,"I recently watched Little Miss Sunshine a while ago and remembered it being getting many critical reviews and success. The film is billed and titled a comedy but its really not. Its much more of a drama. Their may be some comedic moments where people are supposed to laugh at but I didn't. Especially since it dealt with some more serious issues (drugs, suicide attempt, beauty, etc.) Though the story was very well written and the characters were developed. Also this film is very much about a great message which is one of the reasons why its rating is high and it got many positive reviews. There were many strange moments many including the grandma. Some were him telling some ""advice"" to the son- Dwayne. Also there's a real dramatic and awkward scene. SPOILERS! It happens when they figure out that the grandpa passed away so they go to the hospital. Later they get more problems and they sneak the grandpa's body out the hospital bed and put him in the trunk of the VW.I found many things to be somewhat unnecessary in this film like some of the issues. Some things like learning that Frank (Steve Carell) attempted to kill himself because of his gay lover. I felt like they didn't need to make his character gay at all. No real point, just for interest of the audience I guess. Also they made the father- Richard (Greg Linnear) obsessed with winning and forcing it on his daughter- Olive (Abigail Breslin). The mother- Sheryl was more crazy and bizarre, also a smoker and somewhat disrespectful to her daughter. The son- Dwyane (Paul Dano) was at first creepy but pleading not to speak then he has an outburst toward the end of the film. Also they said he was colourblind. That also was something that was just added for audience pleasure (wasn't very necessary). But thats what made the story more interesting and gave more sympathy for the characters. They made the characters all come together and really appreciate one another. So in general the film is very well written but could have done better had it been more comedic and less dramatic.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Social Repartee,I thought the film was completely hilarious and a sensitive portrayal of some things about American society that are really frightening. So many subtle nuances I could go on and on. The uncle who wanted to kill himself and then came to a family that was more messed up than him. The wife who's working night and day to support her family. The fried chicken for dinner (typical American gourmet cuisine. The boy with the dream that he's so determined to make that he gives up communicating. The drug habituated grandfather who completely adores his grand daughter. The family's long journey across America.

Absolutely brilliant.,"Very rarely are we treated to a film so brilliantly scripted, directed and acted. It's a sad, sad fact nowadays. We can enjoy the odd Hollywood movie that makes the grade in some way, but inevitably it's some sequel, or remake of something that in the end, lacks any real sort of magic. In the last few years, Fox Searchlight have delivered three shining beacon's of simplistic, original, challenging, and insightful little comedy dramas. Those being Lost in Translation, The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, and now of course, Little Miss Sunshine. Three great movies, devoid of any of that formulaic, saccharine, Hollywood taste, that in large doses soon becomes inedible. This film marks a great antithesis to the blockbuster, and the lazily produced.Little Miss Sunshine follows a dysfunctional (that's the polite way to put it) family, as the go on a cross country road trip, to take younger member Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine convention to compete. The family is an eclectic and completely diverse mix, with polar opposites including a heroin addicted, highly opinionated grandfather, to a wannabe pilot son, whose taken a vow of silence, right over to the homosexual and recently outed uncle, a teacher, who failed in a suicide attempt following the spurned love of a male student. Relationships are at breaking point, and require repair, and a cross country road trip, may or may not be the medicine to heal the rifts.This really is a sharp, satirical, poignant, and witty movie, that is aided by a superb cast. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play mum and dad superbly, with Kinnear excellent as the self help guru, unable to help anyone because his nine steps programme is yet to be distributed to the masses, and Collette equally good as the work horse mother, trying to hold everything together in the face of manic depressive relatives, and a lack of income. Of great importance was the casting of Olive. She's the centrepiece of the film, as the sweet young Olive, un-hindered by the adult, or adolescent affliction's affecting her family. She is in fact the normality, and the one who stops everything falling apart, the one that all the family would do anything for. When a young person is so prevalent in a film, it is essential to cast a child who can handle the role, with roles this challenging very hard to cast. However Abigail Breslin (who impressed immensely in Signs, at only six years old) is fantastic. She's being hyped up now as the new Dakota Fanning (as if Fanning is now somehow on the scrapheap or past it!?) and in terms of talent rightly so. She's adorable here and gives a fantastically genuine performance. Paul Dano too is excellent as the Nietzsche inspired Dwayne, the troubled teen. Highly impressive as well is Steve Carell. Known thus far for his comical turns in more the Ferrell, Carrey, kind of mugging genre, Carell proves a great crossover actor (like Jim Carrey). Carell's performance is superb, and his choice of roles beyond this will suddenly expand from those that simply require him to gurn for the camera. And finally as the grandfather, is the always classy, Alan Arkin, who has been off the Academy radar for far too long. He is fantastic here, and must, simply must, be a shoe-in for a best supporting actor nomination. Arkin adds a 40+ years of experience and Gravitas to the role.Directing duo Jonathon Dayton, and Valerie Farris, both do a brilliant job. Things are kept simple. It's all about capturing an atmosphere, a mood, and the performances. It's an 8 million dollar movie, that is infinitely more captivating than anything this year, or last year, that is simply about performance and material. There's no hindrance of CGI, of spectacle. It's crisply and simply shot, focusing on the actors. Hollywood I hope is learning that a price cannot be put on directing, acting and scriptwriting of the highest order, now that big hollow blockbusters are starting to disappoint with their box office return.Little Miss Sunshine is quite simply a fantastic achievement in the aspects that really matter in film-making. It's at this current time, the film to beat this year. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best movie of the year ... so far!,"I just saw this movie last night and I'm still enjoying it! I had no idea what 'Little Miss Sunshine' was about. I had only seen one trailer, which basically consisted of one of the early scenes from the movie, when Steve Carell's character explains to Olive, why he tried to commit suicide. That scene was so funny that I didn't care what the movie was about, I just had to see it. Everything about this simple story of a little girl that dreams to be in a beauty pageant, and therefor drags her whole family on a road-trip from Alburquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California, is perfect. The writing was incredible, the dialog was clever and every character was so well defined that there really wasn't one single main character. The acting was amazing! I was so impressed with every single one of these actors, but the one that really blew me away was Abigail Breslin. Dakota Fanning watch your back! This little girl acted so natural that you never ever felt she was acting. One good example is the scene in which Olive (Abigail) asks her grandfather (Alan Arkin) if he thinks she is ugly. This scene was so moving that it could have easily ended-up being a very sappy and cheesy one. But the acting chemistry between Breslin and Arkin was so amazing that this is one of the best scenes in the movie. Wow, I loved this movie so much. Can't wait for the DVD to come out. I have to have this film in my collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Best movie of 2006, one of the best movies of all time...","I went to see this movie being a fan of each and every one of the actors for years. My growing obsession with Steve Carell was going to be gratified with this performance and I knew he had to nail it to be the next big thing. Before I say anything about the rest of the movie, HE NAILED IT. But he wasn't the biggest highlight within this amazing ensemble of highlights. I'll start with Alan Arkin.Alan Arkin's Oscar worthy performance as the herion-addicted grandfather was one of the funniest and most incomparable characters in years. This role could have been performed by any other actor but it is Arkin's voice, looks, and complete dry delivery that took the character to amazing heights.Abigail Breslin has more talent than Dakota Fanning will ever hope to achieve in her entire lifetime as an actress. She basically has the lead role in the movie and come awards season, she should be up for every actress nod she gain get. She was adorable and delivered her lines perfectly.Steve Carell was amazing. I knew he could do this. I was very anxious about this role only because of the ignorant moviegoers of our time. He has had a good two years and his fanbase is still pretty juvenile and I was worried that the press would be disappointed along with the population of Steve fans. He didn't disappoint me and luckily the press didn't do what I thought they would do. Anyways, the performance was amazing. I'd love to see him with a nod or even a win, he carried this movie.Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, and Paul Dano all redeemed themselves in this film. All three belong in films like these. Greg Kinnear wasn't annoying for the first time, in a long time. He plays the perfect sincere, good intentioned jerk. Toni Collette handed in an Oscar worthy performance as the Michael Bluth-esquire mother who is just trying to keep things together. Paul Dano freaked the hell out of me in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, and I was absolutely and pleasantly surprised by the job he did.In conclusion, the critics and every one else is right. This is a crowd pleaser. This movie is very easy to fall in love with and is one of the first real movies of the year to be both touching and hilarious at the same time. This was a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You must see this one!,"It is probably one of the best in years. You will be laughing and crying all at once and will be a part of an experience you will remember for a very long time. The characters in the film is portrayed in a way that makes you feel amazed by how real they are. The dark humor in the movie is so unexpected, I would have never guessed to laugh so hard in a movie that looks strictly like a drama. If you enjoy movies that impress you with simplicity, reality, dialog there is a good chance you will like this one. The movie shows you a lot about family relations, passions and disappointments in life, most of all it is about courage and love.... It is definitely well worth every second you spend in the theater. Highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A heart-warming, off-beat movie","I didn't know what to expect when I went to go see Little Miss Sunshine - all I knew was that it starred Steve Carell, who I love, and it was an indie movie about a family on a road trip (in an old VW van that keeps breaking down), taking their daughter Olive to a beauty pageant in California. After the first 15 minutes, I knew I was going to love this movie. The characters are very well written, which is a rarity in movies these days. Almost all movies these days star one-dimensional characters, each one the same as the next. When chemistry like this happens, it's magic, even if not all the characters are likable (Pageant Official Jenkins, anyone?) It's been years since I laughed so hard during a movie, and Little Miss Sunshine proved itself to be one of only a few films that made me roll in hysterics and cry at the same time. If you're considering seeing this movie, wait no longer - as far as movies go, this is the diamond in the rough of summer 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sweet and funny road trip movie,"My mother had been raving about this movie for the longest time. She kept telling me ""oh you have to watch it, it's so funny!"" Naturally, this made my expectations rise quite a bit. Did the film deliver? Yeah, I think it did. The cast plays their roles perfectly, from Alan Arkin as the cocaine snorting grandfather to Steve Carrell as the gay, suicidal uncle. The script manages to be consistently funny and be very touching. I always welcome that in a comedy. It's themes of family and giving it your all are evident while being subtle, thankfully (I hate it when they beat you over the head with messages). Only problem I had was a nitpick. Their car breaks down and the mechanic tells them they get get the thing running by getting the car to go at least 20 MPH. Okay, fine. How do they achieve this? By pushing it¬Ö wait that's stupid, but nonetheless it works. That's my only complaint and when everything worked as well as it did, I can forgive that.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Marvelous Movie,"This film in its frequently anarchic spirit resembles in a good way some of the signal endeavors of the 60's, namely ""The Graduate"" and ""5 Easy Pieces."" Business as usual in America, whether in social space or as it pervades the domestic sphere, is here given a freshly felt, genuinely contemporary, non-ideological, sharp-eyed scrutiny. Family life, when everyone ""pursues his own bliss,"" is shown to become less personally liberating than a ground for finding others in one's way, and frequently annoying, if not in fact hateful. In career choices, it may lead to wildly unsuitable decisions, given one's actual talents or disabilities. In romance, it may encourage betrayal should a better option appear. In drug use, it may lead to death. There must be more to life, the film implies, than these attempts at bankrupt Nietzschean choice and then consistency in efforts at having one's foolish way or at all costs ""winning."" Greg Kinnear voices his impatience with those around him first at the dinner table and then towards non-customer friendly service people of varied ethnicity, both at a hospital and at an absurd beauty pageant for children. This same subversive spirit bubbles out of almost every line the wonderful Alan Arkin utters as Grandpa. All in all a marvelous comedy of ideas.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Shines Brighter Than I Ever Expected,"The Screen Actors Guild have an ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast"" award they give out annually, and this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE must be among the nominees (if not the recipient).Never before has a story been so well told and equally acted. Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.And the story goes...Young Abigail Breslin (SIGNS, 2002) plays Olive, a six-year-old whom the entire cast orbits around. The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner. She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals. But due to financial limitations, the family can't fly her, so all of them pack into a VW bus and head west. With Abigail comes her barely functioning dysfunctional family. Her father is played by the estimable Greg Kinnear (THE MATADOR, 2005). Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go. But with him comes his ""are you a winner or loser"" motivational comments that irk everyone around him. Also with them comes Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, THE KING). The 15-year-old has taken a vow of silence until he's passed a test that allows him to fly jets for the Air Force; he writes his caustic comments on paper for all to read. Then we have Frank (Steve Carrell, THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN) who was recently released from the hospital after slitting his wrists and is on suicide watch by the family. A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student; one of his male students. Next we have Olive's grandfather played pitch perfect by Alan Arkin (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING, 2001). He's a smack-sniffing, perverted old man with a misplaced heart of gold. He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition. And finally there's Sheryl (Toni Collette, IN HER SHOES), Olive's mother who is the glue that holds the family together.Road trip movies are practically a dime a dozen, but many miss the mark or become ludicrous. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has no such problems. Bouncing off ¬ó or sometimes smashing against ¬ó each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good-natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable. Olive is a bit overweight, wears thick eye-glasses, and has little talent. But her family loves her without restraint and when they stuff themselves into the dilapidated VW, it is her unflagging perkiness and smiling that drives them onward toward California, even when confronting a failed father, a difficult brother, a faulty clutch, or death.The dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend. If you think about who Olive's grandfather was, the dance she chose to do was outstandingly accurate (what other kind of dance could a drug-addled, porn-watching old man teach?) Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice. It also made me ask ""if"" I should be laughing at this, as it was completely deranged and inappropriate! I'm going to risk a lot here and say that I haven't seen a film this enjoyable in about two years. And the audience that watched it with me seemed to agree; they all stood and applauded when the credits started rolling. That says a lot, I think.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unexpectedly hilarious and moving,"I have never laughed so hard and cried so much - all at the same time- for any movie. I usually laugh behind my hand so as not to disturb others but during this movie, I felt liberated to laugh as hard, loud and as long as I wanted. I cried with the same intensity. Yeah, no kidding. Ask the rest of the movie theater! What a joy. I am still feeling all tingly. The only thing wrong with it is that it ended. Go see it. I will not tell you it was well acted because if I loved it so much it obviously was. I won't tell you casting was perfect because if I love the characters and miss them already, it obviously was. It was sly and delicate at the same time. It was poetic - a description of life that reminds you of your life- your day- today! is my day. We are alive, no? It reminds you of that. Layers and layers of wonderful words, thoughts, situations...you just want to dive in and never come up to the surface again.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Absolutely fantastic movie.,"This is possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard there were tears and my stomach hurt. It was hilarious, the performances were exquisite, and it was fascinating. Even the parts you could kinda tell were coming were fantastic. The little girl, Olive, does an absolutely perfect job of being the endearing little girl who is probably the last kid you'd expect to see winning beauty pageants, but you just love her. Her brother also does an incredible job with what must have been a really tough part for a young actor. There really isn't a weak link in the whole cast, and the plot is also very well done. Hilariously funny, but with enough drama to pull it together. Must see movie,definitely.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Modern Shakespeare,"Going into the theater i was expecting something extremely sarcastic and cynical because, anything called ""Little Miss Sunshine"" couldn't possibly be serious.If you liked ""The Dinner Game"" or ""The Importance of Being Ernest"" you'll love this film. I don't understand how people can complain about extremely-stereotyped characters and situational comedy. If what you're looking for is an CGI-action packed spree of unrealistic plots and pretty faces that say pretty nothings, do not watch this. you will be severely disappointed. Otherwise it's a quirky, humorous comedy about a dysfunctional family coming together for the sake of 7 year old Olive's dream. The humor is mostly based on the interaction between incompatible personalities.Some of the jokes are predictable, but the anticipation of something extremely ridiculous about to happen is probably the best part. The entire audience is just waiting for the plans to explode with horrific laughter. Last night there were less than 30 people in the theater designed to seat 200 but their laughter flooded the room and could be heard from the hallway.I hope you will go see this film and enjoy the characters as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
7.2/10.0,"Positives: The characters are all so unique that, despite the unpredictable events, it creates memorable moments that feel both enviable and enjoyable to watch. One of the cutest and funniest lines I've ever seen in a movie was when the daughter, attending the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest, was asked about her grandpa's whereabouts and gave a hilarious response.Negatives: There were a few unrealistic decisions and scenes, which can be a turn-off for someone like me who prefers films based on true events or grounded, realistic stories. I was particularly drawn to the chemistry between the son and the mother's brother, and I wish there had been more scenes exploring that dynamic.Overall:This film portrays a family growing through their struggles, and it's uplifting to watch.

One of the best of 2006,"Little Miss Sunshine, starring Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Steve Carrell, and the absolutely amazing Abigail Breslin is a true gem of a movie. Its funny, witty, intelligent, even has slapstick, pathos, drama and some very touching scenes. Just when you think that the script will divert into National Lampoon territory or the characters become caricatures it pulls back from the precipice and delivers a scene so touching and real and full of heart and soul.The story involves a family where everyone has some eccentric quirk and they go on a road trip in a beat up 1972 VW bus to a beauty pageant in California. Could be so contrived, so ""RV"" and yet these people really care about one another and have depth and that's what saves this film.I'm gushing because it seems like forever since I've enjoyed a movie in the theater so much. I would love for this to become the Sideways of 2006, the little indie that could. I hope that Abigail Breslin receives the accolades she most richly deserves.

Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie FarisWe've seen this concept before there's no doubt about that, but we have not seen this take on it. Newcomers Dayton and Faris prove to be a great talent when packing an ensemble cast that just bursts with comic genius, kudos to Oscar worthy Carrell.

It was so well done that several of the situations left me nodding along, agreeing that I would have reacted in much the same way.If you do not like language or sexual content (no actual sex), this movie is not for you.

Ugh.,"Can a movie possibly be more overrated? The answer is no. Give LMS credit where credit is due: It's pretty much single handedly responsible for the recent wave of horrendous ""quirky-clever"" comedies, where eccentricities are substituted for character development and the plot is easily reduced to a platitude suitable for a Ziggy cartoon. LMS is a perfect example of a comedy that people who wish to distinguish themselves from the Scary Movie/Date Movie crowd often list as one of their favorite comedies---a movie that appeals to their cultured sensibilities and refined comedic tastes. The moral of the film is trite to the point of offensiveness, but the real crime are the pointlessly, helplessly quirky characters who play off each other in a predictably dysfunctional manner. Man, a gay Proust scholar? Hi-Larious! I'm sure all the college educated audience members are chuckling to themselves at the literary reference--despite that fact that his being a Proust scholar contributes nothing to his character except to make him quirky. Same goes for the moody teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Airforce. Same with the self-help seminar obsessed dad who is actually a loser in real life. Oh and please lets not forget the adorably precocious beauty pageant grade-schooler and her uproarious cussing grandfather. You wont believe your ears when the grandfather, (who is really old!) cusses, and then does drugs! O to the M to the G! Way to defy our expectations and challenge our preconceived notions about the elderly, movie! Even the god damned van they drive in is quirky. Worse still is the effect that this movie had on the industry---spawning even more vapid dreck like Stranger Than Fiction and other quirky for the sake of quirkiness comedies. And a nomination for Best Picture? Really? That's got to be a low point for the Academy. Avoid LMS. At all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My absolute favorite!,"The first time I watched this, it became my favorite movie. But when it ended, I remember saying that either the movie was suppose to teach some big lesson, or it had no point to it. I thought the ending was really weird, but after a while I was able to see all of the little things that were really meaningful. I watched it for a second time last summer, and I picked up on a lot more (not all big lessons, but little touches that made me smile). I just finished watching it again today, and I really took in all of the little ways that this movie comes together to make you laugh, cry, and find more happiness in life. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, or the actual life lessons, because I really think people should watch it for themselves.I'm not saying it will be for everyone, and I can see some people getting offended by all of the language. However, I've noticed that it's been on TV before (never watched it on there though) and I'm guessing they edit a lot of the r rated content out. So really, I think anyone should watch it (at least on TV).I'm disappointed to see it getting close to the top of the top 250 movies. I really think this deserves to be in there.

Fully deserved best screenplay,"Having seen many advertisements on T.V. about ""Little Miss Sunshine"" I didn't think much of it, didn't seem like my kind of movie. But now, I like to think I have matured in my taste, and today I proved myself astronomically wrong. This is first and foremost in my opinion not a comedy, yes it has a multiple amount of laughs, but the structure of the film is drama based, so don't watch it with the expectation of leaving laughing.Lets get to it then, what caught my attention was the impeccable casting, who'd of thunk Steve Carell could pull off serious or that a character who doesn't even utter a sound until the end of the film could captivate you so. The oblivious, self involved father is played tremendously by Greg Kinnear, I mean that scene in the hospital, just hilarious and kudos on Abigail Breslin, who had a personality that could rival the whole cast and she showed that just because you are a child, does not mean you can't act like the best.I've got to say, it's so refreshing to see a film like this, a film that isn't cheesy or just plain embarrassing, it's no surprise it won best screenplay. We must continue to cherish quality over quantity and this truly does that, I highly recommend this to anyone with decent taste, nah actually everyone.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Laughed so hard my belly hurt,"Toward the end of this movie there were a couple of moments when I couldn't stop laughing. It was great entertainment, especially if you need a laugh and a break from violence and gore. I loved it!The characters were a little weird, but the teen boy (Paul Dano) reminded me of my ex's son and he's probably more typical of teenagers than not. There was a little contrivance in the plot at one point (it just felt a little overdone but not that big a deal in the big scheme of things). The dad (Greg Kinnear) was a great character, William H. Macy could have played him, too, if that helps you picture him. Toni Collette did a super job and handled a tough part really well. Of all the cast she gets the least to do, really. Steve Carrell was good, probably developed most of all the characters.But the real stars are listed as ""with"" on the playbill: Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin. Wow. Abigail plays a 7-year-old regular kid. What a contrast to the dolls in the pageant--it creeped me out how they looked like miniature adults. You can't help but think of JonBenet when you see those scenes. Alan Arkin had such great lines, he was really the instigator of everything that happened in that movie. Emmett Walsh as the highway patrol cop did a great job, too.I guess the real stars are the writers who thought up the relationships and development of characters, the directors who coached the performances out of these folks, and the producers who sank money into it even though it doesn't feature any huge stars, sex scenes, or violence. To all of them, THANK YOU--I HOPE YOU MAKE BUCKETS OF MONEY. I haven't felt so happy after leaving a theater since The Full Monty. Except I was a little sad the movie was over.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fantastic,"I went to this movie not knowing what to expect, since I haven't seen very many trailers for it. I won free tickets that required me to drive over an hour to see it, but I thought ""what the hell else am I going to do on a Thursday evening?"" and went to see it. I'm so glad that I did. This was more than a movie; it was an experience. I can't remember the last time I went to a movie that had the ENTIRE crowd laughing, clapping and cheering for the characters on screen. What a beautifully flawed, mixed up dysfunctional family! No special effects, just real, believable, tragically human characters that you root for, no matter how crazy they are. I hope to see some recognition when award season rolls around.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So so so so so so GOOD.,"Finally a movie that truly lives up to it's trailer. Saw a preview for LMS about a month ago and have been thinking about it ever since. And then I finally got to see it.I highly recommend seeing this movie. Fantastic ensemble acting. Beautifully crafted moments. I am in love with Alan Arkin and Steve Carell. Big fabulous crushes. It is so nice to see two actors who began at the Second City and in the comedy world do such nuanced, truthful performance. Carell can absolutely do something like Eternal Sunshine -- now we know. Comedians make the best actors! They have the ability to be TRUE...thats one of the most important things in comedy...and if you're great at that often you can do the flip side: move the crap out of an audience. And Carell and Arkin are both genius in this film.OK, but I should also stress that the entire cast is bloody brilliant. This little girl is astonishing. Not showy and all actor-y. Just BEING. Beautiful.See this movie and help make it a smash success. It deserves your attention!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Let the Sunshine In on a Dismal Movie Season,"A dysfunctional family in a dysfunctional vehicle en route to a dysfunctional event makes for a fine comedy, thanks to a good script and a gifted cast. Take a failed inspirational speaker who spouts the wisdom of his nine points to success, a young man who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy, a gay professor who has just blown a suicide attempt, an old man who is into snorting cocaine and reading porn and throw them together in an old mini-van with a broken clutch and you have ""Little Miss Sunshine."" The film's title refers to a pre-teen beauty pageant in which the only seemingly normal member of the family, young Olive, has been entered.A road movie at its core, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" offers enough laughs to coast through the few slow parts. Unfortunately, with the resurfacing of the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case, the scenes at the beauty pageant have an unsavory aspect as the young girls cavort in grown-up outfits and pose provocatively for the audience. For this viewer, young Olive, refreshingly dressed as a little girl, outshines the other overly made-up and overly rehearsed contestants. Greg Kinnear is fine as the father, although his drop-dead-handsome looks are at odds with those of the rest of his screen family. Toni Collette as Kinnear's wife is always good, and Steve Carell leaves ""The Office"" behind and gives an underplayed performance as the gay uncle. Alan Arkin makes a welcome return to the screen as Kinnear's father, who offers his own advice on life, which largely centers on drugs and sex.Not since ""Happy, Texas"" a few years back has a small, low-budget comedy come out of nowhere to brighten an otherwise dull movie season. With snakes, super heroes, and gross-out comedies filling the screens, discerning viewers can find relief and some intelligence in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Two hours with this odd ball family as they lurch towards California is time well spent. Despite deep-seated differences and outward disdain, these six people show that family ties are deep and pull members together in times of crisis.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Any film that has managed to keep my attention through numerous viewings and still entertains in such a way deserves a 10.,"Three things can basically sum up Little Miss Sunshine: hilarious, inappropriate, beautiful. Little Miss Sunshine, directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris, is a genuinely brilliant movie that manages to be indecorous while never being truly out of line.The story follows the Hoover family travelling to California so their little girl can enter a beauty pageant. The running joke throughout is that Olive isn't especially ""beautiful,"" at least in the pageant-queen perspective. Accompanied by the uncle, grandfather, and brother of Olive, she and her parents drive their yellow camper van across the southwest with bizarre occurrences following them all the way. From the hospital and the motel to the pageant itself, Little Miss Sunshine is a non-stop journey of laughter and emotion.Every member of the family from Grandpa to Olive is superbly acted, making it impossible to not get sucked into their lives. The relationship between Grandpa and Olive is particularly interesting, while Grandpa is crass and unapologetic when in the company of the rest of the family, if Olive is there, he is kind and sweet. He clearly has a lot of love for the young girl and doesn't want her to become aware of and burdened by the family's various issues.Every member of the family has their problems, from the heroin addiction of Grandpa, the career problems of the father, the depression of Frank and Dwayne's dream to be a pilot. Each of these is dealt with throughout the film and add extra dimensions and explanations for their actions. Their goals are all seemingly crushed due to different reasons although all the events bring the family closer together. The father is trying to enhance his career by promoting his ""9 Steps to Success"", however, it fails to materialise, threatening the family's finances. This irony is wonderfully exposed using a few key scenes and the money issues of the family are shown throughout.As the film climaxes, the underlying event has been the beauty pageant, and the dance Olive is to perform. The Grandpa has been coaching her and we have small hints throughout as to what it will entail yet when it finally gets round to showing the performance, you will be in fits of uncomfortable laughter. I can't do the dance justice in words, but take it from me, it is well worth the wait and personifies the film entirely. All I have to do is mention the dance routine to a friend and we are in hysterics.""What is your daughter doing?"" ""She's kicking ass, that's what she's doing.""Lastly, the soundtrack, oh my word the soundtrack, Little Miss Sunshine has without doubt, my favourite audio backing of any film. The tempo of the songs rises and falls at the perfect moments and echoes the mood of the characters. Performed mostly by DeVotchka, it is soothing and melodic, precisely what is needed in such a film.Any film that has managed to keep my attention through numerous viewings and still entertains in such a way deserves an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great, subtle story of liberation from the middle-class","I finally saw Little Miss Sunshine last night and liked is as much as everyone else did. I had a special fondness for what happens to the family, where things start bad and get much better. The father, Richard, is trying to make it as a self-improvement guru by selling his 9 -steps to winning formula. His only idea is that the world has two kinds of people, winners and losers, and the most important thing in life is that you not be a loser. Losing is signified by the other people in the picture: the nation's foremost Proust scholar (with the beard) who has just tried to kill himself over a grad-student love gone wrong, the son who reads Nietzsche, refuses to speak, and wants to fly fighter jets, and above all the grandfather in the background, who snorts heroin, loves porn and sex equally, and swears like the blue-collar stalwart that he is. The mom holds it all together of course, and the 7-year-old daughter, who dreams of being crowned Little Miss Sunshine (not pictured), has unwittingly inherited her dad's desire to leave struggling working-classdom and enter the middle-class of sexpot-princess little Barbie girls.I will try not to spoil the plot while still saying why this movie came as a huge relief to me. Richard is a schmuck whose desire to be a rich guru make his family angry and miserable and make him powerless himself. But as it turns out he doesn't have to be that way. OK, I'm about to spoil the plot a little bit: Richard turns out to be more like his badass dad than he wants to believe, and so does the Proust scholar, and so does the weirdly mixed Air Force- intellectual son, and this is certainly true of Olive, the true Little Miss Sunshine. There's a lot of comedy extracted from the car troubles of people who can't afford new ones, and the film winds up as a study of class conflict in which, for once in Hollywood, going back to your unselfconscious and impulsive working-class self makes you ""win.""I don't mean they win as the solid middle-class defines it, but as soon as Richard - without consciously deciding to - stops trying to rise and just throws himself into the mission of getting Olive to her contest, everything gets better. The movie rejects the classically stupid middle-class assumption that solidarity means reduced efficiency and self-fulfillment. The movie rejects the bourgeois failure to fight: things bump along once Richard and the rest of them just go with the screwed-up van, their lateness, their loser-ness, once they start bending and breaking the middle-class rules. Heroics aren't necessary, just a certain non- intimate acceptance of each other, that things will never be normal, that as people they aren't normal, that they don't have to be normal, and than in non-normalcy there is strength.This makes Little Miss Sunshine a great parable of the middle-class ceasing to hate itself, embracing its blue-collarness (you'll know what I mean when you see Olive's actual contest dance), and being way way better off. Liberation from middle-class aspiration looks like people pushing a busted van. They have lost first-gear but have finally - to their enormous benefit - they have learned not to miss it.Plus it's pretty hilarious, with great performances from absolutely everybody. And for why Little Miss Sunshine is so much more illuminating, see my explanation at Middle Class Death-Trips (toodumbtolive.blogspot.com)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Beautiful film!,"What little girl hasn't dreamed of becoming a beauty queen one day? This story of young pageant dreamer Olive and her seemingly functionally dysfunctional family is both heartwarming and hilarious. From an old-school VW bug that only shifts into 3rd and 4th gear, a angst teenager's vow of silence, a suicidal homosexual uncle, a cocaine addicted grandfather, a workaholic father and a mother just trying to keep it all together, there is so much character depth and variation. The actors play their parts BEAUTIFULLY and the directing is just amazing to say the least. This is definitely a film well worth seeing again and again.. and maybe a few times more. Little Miss Sunshine is a keeper with a good message and truly lives up to its expectations. Don't let this one pass you up!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awesome acting and terrific chemistry!!!,"This movie deserves every bit of attention and credit that it has got already and more. I watched this movie with a very special person in my life and it holds a very special place in our hearts. We laughed till our bellies ached and just when we thought we couldn't laugh anymore came a scene that just brought tears in our eyes. This movie had a great blend of humor and pathos, the likes of which I haven't seen in a long long time.Everyone acted so naturally that it didn't feel like we were watching a movie. There was awesome chemistry between the actors and Abigail Breslin deserves a special mention. She was one of the most natural actors that I have ever seen and I am sure she will continue to blaze the screen with her skills for many years to come. She has deservedly just been nominated for an Oscar for this film.I urge everyone to watch it. You will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
