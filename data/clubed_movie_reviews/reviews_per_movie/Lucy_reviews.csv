Luc Besson's 'Lucy'.,"I enjoyed this for the most-part. The momentum in combination with the 90 minute runtime, kept myself entertained for the entirety. It's far from perfect, but it's entertaining. Then again I didn't labour over the science to over complicate the overall enjoyment. The climax is probably the most contentious and unfavourable issue, but I appreciate the intent of Luc Besson's vision.Note: It's probably best to ignore the super low-scoring trolls, who create accounts to downvote and spread negativity. If you don't have some constructive criticism, don't say anything at all. Any 'Not helpful' downvotes on this review are probably by the aforementioned.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great Imagination is this film,"Just like a human has been given priority to itself, this film do so, after have watched it feels human is infinite and can do anything and no any other species would be able to do so, this film start with a myth humans use very little part of its brain, and finely depicts what if a human will be able to use 100 percent of his brain, well no doubt this film is a metaphor but really funny and amusing,
Great imagination, I salute directors thought,
Everything is in a great sequence and should watch by everyone it's a great film.One more thing none can imagine it's climax until it happens itself, great climax.Thank you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Scifi Action Thriller that Delivers,"Lucy is a Bourne Identity meets Kill Bill meets Limitless romp auteured by Luc Besson, the man behind classics like Leon the Professional and La Femme Nikita. In one of the stranger wide releases in years, there is much reward given to those willing to give Lucy grace (ridiculous premise and over-the-top aspirations). It's flawed, but it's a brightly filmed and darkly themed scifi action thriller that delivers. Lucy posits the debatable notion that humans only use 10% brain capacity. Johansson plays the title character that goes from monotony to superhero when a new drug gives her the ability to use 100% of her brains power. Her capabilities aren't just big math problems and fast reading, but telekinesis, shape shifting and other comic-booky things. It's a fascinating if overly ambitious premise that Besson puts to great use, playing it out like a briskly paced, inventive TV pilot. The scifi is strong, with theories and declarations posited throughout and thematic exposition that works. The shining element here is Johansson, who continues her upward trajectory in a bombastic yet effective performance. Her progression from a nobody to the most powerful femme fatale in history is emotional, funny and relatively believable. It's great to see Besson bounce back after The Family to present what may be his magnum opus, touching on all of time and creation in under 90 minutes. Sure, some of the effects are cheap and goofy, but the editing is unique and tight, the violence and style are lively, and the storytelling is refreshing. Engaging and cool, Lucy is highly stylized scifi pulp of the highest order.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Open your mind, expand your potential, evolve !.Nail-biting superheroine flick with thrills , chills , plot twists , struggles , high body-count , moving scenes , dazzling production design and latest generation special effects . Based on the character created by Luc Besson himself and heavily influenced by Superheroes Comic Books . This is a dynamic , fast- paced , entertaining and fun movie . It packs a brief message about the extreme dangers of the drugs and science, as our starring gets a tremendous strength thanks to a peculiar drug , she becomes a superhuman , a killing machine , resulting in fateful consequences . But it was really made to appeal to wide range of audiences , so the plot wasn't so complex , but Scarlett Johansson as the prominently featured super-power heroine was absolutely believable , and there was no other actress at the time who could have played the role asides from her . Nohing more fun to watch than to see her running here and there while seeks vengeance going after the man who previously killed her , or at least, who he believes killed . It also helps that it usually has a relatively good storyline to go along with it . This show has one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast . Scarlett Johansson is nice , playing in her usual style as the two-fisted , serious girl brought back to life by an advanced technology that gives him the ability of super human strength , it would spin to transform into a relentless superheroine , armed with a invincible force that can stop any bullet , while regenerating his vital organs. Being well accompanied by other fine actors , such as : Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman , Choi Min-sik of Old Boy , Choi Min-sik , Amr Waked , Julian Rhind-Tutt , Pilou Asbæk , among others.It displays a stinging and rousing musical score by composer Eric Serra . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Thierry Arbogast . The motion picture was professionally directed by Luc Besson , though it has some flaws , gaps and shortfalls . Lavishly produced by Eurocorps (Besson Production Company) and nicely made by Luc Besson with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics . Luc often casts Jean Reno (though here doesn't appear) and music always by Eric Serra . Besson is the greatest producer and director from France with hits as ¨Leon¨ , ¨Joan of Arc¨ , ¨The fifth element¨ , the ¨Taxi¨ series , ¨Big blue¨ , ¨Arthur and the Minimois¨ , ¨Nikita¨ and many others . Rating : Acceptable and passable, 6 . This is a highly amusing and frequently fun action-adventure romp with a witty script, sensational special effects and accceptable performances from main and support cast .",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Starts well, finishes poorly","Disappointing movie towards the end. Starts off well, everything makes sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain point in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not enjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was not. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The situation the main character found herself in had an array of extraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot out of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and not taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in. If you're a fan of logical ""what ifs"" like myself I would not recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than they say!!,"This film was a wild ride. And yes it's not scientifically accurate, but so what?It was an awesome idea that I found well executed.I will say I wanted to see ScarJo kick more ass but I still didn't mind.

Absolutely Brilliant,"It was a moment of utter spontaneity when I decided to purchase a ticket to see 'Lucy', and wow - I am certainly glad I did. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. At the beginning, I thought that perhaps it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. However, as it progressed the storyline became more and more fascinating. In my opinion this film had the perfect balance of realism and sci-fi. Some of the effects were of course slightly questionable... but I cannot really complain because the overall brilliance of this film outshone any negatives I could detect.Scarlett Johansson was incredible as Lucy and it was astonishing to observe how her character changed so dramatically within just a few moments. Johansson definitely nailed the smart-girl/genius/superhero role, although I do think this role may have suited an actress like Rooney Mara absolutely perfectly. Johansson is just so womanly, attractive and feminine that I found it difficult to completely accept her as Lucy. Perhaps that's just me bring too picky - I just feel that Lucy could have been better portrayed by someone slightly more masculine and cold.This film is one that will genuinely inspire you to think deeply about evolution, human nature, and life. I left the cinema feeling like I had been given a new kick of energy and a punch of enthusiasm for personal growth and exploration. This film will also encourage you to consider the endless possibilities of technology and science. It will leave your heart pound if and your brain buzzing. Overall, this is a definite must-see for all action/sci-fi lovers as well as those who have an interest in humanity, history and the incredible gift that is life. You will not at all regret purchasing a ticket to see this, and as long as you keep an open mind, you will find this film to be extremely thought-provoking and clever.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What Is The Limit Of Your Imagination?,"In my view this is the best film Besson has directed since 1997's The Fifth Element, or perhaps even since his best film, 1994's Léon: The Professional. The film in certain ways is a lot like Limitless, but at the same time it takes a very different overall approach and look on the subject of human evolution. I'm sure that many people will not care much for this film since it is filled with a lot of mystical/spiritual references and ideas and even some false science, however those with an open mind and an active imagination will likely be very glad they saw the film. This is clearly a work of fiction people, but there is no one saying you can't relate fiction to reality either, and actually learn something from it once in a while too. Our limitless imaginations are part of what makes human beings so extraordinary, we are best off using this gift and appreciating it. Fictional films can still be very thought provoking, and this one definitely fits that category. 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't scientifically accurate in many ways to our current knowledge, but it's still a monster landmark of a film nonetheless. Lucy is certainly not 2001, however they both ride that same imagination rules line that can spark the internal fires of unique creative thinking. In my view Lucy is a sci-fi trip worth taking.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transcending Limitations,"""Lucy,"" a high-concept sci-fi thriller from visionary French director Luc Besson, is a stimulating exploration of the human mind's potential. With its combination of slick action sequences, existential philosophizing, and dazzling visuals, it challenges and entertains in equal measure, pushing the boundaries of conventional cinema.The plot follows Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), a woman accidentally caught in a dark deal who turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. Besson has crafted a fascinating narrative that juxtaposes the gritty realism of crime syndicates with the abstract realm of cerebral possibilities.Scarlett Johansson delivers a powerhouse performance, expertly navigating her character's transformation from a terrified victim to a superhuman entity. Her nuanced portrayal ensures Lucy remains empathetic even as she becomes increasingly detached from humanity.Morgan Freeman lends gravitas as Professor Norman, a neuroscientist who serves as the narrative's anchor, grounding the escalating spectacle in a semblance of reality. His measured performance provides a necessary counterpoint to Johansson's increasingly otherworldly character.Besson's direction is fluid and kinetic, imbuing the film with a frenetic energy that propels the narrative forward even as it dips into complex concepts. His choice to intercut documentary-style nature footage adds a unique flavor, creating intriguing parallels with the story unfolding on screen.The cinematography and visual effects are dazzling, creating a vivid sensory experience that takes viewers on a roller coaster ride through time, space, and the human body. The mind-bending visual journey, coupled with Eric Serra's pulsating score, creates an intoxicating atmosphere that leaves viewers both thrilled and thoughtful.However, ""Lucy"" isn't without its flaws. Its ambitious premise often teeters on the edge of becoming too esoteric, possibly alienating viewers expecting a more straightforward action thriller. Furthermore, its fast pace and lean runtime can leave certain aspects feeling underdeveloped, notably the film's antagonists.Yet, despite these shortcomings, ""Lucy"" stands out as an audacious cinematic experience that dares to merge high-octane action with cerebral science fiction. It inspires a sense of awe and curiosity about human potential, prompting introspection about our place in the universe. It is a visual feast that stirs the mind and quickens the pulse, a cinematic cocktail of action and philosophy that leaves a lingering impression.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Intresting and unique..mostly,"I liked this one especially the first 3/4 of it, the end goes a bit silly. Its a cool movie, very Luc Besson identifiable, his style. Great action sequences, interesting locations China, France- I always like to see movies not specifically in America.Very interesting and unique story idea -that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. Scarlett Johansson is amazing here, impressive, when she first gets kidnapped so scared then as the drug leaks into her system so badass.Morgan freeman -much as I adore him often does these sort of cameos in movies these days and not much acting. He is good here as the sympathetic scientist... Just thinking he was also in that movie with Johnny Depp, Transcendence very similar story, he does more here.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is a complete myth! The fun part is: What if it was true?,"This film has greatly polarized critics for its use of controversial concepts. I am a scientist and of course this movie gives me mixed feelings about its science. But I'm sure about one thing, that this is fiction. I am able to watch a fiction movie, am I not?Some people review this film negatively for its scientific value, ignoring the fact that this isn't a documentary. What are these guys comparing this film against? There is no comparison against real-world science here. If somebody makes a film about black holes, I expect it to be faithful to the latest research about black holes. If somebody makes a film about the Sun, I expect it to be faithful to what we know about the Sun. In contrast, a film about aliens can stretch our suspension of disbelief a lot more, because we know no real aliens to compare it about. And my my, how wide a range of alien species has been spawned by the film industry in all its years! The main concept in this film is equally flexible because it has been proved a myth years ago. Everybody knows that, director/writer Besson knows that. These negative reviewers miss the entertainment value of this film because of something they were expecting (harmony to actual science) that was never there since the film's inception.So yes, some other people review this film for its entertainment value, because we want to enjoy this ""What if this myth was true"" scenario. And we are truly entertained. I loved how Scarlett Johansson developed her character very well even when there was inherently not much to begin with: an innocent girl with not further background than dating some guy for a week and living in a shared apartment. Scarlett's charisma, weakness, strength, and acting spill all over the place, even during the most flat scenes of the film, even during the most VFX-packed scenes of the film. Morgan Freeman is... well, Morgan Freeman. Fantastic actor except for the fact that he's been typecast into the wise guy role for like, 20 years. I like the ethnic diversity in such a small cast. Not that they are trying to showcase it anyway, but it's a nice touch.The action pack is very good, the mafia pack is entertaining, and the renditions of Inception, Léon: The Professional, and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all cherished. Once again, the central myth is developed in a very fun way. I believe this film has risked a lot in its development, but for us who want to be entertained and have our imaginations opened, this film delivers very vividly.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Hard to swallow, even for the spiritually open-minded","People say we use only 10% of our brains. The scientific community is 100% sure this is false. Call me a killjoy, but I find it hard to accept movies that are based on an utterly anti-scientific premise. In fact, I find promoting blatant falsehoods that promote anti-evolutionary thinking a bit irresponsible, even for the sake of art and entertainment!Science education set aside, how does LUCY work as a movie? Well, Scarlett Johansson is convincingly awkward and beautiful. Luc Besson's obsession with strong mysterious female leads clearly shines through and Johansson as an actor delivers. The movie is hyper-stylish, with gleaming colors and convincing CGI (lots of). The action is as entertaining as the visuals. And thankfully they decided to keep things short, focus on the core idea and stop right before it became trite.That said, I think LIMITLESS dealt with the 10% myth better as it stayed (somewhat) more within the realm of scientific credibility. And as far as movies go in which people develop godlike powers, LUCY doesn't beat the likes of THE MATRIX or SYMBOL (shimboru,2009).All in all an interesting but ultimately mediocre movie based on an utterly ridiculous (and intellectually dangerous) idea.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

If you're prepared to suspend disbelief (a lot of it) this is a great action/sci-fi movie,"I went into watching this thinking ""6.6; average but good enough for a night in"" considering 22 jump street (which I stopped after the _painful_ first half hour) gets a 7.6 it makes me wonder about what the people rating movies on this site prefer.This film is quick, intelligent and has a number of good actors in it; if you watch it to the end you'll appreciate it, because (in my mind) it does everything right. After this paragraph we'll probably be moving into (mild) spoiler territory, so if you've not watched it yet, or just don't give a flying uh.... seagull? (good job on your censorship IMDb, words are just words and they have their place); stop reading.The whole 10% premise is false, I'll give it that along with the 'fact' that you somehow develop supernatural powers at higher than 10%; it's almost like someone saw the matrix, a supernatural film, an action film and thought ""why not compress all of this into one film"" as I've said in the title, if you're prepared to suspend disbelief, it works. If you want pure scifi with no (major) suspension of disbelief; it's best to look elsewhere. Though as I've said, the movie has all the things I like. Unwitting protagonist, pressure of time put on said protagonist, some scifi in between and the mind control powers of Morgan Freeman's voice (seriously, they should get some real scientists on that; it would accelerate brainwashing research tenfold).From reading other reviews this film seems to be movie Marmite; you'll either love it or hate it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
100% percent entertaining,"Here's another real odd ball that I watched this past week. It stars Scarlett Johansen and that is of course all I needed to wanna watch this movie. Lucy is about this women who is kidnapped by this group of thugs and then gets a powerful drug put inside her that unlocks the full 100% of her brain and now she's super smart and seems to have the powers of Jedi.This movie is just really weird and not quite what I was expecting. This is of course an action film. It's got all clichés that were use to. Then becomes a super hero movie and then a beautiful visual ride. It's really confusing a bit at times and it gets worse in the end. The issue I have with Lucy is that she's the only super powered person in this film and there's no one in this that ever becomes powerful enough to give a really cool final final fight in the end, but a weird and visual like dream of a world kinda ending. It's not great and I highly doubt someone would become super hero or a jedi if we used 100% percent of our brain.

No it is not a thriller...,"... it is a love story.

You would have to go back to ALTERED STATES (1980) to watch Ken Russell fall in love with himself (just the way Besson does in this film) to find an analogue.Once you get past the first 45 minutes (a sad comment, given the film only runs 90 minutes), past the pompous and overblown backstory and still montage, the film more or less holds together as B level entertainment.Not exactly high praise.

More Than Human,"Scarlett Johannson, a partying student in Hong Kong, gets roped into delivering a briefcase to drug lord Choi Min-sik. She's made into a drug mule, with the stuff in plastic bags within her, but it gets broken and what looks like a kilogram enters her body. The new designer drug turns out to have the effect of opening up the connections between cells, so that she gains greater use of her mind. As she heads to Europe, seeking the other mules for what they carry, while trying to fend off Choi and his gang, she seeks out exposition machine Morgan Freeman, and cop Amr Waked for physical connection.It's not the first time that science fiction has tackled new steps in evolution, from Olaf Stapledon's ODD JOHN, to A. E. Van Vogt's SLAN, to Theodore Sturgeon's MORE THAN HUMAN. Writer-director Luc Besson brings his METAL HURLANT sensibilities to the effort, and Miss Johannson gives a great performance as she goes from a hung-over airhead to an omniscient goddess in a a little black dress and Balenciagas.It's the visuals, more than the bafflegab explanations, that makes this movie so compelling, with its weird CGI, time-traveling backwards from modern New York to T. Rex time, and big, black, self-building computers against a white background while Freeman and associates stand around slack-jawed, and Freeman explains exactly what's going on.

Something to Think About!,"I went to see LUCY not really knowing what to expect. Honestly, I did not read one review prior to seeing the movie. However, someone that I highly respect was speaking about the mind and all it's magnificence when he refereed to the movie.While I am aware that some things may have been a bit non-factual, I really left LUCY thinking about how the mind can function beyond our wildest imagination.Watching a family member rehabilitate from a head injury due to a hit and run car accident, I witnessed each level of healing process. At each phase there was a different action from extreme agitation and constant movement to periods of calm. The doctors explained it was the mind repairing itself. Thumbs up to Scarlett Johansson for a great job.Even though Lucy had different twist and turns that you may not necessarily associate with the message of the movie, I enjoyed that I can take something from a movie that made me think beyond the entertainment aspect.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.","Lucy is one of those films that brings about furious reactions, it is after all a science fiction type action thriller. They always divide film fans right from the off. It's a film that to all intents and purposes needs to be viewed just as a cinematic experience, as a piece of popcorn fodder that may try to be something more cerebral, but ultimately is a daft - but hugely fun - piece of film.Luc Besson writes and directs a film that sees Scarlett Johansson duped into being a drug mule, with the transportation of drugs sewn into her abdomen. It's a new drug, boy is it a new drug, and when things go belly up and the drugs are unleashed into Scarlett's system, she's a threat - or hope - to mankind.It can be, and has been, called pretentious et al, such is the science factor, which is perfectly understandable, so any hope of tight science fiction musings will only end up in a crushing disappointment. Undeniably Besson and his backers thought they had something to say, to open up the film watchers' minds to something deep and probable, to be relevant and viable. But unlike the makers we the viewers didn't have access to donepezil, so we sadly couldn't all turn into Bradley Cooper and be limitless in our viewing capabilities.Personally, it's a rollicking fun film for two thirds, when it's about Scarlett kicking butt, a revenge driven babe, it grips and shakes all the genre compliant cinematic senses. The ending, the grand finale, infuriated me, and by the looks of Morgan Freeman (coasting for easy money), he was also a little frustrated. But I had fun, yet on the flip side if anyone fronted me up and said they hated the film with a passion? Then I would understand and take them home to play with my chemistry set. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Weak storyline, not sci-fi","Calling this a sci-fi is a stretch. The story line is artificially cooked up to suit the action, effects are so-so (for this day and age) . Its more of a mindless action movie.The brawn and violence is made to shock, rather than entertain. But after a few scenes it gets quickly repetitive and boring. They tried to interject some scientific narrative in between with an academic backdrop as if that will lend it some credence, but it falls awfully short. Some of the effects are so wild and unexplained they might belong in a Hulk movie. Johannsen's performance is mediocre, she could easily have been replaced by any average actress. She has one part where she talks to her mom and some emoting is needed, but like the rest of the movie it just comes across as plainly artificial.

Of course, it's completely unrealistically, but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does that. Its just, well, cool.

Dear Christ,"I thought the commercials on TV for this made it look pretty good. When the reviews came in, I sort of lowered my expectations. Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. From the beginning, it seems like the director is intent on overwhelming us with transitions and cuts from the present to all of these ""evolution"" shots that, instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feel incredibly stupid. And I'm not one to throw the word ""stupid"" around, but... I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I don't care how scientifically accurate this is, no. I just care that the dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far in between. The car chase is an example, like if it was a scene taken from another actually-decent action flick. I will say that the second half is at least a bit better than the first.Scarlett Johansson has been on a roll lately, and I'm a fan of her. But the reason it took me so long to warm up to her is because while I generally like her very much in her more subdued, quiet or more natural roles (Lost in Translation, Under the Skin) she has the tendency to just not be as convincing in more melodramatic, showier roles. Oh yes, she's pretty bad once her character here gets her powers, totally unconvincing at playing the emotionless aspect. She's supposed to play Lucy as if she has no emotions, but instead it comes across as her trying desperately to convince us that she has no emotions. But before Lucy gets her powers, she's also pretty bad, totally unconvincing and probably more laughably bad when she's trying to play a woman with fear for her life. What a misfire of a performance, although the girl tries hard enough and isn't nearly as obnoxious and as downright ugly as the film around her.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A proper action-sci-fi romp,"Better mention straight away that I'm a hardened sci-fi buff and often critical of films in the genre.As opposed to some of the sci-fi block busters the latter years, this one makes no pretense to, uhm, be pretentious. Neither is it filled with the now popular faux soulful ""scientists"" that more often than not come off as soppy morons. This is a wild ride for the senses of wonder. Like some fun loving reviewers note, it's not at all trying to be scientifically correct - it's heavy on the fiction and demands of the viewer that you let go, sit back and enjoy the ride.I'll quote fellow reviewer thuffman-219-557602 who said it in simple and clear terms:""Bad-*** car chase, science-fiction, sex appeal my goodness, Morgan 'the man' Freeman, Chow Yun-Fat worthy shootout, visuals that will blow your-effing-mind, and it didn't even take 2 sequels and a prequel to do it.""I reckon it's natural that this is by the creator of Leon - don't actually expect another Leon though, this is Luc Besson doing something different. Neither should you expect deep character development or carefully pondering concepts in this express train of a movie.In summary, the action is good and unrelenting, the sci is perhaps more fantasy than science, but still entertaining if you let it be, and the fi ranges from gritty to moments of almost Olaf Stapledon wondrous.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not a Documentary!!!!,"Check the genre of this movie, it says SCI-FI, which stands for science FICTION!! If I watched every sci-fi movie expecting it to correlate with real life physics then there would be no point of the genre. All these bad reviewers seem to be on the more intelligent end of the pole but isn't cognitive enough to realize they're NOT watching a documentary!!!! This is a good sci-fi movie, which kind of lets you imagine what you could do if you knew everything and could do anything. Obviously It's not possible because you would have to break the laws of physics to even get near that point but it's still good to wonder. Worth a watch if you like the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mix of science and fiction?,"I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

Lively sci-fi thriller,"Luc Besson typically mashes up pseudo-science and action in this wildly lively sci-fi thriller and ignores any narrative pot-holes and logic along the way; however, Scarlett Johansson is charming in th title role and ensures that the movie is quite entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Maybe the best movie I've ever seen,"Honestly, I can't understand why this movie only got 6.x/10. Maybe the German dubbing was extraordinarily well done? Like, better than the original? I don't know. It's not even that I'm a Luc-Besson-Fanboy or something - I found ""The Fifth Element"" pretty annoying, although Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors. So why did I like ""Lucy"" so much? First off, the movie starts and is right away enthralling. Scarlett Johansson plays a rather shy girl on vacation or whatever in Taiwan, who is forced by her acquaintance-of-last-night to transfer a mysterious briefcase to a scary gangster boss, incarnated terrifyingly convincing by Min-sik Choi. It turns out the briefcase is full of drugs, a bag of these drugs is planted into her stomach, leaks, the overdose gives her full-access to her brain capacity, REVENGE! All in the first 30 minutes, as I remember. What sounds like an ""ordinary"" action movie story line is fed with (I admit, pseudo-)scientifical information by Morgan Freeman and behavior-study like scenes of animals interacting, and after a short while, it's anything but an ordinary action movie. The more Lucy can control her brain, the more transcendental her abilities become, the more she is in control of her environment, mentally and physically. In ""Lucy"", Director Besson deals with the most urgent questions of humanity, with the existence of something transcendental, 'where do we come from?', 'what defines our lifes?', 'where do we go'? After this altogether, I left the cinema stunned and contemplative. Yes, the movie might have some goofs and flaws, but in the end, the message is unbeatable.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lucy and the brain potential,"The man behind ""Leon"" (1994), Scarlett Johansson in kick-ass mode... Who wouldn't want to watch this film? But as usual, nothing is what it seems, and the question is: is that a bad thing or a good thing? It depends, whether you expect just another sci-fi action packed movie or, knowing old Besson, something else. In the same fashion that ""The Fifth Element"" (1997), ""Lucy"" is not so genre-tight, but it tends to expand, an inside out explosion. Some might like it or not, but the truth is that Luc Besson is a great filmmaker, and it seems he can make a very good movie anytime he wants to. Lucy (Johansson) is a tourist that finds herself in the middle of a drug dealing business and ends up being a mule. To make things even worse, the package she carries bursts inside her, and the consequences are as unexpected as they are cool. In just one day her brain capacity will reach its full potential, unfolding every secret the brain still hides from mankind. Scarlett Johansson (oh Scarlett...) is Lucy, and she turns from bimbo to super-heroine in half an hour, something Scarlett does easily, as well as showing us how with higher brain capacity comes some ""changes"". It is in those moments that she makes her best, though I am not objective here. What she did in ""Her"" (Spike Jonze, 2013) was outstanding, and I am a crazy fan, I must confess. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman are just spectators, and we all just sit and enjoy the Scarlett show. ""Lucy"" is sci-fi, yet it states that we only have access to 10% of our brain capacity, which has been debunked by several scientific studies. That would be unacceptable in most cases, but in this case it is not a big deal, since this film is not hard sci-fi; it is not a superpowers film nor a brain research film, but rather a film about our very existence and evolution. Quoting Pearl Jam: ""I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher (...) It's evolution, baby"" (""Do the Evolution"" from the album ""Yield"", 1998, epic records).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A really good descent sci-fi action flick from Luc Besson!,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few action sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lucy (2014) is written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla. Just like The Fifth Element this movie is very similar to that movie, just it has a different story and different cast of actors in it. At least unlike Taken 3 This film is well shot and bloody. I adore Scarlett and she is an absolute delight to see in this. I just finished watching Lucy today and I like it. It was really good descent sci-fi action flick. In the beginning when Lucy talks to his friend Richard I thought the movie would be boring but it wasn't it was a hell off a ride. It went pretty fast and end well. I watched Scarlet Johansson in Captain America The Winter Soldier which in my opinion is the best action super hero movie for me. And in Lucy Scarlett Johansson did not disappoint me. Also Morgan Freeman was also really good.I enjoyed it ,it was fun and It is pure fantasy. Scarlett Johansson & Morgan Freeman carry this film, no doubt about it. But there is a story here ,what if we used 100% of our brain?? What would that be like , what would we be like?? Well for one thing ,things wouldn't be important, wars wouldn't be fought, racism would not be anything or wouldn't have started in the first place . You could think what you want on all of this, at least the film makes you wonder and that I find is fun. Lucy was like Inception and limitless combined with its intriguing premise and a film where u have to think more than a lot of other mindless films. every movie needs some sex appeal to make it realistic, film is the art of re enacting life....to some degree....I thought she was kick ass until her body dissolved. fortunately that was at the end of the movie. the small amount of sex appeal that she is given with this role is forgivable because her mind is transforming and everything is new, but I felt betrayed when she lost her ability to be relatable.I watch this movie twice it was fast paced and Entertaining action sci-fi flick! I really like Scarlett Johansson I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron especially on Scarlett's acting skills and her behavior during that awful movie. I think in 2014 were still some good movies that I like: I love Captain America: The Winter Soldier which Scarlett Johansson surprised the hell out of me on her performance as Black Widow including Chris Even as Steve Rogers and everyone should know that I love this movie to death. I like Lucy and I think of Luc Besson there are three movies that I like: Léon: The Professional (1994), The Fifth Element (1997) which everyone know I am crazy about that Sci-Fi action movie and this one Lucy (2014). I know the director made a lot of movies including La Femme Nikita (1990) but for some reason I never liked that movie, I don't know why, I just didn't. Or the series which Peta Wilson started it and later in new the series Maggie Q as Nikita. I just don't like those types of bloody movie and series. Those three movies I just counted are really good movies and I love them so much.Lucy is one of those high-octane films from writer/director Luc Besson that gives the audience a fun entertaining action extravaganza set piece but with a plot that is so far out there that its not so fun and entertaining to relate to, unless of course you happen to be tripping' along with the films characters. Scarlet Johannson, no stranger to the action genre brings her A game and Morgan Freeman's authority shines through but Lucy is as wacky as they come. Human mules may be a dose in reality but one where the in-jested drug makes you become one with just about everything is a little bit bizarre. Either way this one will either thrill you or beg you for a much better 90 minute high.The only thing that confused me so much of this movie is the ending which I don't get what happened with Lucy on the end of the movie. The end ended with a cliffhanger by the end if you ask me. I like that Luc Beeson tried to do something different than a straight revenge action movie - It was interesting and it kept my attention - I really liked the scene in the hospital when she was talking to her mother:)!!!! It was fairly decent overall. Wish it were a bit longer though because it seemed quite short. I am giving this movie a 10 because of Luc Besson, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman as a science professor he did an outstanding perfect acting performance, he is awesome as always!!!Lucy is a 2014 English-language French science fiction action film written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla for his company Europacorp.10/10 Grade: A Studio: Universal Pictures, EuropaCorp Starring: Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked, Choi Min-sik Director: Luc Besson Producer: Virginie Besson-Silla Screenplay: Luc Besson Luc Besson Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 29 Mins.

6/10,"An intriguing first act, a great lead, amazing sequences yet a very mediocre execution leave this film just at average level. There are sparks of Luc Besson's talent, but unfortunately on the widescpe they are overshadowed by the lazy development of the story.The film anyways has lots going for it. It succeeds in delivering some of this potential, but fails in delivering the major part of it. Undoubtely the part where it succeeds the most is the first act. It never gave out too much information, but by giving away just the essential it managed to produce a very intense interest in how the story would go. It was also filled with very stylish and kind of strange sequences mixed to it, that I didn't quite understand, yet didn't really mind. Scarlett Johansson is another highlight, she really carried everything along and I didn't realize until later in the movie how much merit she deserved for not making this movie a bore. Her mix of charisma and good skills was key in bringing some spice to an otherwise flat and flawed story. Still on positives, there is a sequence near the end of the movie that was pure brilliance, the CGI involved was flawless and it took me on a short psychedelic journey that I absolutely enjoyed to the bone.Unfortunately that sequence alone is the only spark of visual brilliance that is present in the movie. For the rest there is nothing wrong with the cinematography, but it looks just so average, there isn't one single interesting shot, it all looks as if it was shot by a computer. again nothing wrong because it certainly didn't get me to annoyance, but I was constantly bothered by this flat look. Anyways the biggest flaw this movie has is in storytelling. Firstly, because as much as I found interesting the first act the second and the third just fell into generic action movie territory. Secondly because the logics of the movie are totally bonkers and make no sense what so ever. They manage to produce good filmaking occasions, but their roots are totally out of place.Lucy fails in being what it wants to be, but it succeeds in giving the viewer 90 minutes at the theater that won't bore him and will flow pretty smoothly.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not any single minute is boring,"One of those movies which i watch several times. It is based on facts about % that mankind can use his brain.

Unexpectedly thrilling,"Entering the latest Luc Besson offering, I was cynical, but to my own surprise, the film won me over! Yes, there are logic gaps, a cliché use of Morgan Freeman and perhaps an over-simplification of the idea, but 'Lucy' drives home with visual invention, a notable, pumping score by Eric Serra and sharp, fast paced editing; the effect frequently being that we feel, like our typically tough female lead, as though we are on some mad drug ourselves. Drawing on some of his own best previous work, Besson puts together a film with a feeling, at times, not unlike a solid Manga adaption, ala 'The Edge Of Tomorrow'. Also, a fun little aside that is most welcome, now I think about it, is a not-so-subtle tip of the hat to Korean classic 'Oldboy', with Min-sik Choi himself playing the villain Mr Jang with relish!It is easy to ignore the obvious liberties taken with the science, because the film is quite clearly not trying to be seen as accurate; you can also overlook the lack of character development, or indeed any real narrative meat, because once again, Besson knows exactly what he is looking to make here. Much like its own thesis on how human beings interpret the universe, 'Lucy' is a big idea scaled down. It is not as original or fresh as one might have hoped, and it does have its stumbles, but once you're over the hurdles, it proves to be a more-exciting-than-expected, well-built, high-octane thrill ride, which is most worthy of ninety minutes of your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A ton of thinking. Bind-blowing thinking.,"Lucy review: -Lucy is a film about Scarlett Johansson, a girl who finds herself caught in a sticky situation with a high class mob, in which she wakes up with a bag of drugs in her stomach and has to transport them. However, when she accidentally absorbs a massive amount of the drug, she is given the ability to use more than 10% or her brain. A struggle for answers and her own humanity ensues as she begins to use more and more of her brain. It's a little like Trancendence and Limitless.-The film as a whole was very interesting. I did not find much I didn't like about it, but at the same time there was nothing I really loved in it.-The plot/story/concept was easily the most interesting part as she discovers more and more and makes the audience think more and more about life and everything. There are even some very thought provoking creation vs evolution sub-stories that left me very surprised, I think.-The cast did well. Nobody was really great but nobody was bad. Morgan Freeman has also totally mastered the 'shocked beyond belief' face.-The music was odd, but good.-The effects were very good.-The content was not too bad. The film is actually rated-R, but could have been PG-13. Some language and violence, but that's about it.-The thing that is really most intriguing for me is how the film progresses as the can use more and more of her brain. There are a few things they kept around for the sake of the film which felt add-on, like a cop helping her out. Even he admits he is useless, but she tells him that he is to remind her of what it is like to be human. As the film goes on it becomes very difficult to relate to Lucy as a character, which makes sense, but is also a drawback. However, it will make you think. A lot. Like way too much. Yeah it is ""mind-blowing"" to the almost literal sense. Like the universe and stuff. Okay I'm done thinking about it.-So if you are looking for an average action flick without any depth and too much thinking attached, you might find Lucky a bit disappointing. But if you are looking for a movie what contemplates life and the universe and God and brain power and a bunch of other things that will go totally over everyone's head because they are incomprehensible, it is pretty good. So I would give Lucy a high 7 and say that Lucy is probably worth seeing in theaters, if you want to think that much.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Setup But Gets Bogged Down and Generally Uninteresting,"I agree with a couple of previous reviewers. To maintain real interest, we really need some conflict. I don't mean a bunch of Korean guys chasing after you. It has to be a problem the protagonist has to solve or at least deal with. Lucy unfortunately helps a friend and ends up in really deep stuff. She is used as a drug mule for a crazy drug that can up human intelligence. She was never intended to use but a guy assault her and breaks the bag inside her. She immediately begins to divide cells and transform into a new creature. The second criticism is a lack of explanation as to why she loses all compassion and empathy. She does have the revenge thing going but she is almost zombie like in her interactions with others. Is the point that we are just animals with reproductive and survival instincts? Other than teaching his classes and giving us a reference point, Morgan Freeman is of no use. He just stands around saying he doesn't know anything. Lucy eventually takes us on a ride through time but why. Is she just absorbing information. If so, what is she going to do with it. The long and short is that it is disjointed and relatively pointless.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It has an intriguing concept but isn't perfect.,I personally found this movie to be quite fascinating. It was nothing like I was expecting but it certainly was interesting.

That didn't really bother me as it seemed to work but the transition could have been smoother.It was quite an emotionless film led by Scarlett Johansson but I did enjoy Morgan Freeman's role...as always. I liked the movie but I can see how others didn't. I'm sure there are many scientific inaccuracies but that's the point. It's a movie you can only imagine in your wildest dreams.

"""Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist.""","Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) gets mixed up with a group of ruthless drug smugglers. Still trying to process what's actually going on, she wakes to discover the smugglers have sewn a packet of a new drug into her stomach. Before she can deliver the drugs, however, the packet busts open, releasing the powerful drug into her system. The drug's effect is an ever increasing utilization of her brain. Soon, Lucy is capable of manipulating matter and energy with her mind. She contacts a renowned scientist for assistance. She realizes that the drug will kill her within 24 hours and she wants to pass on the knowledge she's gained. But the smugglers are intent on getting their drugs back. They follow Lucy half way round the world for a final showdown.Overall, Lucy is a fantastically entertaining film. The action is nice with plenty of fights, gun battles, and car chases. The direction from Luc Besson couldn't be much better. He keeps things moving at a very lively pace. The acting is also superb. Scarlett Johansson proves once again that a woman can be successful as the lead in an action oriented film. And Johansson does an excellent job portraying the changes to Lucy as the drug changes her brain. Nicely done. The supporting cast is also solid. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Amr Waked as the bewildered French policeman who helps Lucy in her journey. Another highlight for me has to be the special effects. Just amazing. Finally, even though things do get a bit messy and even rushed toward the end (this is my biggest complaint), I still had fun with it. The time travel bits were especially moving.I really like and appreciate the message I got out of Lucy. Being a father of two boys and getting older each day, I too sometimes feel that the only real commodity of any value that I have is time. Time to spend with my wife and kids, time to do things I enjoy, time to live my life - that's what's important. It's not material objects or anything else. It's the limited time we each have on this Earth.Finally, if you read comments on Lucy, you'll sooner rather than later run into criticism of the scientific errors made by the film. People love to point them out. I honestly didn't have any problem with the film's scientific realism. It's a movie - I wasn't expecting a science lesson. I accepted the scientific mumbo-jumbo just as I would in any sci-fi film. In the reality in which the films is set, it all makes sense. In our reality, it doesn't. I went with it and didn't let it affect my overall entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Maybe this would have worked as a music video.,"I watched this movie because a blogger I respected (and subsequently lost all respect for) gave it a glowing review. Said if you ignore all the Morgan Freeman parts you're left with a great movie.You are not. You're not even left with an okay movie.The dialogue was painful. The BS they had Mr. Freeman spouting was excruciating, but I came prepared for that. It was discovering that the rest of the dialogue wasn't much better.Some other reviews talked about it being worth it to watch Scarlett Johansson kick ass, but the actual physical kicking parts were very short lived. I can think of few things more dull than an all powerful protagonist.I understand why the director opted for a tactic of escalating blandness for the Lucy character. It makes sense for what they were going for, but that leaves us with a woefully uninteresting protagonist.There was a fair bit of splicing nature scenes with the main stary. The type of thing you'd see in a rom/com like Bridget Jones Diary, or some hip TV show about 30-somethings dating in the big city. I'm not sure what the film makers were going for.I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Writer Luc Besson, famous for Taken and Leon turns Scarlet Johansson into Sarah Connor","Lucy is a sci-fi, action movie written and directed by Luc Besson. The movie feels like it's split in two with the first half starting out fairly plausible and by the end of the movie grows into heavy CGI and sci-fi.Luc Besson is famous for Taken, Leon, The Fifth Element and The Transporter. He is a very good writer. This film leans more towards The Fifth Element in its levels of sci-fi and plausibility but I personally believe Leon and Taken are his masterpieces.The acting in the movie is good for an action movie, never likely to receive Oscar nods. I thought Min-Sik Choi was very good as the dictator boss and Morgan Freeman was his usual composed and impressive self as The Professor. Scarlet Johansson had some memorable scenes in the movie and she pulled off the change in her character superbly.The way the film shows the origins of humanity and the development of time, particularly in the end sequence is very impressive and well done.I was a little disappointed with the Soundtrack. I thought this movie could have done with something similar to the Drive Soundtrack or Tron...or even Terminator. Such distinguishable OST's from the action/sci-fi genre. But other than a few main scenes in the movie it lacked memorable backing.This movie is very similar to The Terminator and has elements of The Matrix. In fact, during many scenes in the movie I thought that Scarlet Johansson reminded me of and would have made a great Sarah Connor when it was remade.Overall, I would recommend this movie. It's an entertaining watch from a very creative writer and the plot is very interesting. 7/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
loved it,"I give it a solid 7. Don't expect to see this title on the academy award list. That said, and I admit to being an avid sci-fy fan, i totally enjoyed it. Fast moving from the very beginning, it hooks you rather quickly and doesn't let up. The story is about a woman forced to traffic an experimental drug in her body. Without giving anything away, the bag breaks and allows Lucy to use a steadily increasing amount of her brain. That's all i will say as you really need to see this without any preconceived opinions. The acting was excellent. What can you say about Morgan Freeman that isn't redundant? What surprised me was Ms Johansson. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance as I am not one of her biggest fans. The supporting cast was solid as well. Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Significant,"Seldom post on here. There exist only five movies I can watch over and over again, North by North West, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Big Lebowski, Dazed and Confused and this. Lucy is ultimately the movie that Limitless, with it's all star cast wanted to be, but alas fell short.
Poignant and incredibly clever, a disturbingly accurate reflection of a twenty-first century existence. Call it what you like, Sci-fi, drama, fantasy; bottom line it's art and quite philosophical.
I don't like much but I loved this, Scarlett Johansson as an actor in my humble opinion is as good as it gets. She nails this role.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I must say that was ""over the top""","Human can only use 10% of the brains, but what if they use more? This sci-fi work asks this question.Throw in The fifth element(1995), add in a guy from a Transporter as a main lead, only this time he is playing a woman, with special superpowers actually a Mix between Neo, from Matrix and Nikita, add the late 90s latest street babble about some new drugs who can seriously affect the brains (in a strange way of course) and a Morgan Freeman as a Serious scientist who is working on some Serious scientific project about ""this stupid humans"", who are only limited around the percent of brains they could use simultaneously and tad of some korean guys as a main bad guys and you will probably get what this movie is about.The whole story is really so silly and I also believe it was a Luc Besson take on action heroes movies.

Extremely well done,"We watched LUCY about on DVD February this year. I usually don't like the typical shoot- them-up or speculative-futuristic or robotic movies, they turn me off because they are predictable and way over the deep-end of ridiculousness in their violence, special effects, contradictions and same-old-same-old tin spaceships, weaponry galore, and silly story; like the script and story were just thrown together for the sake of selling something at the box office or TV. LUCY, is excellent, credible beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting, good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY.

Average entertainment,"It is (science) fiction. People who complain about the 10% myth probably complain about how impossible it is for Godzilla to breathe fire.

What kept me watching was the desire to find out what happens when Lucy reaches 100%. The film doesn't have any replay value, but it wasn't a total waste of time.

Lucy (2014),"Lucy is a fascinating action and sci-fi movie by Luc Besson featuring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. They play the role of Lucy and the french professor Norman.It is about a 25 years old girl, called Lucy, who gets caught by the Korean mafia for smuggling experimental drugs into Europe. By accident, she'll take the drug.The plot is based on the effects of this drug on Lucy and, on the other hand, on the thesis of the professor Norman who says that the human only uses 10% of its mental capacities. They'll both make discoveries about humans because the experimental drug increases the mental capacities of Lucy and she'll be able to use 100% of her capacities.I didn't intend to see this film at all but as everyone spoke about it, I decided to watch it. And, actually I did well.I absolutely loved this film despite the fact that there are to many special effects at the end, in my opinion. Even if it's quite unrealistic, the story is shown in a such original and attractive way that we can't not be interested in it.The storyline is very gripping. The way the drug increases the capacities of Lucy is amazing. I especially enjoyed the comparison between the thesis of the professor and the reality of Lucy.As far I'm concerned, I'm totally keen on the main actors ; Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. I've never been disappointed by their acting and I found them once more amazing in this film.I would strongly recommend the film to anyone who loves action films and who wants to experience something new because the way the film-makers have done it is incredibly original.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thrills! But Not PerFect But Close To Be A Blockbuster,"Not better than ""Limitless"" but have little bit uniqueness. Story is Good but lacks in screenplay.

Morgan Freeman is not Used very well. Scarlett Johanson has done nice work. I don't wanna ruin your suspense so I am not going to say anything about story. vfx are really of top class, like a 2014 time movie should have. Direction Should have not been in writer's hands otherwise this movie can be wild thriller instead of good thriller. but so many things to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Take on a Familiar Theme,"That is, a familiar theme for the director, Luc Besson. Lucy, the protagonist, is very much a cross between Nikita and Leeloo the Fifth Element, with a touch of the anime 'Akira' and Chayefsky's 'Altered States' thrown into the mix. There were some great moments in this movie, but, on the whole, I have to say it wasn't as dark and intense as 'La Femme Nikita', or as entertaining as 'The Fifth Element'.Don't get me wrong: Johansson gives an excellent performance, as an initially carefree student who through a very nasty set of circumstances is trapped into serving a drug kingpin as a mule, carrying a surgically implanted packet of a new drug with some ... shall we say ... remarkable properties.When she resists a rape attempt by one of his goons, this suicidally stupid henchman kicks her in the stomach several times, rupturing the packet. Since unless they just hired him that day, you'd think this flunky should have some inkling of what his sadistic, cold-blooded killer of a boss would do to him if he found out -- and he pulled this stunt in front of another henchman -- all I can say is, the guy must have had a major death wish. Or very poor impulse control. Or the IQ of something from the back of the refrigerator. Or all of the above.Anyway, through the miracle of scientific-sounding mumbo-jumbo (as tediously expounded by Morgan Freeman -- what a terrible waste of a fine actor!) we find out that the drug which has leaked into Lucy's bloodstream is expanding her consciousness and giving her superhuman abilities. This leads to lots of special effects and general mayhem, as well as the obligatory car chase.I don't mean to sound dismissive of this movie: far from it. Generally, anything Besson directs is well worth a look. There are some marvelously trippy sequences showing the effects of the drug on her perceptions, and some humorous moments, like when her body tries to rebel while she's on an airliner. Johansson deftly manages her mental transformation into something both more and less than human, making her performance chilling and touching, sometimes both at once.A slight correction to the IMDb blurb: it's true that at first, the drug turns Lucy into a ruthless killer. But as her consciousness progresses to a higher level, she stops killing, even though it would have been easy for her to squash people like bugs.Not Besson's best, but still a nice alternative to your usual mindless summer blockbuster. Worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pushing the boundaries....of idiocy,"OK, it's not a poorly-made film. It's clearly a top-budget tier-A movie. However, the amount of time that the movie, which presents itself to be taken seriousy, dumps all over logic and physics is just unbelievable. ScarJo's powers are also poorly defined, basically she becomes a god and can make up new powers as she goes along. This doesn't make a lick of sense even if I am willing to go along with the ridiculous 10% theory. There are still the laws of physics that humans must adhere to!The movie suffers also from unsatisfying action sequences and a large number of ""what did I just watch?"" moments.

great fun and fascinating concept - plus 2 great performances,"Lucy ws the nsme given to one of the apes extensively evaluated by researchers comparing humans to the aspes with the largest brain size, and Lucy was also the name given to one of the early skull discoveries that anthropoligists trying to understand our earlirest origins have studied.So here the title given to the main character Lucy, starts off as a rather dumb, gullible pretty woman agreeing to take into a bank a locked suitcase, for an obviously huge source of trouble,
she is captured, beaten up, locked up, and operated on without her knowledge, to implant in her a large sachet of a very powerful drug, there are others, men, who have similarly been kidnapped, and had the drug sachet implanted in their abdomen, and each will fly to a different country to spread this drug,
but as Lucy is played by Scarlett Johansen, she will rebel, not follow the plan, and then she will come in contact with Morgan Freeman, who is a senior semi-retied professor who has spent many years researching the human brain and telling us that we only use a fraction of its capacity,
Lucy demonstrates that she now has exceptional powers - demonstrated by the latest hi-fi graphics, and she isd now on a mission to save the world from being controlled by the asian crooks,
it is hi-fi fun, car chases, impossible fights, but Scarlett Johansen is riveting, every moment she is on the screen, and Morgan Freeman backs her up very well.The idea is fascinating but ultimately it is just good high speed fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Johansson is undoubtedly a Hollywood leading lady,"Ambitious in its subject matter - Writer/Director Luc Beeson continues to stay true to his storytelling regardless of how ridiculous its content.

I feel like I approached the film appropriately anticipating exactly what it intended to be - just a fun 90 minute thrill ride with an absurd premise - w/ Scarlett Johansson & Morgan Freeman at the helm. AND by the way - after seeing Ghost In The Shell & now Lucy - there's no reason for any haters out there to doubt Scarlett's talent & ability AND bank-ability as a Hollywood leading lady. You can always count on Beeson to be authentic and unafraid to put everything into his filmmaking; so go into Lucy open-minded and you may actually find yourself liking it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"a great start, but then, just too out-of-this-world inhuman","Usually I discuss older titles, every so often they are long-forgotten movies remembered only by me, or so I often felt (thanks to IMDb I now know it's not quite as bad as that). Today I'm tackling Luc Besson's 2014 opus LUCY, and I am going to kick off by saying that it is spectacular, do see it, you are in for a treat if you do, but as this one is a new movie, I am also really going to blast it plot-wise. Scarlett Johansson is to me what it is all about, so, as far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was the riveting part. You could have kept all the special effects for my sake. The poor little bunny in such terrible distress, Please Mr. Jang, if you can't get rid of the chain, you don't have to chop off my hand... To me, a normal ol' suspense drama would have been much preferred. This bit about unlocking brain potential with the help of a leaking bag of CPH4 sowed in your stomach is just too much, way too much, the much simpler crime thriller that was thrown away in favor of this banal monstrosity really is a sad loss. Anyway, keep Scarlett wrapped in cotton wool, she is a national treasure, still every bit as hot as in THE ISLAND, years and years later, Hollywood living must really agree with her! She has a most beautiful huggable-bunny face reflecting childlike innocence.Memo to self: Unlock 100% brain power. Open up world of endless possibilities.

The worst script in recent memory,"One star reviews are usually hyperbole. Usually they are people joking about how bad a movie is. I am not joking. And I am also astonished that I am the only written review so far.This movies is one of the worst scripts i have ever had to endure. And believe me, ""endure"" is the correct word. It is a test for withstanding abuse. Scarlett's character makes no sense. OK, she unlocks hidden potential? I don't mind that. its very reminiscent (and eventually blatantly rips off) a favorite movie of mine called Akira. She gains power and becomes the ultimate. But no, alas, there is no development. She gets a dose of pre-natal blue rock candy and instantly changes in personality.This would have been wonderful: She suddenly has powers, but is unable or afraid to use them because she is still a meek person. As she becomes more powerful, she becomes less human. It's a no brainer of story, but nope! None of this ""development"" crap!Other than that, the script is 70% unintelligible techno-babble that doesn't even try to come across as intelligent. The remaining 30%? Over-done, seen it 100 times before attempts and bad-assery. The villains lack any motivation for their actions after the first 10 minutes.The acting is, after the first 15 minutes, equally appalling. I usually like Scarlett Johansen. She is a wooden board here. Not that she as anything to work with. I LOVE Morgan Freeman and he spends so much time phoning this in that I actually want to see his AT&T bill for the months he was on set. Must be astronomical.This is a movie that is about accessing other unknown portions of your brain, but this movie was actively trying to shut my brain down. Also, I now have eye strain because i could not stop rolling my eyes. I wanted to rush the ticket holder and demand my money back, but my mind had degraded so much i couldn't process speech to ask for my money back. This review may have some humor, yes, but still, my point remains: This is an absolutely terrible movie and the only good thing is that it came out in a very busy summer, because if this had a blockbuster amount of attention, I would be worried for Scarlett Johansens acting career.

"Measure of Sight, Not of Things","In a meeting today I mentioned spacetime diagrams and my word vomit had a meeting member suggest Lucy.I had seen Lucy a few years prior, I enjoy science fiction and the idea that, as humans we have the capacity to mould our own minds, deeply entertained my thought space.Also, this week I listened to a podcast on curiosity through the lens of complexity. They use a scale which I believe is applicable here.For accuracy to occur there needs to be a high level of cognition. While inaccuracy aids lower cognitive tasks.In the podcast, Dani and Perry mention that people strive to strike a balance between the two ends of the scale, yet there is often a sacrifice for one to the other.Lucy aims to strike a balance where we are able to understand the deeper concepts being presented - such as the time continuum, scale, data, really - quantum thinking.The sacrifice of accuracy allows for an enjoyable watch with themes that had a 'light' way of having me question the purpose of life, knowledge, and time.""If you're asking what to do with all this knowledge you've accumulated I'd say, pass it on, just like any simple cell going through time.""

I counted only once that the dialogue was interesting.3.

It explores what people have inquired about for decades, and it does so in a fun way - with constantly growing special abilities now wielded by Scarlett's character, Lucy.

Completely different from what I expected,"When I first saw the trailer, I thought this would be some kind of superhero movie - maybe not saving the world, but some kind of origin story. Well, as it turns out, I was wrong. Apparently ""superpowers"" don't always equal superheroes in cinema. That's actually very good. I'm glad that this didn't turn out to be some mindless superhero action movie with ray guns and all that stuff, even if this isn't on the same level with the actually deep, astonishing science fiction movies.Cinematography was astonishing. The effects were good, and most of the scenes were very clear, and it was easy to keep track on what was going on and were.Lucy is slightly interesting as a character, but only because of this mystery around her. We don't know who she is, we know only small things that are kind of useless little facts. But all that interest I had in her vanished after she started to change into this typical godlike character who is in some way superior to others, and just knows everything, knows how to do everything, and then just sits there and explains things we don't know about our word so expressionlessly it's almost painful.But to be honest this movie was disturbingly, well, racist. Mostly because of in the beginning this was a lot of ""White woman killing scary Asian men"". Come one, she shot one just because he didn't speak English, that is disturbing considering were she was.If you don't think about the racist parts for a while - and I know a lot of people won't - this movie is pretty good.

"This movie is a mockery of human knowledge, intelligence, and understanding.","From beginning to end, this movie was absolutely ridiculous. Even before I watched the movie, I knew it was going to be a horrible movie, but I decided I'd do it because some of you guys would probably be interested in a review, so here it is. The fundamental idea at its most basic level can bring forth a very interesting concept, such as what the movie Limitless did. What I saw in this movie was an infinitely worse version of Limitless. Luc Besson, the writer and director, took this very simple concept, and not only did he try, unsuccessfully to overcomplicate it to sound smart, but he tried to use a trick on the audience, by introducing a few sciency sounding terms and keeping the viewers interested by their, ironically, lack of knowledge. The path he chose the movie to take, from the fundamental concept, made the whole idea absolutely, and hilariously, absurd. Firstly, the ""fact"" that humans only use 10% of their brain's capacity is a myth. We use 100% of our brain's capacity, just at different times, for different actions. Secondly, the idea that humans, or anything, for that matter, are able to control things that are physically unreachable on a subatomic level, such as time, is just stupid. And for any questions regarding time travel: time travel doesn't work with simply ""moving"" time. You bend spacetime to reach a different destination. You're bending particles with energy; not magically leaping through time. This movie completely disregarded any and every basic law of physics. Moving on to the acting, it was the best acting I've ever seen in my life not really. The acting was actually very bad. I didn't expect much from Scarlett Johansson, and I got even less from her. Since she was basically the only important of the movie, I'd say the general acting was bad as well, seeing as no one else had any significant roles, except for Morgan Freeman, whom didn't have many lines either. The metaphors were completely unsubtle, and pretty much threw themselves at the audience's faces and screamed ""WE'RE METAPHORS."" Also, I'd like to point out that it's literally impossible to portray a character infinitely more knowledgeable in a movie, seeing as the ""research"" put into said movie would come from other sources. So, unless the writer would be the Nikola Tesla of our time, it'd just be a poor attempt, and excuse, for a movie introducing a ""new concept"" which is revolutionary. It's predictable down to the last detail. I'm not even kidding. It's an extremely predictable movie. The director/writer is, from what I gather, not a very intelligent man, and movies like these should be left to people who: a) are intelligent, and b) actually know what they're doing. This movie was just a mockery of human intelligence and understanding as a whole, not to mention and indirect mockery of anyone who thinks it's good.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brain power,"Lucy starts off with the introduction of an ordinary girl who is trying to make it in Asia. Lucy simply stumbles across a bad situation and gets caught in an international drug ring. This sets off a series of events that create an expansion of Lucy's brain capacity. Research says that we use only 10% of our brain, but what if we could ramp it up and be able to use all of it. This would seem incredible but would this be ability that we would really want. Lucy is incredible, fast pace, full of suspense and points to questions, without passing judgment or being preachy.Scarlett Johansson showcases her full broad skills as an actress as she transitions from a sex kitty to a genius scientific intellectual in the course of the movie.

Much more fantastical than intelligent science fiction.,"'LUCY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sci-Fi action flick written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Scarlett Johansson as an American woman, living in Taiwan, who's forced into transferring a powerful drug, hidden in her abdomen. When the drug starts leaking it allows the woman to use her brain's full functioning capacity, which in turn gives her super powers. The film costars Morgan Freeman, Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked. The film deals with some interesting theories but it's much more fantastical than intelligent science fiction. Still it's action-packed and pretty entertaining.Johansson plays Lucy, a young American woman who's living in Taipei, Taiwan. She just began dating a drug mule there, named Richard (Pilou Asbaek). After Richard makes Lucy do his job for him, and he's killed, the Korean gangster he was working for, Mr. Jang (Min-sik), forces Lucy to take his place. A powerful synthetic drug, called CPH4, is sewn into her stomach and she, and three others, are forced into transferring the drugs into Europe. After being beaten, by one of Jang's men, the drug begins to leak inside her. This makes her increasingly smarter; which gives her special abilities. Freeman plays a Professor that Lucy goes to for help.The theory that we only use 10% of our brain's capacity is heavily explored in this film (although most scientists say it's just a myth). In this movie when Lucy begins using 20% of her brain, and increasingly higher amounts, she develops super human abilities; like telekinesis and mental time travel. She keeps getting more and more powerful, self aware and also increasingly emotionless. This makes her character seem extremely unrelatable; she's still an awesome action heroine though. Besson is well known for doing action flicks with really strong female characters (like 'LA FEMME NIKITA', 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT' and 'THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC'). Johansson's character here continues that tradition. As an action flick it works but it's definitely not full of intelligent big ideas. It does try to do something different but it's still highly reminiscent of other recent sci-fi flicks like 'TRANSCENDENCE' and even 'HER' (which also featured Johansson). It's definitely entertaining enough for 90 minutes though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/3AK4roDokJo",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

New kind of movie by Luc Besson,"Lucy.."" Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it? "" Lucy was a kind of movie to answer those question. and Lucy did it! Lucy showed a beautiful shot with some issue of human brain capacity.Scarlett Jo played great as she is, even act not in her best performance..maybe because shes in pregnant while shooting this movie.Once again..Morgan Freeman steals attention in many scenes on this movie.

"Three gifted main actors, an incredible director and stunning visual effects lead us through a thought-provoking story where science and fiction collide in equal parts","Lucy could easily be the best film of the year and should attract a lot more cinephiles to the movie theatres than it already does. The movie has many different strengths, differs from similar films and feels fresh and entertaining despite a more philosophical and scientific approach.First of all, the movie has a running time of ninety minutes only. The viewer is immediately thrown into a story filled with pace and tension. This films simply doesn't include any unnecessary lengths.The acting performances in this film are completely incredibly. Scarlett Johansson starts as a naive and shy lady that slowly becomes a clever heroine in a credible manner. Her character doesn't include the usual weaknesses of so-called superheroes. She doesn't talk too much, she only uses her powers when she has to and is still quite impressive and there is no cheesy love story or a demon from her past to distract us from the main plot. Morgan Freeman only has a smaller role in this movie but he simply convinces for being there because he is credible in his role as a clever scientist and has a lot of charisma. The ruthless main villain is portrayed by the incredible Choi Min-Sik who is one of my favourite actors ever and it's great to finally see him in a Western movie where his incredible talents get some more attention. This may not be his greatest performance but this man has a talent and history for playing dark characters.The story of the movie is another strong point. It's not your usual tale of crime and vengeance. The film has a rather profound philosophical and scientific side and takes its time to explain what is actually going on without boring the audience. Many viewers felt let down by the ending of the movie but in relation to the entire film, it completely makes sense. The movie doesn't only convince with gifted actors and addicting action sequences but also offers some real food for thought.The visual effects of the movie exploit all contemporary technologies extremely well. I was stunned by many impressive images from animal and nature sequences over animated pictures of the human body up to modern images with different rays and colours. These effects make the movie even more enjoyable in a cinema.The rest of the movie is very well executed as well. There are no annoying shaky camera passages, the soundtrack is very fitting and the whole movie has an intriguing multicultural touch as it takes place in Taiwan and France and involves actors and characters from many different countries. The fact that the Korean actors only speak Korean might be annoying for some viewers but it makes the experience even more realistic. Just as Scarlett Johansson's character in the beginning, the viewer doesn't always understand what is going on when the Korean characters are talking and this adds even more tension to the plot and is a great element that is more and more employed in commercial movies as well.Lucy may not reinvent a whole genre but this science-fiction movie focuses on the best elements of science and a really gripping fiction. If you only like slow-paced dramas or comedy movies for the whole family, this movie isn't for you but anyone else should absolutely watch this film as soon as possible. There are still some interesting movies to come out this year but so far, this film is a more than solid candidate for the greatest movie of the year and you really don't want to miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
very good,"I finally saw this movie on TV and I liked it. it gives meaning to ""what if"". We do not know what will happen if we do use all of our brains because some people may use more and others less. Maybe that is the difference between scientists who invent something or theorize and use trial/error and the common blue/ white collar. why do some people have higher IQs than others? Besides the movie being entertaining, I did like the fact she can multi-task. Would we be able to do the same?

Super Scarlett is super entertaining,"(67%) A spectacularly entertaining sensation with doses of ""Limitless"", ""Under the skin"", ""X-men"" and ""Transcendence"", just to name a few. Johnansson is utterly terrific throughout, and this really does prove that she is more than capable in a leading role in an action movie. While Besson has saved one of his more interesting scripts for himself to direct, and he does a wonderful job with a plot and structure style that could have gone badly wrong. At 90 mins the movie is surprisingly satisfying because the pacing is sublime, and from the very start this is efficiently thrilling. There are a few minor niggles here and there that mostly come from its own high ambitions that it sets itself, but overall this is a summer hit to remember.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
No brain function was used during the writing and making of this film,"What will happen when Luc Besson uses none of his brain while making Lucy? A film with the philosophical insight of a stoned 14 year old boy and is so jaw droppingly stupid, it's frightening to imagine a major theatrical release that's worse than Lucy in 2014. Metaphors are literally shown to the audience with footage of animals, like a mouse being enticed by bate in a mouse trap and it's either Luc Besson's idea of artistic flair or he thinks so little of his audience that he has to spell out even the dumbest scene. Morgan Freeman's speeches about using more than 10% percent of the human brain, even in fantasy movie land, are so simplistic and silly, an audience of children would be more fitting than college students and adults. For someone that has apparently unlocked all of her brain, Lucy doesn't use much of it and has gotten herself drawn into a really terrible action movie - when she could have used her smarts and about 5 minutes to synthesize the drug for herself, or simply duplicate it with her powers. But no, she has to travel the globe to get a few bags from some mules, because the worldwide theatrical box office would benefit from it, not that a modicum of logic should dictate the story. Idiot plotting; dialogue that's equal parts point at the screen hilarious and roll your eyes into the back of your head bad; villains who are typical stock characters that you'd find in your standard straight to video actioner; a climax that was either cut due to budget restraints or Besson just had no ideas outside of throwing his percentage of brain gimmick into the structure of a D grade action film - Lucy is truly out of this world dim-witted.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
one time deal,"This movie is a one time deal. You see it once and probably don't want to see it again. The movie is a great one, but its not for everyone. Scarlett was a good pick for an actress. The movie was cool to watch, but a little weird. The way they put the movie could have been different. It was also a fast moving movie, so you have to pay attention. The end was weird and came abrupt end. Though it was different than many other movie it still wasn't good. Morgan was a highlight to this movie for the brief parts he was in. It was also weird seeing Scarlett keep a straight face, she reminded me of Kristen Stewart acting. So the first time view is fun other than that forget it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lucy had big potential but...,"Very unusual movie with great potential. Some kind of science fiction action, just to see the Luc Besson's writing. I read somewhere that the film is a mix of a Leon Professional and 2001: Odyssey and really would agree with that. Especially towards the end. Scarlett is a real female heroine in the movie and its transformation into the same is to be applauded. For some things in the movie should not be seen as black and white, because technically they are not true, but actually it does not matter so much, just accept that you watch the movie, not real life. As a whole, the film is very entertaining and intense, and he certainly giving thumbs up, but I think it could be a lot better. Thus I evaluated it with the strained seven, closer to six than eight.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Suspense...,"""Lucy"" is an action thriller movie in which we watch a woman who accidentally caught in a strange deal and now she has to fight her way back. After this deal takes place she is transformed in a best warrior with some special powers or better senses. These powers cannot be understood by the people since they are very evolved and beyond the human logic.I liked this movie because of its interesting and new plot with a well-written script. It was the first time I watched a movie with this kind of plot and it was a good surprise for me. I also liked the direction which was made by Luc Besson because I believe he did a great job and it can be easily understood from the whole duration of it. The interpretations of Scarlett Johansson who played Lucy and Morgan Freeman who played Professor Norman were simply amazing.To sum up, I have to say that ""Lucy"" is a good and interesting movie with which you are going to have a great time. I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much since you are going to be alert for the whole duration of it and you will be amazed from the ending of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Has the gloss and nice structure, but ultimately lacking in forward motion, sense, and thrills","It is to this film's benefit that it barely touches the 90 minute mark; not only was it this factor that made me watch it in the last 100 minutes of a long-haul flight, but it also means that it has a very short distance to go, and doesn't have to worry too much about not being able to keep up a fast pace all the way. This does cover up for a lot and to a certain point it did make the film work for me by virtue of it moving forward with slickness and material that offers some interest. It also benefits from a nice structure which has a lecture interspersed in the beginning, plus quickly edited clips and images, all of which add pace and variety.This approach is complimented by a slick presentation, a good sized budget, famous faces in the cast, good locations, and all the trimmings one expects with such films. Unfortunately, these aspects mostly serve to mask some of the inherent problems with it, rather than lift an already strong film to be stronger. The writing is probably the root of most things and in this case it is weak, trying to engage and expand but also trying to service an action thriller – it doesn't really do either well, even though in the broad sweep it is quite daring in where it goes. That said, by failing to really engage the brain, the daring place it ends up, actually comes over as pretty silly and ultimately makes for a weaker ending than it should have been.The action is a mixed bag since at times it is well executed whereas at others it is lacking in memorable set-pieces and tends towards genre cliché and standards. The slick style does cover this up, but generally the action doesn't thrill as much as it should, and combined with the so-so material, I did find myself just ""looking"" at the screen, rather than really being into the film. The cast try hard and are part of the slick presentation; Johansson is not really used well, however she does her best in the style, and has some elements of performance about her. Freeman plays himself – and is best when detached from the action, not so much in the second half. Likewise Min-sik Choi is stylistically very much a key part of the film, but at the same time could have benefited from doing that within a better film.Lucy does fill its time well, and does it with a style and pace that at least will distract, but not much more than that. The action needed to be sharper, the ideas needed to be smarter, and although the destination is a good idea, it is poorly executed and ends up more silly than inspired.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Scarlett Johansson is HOT in this Ridiculous Fantasy Flick,"While audiences might be doubtful on its logic flaws regarding the accuracy of bio-scientific theory, the film finds itself in balance while presenting both the science and the usual action thriller. It starts off with basic human evolution science fiction, interchanges with drug activation scenes which enhances the speed of the plot, but then further progresses into a ridiculous fantasy flick. The cinematography is generally fine, but considering to restructure and combine the film together with Transcendence? into a new individual film might have the chance to be a better film than Limitless?. Nonetheless, the scores which suit the film perfectly, extraordinary charming performance from Scarlett Johansson herself and Morgan Freeman have succeeded enough in closing the logical gaps and action thrills to embrace all Black Widow's fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A classic beauty playing a cerebral role to the max,"Scarlett Johansson shines in this thought-provoking film that focusses on the realization of 100% of a person's brain potential in a scifi special effects bombshell. She plays Lucy, initially a down on her luck young lady who gets involved with the Chinese mafia and ends up ingesting a drug that morphs her into a superhuman in terms of ability to rule matter with her mind. The plot develops into her journey to the 100% marker of brain power while the Chinese contingent is trying to destroy her. Along the way, she involves a French detective, Amr Waked and a professor, Morgan Freeman. As she moves close to using 100% of her brain capacity, Lucy becomes more estranged from human feelings and gradually replaces them with pure logic and knowledge of the fundamentals of human existence and bridges the gap between physics, time and space. The evil doers chasing her are not used to losing but are thwarted at every turn and in the end they are obliterated. Lucy the movie is a fabulous ride to the unknown and gives us a glimpse of what can be in the far distant future. This is a different role for Scarlett which she plays wonderfully.

unexpected and smart........,"i went to this movie to see a copy of the movie limitless,but after watching it i can say it's not the same.there are some similarities between the two movies but the way the movie maker presented it is different.this is a more action packed version where the style and the methods that was used to make this movie really gives it a unique touch.A woman named Lucy at first portrayed as a party type typical girl and after an incident her world changes in a really fast way where she gains full capacity of her brain.the movie directly put the audience in the place of Lucy and after that it's nonstop action ride.events happens in a really quick way and the word boring can't be used in this movie.Scarlett Johansson who plays the female protagonist give a good performance which really suits the style of the movie.Morgan Freeman is playing the role which he played in several other movies recently.Min- sik Choi a veteran actor produces a reasonably good villain who goes against Lucy.however one draw back for me in this movie is the way Lucy was presented,where after some time the character Lucy becomes soo powerful no one becomes a match to her and at that point the movie losses the edge a bit.but considering the whole movie it's a minor draw back.this might not be a exceptional movie,but it is a really enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Scarlett Johansson is a goddess,"Well, we all knew that, but now she has like... abilities. Anyway, my impression of this film is that it is another type of Fifth Element with a sexy chick presented as the greatest and best humanity can become. Like The Fifth Element, Luc Besson writes and directs this story about the aptly named Lucy who accidentally absorbs a superdrug that a Korean cartel is trying to manufacture and sell. She then uses more and more of her brain allowing her to have all these wonderful powers and knowledge.Unfortunately, this is about all that the movie is about and you get that from the trailer. In a way, the trailer is a damned lie, because after you see the premise of the film and some cool scenes, you are tempted to believe that is just a part and the rest of the film would be building on it. It is not. That's about all you get.In fact the Korean mafia and the police and humanity in general become pretty much inconsequential after a while. Morgan Freeman's character appears in about 5 minutes of scenes, the violent murders, fights and car chases are there just as a distraction and Lucy herself, the apex of humanity, does nothing more than use the entire existence as a she would a cell phone, spout some existential things that make little sense and look pretty.Bottom line: If Transcendence really posed some interesting questions about what people would do if granted limitless power, ending with a very philosophical free will choice kind of thing, Lucy is just eye-candy. The only interesting idea in it seems to be that the purpose of life is to share knowledge. Well, there is that, but also another: the elimination of knowledge we don't like. Yet that's another story altogether and probably more interesting than this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Takes you off guard at first but it's a fun movie to watch.,"So wait, I though we had debunked the myth of human beings only using just 10% of our brains a long time ago?You are not gonna get any science accuracy from this movie and the great Luc Besson does nothing to hide that fact. In fact, he bares it all in this over the top surrealistic action comedy (Although, I don't think the movie is advertised as an action comedy, it's purposely laughable)The pleasing to the eyes Scarlett Johansson plays the title character who is force to use her body as a drug mule, but when the package burst she discovers an overdose of the new designer drug opens parts of her mind that would take thousands of years of evolution to do.The film making is very unorthodox especially for a big American movie like this one. Luc's inter cuts of stock nature footage was not really something we are use to but it was worked in brilliantly and was very humorous. It felt like a major Hollywood studio was allowing this Frenchma n free creative control to make the most artistically obscure action movie the U.S has ever released in theaters, and he's proving to all studios that they should give that type of freedom to artist. Nicely done.I also loved how foreign the movie felt, not just with the film making but with the international cast. The movie takes place mostly in Taiwan with small parts in France. Though it stars two American actors the movie's man antagonist does not even speak English.Possible the weirdest action flick I've seen in a while, it's not for science geeks as it's thrown out the window for a more artistic focus that made for a very watchable thrill ride at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A whimsy built on a fallacy. Exciting, but conveniently wrapped up.","It's been a while since Luc Besson really excited me. I'm going to say 1994, with the sublime Léon. His most recent outings as writer (3 Days to Kill) and director (The Family) have been dull thuds that threatened to overshadow the resounding successes of his hit-man triumph and the likes of Subway and The Big Blue. Twenty years is a long time to wait for something worth celebrating, but finally we have Lucy to admire.Let's not get too excited, though. Lucy is a curio, an enjoyable return to form from the French auteur (a contentious mantle and one worthy of debate another time), but is a long way from being a classic, despite a solid, central performance from Scarlett Johansson in the title role.When Lucy is forced to deliver a briefcase to the violent criminal kingpin Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), she winds up with a bag full of a new synthetic drug sewn into her belly. Before she can complete the delivery, the bag bursts and the drug infects her, unlocking the unused 90% of her brain and transforming her into an acutely aware, brilliant superhuman with warrior-like powers and a drastically reduced shelf life on this earth.At this juncture we should perhaps take a momentary step back into reality. Lucy is a whimsy built on a fallacy. We don't use a mere 10% of our brain. We use all of it (although a look at some people around here does bring that accepted 'fact' into question) but understand perhaps 10% of the brain's workings. And while we're at it, if you cut a worm in half, you don't get two worms, you end up with a dead worm in two parts. Deal with it!However, facts can get in the way of a good story and so Besson dispenses with them from the outset, not that I have any particular issues with that. For the most part, Lucy is exciting and a thoroughly enjoyable romp. There are plot holes aplenty but Besson bats them away with aplomb, and concentrates on the thrills and the race against time. This is Limitless meets Transcendence with a serious armoury thrown in for good measure. There is much to enjoy as we watch Lucy evolving physically, mentally and emotionally before us, becoming ever more resourceful and violent as she seeks out Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), the authority on the mind and brain function, for help and to impart her knowledge to him.Morgan Freeman, though a comforting presence, is unremarkable, playing essentially the same role as he did in Transcendence. His Professor Norman is virtually indistinguishable from his Joseph Tagger and the impression he gives is of a man coasting in his dotage. His performance doesn't in any way detract from Lucy, it just doesn't enhance it.The presence of the hominid Lucy is awful, however. Didn't Besson think about looking at the make up and CGI created for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or even the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Awful, just awful. And the confusion of travelling through space first and then time is clumsy and implies he is uncertain of his historical chronology and geography.The principal failing of Lucy is its culmination, which of is largely unsatisfying though hardly surprising. Lucy sets out with high ideals of uniqueness, boldness and enlightenment but is unable to be truly original and has to settle for a rearrangement of old ideas. That isn't entirely the fault of Luc Besson as we must shoulder some of the responsibility. We are creatures of limited comprehension, we cannot truly fathom the infinity of the universe (something has to contain it, surely) and this, Lucy, is no different. We have a need to box things up to understand them and by doing so Besson immediately limits it.'It', the expansiveness of intelligence and our potential, becomes something tangible for us to scrutinize. Professor Norman states early on that he doesn't know what would happen if we ever harnessed the entirety of our brain capacity. He can only hypothesize; the rest is a mystery. Besson, however, attempts to explain and portray it for us. The bolder move would have been stop short of an explanation, to perhaps watch Lucy's brainpower percentage rise and to fill the screen and auditorium with white noise until the credits cut in, leaving us puzzled, confused, befuddled, just as Professor Norman is, but I suspect Besson feared the cries of outrage from audiences and critics and instead he gives us a convenient, comprehensible resolution.Lucy needed a visionary at the helm. Whilst Besson is imaginative and delivers a rollicking good ride (on a good day), he lacks the courage to create something truly unique and astounding.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A cinematic Neanderthal,"'Lucy' tries to be both an action-thriller and intellectually provocative, but succeeds in neither of these ambitions. The film's tired plot relates how some blood-thirsty Chinese drug traffickers attempt to corner the market with a new designer drug. After sewing packages of the substance into the stomachs of some reluctant mules, they blackmail them to fly to Europe with the contraband. Apparently these incompetent mobsters haven't properly tested their product, and are ignorant that an overdose can endow its consumer with extraordinary physical powers and intelligence. When one of the packages leaks, a ditsy blonde mule metamorphoses into Superwoman.The plot-holes are gigantic, so writer/director Luc Besson attempts to distract the audience with his standard menu of theatrical fights, car chases, shoot-outs and gratuitous violence. These stale leftovers are served up with some pretentious babbling about the drug's mutations projecting humanity up the evolutionary ladder.

Entertaining and visually nourishing. Not incredibly deep plot..,"Lucy, as we know, is evolving and quickly becoming able to use more of her brain. The interest in what ideas the writer's may come up with to take advantage of this catchy film idea, keeps the watcher attentive. Unfortunately, as most movies do that just try to push scientific evolutionary theory as the 'main-Sell' of the movie, it ends up lacking in the human-relationships side of the plot. Although there is some romantic interest in Lucy, there seemed a lack of believability in some of the other characters relational-side to humanity. Visually, it is a very Matrix-esc display (Even though it could have used some of that Matrix Sci-Fi-ness to enhance the plot). Great special effects, time stop-motion filming. Good camera effects with zooming, panning, and meshing with computer animations. The down-side was an extensive amount of B-role footage from yesteryear. A lot of time lapse photography/videography, and history lessons that look as though they came straight out of the Encyclopedia Britannica CD ROM collections of a decade ago. They would've been better-off to show more of their A-List actress, Scarlett Johansson. She played the role very well, not overly emotional (as the character dictated) and not so understated that you miss her. Co-staring actors left something to be desired. Johansson is a real up-and- coming film Icon. Her role in Captain America gave her widespread fame amongst a diverse audience. Her audience for Lucy will be considerably smaller. Although doing well at the box office, because of the content and MPAA Rating, Lucy has a lower ceiling for success.

The Dopest thing i watched by night.,"It's unbealivable how Luc Besson ran and shot this movie knowingly that Leon The professional is movie way more different over this one (albeit there were a few shot inspired by it); The Visuals are great sometimes mostly, but there are some moments where it feels so computarized just like Lucy (the Monkey) and those black tentacles but the rest it is wonderful; Scarlett Johansson is so well-known as Black Widow so far (no wonder she did pretty good) but the people must acknowledge her other works like this one, Morgan Freeman is a Master, ain't his best role but anything he touched turns into gold itself.

Intriguing idea...which fails to deliver,"Intriguing idea...which fails to deliver.A woman, Lucy (played by Scarlett Johansson), is kidnapped by a gang in Taiwan. Drugs are hidden in her body but these are accidentally absorbed, causing her to use far more of her brain power than any human. With power comes responsibility...The movie was initially quite interesting. Yes, the whole ""we only use 10% of our brain"" premise is just a myth and is actually absolute nonsense - we use our brain pretty much to its capacity. However, there was room for a interesting story on what we could and should do if we could extend our brain power.It's a pity then that it just took a random direction, turning into a ""look at what I can do with CGI"" display by director Luc Besson, rather than a coherent story. What follows is far from profound or satisfying.It also became an action-drama, but even there it didn't really cover new ground.

A decent movie that I'll watch again sometime,"Reading reviews seems to a risky matter: some reviewers are snobs and try to be hypercritical, while others run the gamut. I approach movies just seeking to be entertained for awhile, and this movie did that. In fact, I liked it and as my above summary says, I will most likely watch this movie again. As many reviewers have critically mentioned, the story line is improbable, but so are the Star Wars movies. This movie doesn't have the overuse of raw language or grab-you-in-the-ass action/gore/sex/fill in the blank which some people seem to expect from every movie. I don't watch every movie waiting for the special effects. For me, it was just a story that had enough going to keep me interested. I do enjoy movies with character development and this movie doesn't have much of that, but given what is happening with the main character, she's not left with much personality. I think that it would be easy to approach this movie with expectations that might not be met; if you take that approach,you may not find what you were looking for with this one. Besides, it has Morgan Freeman and sometimes that's just enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Tries so Hard to be ""Deep""","I have now watched 3 movies Luc Benson directed and 3 is the highest rating I gave any of them (Lucy, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, and Leon). There is nothing in common with the direction of these three movies that stands out to me, only that they stand out as some of my least favorite watches over the past 5 years. Regardless of my dislike for Benson's work, here we have a movie that jumps into action immediately, but quickly devolves into a science fiction mishmash that really makes no sense. You are asked to accept something that is patently ridiculous. If as a viewer you are unable to accept that then the movie will be like a joke to you. If, however, you are able to accept the absurd premise the movie will be interesting but still unfulfilling.The ending is atrocious. The one thing Lucy had going for it through the first hour is its fast pace and the ending brings the action to a stand still and makes the viewer focus on the ridiculousness of the plot. Lucy is a fantastic failure of a movie that tries so hard to be deep but only comes off as ludicrous.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
OTT SF film is also a bloody crime story.,"A Universal film. Exciting trailers suggested a film rather like 'Transcendence' from earlier this year starring Johnny Depp, and so it turned out to be. 'Her' (2013), which was screened earlier this year, starred Joaquin Phoenix as a man who fell in love with his computer. That film concentrated on the personal and was rather boring. By contrast, in 'Transcendence', Johnny Depp is plugged into a computer, an event which is exciting and has far-reaching consequences.In 2011, Bradley Cooper starred in 'Limitless' playing a man who takes a drug which expands his brain-power. 'Lucy' has a similar plot, so it is not an original idea. However it is an exciting film. If however you are interested in this brain-expanding idea, 'Limitless' is the better of the two films. Like in 'Her', 'Limitless' concentrated on the personal, and was rather believable. Writer and director Luc Besson seems to have taken that idea as a starting point, but then via a crime story, has moved into a 'Transcendence' mode of limitless possibilities.In 1994 Luc Besson astonished audiences with his 'Leon'. Now in 'Lucy' Mr Besson has given us a rather similar bloody and exciting crime story.'Lucy' opens with some nice graphics to go with the opening titles. However, just like in 'Leon', it is merely the calm before the storm. Some information given out about this film was that the star, Scarlett Johansson, played a character forced to carry drugs, which then got into her system. This seemed an unlikely scenario but Luc Besson makes it a believable situation.Miss Johansson plays a not too bright party girl in Taiwan who is caught up in the clutches of a gang of violent criminals. Just as 'Leon' opens with a young Natalie Portman scared of falling into the clutches of mad killer Gary Oldman, so in 'Lucy' we have a similar scenario. Miss Johansson stumbles into the clutches of a Mr Jang played by Min-sik Choi. This villainous character makes Mr Oldman look like a pussy-cat. Like Miss Portman before her, Miss Johansson attempts to escape her predicament. However she is unable to. The situation gets worse and worse, the scenes bloodier and bloodier, unremittingly so.Whilst the early scenes are filmed in Taiwan and are clearly based in Taiwan, the gangsters do not seem to be Triad members. The body-tattooing and Korean language suggest rather that these gangsters are in fact the Japanese Yakuza, who in reality have many ethnic Korean members. Poor little white girl Lucy, unable to speak the language, is terrified by the situation. This is captured well, and we, like Lucy, do not understand the situation. In these scenes Miss Johansson is very emotional and gives a superb performance. As the film develops, so does Lucy, and she becomes more like 'the woman who knows too much', acting accordingly, and again Miss Johansson excels in this character development.Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked give good support, but this film is all about Scarlett Johansson and Min-sik Choi, who are the chief protagonists, and who dominate the proceedings, in every scene they are in. Two tremendous performances.This film is part SF, and part crime story. It is very bloody. If you liked 'Leon' (1994), or 'Transcendence' (2014), then you should enjoy this film. Fans of SF and pseudo-science will enjoy this film, but it is not suitable for viewing by scientists.Bloody, but good. 9/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great movie contemplating about unlimited potential of human mind and brain through the action story,"My wife and I started to watch this 2014 motion picture on our regular Friday's movie night. Well, it is produced as the action story with a lot of graphic violence, first against the heroine and then also by her herself. My wife quickly could not take it anymore and left the living room. I remember that once at the movie Snowpiercer in the theater she left the room and waited for me in the lobby for the same reason. I had to finish it both times myself and I am so glad I did. I finished watching Lucy in my room. If you cannot take a violence, even it is reasonable in the context of the story, then do not. So, I write this review without my wife's input which is always very interesting and beneficial. This story has much deeper meaning than what is just portrayed by Scarlet Johansson's fast-moving actions. Yes, it is a lot about our human essence. Movie creators developed plot and story around CPH4 drug which is secreted in pregnant women after the six weeks of their pregnancy. It helps fetus or baby in the womb (choose what you like) to develop. What if at that time our soul just sneaks into our body as a gift to our being from our God or Source (again, choose which one you like or believe in)? The drug in massive amounts in movie was synthetized enabling our mind to accelerate the capacity of our brain from average 20 percent all the way up to 100, as professor in the movie played by Morgan Freeman wonderfully explains could be possible. No word about how CPH4 was made, and I personally think that anything like that might not ever happen. But yes, our cells are individual beings, and we have a potential to manipulate them and everything around us. We can know everything thanks to that wonderful gift received when six weeks old. We have to cherish that and understand that rising to such ultimate level is possible only through dedicated effort and unlimited love. We can then assert that we are God-like as Peter Russel writes in his book From Science to God. And then when we know everything (or everything we need to know) we perhaps do not need to exist here anymore, even we still continue. We wish to be back in our Source, our God Ultimate Creator and it is much easier to leave this world. Then nobody will deceive, condition and manipulate you again.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly smart and enjoyable for a relatively dumb plot. Johansson is stellar.,"How do you like your action movies? Straight-up and balls-out, no brains required? Or something a wee bit more thoughtful, even if the philosophy being peddled is wacky science and hardly substantiated by scientific inquiry? Either way, oddly enough, you should be quite pleased with LUCY, which is a ridiculously fun - if occasionally outrageously silly - action movie, spiced up along the way with some unexpectedly deep ideas about the value of life and love.Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an exchange student in Taiwan, is a perfectly ordinary girl with perfectly ordinary concerns. (Leaving aside the fact that she looks like Scarlett Johansson, that is.) Sent into the maw of an international drug syndicate by her skeevy new boyfriend, Lucy is forced to become a drug mule. A brand new experimental drug is sewn into her stomach for transport back to America. But no one expects the bag to be roughly kicked apart, or for the hyper-dangerous drug to sink deep into Lucy's bloodstream. Within minutes, she finds that any previous limitations on her mind and body are rapidly being unlocked - which greatly facilitates her quest for vengeance and, perhaps, something more.Make no mistake, this is science-fiction of the first order; if you're looking for science-fact, you've definitely come to the wrong place. The notion that humans use only 10% of their brain power has been debunked by scientists but remains stubbornly entrenched as an urban myth. Writer-director Luc Besson relies heavily upon it - and the sonorous, credibility-lending tones of Morgan Freeman as a professor expounding on said theory - for the progression of his story, as Lucy acquires new, terrifying abilities each time she gains access to another portion of her brain. It makes for some quite thrilling, hyper-kinetic scenes, as Lucy moves from manipulating gravity to changing her appearance in a split second. Besson even manages to explore a few weightier ideas tied up with identity: as Lucy's consciousness expands, so too does her understanding of the inter-connectedness of the world around her, and she begins to slip away as an individual.But Besson does falter along the way - he takes his frankly silly concept so seriously at times that it's hard not to laugh at what he's tossing up on screen. Lucy meets the first primate - a female named Lucy. She gains a soul-changing comprehension of the universe and is nevertheless bent on avenging herself against Mr. Jang (Oldboy's Choi Min-Sik), the brutal head of the drug cartel. LUCY - and Lucy's - final scenes manage to be eerie and ridiculous at the same time.Fortunately for Besson, Johansson anchors the entire film - even at its flightiest - with a steely humanity that proves absolutely essential in her more dramatic moments. It's sometimes hard to follow the logic of the character (surely Lucy should become more pacifist and less wantonly violent as she gains knowledge?!), but Johansson will make you care anyway. She delivers most of her dialogue with a stony, impassive face, yet somehow allows the great pain and fear Lucy experiences, at least at the beginning, to spill through the cracks of her character. Her few moments of human connection with people who mattered greatly to her in the past - her mother, her room-mate - give this action film more emotional ballast than you'd expect.LUCY is not, ultimately, Besson's best film - he might well have made that twenty years ago, with The Professional. But it's certainly a nice change of pace and relative quality from the forgettable films he's been overseeing for years - everything from the Transporter and Taken franchises, through to the awkward We're A Nice Normal Family. Smarter than you'd expect, though quite silly as well, there's plenty to enjoy in this high-octane, heart-racing, brain-busting blend of action, emotion, and pop philosophy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bourne + The Matrix + a healthy dose of likable insanity,"""Lucy"" is nothing at all like I'd expected - that is, your usual Luc Besson schlock. But he is seriously tripping balls with this one. All because of a drug o.d., Scarlett Johansson begins to open her mind far beyond our known capacity; which means she's just full-on superhero. And the first half of this is a tightly-paced bundle of energy. IT is pure comic book and a lot of fun. I'm actually surprised it isn't Japanese (""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Akira"" jump to mind).The second half is where it loses step, explaining the nutballs plot and trying to make a statement on man's power list. Scarlett manipulates space and time like Neo and it loses its winning personality. For me, this movie boils right down to its lead. She is perfect; and I wonder how good this would've turned out with a lesser actor. Casting makes up for an awful lot in the writing department here.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When a director only use 10% of its potential ...,"From the start, the concept around which the story of the movie goes is a wacky myth from the 19th century. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_brain_mythI had the impression of watching the childish fantasy of a guy who really wants to believe that the brain can contain an infinite potential, and justifies his theory in the film by making allusions to Darwin to get credibility.

"The fourth strong sci-fi this summer (Snowpiercer, Dawn of The Planet of the Apes, I Origins are the other 3)","""That's your best friend and your worst enemy - your own brain."" Fred DurstLucy is a summer surprise—a sci-fi with brains and humor directed by Luc Besson, whose talents I first spied in the strong woman flick, la Femme Nikita. The titular heroine, played by Scarlett Johansson (carrying on from her other intriguing sci-fi this year, Under the Skin), begins as a hapless woman caught in a drug deal, whose drug she is forced to carry as a mule. Spillage gives her brain powers undreamed of.This drug increases her brain function incrementally until she finally uses all of it. At stages higher than the usual human 10% or so usage, she has insights and telekinetic abilities that neutralize tough guys and engage intellectuals, mainly Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who has been theorizing about the brain's potential for years. The reality of the increased brain usage in Lucy is almost more than he or the world can bear. The super power action could remind audiences of The Matrix's arcane philosophy and action.Besson deftly plays between violence and humor, the opening sequence the most hilarious when the bad guys corral Lucy, who begins to feel her power and uses it on the Asian thugs, who scarcely can believe this white woman tornado. Intercutting between Lucy's slowly realizing her accelerating brain functions and Professor Norman's lectures on the brain's underused capacity, Besson keeps the film moving at thriller pace while educating the audience on the potential of underused intelligence.As usually happens in most thrillers, but not always sci-fi's, chases are too abundant, either in cars or on foot. The car chase where Lucy drives through Paris is unusually creative, more keystone Cops than James Bond, but ingenious enough for me to mention action I usually ignore in reviews.In the end, it's not the guns or the beautiful Johansson that interests me; it's the philosophical contrast between our need to love and our thirst for more knowledge and experience. After all, that knowledge compromised Adam and Eve, and by extension all of us, and Lucy's increasing wisdom would seem to put us in a similar danger.""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,"" as the saying goes, but what about too much?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"While it is never quite able to make its silly premise work, ""Lucy"" is still breathlessly action-packed, creative and fun.","Sometimes a film can be forgiven for a shoddy, silly script if everything else works. Sub-par writing isn't always a death sentence. If there are good performances, solid direction, interesting effects and decent production values, audiences may be able to forgive story lines and characters that just don't quite work.And I think ""Lucy"" is a good example of that.It's storyline is a bit messy. It's based on a false myth that has been scientifically disproved. The characters are fairly stock and even boring. And outside of the titular ""Lucy"", you'd be hard-pressed to even remember anyone else's name.However, the direction is very strong. The effects are quite fascinating. There's some truly unique and creative uses of editing, music and cutaways that give the film identity. And the performances are incredibly strong. So honestly... I didn't mind the weak script, because despite it, the film was just too much fun for me to dislike.Scarlett Johansson stars as Lucy, a seemingly normal young woman who is inadvertently pulled into a desperate and bizarre situation after hesitantly agreeing to act as a one-time ""drug mule"" for money. Suddenly captured by the ruthless Mr. Jang (the incredible Choi Min-sik, best known for the Korean version of ""Oldboy""), she is forced to accept a new job smuggling an experimental synthetic drug surgically implanted in her body. However, the bag containing the drugs within her is accidentally ruptured, lacing her entire body with copious amounts of ""CPH4""- the synthetic drug which begins to rapidly advance her body physically and mentally, allowing her access to the previously unused parts of her brain. Suddenly granted increasingly super-human abilities, including telepathy, telekinesis and other powers, she decides to seek vengeance against Jang and seek the help of a scientist (Morgan Freeman) who may hold the key to helping her control her new powers before they tear her apart.The performances and production are what really saves the film here. Scarlett Johansson excels as Lucy, giving a performance that, while not perfect, really shows growth as her character ""evolves"" and transcends ""normal humanity."" She's perfect for the role and is able to garner a lot of sympathy, empathy and support from the audience. Choi Min-sik is perfect as the ruthless villain. He's a bit one-dimensional, but you can tell he's having a blast just being pure, unadulterated scum. From his casual ""been there, done that"" attitude towards violence, to some amusing moments where he loses patience with other characters during the bizarre scenarios presented, Min-sik is absolutely watchable and compelling. And supporting roles by the likes of Morgan Freeman are all admirably played. (But seriously... it's Morgan Freeman... when has he ever given a performance less than stunning?)Luc Besson's visual direction is grand. As per usual with his films. No matter what content, Besson always brings vast scope, character and energy to the visuals of his films. And this is no different. He excels and elevates the material. He also makes a fascinating choice of using consistent cut-away shots of footage (both stock and new footage made exclusively for the film), often in most scenes, to emphasize things like mood, character and emotion. (Ex. some scenes may feature cutaways to wildlife, animals hunting, volcanoes erupting, etc.) It does almost feel cheap at first (I thought it was just padding to extend the running length), but as time went on, I realized that it was a fairly carefully planned stylistic choice, and I actually really got into it.The visual effects are quite spell-binding. And they also help to elevate the material. While it is obvious what is CG and what is practical, the computer-generated imagery is quite unique in its design, and the way it emphasizes the changes happening to Lucy. While they may not be photo-realistic, they are just darned cool on their own.As I said above, the script is the only real problem. Because it doesn't quite work. But the wonderful performances, great direction, cool effects and other very competent facets of the production are able to make up for it. It's a very watchable, enjoyable film. And that definitely counts for something.I give ""Lucy"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth checking out for fans of action (and even of Sci-Fi) at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

How can people say this is brilliant?,"Throughout watching Lucy, I face-palmed so many times that my forehead turned red. I started counting the the money I spent to buy this DVD in cents so that I too, can plug into another dimension and forget I ever bought it. The movie is based on the most wide-spread urban legend since the Loch-Ness monster. The fact that 100% of your brain is used (maybe not the director's) is the most classic example of debunking scientific misconception and I am surprised that there are still quite a few thousand people who still believe it. I pushed myself to watch it because I thought that it would be a ""Limitless"" copy but it turned out to be a lot less than that.Defying the basic rules of the universe is a job for a superhero, and I tried to see this like watching another superhero movie. But the problem is that even superheros have a special ability that arises from exploiting unknown scientific concepts. Whether it is a humanoid for another planet, or a chemical reaction to an uncharted material, or even a smart-eccentric millionaire geek. All of the above have an unreasonable, yet a quite far fetched ""believability"" because they are based on facts you DON'T KNOW. Not on the De'facto KNOW it's not true. Even so, to be able to show a character defy the very laws of nature, there must, in my opinion, be some sort of a far fetched explanation, exploiting the unknown variable.They might as well replace Scarlet with a talking CGI tree and remake the whole movie.

Unusual, violent, fun, exciting, illogical, fascinating and just plain interesting without a moment of boredom in this very well directed short, tight sci-fi thriller from Luc Besson. Though the lead role sometimes requires nothing other than a blank stare, but Scarlett Johansson pulls it off with panache. Everyone else in this is secondary even Morgan Freeman who plays, well, Morgan Freeman. Egyptian actor Amr Waked is strong as first her foe and then her sort of comrade in this wild story of an innocent woman who has a drug enter her system that causes her mind's ability to expand beyond our wildest dreams or any real logic. This is all ridiculous, but where it takes us is quite a trip. This is a terrific sci-fi action thriller with a visual treat of an ending. Watch the end credits.

A good entertainer,"I would rate this movie a 7,first of all the good aspects..a entertaining movie throughout...you cant take your eyes of the screen the graphics and everything is spectacular..I like the science part of info in the movie even though some informations were controversial.But it is worth a watch.I will say the movie ended too fast but yes,you'll enjoy it if you have a interest in science fiction.P.S:The 10 percent of brain myth is the widely perpetuated urban myth that most or all humans only make use of 10 percent of their brains.I think this ain't true because this means if 90% of our brain was removed we would still be fine?Nope I don't think so.It is kinda sad that this movie had to propagate the myth but if you are a believer of the myth then yes,You will surely love the movie even the others will.The actors have done an amazing job with a incredible story line.So thumbs up.A good entertainer.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An epically shameless nonsense,"What if i told you, in a subtle but persuasive manner, that if you had a third leg you could shoot it like a blaster?

Braindead popcorn entertainment,"Maybe it's ironic that to enjoy a film about using 100% of your brain capacity you best turn it almost completely off. Johansson plays a woman who gets forced to smuggle a kilo of CPH4 (a new drug) in her stomach, but it rips open and she gets a overdose which gives her the ability to gradually use more of her brain capacity. It all sounds plausible up to here but then it goes completely of the rails. I won't mention the things she can do with her mind in this film, but let's just say that they are not very realistic or scientifically sound. It's all just very silly and ridiculous and you have to just go with it. The film was very successful in the cinemas, my guess is because it's a very international film. There are Americans, Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, Koreans and China-men in it. Everybody likes to see themselves in a movie right? The film most resembles a scifi version of the Transporter films which Besson also produced. You could say Chris Nolan makes Scifi with a capital S and Besson scifi with a small s.

"The overall film was very precise and well organized. Without a doubt, action-thriller fans will be overwhelmed with Besson's latest effort.","Jackson, Courtney N. October 09, 2015 Expository Writing Mrs. Smith Lucy Synopsis: Scarlett Johansson, who plays the brave role of Lucy, is deceived by a guy who she thought was a ""friend"" into carrying a briefcase to a supposed business contact. The once care free student is captured by a gang of men with all of the wrong intentions. After being exposed to a new European synthetic drug, Lucy develops superhuman abilities; which, causes her to seek help from neurologist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who she hopes can and will help her. Review:The movie Lucy is an exhilarating, action packed thriller that will have you on edge every step of the way. Very similar to the film Limitless, director Luc Besson with an excellent choice of casting and meticulously detailed imagery depicts the first person to access full cerebral capacity . With Scarlett Johansson cast as the main character Lucy is portrayed as a brave, fearless, and sharp minded individual. She was placed in a tough situation, and she follows her instincts in attempt to reach safety and potentially save her own life. As you get further in the movie more extreme things began to happen and more mishap's are stirred up.Ten minutes after the movie has started, action has already taken place. At a midnight club outside of New York City, Lucy meets Richard (Pilou Asbaek) who she dates only for about a week up until the day of his death. One evening Richard tries to lure Lucy into entering a hotel by herself and supposedly delivering a briefcase to a man she'd never met by the name of Mr. Jang. But Lucy's isn't going along with the plan, so Richard quickly handcuffs the case onto her wrist forcing Lucy to complete the mission. The way she handled herself allowed viewers to get an inside look at Lucy's demeanor before the whole disaster. Once Mr. Jang comes down to ""receive his package"" a spark was lit and more action took place. Mr. Jang's thugs abducted Lucy and shot Richard dead on the sidewalk in front of the hotel they were at.Although false, the combination of philosophy and scientific theory Besson delivers viewers to ponder is remarkable. These mind stimulating ideas brought additional excitement to the film! That wasn't it though, it seemed like the more Cph4 that dispensed into Lucy's internal organs the more levels of her brain she'd unlock.Besson manages to use a lot of vivid and colorful imagery of the synthetic drug that was inside of Lucy's body. When she'd reach new levels, you could see the colorful medicine rushing through her veins fast and with really cool illuminations. This keeps the audience's attention. The aggressiveness shown by Lucy was acted on not only for revenge, but also for the safety of the drugs being exposed to the world. In hopes of storing all of the information and knowledge the drugs allowed her to and passing it on from generation to generation, Lucy's entire mission to obtain the drugs, inject them, and use 100% of her cerebral capacity wasn't an easy one. With the help of Professor Norman and his colleagues, Lucy is monitored as she absorbs all of this information through matter.His choice to parallel Lucy's story with nature and evolutionary biology makes sense and was very unique. I would definitely recommend this movie to any one who enjoys action/sci-fi drama related genres.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't do drugs,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Lucy"" (2014) isn't as sophisticated as it might seem after seeing it, basically, it's action flick with some big speeches about existence, time, space, gravity etc. And although it's a bit refreshing to have these things in action movie, they don't use them very deep - it's more of a style then actual meaning or plot devise. First part of ""Lucy"" was fun, the second one for me - not so much, because when they have moved to ""Transcendence"" territory it wasn't so much fun because i never buy it as serious stuff. ""Lucy"" isn't sci-fi gem, it's simply action movie with some unusual writing - that's it.Overall, ""Lucy"" isn't your typical action flick, because it has some sci-fi (more ""fi"" then sci) stuff in action movie that you kinda won't see coming. It doesn't have big ideas, it only has big speeches about ides and it's a bit unique to hear them in seemingly typical action flick, which at the end is just an action flick. Not a bad one for one viewing if you ask me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tries To Be Smart but Embarrassingly Fails,"Scarlett Johansson has been on quite the roll as an action star as of late, bouncing back and forth between her more expensive (Marvel) projects and more peculiar and experimental ones. Though Lucy might appear to be the former—a clichéd, loud extravaganza of mindless, fun action—from the trailers and the like, the truth is that it (somewhat) belongs to the category of the latter. A Taiwanese mob implants a mysterious drug called CPH4 into her stomach, and very soon, she discovers that access to her cerebral capacity has surpassed that of the normal human being. Apparently, that means that she can now wield ridiculous superpowers that allow her to tap into people's memories and extract any bit of information from whatever object/individual that existed within. It also means that she can levitate anything and anyone, as well as teleport to any location she so wishes.Right from the get-go, you'll have to get used to the fact that the premise is incredibly unbelievable; the plot will get even more outlandish as it progresses, and don't worry: the movie will warn you with a continually increasing percentage (indicating just how much of the brain she can now utilize) every time events are about to become even more preposterously implausible. Once you get past the utter lack of realism and plethora of plot holes, what you experience is pretty badass. It's heavily stylized with its sci-fi components—it honestly reminded me of something like The Matrix, especially when considering the more twisted acts of violence. Complemented by beautiful cinematography (lavished with appealing colors and futuristic characteristics), this film is a blast—a lightning pace and intriguing set-up.Everything, aside from the ending, offers an abundance of thrilling amusement, and part of it obviously is due to Johansson's fierce presence. Even though Marvel Studios' rendition of Black Widow is softer and more forgiving, Lucy can be ruthless and calculating just like the original Marvel comics portrayed the Russian spy, Black Widow, as. However, eventually, the narrative takes a turn for the insane as convolution and far-fetched absurdity floods the plot and the sheer power Lucy truly holds furthers into the realm of sheer impossibility. The focus on high-octane, compulsive action is therefore abandoned and substituted with a confusing climax that only makes you wonder about what the hell this film which started out with a gripping basis has transformed into.So yes, the tale's unraveling heightens in ludicrousness, but at least, it's entertaining and cool. On the other hand, when it comes to the film's attempt to assess the themes and depth to which the idea of an increase in cerebral capacity goes, the arguable failure of this project certainly arises. First of all, this story is centered around a myth (humans only use 10% of their brains) that's already been debunked by guffawing scientists, creating irritation in the viewer as they continue to roll their eyes at the filmmakers' ignorance and clear unwillingness to properly research the subject. Secondly, as I've pointed out, this increase in intelligence—the ability to use more of your mind—does not mean that you'll suddenly turn into some terribly powerful superhero.If Besson didn't concentrate on producing a Limitless rip-off and simply decided to produce an absorbing sci-fi action film instead, Lucy wouldn't have been as annoying of a film, but if we're incorporating serious topics that beg the audience to recognize intellect in the project, don't expect to hold that compelled audience when you begin betraying realism and truth (of the topic). At the end of the day, Lucy is mostly fun, but it's ironically stupid fun as much as it tries to be smart fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Movie Of 2014,"Well all I can say about this movie is it impressed me to no end, Luc Besson pulled it off yet again with a likable anti-hero type that despite all forces working against her well, I won't spoil it but Scarlett Jo did a wonderful job portraying this character.Only hitch I found were the 'bad guys' that were annoying and I only partially understand why they were a continued threat; some other plot device could have been used to drive the story (CIA, FBI, NASA, NSA, CSIS - anything really) - something that would really give governments a cause for concern is someone with powers such as Scarlet Johansson obviously had so except for the stereotyped mafia types chasing throughout the movie everything else was strong.I really enjoyed the philosophical moments, a quiet moment early on when Lucy calls a loved one - the technologies that were displayed, the visuals, the music and score.I really think this was a strong effort and well, we'll have to see if this becomes a Trilogy.I gave this movie a 9/10, if more attention had been paid to the broader scope someone like Lucy would pose a threat to world governments and ALL forces would therefore make efforts against her I think that would have set the stage for some really fantastic stand-offs. What we got was OK, but not great as it was a bit too simplistic for what was happening in other parts of the movie near the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A movie about brains, with none.","Wow! I watched this a week ago and I'm still livid with myself.Luc Besson does a great job in overstating every aspect of this movie - be it through cutaways to stock footage to re-illustrate what's going on, or employing Morgan Freeman to verbally explain the plot as it happens. Subtext clearly a hindrance for cinema-goers, Besson leaves no stone unturned as he dazzles us with shots of animals hunting prey to tell us something bad is about to happen, title cards to inform us what percentage of Lucy's brain she's using, Lucy's voice-over, or indeed, Morgan Freeman's voice-over - which is cleverly disguised as his character's dialogue.Hopefully they'll someday release an interactive version, which will show the movie's viewers what percentage of THEIR brain they're using, and administer a dose of tranquilisers any time it ventures above zero.For a movie that wants to explore the impossible, all it really explores are a bunch of hackneyed action B-movie plot devices - which is fine if you're thirteen years old - otherwise, I'd steer clear.

Johansson Rocks in this visually spectacular film !!,"I was never a Luc Besson fan. However, he is a director who made some visually breath taking films such as The Fifth Element and Leon. If you think Lucy is an action film then beware its more of a sci-fi film with heavy scenes.Lucy starts off well. Its slow initially and as I watched the film, it got a creepy feeling in me. But when Lucy starts harnessing her brain as the trailer shows, Besson makes it a visual spectacle. His interpretation of the subject is brilliant and he uses less of CGI to show his mastery. I loved the scene where Lucy goes to meet Mr.Jang. Jang is listening to opera and Lucy is killing his men.Even the character of Lucy is interesting. Once she begins harnessing her brain, she becomes into a superhuman with some extraordinary powers but never a superhero. She is somebody seeking answers and not interested in providing solutions.And, that brings me to Scarlett Johansson. I think no actress would bring justice to Lucy's character what she does. She is brilliant in each scene; 1st as the victim and then as a person seeking answers. There are two scenes that stand out; one where is speaking to her mother and the other in the plane where she gets an attack.The rest of the cast does well. Freeman is sidelined in this film by Johansson while Choi is superb as the Korean drug lord.What doesn't work in Lucy is the last 15 mins. It left me confused and there was too much to think and absorb. Also, there is a some unnecessary blood shed.If you forget the last 15 mins and don't think much about the plot and scientific reasoning, then Lucy is must watch for sci-fi lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""I feel everything"" well I certainly felt douche chills","Luc Besson has continuously disappointed me, it's almost simplistic how he develops his female protagonists, an terrible or tragic event sets up the revenge, and use a plot device so she becomes a trained killer. I try not to compare this movie to Luc Besson's earlier work, as it makes him seem to repetitive, and he is a good film maker, although it's hard to call his work purely original when the influences are so obvious. I would compare this film to Transcendence, and in comparison, this film has better ideas, however the execution of Wally Pfister was much better considering he worked with Christopher Nolan and Lucy feels like it was made by someone trying to be Christopher Nolan. There are things which Luc Besson does in this film, which are extremely French for a mainstream movie, and certain aspects don't feel right, mainly the percentages which display periodically throughout the film. If Wally Pfister and Luc Besson switched movies, Lucy would've looked the way Luc Besson wanted it to, and Transcendence would have been interesting, with cheesy dialogue which only a Frenchmen would write.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
TOO much Fiction even for a science-fiction!,"'Lucy' is at best a stylish fast paced thriller, well made and brilliantly led by Scarlett Johannson. At worst it is an over the top movie based on a single concept that runs out of ideas and falls down. The truth of this movie is somewhere in between. Lucy has a great opening, with a woman forced to transport a rare drug in her stomach by the menacing Min-sik Choi 'Oldboy'. What happens after that is quite amazing however the plot is too short for a feature length movie so the last half an hour seems to lose track of anything remotely feasible and this spoils the whole feel of the movie. Its a shame really because for the most part this film is a good thriller but even sci-fi films have to remain convincing to be effective, no-one expects a realistic movie with science fiction but it needs to be intelligent. 'Lucy' lost focus and descended into something quite absurd, despite this however it's a decent ride with the stellar cast in brilliant form.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Gruesome and Torrid Pace that Falls Flat,"This movie has a lot of movement for most of the story. But suddenly, the end just falls flat. It doesn't totally, but the ending in no way measures up to how you got there.Scarlett/Lucy is a nobody in Taiwan with a loser boyfriend. She gets involved in this drug deal and next thing you know, the ride begins. This movie is ultra-fast paced, and seems to accelerate as Lucy's powers expand. There is a lot of blood and violence here, so be warned. The story is good, it keeps you guessing where this is going. The French policeman, Del Rio, is superb - he knows how to act, and how to let Lucy do her thing. Morgan Freeman plays the wise professor who is somewhat shocked to see his theories live before his eyes.There is a lot of killing and somewhat over the top bloodletting. Many chase scenes too, one of the best taking place in downtown Paris. Scarlett Johansson is terrific as Lucy. She has this look of, well, you don't know what I'm going to do next, but I know I'm capable of doing whatever I want. Kind of reminds me a bit of Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill series, without the swords.However, you are ramped up to reach the end, and then, splat. It falls flat. You could hear the audience sigh....that's it?? Yep, that's it. At 90 mins start to end, that's at least a tidy pace. But I think Besson could have taken the last 15 mins, shortened it to 5, and spent that extra time adding a bit more depth. Leaving a movie at the end with a --that's it?-- feeling is deflating.I still give it a 7/10 because for 95 percent of your time, you are glued to you seat.

Bulging with excess and pseudo-science and effects...all in good fun,"Lucy (2014)If you take the contents of this movie seriously you are very open minded—because the ""science"" here is total fantasy. It's science fiction in an ungrounded, wing-it kind of liberation. That's why some reviewers hated it (see the one in The Atlantic via Rotten Tomatoes). And I hated that aspect, myself.But this is a completely cheerful kind of mindless movie on some other level. It's actually funny (laugh out loud funny) in many parts, if you're paying attention (the most obvious is when the American Indians are shown). There are wry comments and a kind of chipper exaggeration throughout that make it all kind of bright, even when crazy and deadly things are happening.There is also the kind of action-adventure pace, with lots of moving camera (some of it really good) and lots of fast edits (without resorting to montage). There is also plenty of computer graphic excess, and sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just self- indulgent and almost boring.Scarlett Johansson holds it all together well, playing the emotionless type of character she just played in last year's ""Under the Skin."" I like her! Morgan Freeman plays a scientist, a dull version of his Lucius Fox (from ""Batman""). The rest of the cast is there to prop up these two (and mostly Johansson, who is the title character), but it's worth noticing, I suppose, that there is the common Hollywood pandering to the huge Asian (Chinese) audience it hopes to seduce. There are lots and lots of Korean bad guys (all are men but one, a tattoo artist). And there is lots of shooting, both in Taiwan and in Paris, where the second half of the movie is set. (The movie is officially a French production, but is mostly in English.)The movie has pretensions, which is its biggest downfall. Instead of just being silly and fun (like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") it has big (empty) ideas to foist on us. The opening scenes of the movie set this up, a kind of fast motion ""2001"" beginning. (Director/writer Luc Besson admits this, sort of.) And the very last moment of the movie makes clear the concepts here are ""big.""

The plot is nice and catchy and the script is full of surprises and theories ... it is a full sci-fi indeed but with a little taste of Morgan Freeman's Wormhole added the element of ""could it really be !!"" question and let's be honest .. always hearing his voice narrating make me feel chill and concentrated in the same time :DAs for the cast , well..

"A thought-provoking, fun, entertaining sci-fi action film","First and foremost, Lucy isn't exactly the typical sci-fi action film that you would expect. The film shares many similarities with Limitless, Watchmen, The Matrix, The Tree of Life, Her and Transcendence. The film has a slightly misleading neuroscience premise that's based on the age-old, silly '10% of brain' myth that most humans use only 10% (or less) of their brain capacity. In actual fact, humans use nearly 100% of their brains in various ways...with many parts of our brain are not accessed consciously but rather subconsciously most of the time. However, humans never actually use 100% of their cerebral capacity consciously at the same time.The film is basically a story about a woman who is being forced to work as a drug mule manage to 'unlock' her entire brain capacity, consciously at the same time and gain exceedingly powerful physical and mental abilities after a packet of a newly-developed synthetic drug called ""CPH4"" breaks inside of her body. However, her body becomes highly unstable and starts to disintegrate due to the limitation of the human body and she needs more and more of the drug to sustain herself. The film asks thought-provoking 'what ifs' questions that are meaningful, provocative and worthy of our attention: What if the synaptic networks of our brain are so perfectly connected that we are capable of transmit more information at one time? What if we have access to all our motory functions, deepest memories and knowledge in fractions of a second? What if we are capable of using 100% of our cerebral capacity, consciously at the same time (all regions of the brain are pushed to the limits and we are able to control the subconscious regions of the brain)? Most importantly, what would happen if a person eventually gains complete control/mastery of elementary/subatomic particles that exist in the quantum realm?The film gives some rather clear answers that may seem absurd, nonsensical or silly to many, but some of them actually makes perfect sense if you think about it carefully. However, it is true to say that the film borrowed a few scientific principles (the basics of quantum mechanics and brain functions) and embellished them a bit for entertainment purposes. At first, the person acquires various enhanced physical and mental capabilities: perfect marksmanship, extreme agility, instantaneous reflexes, fast absorption of knowledge, immunity to pain and fear...and subsequently, telepathy, telekinesis, the ability to interpret/decipher/control various electromagnetic waves, atemporal and able to perceive time in a non-linear perspective, clairvoyance, quantum teleportation across space-time continuum and matter or energy manipulation.In short, the film is actually a mixture of facts and fiction. Some parts of the film do require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief from audiences as the writer/director has taken some creative liberties with its grand and rather ambitious sci-fi premise (Besson has admitted that this film is a lot more fiction than science). Although some of the main lead's abilities look downright silly and ludicrous, they're actually quite new and imaginative.While all facts are not necessarily 'true'; some fiction are not entirely lies either. Just that the 'world' around us behaves like so, we tend to perceive it like so. This doesn't mean that in other parts of the Universe, the same rules apply. While some people might find it hard to understand, all things, including living beings, consist of matter which has mass and each of them occupy a space-time dimension. We are bounded by the laws of motion and gravity. We are our own observer as time is relative while we're moving through space-time.Although the film's premise is not horrible or completely illogical, the execution is rather sloppy at places. The film shows the evolution of all living things on this planet by cutting in various shots of nature or Universe. Unfortunately, all these pieces just don't fit together nicely and seems rather out of place. There are numerous plot contrivances to allow characters to perform a certain action just to move the plot forward. There's no character development and backstory. The characters in the film don't have any significant emotional attachment to any other person on the screen.Despite its shortcomings in characterization and plot, Scarlett Johansson managed to pull out a great performance to carry the film. Her panic shaking as she cries and begs for her life when she meets Mr.Jang for the first time or even when she wakes up after heavy sedation feels real and truly gives the feeling that she's in peril. Later on, when she is able to access her deepest memories and cry profusely during the phone conversation with her mum, it clearly shows her character's vulnerability. But as Lucy rapidly evolves, her lack of expression shows that she is gradually losing her emotions and humanity. It shows that she has truly become transcendent and no longer has any petty human concerns. On the other hand, Choi Min-sik done a great job as the merciless, frightening Korean drug kingpin, Mr.Jang. His presence on screen shows that he's not the man you would want to mess with. Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman doesn't have much to do with his character other than delivering exposition for the audience to know more about the premise.In my opinion, this is by no means a terrible film, it's rather fast- paced, thought-provoking and entertaining. The purpose of science fiction is to seek answers for big important questions, to pique your interest or curiosity to further question, to find the truth and making sense of the world around us. This film succeeds in this aspect, despite its flaws. I believe that you'll appreciate this film more if you're willing to make an effort to take a step further to ponder and think, seek answers to extract the facts included in the film.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/08",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pile of rubbish fantasy film - still quite enjoyed it!,"UPDATE: Ed-Wood level bad film, don't see it.And they bucketed Limitless?? Limitless is an actual science-fiction film, and in my opinion an underrated one. Yes, they could have done a lot more with it, but at least it stayed just barely within the confines of possibility.Lucy, however, isn't science-fiction, it's pure fantasy. It's Harry Potter Goes Sexy Guns.But I still kinda enjoyed it.The 'science' in this thing is pure bunkum, so please don't go in expecting your brain to be massaged - I groaned all the way through it. Unfortunately I can't go into details without spoiling, but basically it's all wrong: incorrect, unfactual, mixed-with-pseudoscience, wrong.In some ways, it's a shame this tripe-fest got foisted on poor Scarlett - she is an underrated, actually very good actor, and this plot and its details were well beneath her abilities.But, as a ride, Lucy is quite enjoyable. It has no message, and no internal consistency, and it's based on a load of gobbledegook, but heck... at least it's not boring.The action is very actiony - the start, especially, is very gripping. (Though there are 'art' cut scenes in a very heavy-handed attempt at metaphor - oh my god, they just have to be ignored.) It promises you that it's going to be some kind of deep, techno-thriller... then it goes somewhere, er, 'else'.The CG is quite amazing, and for once it serves its purpose instead of boring you to into headache-dodging sleep like the (yawn) Matrix sequels.Grab the beer and the pizza and a bunch of friends, put it up on the big plasma, and turn your brain OFF - use 0% of it.Cheers!------",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Really good action, with a surprisingly thorough take on philosophy.","What a great action flick! Fun from start to finish, with exactly the right amount of pseude science woven into it. The take on meaning of life, existence, perfect knowledge is a fun one, and deep enough to convey a feeling of grandesse.Big shoutout to the amazing cast, ofc this feels utterly 'overcast', but I love all the big names in such a comparetively shallow script. Comparetively, because all in all it's a thoughtout, well done movie, that - just to set it into perspective - remains an action movie with sci-fi elements.Great watch!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very entertaining.,"Many reviewers here hate this movie because it does't make sense. They invoke the famous myth that we only use 10% of our brain and that does not make sense.I will not argue with the fact the we use 10%, 50% or 100% or our brain. My belief is that action movies serve one purpose: entertain. Does Superman or Thor make sense? Do people actually believe Iron man exist? Or that Rambo can kill thousands of soldiers without getting shot?Of course not! Then I wonder why we try so hard to apply logic in this movie. When I watch a science-fiction action movie, I don't care if it makes sense of not. It usually doesn't. Do I have fun watching it? Yes? Then it passes the test for me.Lucy is a fast ride (like all Luc Besson movies) and it serves its mission.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Looks Great, Less Filling","I'm a big fan of both writer/director Luc Besson (The Transporter and Taken series, among the lengthy action credentials he's racked up since La Femme Nikita) and his star, Scarlett Johansson. Alas, the two have collaborated on a movie that's truly cool and exciting until it descends into stupidity. Besson's directing significantly out-paces his writing in this one.The premise is familiar axiomatic science. Humans only use about 10% of our brain capacity, leaving zillions of neural pathways, with all their unknown potential capabilities, in storage. What if we could use more, or even all of it? What information and collective memories might we access? What physical and mental powers might emerge - perhaps ranging somewhere between superhero and deity? Those prospects are particularly relevant, since Johansson has played the former, and co-star Morgan Freeman the latter in better movies.Johansson's character is a college student dating the wrong guy in Taipei. Gangsters force her into serving as a mule for a new designer drug they'll sell in Europe. When the package they plant in her belly bursts, it expands her mind to the max. Payback and other deployments of these enhancements before the drug overwhelms her drive the plot and its hectic pace. Several sequences show Besson at his best, including one in which Johansson drives through Paris like another Jason Statham.As to the rest, there are two possibilities. Either Besson didn't know how to get his cast out of the situation he created, settling for a jumble of splashy, acid-trip array of computer effects that fail to sync with his title character. Or the upper limit of my 10% is so far below his that I've missed the point and should have given this a higher rating. If you go, the call is yours.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Really absurd plot with more holes than a sieve,"Well after 10 minutes I could see that this was going to be a really stupid film, and boy was I right. The plot was just terrible and just about all the characters did stupid things that beggared belief, which in turn made me not care one iota about any of them. There is a quite a lot of action in the film, but the majority of it was quite frankly pointless and you were constantly left asking yourself why did they do that, or who the hell would do that. You really have to ask why the so called A-list actors would read a script like this and say ""sign me up for that"", of course only one reason, money, and my god they must have being payed a lot to put there name to this film. The only decent thing about the film was the CGI, which was quite good, but again it was not really placed that well in the movie, in fact it made the movie even more confusing if anything. If you want to watch this film, then wait for it to come on TV is my advice.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The more ""Lucy"" stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSEarlier this week I updated my daily attire with new glasses. ""Lucy"" is the first movie I saw since the transition between spectacles. Not only did I feel as if I was watching a movie with new eyes, but the film showed me something that I have never seen before. The undeniable fact of ""Lucy"" is its ingenuity, but be warned, it is a polarizing experience.Though I hardly find it as trend-setting as some suggest, feminism is embedded deeper within the film than the drugs are planted in Lucy's stomach. The explicit female empowerment almost becomes cheeky satire, such as when Lucy's love interest addresses his expendable nature in the plot, but her response insinuates the best use of his existence is to kiss her while she fights the bad guys. (Women Studies professors across the country will be giddy after seeing ""Lucy"".) It's incorrect to pretend as if females have not led science fiction/genre films before, especially films that acquired a lucrative gross at the box office. Though Johnasson's Lucy is only a descendant of people like Ellen Ripley, this film's success could turn the tide away from the frequency of male dominated action thrillers.The first twenty-five minutes of ""Lucy"" are unbearable. The film's opening moments begin with calm images over Johansson's voice, whispering ideas emblematic of evolution, but that lasts for only moments. The story plunges its viewer into an obnoxiously directed, jarringly edited, and bombastically scored chaos. It would be acceptable if someone were to walk out of ""Lucy"" during its introductory scenes, even if they would miss the fun surprises to be had later in the film. During the crucial, plot-setting scene, Director Luc Besson interweaves shots of a cheetah killing its prey into the sequence, a pompous move that sinks ""Lucy"" to its lowest point. It's almost as if Besson was testing his audience through endurance experiments during the first 25 minutes, before getting to a film that wasn't actually that bad.The quality transition from act one to act two and three is one of the most drastic in recent memory. ""Lucy"" began as a discomforting experience, but something happens after the dust settles from the storm of act one. The material is given the space it needs to breathe, Besson takes his dead weight foot off the gas pedal, and ""Lucy"" begins to fly. In the second two thirds of the film, the tone is infused with real emotion, campy fun, and soothing tranquility. Besson relinquishes his domineering approach seen in the earlier scenes and lets the erroneous ideas speak for themselves. The film concludes with a sensational montage that exposes the radical ambition behind ""Lucy"".For however disproportionate the film itself becomes, the one constant is Scarlett Johansson's drilling performance. Johansson can add ""Lucy"" to her string of hits recently because in this role she shows emotion in the most melodramatic ways I've ever seen from her as an actress. In addition, she builds a grounded, cold state of omnipotence in later scenes of the film, creating a nice emotional range within the movie and the character.""Lucy"" has ideal pacing and storytelling methods, clocking in its running time at 89 minutes. Sure, the introduction was a bit disorienting in its eagerness to jump immediately into the rising action, but that's a forgettable flaw once the running time minutes begin to rack up. It comes and goes swiftly and pragmatically, and maybe that's something future films should try to emulate, in addition to the female dominance. The more ""Lucy"" stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.* * * out of * * * *6.9/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Silly but entertaining sci-fantasy. 70+%,"Some of the movies that ""Lucy"" recalled for me included ""The matrix"", ""Videodrome"" (or other Cronenberg titles), ""2001: a space odyssey"" as well as, oddly, Aesop's fables (not a movie, but thematically). It's definitely a movie worth viewing but I don't think it really captures the imagination like the first ""The matrix"", for example, nor does it get as trippy as the end of ""2001"".The plot of the movie revolves around an American tourist - the titular character, played by Scarlett Johansson - who is duped into becoming a drug mule for a nasty Asian drug syndicate. Due to her being assaulted by one of the syndicate's goons, the drug is released into her body, giving her extraordinary powers. Lucy now has her chance to get revenge on the syndicate. On the level of a revenge movie, the movie also fails to deliver (as it did with its ""trippy"" aspect).The high concept of the movie is the premise of: what would happen if humans could use more than 10% of their brain? Lucy creeps closer to a figure of 100%, as the screen constantly reminds you. Now, I'm not sure where the figure of ""10%"" is pulled from, but I'll be so bold as to predict that someone attaining 100% brain capacity will...not in any way resemble Lucy's personification of this feat! In other words, her abilities are somewhat implausible and the movie comes across as more science fantasy than sci-fi. However, I do get the impression that the movie mixes actual science facts (or provisional facts, if you will), with just pure, escapist fantasy.Performance wise, I found Scarlett's representation early on (pre-drug effects) to be a bit ""Laverne & Shirley"" like...although I haven't actually seen that TV show...just brief clips. I.e. she seems sort of working class...Brooklyn (?). Like the movie, I didn't find that she created a sense of excitement for the concept. Morgan Freeman also plays a scientific expert. Again, his performance didn't really grab me. So, from my point of view, whilst Scarlett and Morgan being int he film helped to get it sold, I personally wouldn't have minded had the cast been complete unknowns. Morgan pretty much does what he's been doing for years in these kinds of roles...quietly oh so Morgan. I did enjoy the amusing performance of...- this site bills him as ""The limey""! - Julian Rhind-Tutt.The movie itself is jokey at times (as with ""The limey""), amusing, dark, violent and fantastic (as in hard to believe). At the start of my review, I mentioned ""Aesop's fables"". By that I mean that the frequent juxtaposition of shots of animals in the movie serve to provide a moral lesson for the bind that Lucy is about to find herself in. Some may be put off by this random juxtaposition of film.If I had any other issues with the logic of the movie, one might be the scene where Lucy meets her namesake. It made me think that perhaps the world that our Lucy lives in might have been changed by that meeting.Some interesting titbits from the end-credits:* Oddly, there is a ""Special thanks"" to Monsieur Hulot! Guessing that the director doesn't take these things all to seriously!* I enjoyed the music at the end of the movie...was unsure if it was one song or me. I particularly like the song that plays last in the end credits. I thought that that might have been by Blur's Damian Alburn (""Sister Rust""), but it turns out to have been by Roary, with a song called ""God's whisper"", which I'm not sure is even mentioned in the end credits. He's a new artist...not even on Wikipedia yet!As I say, it's an odd but interesting movie that is well worth seeing, but doesn't have a big pay off if you are after a 'straight' sci-fi movie, 'trip' movie or revenge movie. If you like screen violence/fighting/car chases etc., that's all there too. In fact, on reflection, the anti-climactic 'fight' scene with Lucy up against a bunch of syndicate goons is amusing for the way that it deflates boyish fantasies of revenge.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Action plus Sci-fi,"This is very good action and Sci-fi film. I am not a big fan of science fiction, but this movie is well done.Scarlett's acting is at its peak.

If you use more than 10% of your brain you can do wonders.The movie is fast-paced, and will keep you at the edge of the seat.

Pulp Sci-Fi,"Overall, Lucy is a few ideas for a sci-fi movie stitched together, so it lacks coherence and flow. However, it is enjoyable if you have nothing else to do for 90 mins.The film gets off to bad start with its premise. It is a complete myth that we only use 10% our brain. So its attempt to ground a matrix-style movie in reality falls at the first hurdle. Also, the premise was used in Limitless so the repetition is a bit tedious.Morgan Freeman's job seems purely to establish the bad premise and doddering around, not contributing to the story.People will argue over Johansson's performance over the course of the film but she does a good job with weak material.Some of the effects and stunts are very enjoyable.

The movie slowly swelled into heavy symbolism and incredible statements about getting past the animalistic nature of mankind, among other things.I cannot describe how hard the script hit me, and walking out of the movie theater was so surreal I had to sit down and think for a few moments. I'm not sure how others looking for an easy viewing would like it - I see this film as something you need to have an active mind for.Anyway, SJ's acting of course was beautiful, and the visual effects were breathtaking.

The ""science"" here is only a poor excuse. The scientific argumentation given by a very solemn Morgan Freeman is just laughable (""go from evolution to revolution"" wow...).

Great movie,"Lucy is a quickly paced movie. Much of the beauty is found intellectually, with a good mix of black comedy.I enjoyed this movie so much that I would pay to see it again!Besson is evolving just as much as Lucy evolves in this movie and you may even find it thought provoking. The movie probably require an audiences with certain level of scientific education or open mindedness in order to understand or appreciate what's going on In the story line Besson manages to successfully transform a drug heist movie onto a very good sci-fi thriller.Not for those who can't see outside the box, or are guided by a puritanical or religious culture",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Maybe, if Besson could be limited to directing","I've seen a few of Luc Besson's movies beforehand, mainly those where his obsession with the idea of the reluctant super heroine operating in a male dominated world is clearest. I liked Nikita, though I had some issues with the plot holes that in my mind come to signify Besson's writing. It was even more of a problem with the 5th Element, where pseudo philosophic babbling was added to the mix not to mention tons of pretentiousness. The truck on which Besson's obsession carries him is moving forward always advancing, unfortunately it doesn't advance into good movie making, it's simply gets more pretentious and more dependent on his pseudo philosophic babble. Besson has all the making of a good director. He has a very good visual perception, which he always translate well to the screen. He has a good eye for actors and even more so for actresses Anne Parillaud, Milla Jovovich and Natalie Portman owe him a lot, the last two launched their cinema career on his films. And all his talent as director is getting him into poorer and poorer results, because he insists on writing his own scripts. Many directors do it with remarkable outcome Luc Besson doesn't. He must have someone else beside him to tell him that things don't make sense, someone with an influence. It seems to me that he simply doesn't care about plot logic he might even think his ""philosophic"" bits are deep and meaningful - sorry it's not the case. It rings hollow and pretentious (I know I used this word before - no other word describes it better).And so, amazing performances by Scarlett Johansson, and Min-sik Choi, and some solid acting by Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked, on top of some brilliant action scenes and some real beautiful cinematography, are all getting wasted because by the end of the film the utter stupidity of it all covers everything else. What's supposed to be deep and thought provoking is so empty and ridiculous I found myself laughing a desperate bitter laugh instead of being excited or thrilled.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ridiculous,"In short- The movies starts off good and then it's all down hill from there. I didn't even bother wasting my time watching the last 10 or 15 minutes. It was just so ridiculous and absurd. I had no real knowledge of the movie before seeing it, which is the way I usually like it so I have no preconceived ideas. But as I said before, the more I watched, the more ridiculous the movie became and the less I liked it. It's the whole thing, it's Stupid with a capital S. There will be people who will enjoy the movie. Those who can accept the absurdity presented then it will probably be great. But for me some of the concepts presented in the movie were just something I couldn't get my mind around and accept. It became so weird towards the end I couldn't even bare to watch another second. My thumb hurriedly stumbled across the remote searching for the stop key with all the finesse of an elephant on ice skates in an attempt to end the absurdity as fast as was humanly possible.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could've Been Better!,"Love Scarlett Johnson? You have to watch this movie! The opening scene of how she's forced to deliver a package against her will isn't convincing enough. Also, after she evolves she going on a rampage on innocent people is uncalled for! Rather, she could have just focused on killing off the bad guys and moving further. Also, the scenes where she talks to the professor to discuss her powers ... while may be needed ... boring for the common man. However, it is just a movie with a fictional base, we can't look for logic. It is an interesting way to kill some time. If you are behind sci-fi movies, you might find this interesting. Some say this movie is based on an experiment ... could be or needn't be ... However, the ending was very simple and killed the thrilling ride!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Decent flick.,"The movie is quite amusing if you are into science fiction which this movie fulfills greatly. I hear a lot of people complaining about the science, but that's where the fiction comes in! I think we all know by now we don't use 10% of our brain (Or cerebral capacity if you want to get anal) and I think the people that made the movie also knew this. It's just a matter flicking a switch in your mind that in this reality, in this fictional film, this is true.The plot was quite simple and compact. Nothing too complicated and it was quite easy to follow. Not a great masterpiece with convoluted intertwined story lines or deep characters. Which made the movie better in my opinion. This shouldn't be your nail biting shoe squeaking adventure. It's good action and just regular old science fiction with a hint of slight sarcasm towards the science field. Somewhere I got the feeling that the main point of this story was that we as a species have become so full of ourselves that we think we know everything as fact.Scientists usually say they love to be proved wrong but mostly they love it more when they are right. Maybe the point of the movie was to show that we could be wrong about everything.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nonsense and Morgan Freeman.,"Firstly, let me just say that Under The Skin is already my film of the year, and I can't imagine anything changing that position with just a few months of 2014 left. I did not expect Lucy to be as magnificent as that of course, but I had hoped for some mildly entertaining sci-fi to pass a couple of hours at the cinema, alas however, this movie got under my skin alright, but for all the wrong reasons. Luc Beeson has been put firmly in his place by Mr Glazer. .We begin with some shots of a chimp (which looks absolutely terrible when compared with the Apes movie out at the moment), and Morgan Freeman spouting off pseudo-scientific garbage from a podium being well.......Morgan Freeman. Is it just me, or is anyone else sick and tired of seeing Freeman appear in movies as the ""knowledgeable old black man"" adding nothing to any film he's been in for years, and existing only as a piece of old mahogany furniture as if his mere presence gives a flick some validity? He's been typecast for at least a decade now and surely he must know how boring a character he's become? Honestly, you could take him out of any of the last 20 films he's made and place him in another and no one would notice the difference. What a yawn. I wish he would just call it a day and retire with his ample fortune. But anyway, back to Lucy. .Once Scarlets character has a package of drugs burst inside her she apparently gets the ability to use more of her brain (does anyone with even half a brain still believe this 10% nonsense? Obviously Beeson thinks someone does), and all of a sudden she acquires these superhuman abilities which even with some amazing drug effects are preposterous (yes we don't see all of the available light on the spectrum for example but that's a condition of our eyes' construction, not something a pill will fix). Then we have several intercut scenes of wildebeest roaming the plains (or was that Fawlty Towers?) and animals having sex, crashing oceans, and other ridiculous tosh that's supposed to underpin the daft plot. If I wasn't cringing at the dialogue that came out of Scarlets mouth I was laughing out loud at the scientific woo I was being force fed. I know it's a fact that America is low on scientific literacy but surely no one could swallow this nonsense? I mean really? It's been mentioned many times too that Lucy is a bit like Limitless, which I agree with slightly, but Limitless was fun and wasn't trying to take itself seriously, while the longer Lucy went on, the more ridiculously ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" it got. Exchanging one pseudo- scientific soundbite for another (sending me off down the proverbial rabbit hole). .By the end I felt mentally raped of my intelligence. Yes it's only a movie, but I know that somewhere out there people read into stuff like this creating ""alternative"" websites and Facebook memes that spread wacko rubbish all about (like we only use 10% of our brains). But maybe I'm wrong, because when I truthfully look back at my experience of watching Lucy, I get the sense that I was indeed only using 10% of my brain, or maybe that's all I was left with.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time to GROW UP,"""Lucy"" (2014) is about an average hot babe named Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi).It should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, ""Powder"" (1995) and ""Phenomenon"" (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while ""Powder"" reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's ""Youth Without Youth,"" a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include an entertaining story.""Lucy"" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Lucy"" includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, ""Lucy"" is stylish and ""hip,"" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizzazz.Some complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality.What's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?)In regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow-motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.Less spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, ""I was thinking the exact same thing."" What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge."" Although they're exaggerated in the film, they're REAL.""Lucy"" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time ""partying"" and pursuing a ""cute guy with nice buns"" (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to ""All things in moderation""? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.My praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything?

We DON'T use only 10% of our brain!,"Luc Besson has made several films that have been called ""science fiction"" but which are actually fantasy, e.g., The Fifth Element: That was a delightful movie, but of course there is absolutely no way that the future portrayed in this film could actually happen. (If you disagree, you're in desperate need of a total reality transplant.)What's deceptive about ""Lucy"" is that it's packed with pseudoscientific claptrap that some gullible, impressionable boneheads might actually believe. The main one is that tired old saw that we only use 10% of our brains. As someone who knows better, I'm here to tell you that that is COMPLETE BALDERDASH (a euphemism in place of the word I really have in mind). Every animal with a brain, including humans, uses ALL OF ITS BRAIN, ALL OF THE TIME. Don't fall for that fictitious claim about using only 10% of our brains. Why would organisms waste the energy necessary to keep all of our brain running if we didn't need it? There's also a lot of biobabble about evolution in ""Lucy,"" and ALL of it is wrong. The film, with all the garbage spewed about ""evolution,"" ignores one of the fundamental principles of evolution: An organism's energy balance is tightly controlled. Everything that isn't needed is gotten rid of. That's why the great apes and we humans don't have tails. That's why when we evolved lungs, we got rid of gills. In fact, if you want to name organs that can be both partly or wholly utilized, it's the lungs and the muscles, NOT the brain. At rest, you use only part of your lung capacity. At rest, you use only part of your muscle capacity. But you ALWAYS use ALL of your brain capacity, because that's how the brain is designed. If we only needed 10% of our brains, our brains would be only 10% of their size.So if you want to enjoy ""Lucy"" as pure fantasy, go ahead. Just don't fall for the nonsensical pseudoscience. It's. ALL. Wrong.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Besson's latest concept actioner goes the abstract, philosophical route","For the last decade, Luc Besson has been among the most reliable producers, writers and directors making thrilling, mindless entertainment, which makes ""Lucy,"" a film about a woman accessing 100 percent of her brain capacity, somewhat ironic. In all seriousness, however, ""Lucy"" is a departure from the filmmaker's gritty, revenge-driven track record of late, though not necessarily a noticeable improvement.Like most of Besson's films, ""Lucy"" is a straightforward, concept-driven action movie: Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American in Taiwan, gets kidnapped by a wealthy organized crime boss (Min-sik Choi, of ""Oldboy"" fame) who stuffs a package of a new synthetic drug in her body for smuggling purposes, but the plan takes a turn when the package ruptures and Lucy begins experiencing its mind-enhancing effects. Consuming knowledge and experience cell growth at an unprecedented rate, she seeks to turn the tables on her captors.But while ""Lucy"" is a pretty clear-cut concept, the plot is rather messy. As Lucy begins to unlock more and more of her brain and power, she understandably becomes more than just revenge- driven and becomes obsessed with sharing her knowledge with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). The script ends up being 50 percent philosophical and theory-based, and it seems Besson is more fascinated with this idea of humans accessing their full brain capacity and what we would learn about our existence than he is with crafting a compelling story.What results is a film that talks an interesting and intelligent game but plays out in somewhat dumb fashion. In other words, ""Lucy"" is easily the most thought-provoking film Besson has made in the last 10 years at least, but it ranks behind many of those recent films in terms of being a compelling watch. Eventually, the concept of what's happening to Lucy's brain flies off the handle and we can no longer understand the science or theory behind it. The movie gets abstract and flat-out trippy in a way we haven't seen from Besson since ""The Fifth Element."" At times you have to wonder if he was watching too much Terrence Malick when he made this one.Johansson, of course, makes for an eternally watchable leading lady. Even when Besson injects a few emotion-driven moments that feel completely out of place, she makes the most out of them, as if somewhere inside the hollow vessel of her character is a multi-dimensional person. Even the casting of Freeman as the professor, who exists exclusively to explain what's happening to Lucy, adds a certain legitimacy to the filmTo Besson's credit, he manages to create enough thought-provoking moments to make ""Lucy"" feel like a smart and unique film. There are some big ideas within this concept and though he mostly scratches the surface, he manages to create enough of a hook to pull the audience into the movie. Although it plays out so differently compared to films like ""Taken"" and ""The Transporter"" series, Besson again proves to be innovative as far as surface-level entertainment goes.It's also tremendously helpful that ""Lucy,"" like most of Besson's films, is short. At less than 90 minutes, it doesn't toil about long enough to let its faults drag it down. For everything it's missing, it's still efficient. That's the kind of low-risk approach that most flawed movies could stand to benefit from and that Besson had proved time and time again to be pretty reliable in delivering.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Incredible,"Luc Besson and Scarlett Johansson; what a match. I've been a fan of Besson for ages, and I find his movies to be different and intense at times.Leon the Profession was the start of being a massive fan of Luc Besson, and overall he is my definitive favorite director. Taxi and The Fifth Element just added to my fandom. His movies are so different, well-made, and always a highlight.Lucy is no exception, and if you're a sci-fi buff this certainly is sublime. It starts off like many Hollywood movies, but it just goes wild, forwards, and upwards from there.Besson often bring France into his movies, and it's nice to get a change of scenery compared to, more or less, everything Hollywood spits out.I really hope there'll be a follow-up to Lucy, but I'm afraid of how it would be.

Forsaking Mistaking Trailers,"Luc Besson's Lucy is a high-concept sci-fi thriller that begins as an action-packed revenge film before transforming into something far more abstract and philosophical. Scarlett Johansson delivers a compelling lead performance, evolving from an ordinary woman into a superhuman force after ingesting an experimental drug that unlocks the full capacity of her brain.Visually, the film is sleek and energetic, packed with kinetic action sequences and striking imagery. The first half is especially engaging, balancing tension and spectacle, but as Lucy progresses, it leans heavily into heady, existential territory. While Besson's ambition is commendable, the film's pseudo-scientific premise and rushed final act may leave some viewers divided.Though not without flaws, Lucy remains an entertaining and thought-provoking ride, blending action and big ideas with Besson's signature style.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In truth, you must be one to appreciate the journey rather than reaching the destination. To be honest, I had second thoughts because of the poor reviews...

Better Than Average Sci-Fi - Lucy,"Before viewing this film, I had a rather low opinion of Scarlett Johanson as an actress. Also, for the first ten minutes of the film, I was not really impressed with her performance because I figured she was a low-life playing a low-life in a film; not exactly a stretch. Then I was surprised by her range and acting ability. My opinion of her has changed radically. Morgan Freeman is always good; and he is good in this film as well. The story of a street girl who becomes the smartest person on the planet is entertaining, and the production values, although a bit violent, are first-rate. Some of the characters (like the Asian drug dealers) are stereotypes and cartoonish, but we forgive that because the general story line is very intelligent.

To knowledge.,"I recommend this one, not because it's *good*, but just because it is so completely bonkers, I couldn't help but enjoy it. This movie is not ""everything but the kitchen sink"", this movie is everything *and* the kitchen sink, with some dinosaurs and shootouts thrown in there too. Johansen plays a tourist caught in a drug smuggling operation, forced to be the drug mule, and carry the experimental new drug out of the country, hidden in her abdomen. When the packet of blue crystals and goo burst inside her, the fun begins.From then on, her character's IQ skyrockets, she reads people's minds, and the film becomes a series of explosions, shootouts, and wild chase scenes, as Morgan Freeman basically narrates (in this most ridiculous musical montages(!)) what, theoretically, happens if a human could access 100% of their brain, and while Scarlett Johansson's character basically becomes The Terminator.Bright and colourful, with good effects work, and a hilarious car chase, filled with stunts and car flips, and sexy Johansen in the lead make this fun and watchable, but its lead girl is unsympathetic and robotic, its logic is absurd, and its villains weak.One of this movies that can be fun if watched in the right frame of mind, but also one of the oddest films ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boo different opinions boo,"Lucy is an interesting science-fiction movie. Although I expected the movie to be much better before watching it, as can be seen from its score here, it is just a movie that is just a little above average. After watching it, I can remain of the same opinion. Even though they chose the concept well, I think the mistakes the movie contains and its last half hour definitely drag it down a lot.In the movie Lucy, the idea of ""not using the full capacity of our brain"", which most of us have probably heard somewhere, is discussed. In this film, a scientist who develops a hypothesis on whether this full capacity is used or not, and a woman who has a high dose of synthetic drug mixed into her blood and therefore can use her entire brain, come together. However, the skills this person can achieve when his entire brain is used seem very interesting indeed. Of course, the fact that a person is very smart brings to our mind the firstly artificial intelligence. These machines, which can perform very large operations in seconds, can run through their algorithms in a very short time the things that people often work on for hours and produce results. Naturally, when we say ""very smart person"", the first thing that comes to our mind is artificial intelligence as an imitation. However, with the popular artificial intelligences we had the opportunity to talk with recently (GPT), we have seen that artificial intelligences cannot avoid very simple mistakes and cannot be fully human. So here we have a person who can hypothetically use his entire brain. Although we think of a person who can use his entire brain as a very high-level calculator in today's scientific paradigm, the screenwriter's perspective on this matter is different.In the paradigm of today's science, humans are represented as high-level complex machines. In psychology, elements such as memory and mind are modeled through computers. People do not build computers by looking at humans, but they take computers as an example and explain their own brains. The reason for this is that the West, which is the ruler of science, defines the person who meets its own living standards as ""normal"" while determining the ""normal"" of a person, and defines the other as ""abnormal and non-functional"". In other words, in the paradigm in which the West has a strong say, man is a machine from the perspective of science. We, in general, agree with these ideas because we were educated entirely within the Western paradigm, especially in science. While looking at the reviews about the movie, people complained about the movie not being scientifically real, but the movie doesn't make such a scientifical claim anyway. However, we can see in these people how today's scientific approach crushes even our dreams and theories under the name of ""science"". They are so attached to the paradigm that a new idea has no effect on them and they reject it outright. However, science itself is not done this way. Science can thrive almost entirely through dreams and ideas. It is clear that if such people had lived before, they would have been firmly committed to Newtonian physics and would never have agreed with Einstein. I was saddened to see these friends who were more interested in information technology than science.The themes of ""nirvana, ascension"", which are mostly from the east, are discussed in the movie. The power that comes from knowledge and the full use of the brain can give a person powers that we currently describe as ""superhuman"". These powers include not only being very intelligent, but also being able to control the physical world. From here, the unity of man with nature and different religious and spiritual views are included in the film, but since I do not have much knowledge, I cannot write about it in detail. In my opinion, there is no point where the film contradicts the general theme. If there is, it is because today's people cannot see the situation they are in and are unaware of this situation, limiting even their imagination in line with what this world has taught them.So, if you ask what the problem of the movie is, it is that the character, who uses his brain enough to integrate with this world, makes some strange mistakes in the movie. I think that a character created like this should definitely not have made these mistakes, which I think were made to lengthen the movie and make the ending exciting, but at one point they might have made them to emphasize that this character is aware of everything and that he created the difficulty herself, etc. It is really difficult to make a clear inference, but of course the police officers watching a lot of people with guns entering the university cannot be explained. Although the general theme of the movie is interesting, they failed to keep this theme warm and wrote it as if it went completely wrong after a while. Maybe there's something I missed.I liked the visual and sound techniques, but they are not great either. Those black parts at the end were very fake and very visible. In general, it would be fair to say that I did not see any additional shooting techniques, but since I still do not consider myself competent in this regard, I would like to quickly finish my cinematographic review and move on to the music. To be honest, there was nothing that interested me much in the music, except for one or two songs. There is one piece that is quite nice, but the rest seemed like filler pieces to me.It would be a lie if I said I remember anything extra good or bad about the acting. Personally, the acting of the Asian friends looked a little bad, but it wasn't that bad. I think they used Morgan Freeman purely for his voice, I don't understand why they chose the actors anymore. I think that our sister in the leading role was chosen to resemble the people in these first human events, but she is not such a divine human type. How's her acting? I don't know much, honestly it seems average. There is no scene that impressed me.In other words, it is a movie that starts well, goes well, but then becomes a bad movie with a lot of mistakes. I would say the concept is good, but I can't because they say it's too similar to the movie Limitless. Oh, it's definitely worth watching. An hour and a half won't steal anything from your life anyway. Maybe it will help you open your mind and get rid of this ""science"" paradigm that the West has established on you. As I always say: ""Boo different opinions boo"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The constant cutaways to random clips ""related"" to the scene don't add a philosophical mystique, they are a flailing attempt at stuffing the heroine's proverbial bra: sounds like a great idea but ultimately a massive disappointment. And don't even get me started on the opening scene showing the film's apparent namesake. The people behind this film should never have been allowed to work in the industry again and I hope Scar Jo and Freeman fired the agents that tied them to this abomination.Edit: I wrote this originally 1/3 of the way in and now I don't even know what to say.

As cerebral as it is exciting,"Lucy is not your average thriller, not by a long shot.

Her shady boyfriend lands her in the hellride she's in for, and as an experimental drug explodes inside her, her brain capacity begins to increase. She uses her newfound abilities to get out of her predicament and escape her captors, but what she does from there may surprise you.Right from the start, ""Lucy"" asks questions. For a while, it even segues between Lucy's story and that of Professor Norman (played by Morgan Freeman), who's trying to theorize what could happen if humans could use more parts of their brain. Eventually, the two characters will meet.""Lucy"" is very exciting. Right from the go, we are with this innocent woman who wants to escape the drug cartel who capture her and intend to use her as a carrier. Scarlett Johansson is amazing, growing from the terrified young woman to the increasingly supernatural warrior with her own mission in mind. Min-sik Choi is terrifying as the revolting Mr Jang. At times you might feel that Lucy's a bit lenient on him and his men, but her ordeal changes her. I hesitate to give away more but the finale of this movie really makes you think. The movie's also very inventively told, with intercutting shots of things like animals used to thematic effect, especially as we realize in what danger Lucy is, and the interstitial indicators of the percentage level of her brain function.I'm not surprised that Lucy already has a below-7 score, because it's a science-fiction thriller that asks questions.

With Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail and mastery of creating films that question human existence and our place in the universe, Lucy could have been a deeper, more philosophical exploration of the human mind and the potential dangers of transcendence.The stark visuals and haunting atmospheres he was known for would have elevated the film to an entirely new level of complexity.That said, Lucy remains an exciting and unique film in its own right, blending action, science fiction, and philosophy in an engaging way.

"""the best of"" kick-ass  (maybe straight-ahead, but maybe tongue-in-cheek)","""Lucy"" is worth seeing on the big screen. Probably it's a straight-ahead ""summer"" movie which could be (awkwardly) categorized as an action thriller ...or maybe it's an attempt to break new ground ...or maybe it's a massive tongue-in-cheek send-up of current multiplex fare. Although it has sci-fi elements, focusing too much on the sci-fi aspect will be disappointing. It's a bit more thoughtful than most ""action thrillers"", but just a bit; certainly it's not something to look forward to sinking your intellectual teeth into.It's reminiscent of many other films. Some that come to mind are ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Tron"" (the original one), ""Chunking Express"" (the first half), ""Baraka"", ""The Matrix"", ""The Tree of Life"" (the abstract part), and ""Home"". Originality isn't the point - taking good ideas (sometimes even actual footage) from lots of places and pushing them even further is.Before going on, let me directly address the premise that ""we only use 10% of our brains"". In a completely objective world, this idea would be no sillier than the idea of telepathically controlling a suit of armor which projects force fields. But, probably because of the history of the 10% idea, right now many people recoil from it. Don't. Leave your scientific/analytic hat at home. If you insist on getting hung up on the ""un-reality"" of the 10% idea, you're certain to not enjoy this film. (The film even jokes a bit with this idea, labeling a U.S. college student studying abroad as using not ""10%"" of her brain power but only ""1%"":-)I understand why many professional reviews are tepid. The science is somewhere between implausible and laughable. The philosophy is sophomoric. And the ending can feel unsatisfying, even abrupt. That's partly because the logic motivating the sequence of events, even though actually quite simplistic, can be hard to follow on the first viewing. And it's partly because it's pretty hard to ratchet the ""climax"" even higher when the volume has already been up all the way to 10 for so long. In other words, judged only by small-screen criteria, the movie is indeed mediocre. It doesn't help either that the movie doesn't fit all that neatly into any existing ""genre"", so professional reviewers are uncertain what to do with it.The acting is first-rate. It's not just pretty faces; the characters are engrossing. The main character's development from quite emotional at the beginning to completely flat at the end comes through very well. It might sound like a downer that for the lead role Angelina Jolie was replaced by Scarlett Johansson. In fact it was most likely an improvement. One's reaction to Jolie kicking ass might have been ""again?"", but when Johansson kicks ass one really sits up and takes notice. The technical aspects of the shooting must have been outrageous: there are some outdoor scenes that appear to move far beyond any imaginable boundaries of a ""location"" or ""set""; some perspective shots that make you think you're either flying or high; there's excellent wire work where you'd never expect it; and it's quite difficult to separate what's a stunt, an in-camera trick., compositing, CGI-enhanced, or full CGI (for example the outrageous car crashes that you would think must be CGI are in fact stunts).But where the movie really shines is as a visual spectacle (or perhaps as a primo example of ""style""). Go with the same mindset you'd use to watch a movie with cartoon characters in a cartoon story. Hang loose. And just let the images wash over you.There's some of the best nature photography I've seen. There's plenty of blood and gun-fu and random deaths (but that's not the whole movie). The extended car chase scene is the wildest I've ever seen bar none. There's simulated micro-photography (things like cells dividing). And there's simulated macro-photography (things like interplanetary nebulae). There are shots inside airplanes that quickly switch from things you've always dreamed of to matter disintegration. There's improbable mixing of different contexts (for example a woman in a black dress sitting in an office chair, which in turn is hovering on the surface of a swamp). There's an epic battle inside the Sorbonne. There's wide scenic vistas. There are famous landmarks. Time sometimes speeds up, and sometimes slows down, and sometimes runs backward, showing us both fully realized cityscapes a hundred years ago and the birth of the earth and moon. And so much more. And the extremely rapid editing shoehorns all of it into less than two hours.I admit I had to see it twice to fully grasp it. The first time the story was a bit jumbled, and just letting all the fantastic images wash over me was everything. The second time though the story was fully coherent (if rather simplistic). My suggestions are to use all the movie and TV reading skills you've got, and to not look too deeply for a complex story or philosophy. And if you still don't ""get"" the story, don't worry about it, just sit back and enjoy the visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Deep, deftly-made, and morally bankrupt","After spending 24 hours reflecting on ""Lucy"":I've seen some movies in which monsters become heroes, and some in which heroes become monsters. I've seen many movies with characters that are both heroic and monstrous.I think ""Lucy"" is the only movie I've seen in which we're asked to accept a monster as a hero even though she is consistently monstrous and never once heroic.The only theme I can find in this movie is that, in the fight to survive, might makes right and the lives of less gifted or less powerful people are disposable. The monster becomes immortal at the end of the story, which is ambiguous at best - on the one hand she is no longer rampaging through the city streets endangering public safety, but at the same time she has never shown any ethical concern whatsoever for anyone's well-being but her own.We are told to likewise pursue individual immortality, apparently with utter disregard for the needs and integrity of others. Immortality in this case is defined entirely in terms of biological and intellectual information - moral and emotional information is completely neglected. In this light, the ambiguity of the ending is terrifying. This could be a very successful monster movie if writer/director Luc Besson had given any indication at all that he was aware of the terrifying moral and ethical implications of his story. Unfortunately he seems to think Lucy is far from being a monster, but is in fact an ideal woman: smart, beautiful, powerful, and devoid of empathy or righteousness.6/10 for its depth and deftness of storytelling",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wished it was better,"Well the story is a direct steal from ""Limitless"" with typical Monsieur Beeson action thrown in. It soon looses grip, and just limps through to the end. Acting was terrible, a far far cry from Beeson's earlier master work such as ""Leon"" or ""the big blue"", indeed he has gone too commercial these days, his movies are very shallow and lack-lustre. Watch it if you must, it looks like a 10 minute youtube movie stretched to 90 minutes in order to sell. It has a good beginning, but then it stops cold! goes nowhere. Ms. Johansen is wasted here, anyone could have played the dumb-blonde. I believe she was brought in only as a selling tool.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Promising at first, but quickly goes bland","Probably everyone has at some degree wondered how it would be if humans could use more than their normal brain capacity.This movie provides a glimpse into what would happen if a person could unlock his mind's full potential. The story starts in a middle of interaction between Lucy and a man she has been seeing, where he is trying to convince here to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang. She ends up having no choice and what seems like a simply job gets Lucy involved in a horrible deal where she is turned into a drug mule for and extremely powerful drug.Things even take a turn for the worse when she is physically abused leading to the drug-bag in her stomach to rupture and a large dose is released into her bloodstream. Only not killing her, this dosage also causes her to be able to access bigger and bigger part of her brain – with drastic consequences.The featured cast is pretty interesting, as well as the storyline, however after a decent start the film completely loses its grip. Lucy doesn't have to go through any learning process to know how to control her new set of skills and powers – which was a bit of a let- down. Instead her journey thenceforth is a smooth sailing with minimum of emotions and excitement.There are a number of good looking scenes, but they do not come close to make up for the blandness, hence it is very hard to get invested in the story. Additionally the ending is partly given away early on which further reduces the excitement. This action film includes a strangely large amount of stock footage which really is totally unnecessary.Scarlett Johansson puts in a good performance; she has the extraordinary look a person for this role needs and is pretty believable as this supernatural human being. Morgan Freeman's role is a lot less interesting and is mainly used to explain what is happening to Lucy when she is not on-screen. Although Freeman has the look of a professor, he surely didn't feel like one to me on this occasion.The first part of the film is enjoyable but after that it just goes downhill, being extremely bland and stupid in so many ways (which is kind of funny given the brainpower of the main character).I cannot recommend Lucy – 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A bizarre, sometimes interesting mosaic","The only interesting parts are the ones dealing visually with the theories about increasing intelligence and powers. Thankfully these occupy most of the movie. The rest is some gangster filler with good actors that have nothing to do but look gangstery and punch and shoot. The movie goes philosophically beyond reason and abruptly stops wowing as a result. Also it does not deal with the obvious issue that this compound is now imminently available and many people can be like Lucy so now what, complete human crisis. It also bothered me that it's in the same vein as Ocean's 11 and Bourne Identity, rich people making movies about multiple luxurious foreign locations as if we've all been there done that. Most people are paycheck to paycheck and this jet-setter international shooting location style is something that is revealing about the ultra rich lifestyle of the movie-maker and his milieu rather than something necessary to the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beautiful intellectual garbage,"Let me preface by saying that as a student of Biology and a future doctor, I knew this movie would challenge my ability to suspend belief based on an absolutely idiotic premise which has been discussed to death. I can suspend belief in just about any sci-fi movie but a movie so blatantly moronic I actually felt tortured watching it.During my undergrad I dabbled in neuroscience and even philosophy. The movie was just scene after scene of beautiful putrid garbage that spits in the face of biology and physics. The greatest issue was that the storyline was thinner than a surgeons scalpel. It was essentially Scarlett acting melodramatic and constantly changing her power levels (which didn't correlate to the 'percentage' whatsoever).The most adorable thing was the 'writers' attempt to bring up a fundamental existential question. Can someone give the idiot writers a joint so he can at least match the theories of 13yo stoners? I've never actually seen a movie with a weaker premise, I wish I was making that up.I really can't review this much further, my brain is still numb after being subdued to this (I had to stay till the end because of friends). Please do yourself a favor, if you have beyond high school knowledge in biology and physics stay far, far away. Don't fund this idiocy. Go watch matrix or something.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More than adequate. Thought provoking. Perhaps, though....","...a little melodramatic. Disclaimer: I am a Scarlett Johansson and
Amr Waked fan, so I walked into this a little skewed to the high end. I thought the premise of the movie was already done, but this evolved to a different take on things. Second disclaimer: I am a retired meteorologist so I have no patience for ""Twister"", that collection of lies and idiocy. But I'm not a neuroscientist so the science behind this mostly escapes me and I'm okay with that.The characters were necessarily a little shallow-ly developed, but what else can you do? It's not really about them.Con: I wish it had explored more of her new abilities and included
Amr Waked in them.Pro: The car chase was not overdone as in most movies. Some Tom Cruise movies contain 50% car chases. This one was sufficient to the plot.It's a fun ride with just wonderment to warrant a 7/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"The fifteen first minutes are captivating, it's not so often that a movie brings the thrill so fast and so intensely. Had the movie gone on this way, I'd have given it at least 9/10. Even though the starting idea was already used before, the direction taken afterward is very interesting. Let's even disregard the credibility (of which I could not care less). Unfortunately, the second part of the movie goes too fast over too far stretched features. There are so many good ideas in there, we kind of would like the director to take us further inside those. Instead, the emphasis is made on spectacular aspects which I found out of place. I felt it as an attempt to entertain the widest public. If so, why even bother with a scenario? Although the plot is excellent, the result is shallow and the point made by the movie suffers greatly from it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good talent, but challenging speculation","I like Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman and admire several films of writer / director Luc Besson (The 5th Element, The Transporter, District 13) ... but this movie didn't do it for me.The science aspect, which I usually tend to ignore, bothered me and felt like too much of a stretch. It just felt strange - If we use 100% of our brains, we become like gods?What happens if a cat or a chicken uses 100% of it's brain? Boggles the mind.The movie ""Limitless"", which also speculated on using near 100% of the brain, felt more believable and interesting. As the main character increased in power, there were limitations and trade-offs. As such, there was a compelling challenge and catharsis involved.This movie seemed more like a simple speculation embedded in a weak story.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Action Packed, Visually Stunning, Challenges the Imagination!","What more could you ask for? Scarlett is amazing and perfect for her role and this script. I could never tire of seeing her gorgeous face..but this my friends is NOT why I gave this movie a 9/10. It is Fun, Edgy, Visually Captivating, and so fast paced, that you forget it's a movie. There is no time for boredom in ""Lucy"". It's NOT ""Limitless"", and NOT ""Trancendence"".. but it takes a bit of premise from these two films and not only DOES IT RIGHT, but takes it to the MOON!!! ""Lucy"" is NOT a far-fetched fantasy with a lengthy, talkative, or wheel spinning plot.. but an ACTION-SciFi-Thriller, that has more than a tinge of realistic probability to it and Packs a Punch!

What is life? and Who are we, or Where did we come from?"" and does it in a cool, quick, to the point way! Come on guys.. You couldn't get a more beautiful actress to play such kick-ass character. in a film with such a thought-provoking, interesting plot. Bottom line is this..

Still a thought-provoking mix of 2001 with Nikita and Night Head,"When he filmed the Gospel of Matthew, Pasolini apparently pleased Christians less than he pleased atheists. Similarly, this evolutionary fantasy by Luc (masculine for Lucy) Besson should appeal less to evolutionists than to creationists. Basically because it is based on the biggest myth in neuroscience: that humans only use 10% of their brain. In fact, we use it virtually everywhere: the brain stem alone (which includes the cerebellum and the back) controls our elementary bodily functions and comprises 12% of the entire brain.

"Dazzled, to say the least.","Lucy is a sci-fi action thriller made in 2014 starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. It is the most thought-provoking and intriguing film I have seen in my life and I could not have hoped for better. Throughout the film I have had a million thoughts such as whether she knew what the definition of the afterlife was, whether Lucy still experienced emotions or not, and if mankind was truly ready for the knowledge Lucy had obtained. The CGI is like the cherry on the pie, with astonishing shots attempting to recreate the sight of the creation of the universe. I am astonished by the fact that this is something that could actually happen; Of course we are very much aware of the 'We use only 10% of our brain' theory being a myth, but I assume that the intention was to put it as if our current brain only uses 10% of its knowledge capacity, see it as if without the drug Lucy couldn't learn more than that 10%. I think that Lucy is a brilliant film everyone above 15 should watch, as it does have some gory violence and the drugs may have a bad impact on younger viewers. Besides that, the entire concept of the film may be too much for children.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Over-sophistication of action film,"In general, I like Luc Besson's creations I have tried to follow them as much as possible. His distinct approaches and good choices of actors are notable - and Lucy is no exception here. However, there is too much neuroscience, sometimes sci-fi and plain shootings do not match / disturb each other, there are some unrealistic scenes (e.g. person with a visible gun freely moving around in a public institution), and the talent of some actors (particularly Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked) was ""wasted"" in minor and non-elaborated characters. Scarlett Johansson is, of course, great and thanks to her abilities and charm the film's overall value is enhanced for me. Long shootings are car chases characteristic to Besson are present as well.Anyway, the film in question is still far above average and the 1 hour 20 minutes pass smoothly, with a few protracted scenes though. But it has not reached the level of e.g. Subway or The Fifth Element.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Impressive and inspiring,"I didn't expect Lucy as a brilliant movie while I stepped into theater. Luc Besson is well known for directing Leon, however I told myself I am not going to watch another Leon or The Fifth Element from the director who made amazing movies 20 years ago.Back to Lucy, alongside all Sci-Fi movies where all talk about one thing in total, Lucy opens a new horizon in telling who we are. Prometheus, for instance, nicely developed the idea of our origins. But Lucy is different. With taking some notes of religions and what it has been written on the Holy book or Quran, you can feel our origin, you can feel the source of creation. That's why I love this movie. It's nice, the plot is easy. However it makes you think, it make you agonize about yourself, about universe.Thumps up!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thunderstruck Lucy missing the mark.....,"Lucy is a good film but maybe a bit over ambitious. Saying that, Luc Besson has succeeded in the past with similar gambles such as Nikita. In this case we have Sci-fi and Nikita mixed together as we count up to an unintentionally drugged up Scarlet Johansen increasing in sensory powers.Chased by some conglomerate hoods, we have explosions and chases which in the usual Besson way are spectacular and exciting. Our lead is perfect in the role and is smart, sexy and convincing.However the problem is the story. Okay it's Sci-fi but it just stretches things too far to get too interested. The dialogue helps to give an interesting explanation of the pseudo science behind the film, but you don't need a degree to see the holes which hurts any credibility. The ending in particular seems to have been conjured up in an afternoon after a struggle to figure how to end it.Overall fine but didn't fully hit its target.

Luc Besson's Best Visionary Scarlett Johansson,"Some people are hailing this as Luc Besson's best piece of Science Fiction work since ""The Fifth Element"" Scarlett Johansson. A mythology, similar to Neo in the Matrix, revolves around the idea Scarlett Johansson. The wrinkle in this film is the blue pill allows you to see the code behind the 3 dimensional Scarlett Johansson. But for only 24 hours. Morgan Freeman, who appears in every film released, plays a smart guy who knows exactly how the ability to Scarlett Johansson.The film starts in a very gritty scenario that resembles his first Hollywood style film, ""La Femme Nikita"". Scarlett Johansson, who you think could be Marilyn Monroe's kid, gets in trouble with dangerous drug dealers. There are shocking moments of terror and violence that Besson has a flair for, and doesn't disappoint here. Feeling a sense of educating the audience as if a National Geographic documentary was directed by Micheal Bay, the frenetic editing wants desperately to make us connect with something deeper. But ultimately the story seems just interested in giving us a series of flashy sequences that feature Scarlett Johansson. Anytime Scarlett Johansson leaves the screen, even Morgan Freeman can't save the vacant space where a more coherent story should be.It kind of reminded me of the last ""Jack Ryan"" film. The filmmakers have a checklist of requirements for a run-of-the-mill action thriller. Car Chase - check. Fight scene on the walls - check. Slowing down time - check. The audience reaction to the imagery-filled climax was that this supposed deeper imagery came out of nowhere, and didn't really fit what looks and feels like a Scarlett Johansson vehicle.But I really like Scarlett Johansson. I like watching her on the big screen. The material certainly has potential. But so did Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity and Johnny Mnemonic, etc. The material outside Scarlett Johansson is so weak in it's structure, the slightest puff of wind would cause it to collapse. Does the movie play self-aware and wink at the audience with a ""we know this is silly but just go along with it""? Not if it thinks it can take itself seriously with the animal documentary footage. So, no, not meant to be silly. Did I enjoy myself? Sure OK, this was a flashy but digestible action thriller. But if I had the choice, I would save the money and checkout Scarlett Johansson on DVD or streaming. But you may notice I have mentioned Scarlett Johansson twelve times now. So for some people that is enough to see this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Lucy,"A woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic.Lucy is directed by Luc Besson and is starring Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman. At first sight this film could appear to look like Limitless, which is quite similar. This time again Luc Besson works his magic on a beautiful woman with her gun (Nikita, The Fifth Element, etc.). Scarjo is pretty good at that in the movie, as she quickly turns into a bad ass killer in the first act. Morgan Freeman's character is not that interesting, he has pretty much the same part as in Transcendence except that the film itself is better than Transcendence. Mr Jang starring Min-sik Choi is nothing more than an evil guy, killing people in cold blood, we don't really know more about him. However the movie is looking good, it is very well edited. There's a cool car chasing action scene, several very natural and fluid action scenes as well. I have a divided opinion on this film as on the one hand Lucy has some conventional action movie themes and on the other hand some too unconventional parts; it's dealing with smart things in a dumb way. It's like Luc Besson wanted to make cool things happen in a movie and he did it, but I don't really care about the plot and characters and where the story is going. We can't really like Lucy or relate to her as she doesn't encounter threatening situations, as she can access 100% of her brain capacity she becomes nearly invincible and as a protagonist nothing properly challenges her. It's entertaining but there's no tension as in an actual action movie.Overall Lucy looks good, there are great action sequences despite the fact that tension really isn't there it's entertaining if you're just seeking that.

Goofy Fun,"A lot of people seem to have a big problem with this film using the myth that humans only use 10% of their brain. Really it's only true of people in Hollywood. Because this is just an entertainment piece, it doesn't bother me much. If it was something more pretentious, like an Aronofsky film, I would have a bigger problem with it. The movie is certainly watchable from beginning to end. I'd even say it's fun most of the way. But it never makes the most of its premise and even seems to give up trying relatively quickly. You have a character who can do pretty much anything but the things they have her do are mundane and the only threat to her they can come up with are angry drug dealers with guns. The ending is the default transcendental trip that every movie about humans evolving since 2001: A Space Odyssey has used a variation of. The most amusing part is where Lucy (Scarlett) meets Lucy (ape woman). But 'space baby' it is not. The use of the animal footage is the kind of stuff film school students do. Maybe it does have its pretentious moments. Scarlett Johansson's entertaining. The guy from Oldboy is fun but the character was really an unimpressive threat. Morgan Freeman's got new choppers.

bad scientific justifications!,"I'll keep it short not to waste any of your time.There are movies like star-wars that are scientifically inaccurate (use of the force). But the good ones don't try to scientifically explain/justify it, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. Believing in the force is admission to the star-wars universe. But they don't tell you some story about how consuming only orange food will do that to you...This movie however is scientifically inaccurate, and does try to justify it with bogus science. Which means that a good portion of the movie you're listening to completely rubbish false science and you'll be going.. ""whhaaat?! no... Thats not how that works...."" I don't want to spoil the movie so I won't go into detail, but I'll give one example: there used to be this myth in the world that humans are only using 10% of their brain. The myth has since been debunked because maybe at 1 time only 10% is in use, but all of it is used at some point. It is like activation 100% of all muscles all the time doesn't make you stronger, but spastic, and will stop your heart because in fact you need to activate and then deactivate the muscles is order to pump.. some muslces are actually creating forces in opposite forces. The same is somewhat true of the brain, activating it 100% won't make you smarter, it will just activate every part of your body and mind, and it will be bad.. The movie makes a lot of big big big jumps from there i wont spoil for you, but if you hate scientific inaccurate EXPLANATIONS, you'll hate this movie.I really hated someone telling me absolute bullshit for most of the movie. It is as if the whole movie someone is telling you all of what is happening is possible because 4+2=10 and 4-1=0...

Fun & Interesting - Not the best but was worth the time!,"It was okay sci-fi that was plain enough for tweens, teens and adults seeking a simple sci-fi & shoot em up type genera that was easy to just sit and enjoy as is. Also there was enough for the more intellectually oriented to think about and contemplate some of the scientific fantasy sci-fi aspects as they as well enjoy the movie for what it is.Do not expect the movie to be based on solid proved current scientific understandings with its premises or how such events come to occur; that is why it is a sci-fi fantasy. Saw so many complaints in reviews here and other sites about it not being 100% scientifically correct etc. Tralala...Too often many adults seemingly lose imagination and become rigid as they get stuck on technicalities and are only able to relate to their understandings which often is what they find comfort in and/or seem to just seek to show they know better and basically fault find in a seeming sad attempt to prove their intellectual superiority instead just allowing the mind to stay flexible and enjoy such genres as is. There are many free documentaries and as well free college lectures widely available on the web if you are seeking such; this genre if for enjoyment by many demographics with varied interest and skill levels.Not being mentally locked in is why kids often make profound observations on things about a issue that have been right before us but we adults seemingly have missed or can not see. This is why kids often have uncharacteristic insights that we adults often miss because we have lost contact with our own imagination or ability to look at things from differing perspectives and points of view as we have failed in keeping and nourishing an open imagination into and throughout adulthood. Guess that is why many new ideas, technologies or re-purposed old technologies and as well many key scientific discoveries occur by young people, if child or adult.

Good,"Yes, this does remind me a lot of Deja Vu. The comparisons are obvious, and just like that film, I like it enough, but I don't think it's great or all that really good. In some ways it is the most ridiculous thing I've seen in years. Some of the dialog could be better. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. Other than that, it was an okay film, and I would recommend that people watch it. Riveting from the first frame to the last.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Silly it is, fun it's not","""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale.""I've always been a fan of Luc Besson's work so I was expecting great things from Lucy considering I had read several positive reviews, but personally I was disappointed. And I'm not trashing this film simply because the assumption that humans only use 10% of their brain is erroneous; that wasn't an issue I had here. I just found it hard to engage with the character of Lucy, the philosophical themes explored here were silly, and the entire premise simply bored me. There were some similarities between this film and Johnny Depp's Transcendence where despite some solid visual styles the philosophical themes hurt the overall narrative. Scarlett Johansson delivers another solid performance, but her character really didn't work for me as well as former Besson leading ladies such as Milla Jovovich in The Fifth Element and Natalie Portman in Leon. Perhaps it was all the philosophical and scientific mumbling that ended up hurting the narrative story for me. However I do have to give Besson credit for trying something different and taking risks because the film goes to unexpected places at times. I do feel that comparisons with 2001 are unfair. Some of the CGI didn't really work for me either, especially the one with the Neanderthal during the opening scene. Besson also experimented with the use of imagery that seemed to be taken from a National Geographic channel which overlapped with the narrative serving as an analogy, but those scenes felt forced and they also took me out of the film. This sci-fi film might have taken several steps to stand out from other formulaic movies by not following the standard structure of a genre film, but the result didn't really pay off. I felt as if Lucy was trying to be this sort of profound philosophical film, but it turned out to be fairly silly and incomprehensible. Perhaps it may be that I use less than 10% of my brain and therefor just didn't get it, but for my limited brain capacity Lucy wasn't worth my time or money.Scarlett Johansson has taken several risks in the past year delivering some very solid roles in films like Her, Under the Skin, and now Lucy. The risks seem to have payed off considering she is catching the attention of talented directors and I'm glad she isn't going for the easy roles in rom-coms or standard action flicks. Despite enjoying her performance, this film lost me halfway through it. I enjoyed the supporting cast as well. It was great to see Choi Min-sik (better known for his role in Oldboy) play the villain here although I wish he would have been given more screen time. Perhaps my favorite performance was that of Amr Waked who played the officer helping Lucy (or should I say simply riding along with her?). Besson switched the genre roles here as usually it is the other way around, where the male character is the one doing all the work and the female only riding along. Morgan Freeman might just be the weakest link in this film as he is the one responsible for all the scientific and philosophical blabbing going on (my least favorite thing about Lucy). For a film that tries to take itself seriously with profound themes about wasted human potential, there are way too many flaws involved. I understand that most of these flaws were needed as an excuse to introduce some of the action scenes which this film would have suffered without. There are some fun scenes like a car chase across Paris, but there isn't much more to this wacky film. For all the scientific rambling there is very little substance to Lucy despite its ambitions.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Best Films Ever,"Stop worrying about the science. This is a work of fiction rather like The Matrix. This is a fantastic 'what if' story, a mixture of action and fantasy, one of my favourite films ever. Just accept the premise and this becomes a deeply philosophical ride into an imaginitive alternative reality, mixed with great acting by the central character. She goes through an emotional black hole with real feeling and takes you with her all the way.There is also a lot of really enjoyable action as she encounters the gangsters, first as a scared helpless victim and then increasingly takes control of her own destiny and that of humanity.

"Good production quality. Cringe-worthy script. Every line of 'science', not just the 10% thing, was backwards.","'The 10% myth isn't true, but if you can just roll with this one thing, the rest of the film is interesting and watchable' is something you can say about Limitless, but not this drivel. Everything was fine about this film, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the pacing, the cgi, all excellent, except the script, which was garbage. Even the plot was basically okay, although quite predictable. the general premise, though far-fetched, wasn't what ruined this. Every sentence of 'science' was a mashed up jumble of science buzz words. Every one. Science word spaghetti.

There was a whole lot of things in the movie that could of been done better but even with all those flaws I still found it entertaining.The only thing that let the film down for me was the ending which even though visually was probably the best part of the film it still felt a little too generic and overdone.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ridiculous but very entertaining,"Morgan Freeman is a scientist , at the beginning of the movie he is giving a talk, some of the things he was saying during his talk made me cringe and roll my eyes. At first it annoyed me because how hard can it be to do just a little more research before writing a ""scientific"" talk in the movie. He didn't even have the basics down in some parts. He clearly doesn't know how the human brain works and that's just embarrassing for the movie imo.I laughed when Morgan Freeman didn't know how to answer what would happen if someone was at ""100%, brain capacity"" but somehow had a very detailed answer for what would happen if it was at 40%... Sorry dude, but how would you know what happens at 40% either, information is being just pulled out of his ass.THAT BEING SAID, i was able to get past that because the movie itself was pretty fun and entertaining and frankly that is hard to find these days.If you can get past some of the ridiculousness, like some of her abilities that just don't make sense, you will enjoy it. It's best to stop asking question and trying to apply logic when watching this film.

Pseudoscience has never been so much fun!,"Let me start out this review by saying that I freaking love The Fifth Element and The Professional. Luc Besson was killing it in the 90's, and while he may have lost some steam in the 21st century I still couldn't help but get excited over his newest explosive action exploit, Lucy. Scarlett Johansson stars as the titular character, a girl who inadvertently gets mixed up in a drug smuggling ring that isn't smuggling any old drugs. She is forced to smuggle a new drug that heightens a person's ""cerebral capacity"" and when she is exposed to the drug she starts gaining all sorts of crazy abilities that she rightfully uses to kick ass and take names. Honestly I don't really know what her actual goal was, but plenty of people get to die in cool fashions along the way, and that makes for an action packed 90 minutes of super powered ScarJo, so how can I complain?Now, this movie centers around the idea that humans only use about 10% of their brain and it speculates what a person would be capable of if they could unlock all 100%. There had always been controversy over this theory and shortly after the movie came out, hell it might have even been before its release, this whole theory was disproved and smashed into fictional conjecture oblivion. Thus, it's really hard, nigh impossible, to take Lucy seriously. It takes a lot of scientific liberties and its attempts to explain things for the sake of the plot are mostly laughable. There is some seriously nutty pseudoscience being bounced around here, and at times it seems like they're making it up as they go along. But once you separate yourself from the silliness of the plot and just accept the absurd foundation on which this film is built, you'll start to have a lot more fun.It only takes Lucy about seven minutes to kick off the action so if you like explosions, gunfire, or martial arts then Lucy will have your attention pretty quickly. Besson might be a bit older and a bit less on point, but I can't deny the sonofabitch still knows how to put together a badass action sequence. Lucy gives us the smart, tension filled action set-pieces reminiscent of The Professional. It reminds us that we go to the movies to enjoy ourselves and not everything has to be so serious all the time. And for that I have the utmost respect for Lucy.A film based around such flimsy science is bound to have a swathe of issues, and Lucy is no exception. But the issues here you can really just chalk up to the conceit of movies. Sure, the dialogue is cheesy, transparent, and comically expository at times. The performances are good, but you have to take them with a block of cheese. Johansson is fun as the super powered ass kicking femme fatale, and Morgan Freeman is pretty entertaining too, even if his character's only purpose in the film is to explain the plot and give us back story. But these issues are passable things that don't stop Lucy from being a riotously good time, and it's wacky story actually plays out in a really satisfying way. I was prepared for a really stupid ending, but what I got was actually pretty awesome and something connections that I didn't see coming were drawn out by the end.As far as action movies go Lucy is great. Its loaded with ass kicking and jam packed with wicked special effects. The film is a nonstop roller coaster and the ending certainly goes off the rails, but in an age where action movies draw out for far too long, what with our superhero and fighting robot movies clocking in at almost three hours half the time, Lucy with it's cool 90 minute run time is short sweet and to the point. It doesn't dwell and it doesn't over complicate things. If this movie's one goal is to entertain while not taking up too much of your time or too much of your cerebral capacity (hehe) then I would say it's a huge success.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hmm...,"I'm trying to figure out whether or not this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm leaning toward not, because the first fifteen minutes are sublime. Truly. As breathless and tense and real as the opening of MIdnight Express, where you know that somebody in a foreign country is about to make the worst move of their life and that only hell will follow, and you feel powerless to stop it. But once Lucy gets inside that building, all attempt to tell an emotionally or narratively coherent story are tossed squarely out the window, and from that point on not a single thing any character does is what that character would do in any given situation. Plus dull and no attempt to establish emotional stakes, except for one very affecting conversation between a mother and a daughter which, like those opening fifteen minutes, saves this, barely, from being the worst movie I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Lucy knows everything anyway and his explanation to the viewer will hurt your soul. It doesn't matter that the whole premise is impossible but STOP RUBBING IT IN MY FACE. The fact that hes presenting his ideas to a room full of students and professors only ads insult to injury. No one asks a simple why. Why does he think humans get psychic powers at 30%. Telekinesis? Why is he even doing ""research"" on some weird hypothetical. This movie is literally better if you cut out every Morgan scene.This movie is way too pretentious for the few good action scenes it has.

Exquisite . . . What film should be . . . Besson = Master,"Luc Besson achieves a level of cinematic perfection, seldom seen, with his latest offering - ""Lucy"".This film is complete - beautiful cinematography, great story, a gripping score and tension that crawls into you and won't let go. Fans of the Fifth Element will recognize the increasingly frenetic pacing and staccato use of scene cuts, as well as the gorgeous, flowing camera work and the use of visual allegory from Besson's previous projects. Old film tricks used in new ways serve to build the tension from the first frame to ""Lucy""'s final, shuddering climax. Elements of Leon The Professional and La Femme Nikita are present but feel more refined here, more sophisticated and deliver even more ""oomph"" to action fans.However, beyond what we know of Besson's previous work lies the truth of why ""Lucy"" is such a fantastic film and a true, ""must-see"". If you love sci-fi - It's an excellent rendition of a classic theme. If you love Scar Jo, she's never been better and again demonstrates the range of a true talent. But, if you love films - be you a student, an enthusiast or ""in the biz"" - you must see ""Lucy"". It is on of those rarest of works that will remind you of why you started loving movies in the first place.Rarely, have I been moved along, so urgently, by a film. Ushered swiftly into experiences I thought I knew, only to have revealed to me some new thought, or philosophical idea that I was heretofore unaware of. ""Lucy"" does this honestly and smart. At times I found myself enthralled by the ""Koyaanisqatsi""-like images - here used as a device for squeezing more tension out of a scene - not just for their intrinsic, artistic value. ""Lucy"" is blessed with musical scoring so subtle and powerful that, at times, I was unaware that I was breathing with the tempo of the film.You will watch it. You will discuss it. You will re-watch it. You will remember why you love movies and lament the fact that so few of them deliver what ""Lucy"" does. Thanks Luc.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Wow... what a train wreck. It doesn't matter if the movie is scientifically accurate; treat it more like a sci fi film than a realistic depiction of brain chemistry.But as a sci fi movie, or a movie in general, this is an absolutely horrendous movie. Firstly, the setup is too quick at the beginning and rushes to get Lucy to her superhero phase way too quickly. She has no character, so when she changes it doesn't have any impact. Every character in the film is one dimensional and most are plot devices.The editing with nature footage is downright awful. It occurs early on and continues through the film, consistently drawing attention away from the plot to give some broad visual themes that are way too heavy handed (the gazelle and cheetah chase eg.)Visually, the movie does very little of interest with the concept of (essentially) superpowers. We barely see any of Lucy's altered perceptions other than through some quick editing and overt dialogue.The writing is god awful.

I highly appreciate when someone tries to make something beyond their capabilities and understanding. The result is a fine product that incites imagination, which is more than can be asked of plenty releases. And average script aside, it is the development and execution that makes it. A simple scene of Lucy speaks to her Mother over the phone.. just to tell her how much she means to her. Scarlett does a great job.Sadly..

Luc Besson is the Michael Bay of France,"Spectacle over substance. Not much more to say. It's a fun completely brain dead romp of CGI, explosions, and goddess of war woman kicking tail. It is unintentionally funny in many scenes mainly due to the complete lack of any sort of internal logic coupled with an almost Matrix Revolutions level of self pretension and the very wooden acting of the lead character that I can only assume is per direction. This is one of Luc Besson's better recent films but honestly that's not saying much.""1 + 1 does not equal 2"" <--- This is supposed to be a deep quote.LOL, OK, Luc. Lots and I mean LOTS of psychobabble wrapped in pseudo scientific language. The crafting of the movie is very good but the art behind it is pure dreck.And then there is... ""I'm not sure mankind is ready for it."", that ol' sci-fi movie trope.This is totally worthy of a parody audio dub if it hasn't been done already, but at the same time it is quite a bit of fun nonsense. If you can squint your brain vision hard enough through the silliness of the whole thing then what's left is worth a Saturday matinée. And of course the lead character is a draw simply because of her looks.Morgan Freeman should get an Oscar for this, managing to say the lines he does with a straight face and actually pulling off a seemingly real person.

You will leave wishing Lucy had died in the opening sequence. That would have saved you the 90 minutes of pure action with no storyline.Then there was the cinematography.... I was super confused with the opening sequence that was made up of flashes from Lucy to Freeman, then to national geographic footage??? With none of the clips containing enough info to get a handle on the story. Hence the lack of feelings for any of the characters...I love movies, and I really expected this to be a great summer blockbuster, but sadly even Scarjo and Freeman could not save this story-less plot, and awkward cinematography...I gave it a 2 to even out the overly high user reviews.

Masterpiece,"What is so fascinating about Lucy is the fact that she is able to combine the mythology of action films with that of comic books. The protagonist (Scarlett Johansson) is a superhero, but instead of having selective powers - like invisibility or the ability to fly, for example - she has all possible powers. Thanks to an accident involving a synthetic drug, Lucy starts to develop her brain, and soon she can control everything and everyone around her. (That is, drugs can have very positive effects, children, but don't try this at home). The prospect of a character capable of anything can be completely absurd in terms of script, but powerful in terms of image.Lucy does not live in a parallel world, of the future, she is not particularly intelligent or well intentioned. The young woman is accidentally chosen by a group of mobsters these days, and sets out to seek revenge for purely personal reasons: the character does not want to rid the world of drug trafficking, or evil men, just to do an extreme experiment itself, which leads it to seek and steal this synthetic drug from several people. Lucy is one of those strong, avenging women, a hero without character, as was Kill Bill's fascinating Widow, for example. She is one of the only female characters in the entire plot, surpassing all men in intelligence and competence.What follows is an absurd and inventive succession of moments of action. Everyone has seen shots and chases before, but this story makes an unprecedented representation of the action: instead of shooting the bad guys, Lucy disarms them with the power of thought; instead of overcoming them with punches, she sticks the bad guys on the ceiling (!) with a small gesture of the hands; instead of crashing into cars and generating explosions, it causes them to roll over on their own in the middle of the street. The script sends out naturalism and explores the potential of this great video game with sincere joy. The narrative is fast and lean, investing in the progression trajectory - the percentage of the protagonist's brain development appears on the screen, increasing. What will happen when Lucy reaches 100% of your brain?Luc Besson seems really invested in this project. He puts pop rock music in car chases, and soon afterwards uses excerpts of classical music (the same as the highly intellectual Nymphomaniac, by Lars Von Trier) to show the protagonist watching the sap of a tree running through each part of the trunk and roots. Lucy can be serious at times, hilarious at other times, and who would say, even poetic and moving in a few moments. Some images of the cosmos border on parody, others refer to Terrence Malick's transcendental aesthetic. The result, of course, is a surprising mess, aware of its excesses, without fear of displeasing. Lucy constitutes, from now on, a small trash classic, a script for a B film covered in Hollywood packaging.As for the metaphysical pretensions, the discussion about the capacity of the human being, the relationship between time and space, it is merely a background to attribute verisimilitude to history. No one in their right mind can believe the complexity of that scientific data. Everything is obviously false, but the film distorts rules of science to imagine a fiction - thus constituting a science fiction par excellence. The speeches of the great intellectual Norman (Morgan Freeman) are as simple as a pre-university entrance exam review, his data presented in Powerpoint does not convince anyone. But Besson includes comical comments, inserts about the animal kingdom, which reinforce the humorous character of this strange science: no, Lucy does not take herself one bit seriously. And for those who still have doubts, the human being does not use only 10% of his brain, as stated in the premise of the film.Who also deserves congratulations for this film is Scarlett Johansson. The actress could be content with the fame and salary obtained in great action films, in the style of The Avengers, but she continues to seek demanding, difficult roles, such as the operating system in Ela, the man-eating alien in cult-trash Under the Pele, and now of that kind of total woman, heir to the first woman in history, also called Lucy, and equivalent to a goddess among humans (""I am everywhere,"" she says). The actress does well in all these roles, deals with projects with great commitment, and builds in detail the progression between the initial Lucy and the others, with different percentages of the developed brain capacity. Johansson brings this small coherent, insane and fun project to life, marked by a healthy desire to bring something different to action and science fiction blockbusters.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm seen on August 26, 2020.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Excellent Sci-Fi Movie,"This movie truly is a masterpiece of science fiction, that is, it fictionalizes what happens if the limits of science are expanded. And it does that at a carefully measured pace. I was surprised that many ""critics"" (i.e. parasites of opinion that compete for the meanest words to retain readers) point quickly to the inaccuracy of the science behind Lucy, but they do not care to point to the physical impossibility of let say Captain America.This is not your average Marvel movie... it is much better. There is the sexy girl, the exciting action scenes, and some profound questions without trying to give mystical answers. You can just sit down, relax, and enjoy an action sci-fi flick that is outside the predictable and formulaic Hollywood bunch (some of which I also enjoy greatly). This movie is a refreshing view on an old topic. There are many cultural references in this movie (to movies, arts, science, the crown of french archaeological findings, etc.) that you might miss if you do not pay enough attention; even if you do, you need to have vast knowledge to pick them all up. I am sure I missed many. For example, there is an elegant reference to Michelangelo's ""The Creation of Adam"", and another clever fundamental scene with Lucy drinking water happens in what looks like Gorges de l'Ardèche, where the Cahuvet Cave guards the oldest human paintings. Pay attention to the statue destroyed at the University. Perhaps many references are unintentional, and simply reflect the spirit of our time. In any case, Lucy takes you on a ride that will last long after the lights are back on. LUCY IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When scifi becomes fantasy,"I don't seem to understand how the other reviewers are giving this movie 8 or 10.

That is also the biggest issue that I have with this movie. I can accept a few scientific inaccuracies but this movie is a total fantasy land.The movie is based on the myth that ""we use 10% of our brain power"" and tries to explore what might have happened if we used more than that. The story has a lot of potential since it's really interesting but it becomes too much too fast. Everything paranormal is in this so called scifi movie and the irritating thing is that they try so hard to present it as if it's something that professors could be talking about.This movie is purely made in Hollywood terms oriented towards brain-dead consumers who don't like to use their brains. Some might say that the movie makes you think.. yes it does. However it makes you think based on totally paranormal ""facts"".If you like movies that are truly intriguing, then I recommend to skip this one.

Writer/Director Luc Besson has a track record of mixing stylistic visuals with more traditional action: La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element. This time he tries to mix those components with fantasy, sci-fi and neuroscience. His hope was that Scarlett Johannson in a snug t-shirt and Morgan Freeman as an on screen narrator would sufficiently distract viewers from the intercontinental drug-muling mess.We have all fantasized about expanded brain power, and many films have touched on this: Transcendence (Johnny Depp), The Matrix franchise, and Limitless (Bradley Cooper) to name a few. Omnipotence may not be everyone's goal, but it sure doesn't seem to go well in movies. This time around, there is a Korean drug syndicate led by Choi Min-sik (Oldboy) who have synthesized a drug that takes the human brain to a new level.There are some nice moments in the film, but the pieces just don't fit smoothly together. Circumstances are such that Scarlett finds herself experiencing the effects of the drug - first by dancing on the ceiling ala Lionel Ritchie, and then with the most awkward phone call to mom in film history. Soon enough her telekinetic powers are so advanced, she mows down the heavily armed bad guys with a flick of the finger. If that makes no sense to you, you'll have to follow along with Professor Morgan Freeman's charts and graphs. His lecture spells out the steps that Scarlett will go through and the interconnected scene cuts makes sure all movie goers can keep up ... even those who don't use 10% of their brain.My biggest complaint is that if a movie about extraordinary intelligence is to be made, then the movie itself should at least be smart ... or witty. What the movie tells us is that expanded brain access allows us to medically diagnose our friends through a hug, instantly change hair color while strolling through the airport, and create invisible force fields to trap our enemies. We also learn that really smart people drive the wrong way on one-way streets. In Dallas, we typically refer to those people as idiots ... or at least horrible drivers. Evidently the joke is on us - those are the enlightened ones!This movie should have been a lot more fun than it was. A tip of the cap to Mr. Besson for casting Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen), and for the global trek from Taipei to Berlin to Paris to NYC ... and finally a dinosaur and memory stick. While Scarlett's character remembers the taste of her mother's milk, I expect the memory of this film will fade quickly.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unreached potential,"One of man's perennial questions is 'what if we could use 100% of our brain capabilities' and this is the main thrust of this film.Since it is based on a scientific assumption, this is a science fiction movie that treads on a rather thin line. The truth is we don't know, empirically, how much of our brain we use and neither can we tell what it would be like if we reached 100% so the makers of this movie took a huge creative leap with rather mixed results.Don't get me wrong on the whole, it is a decent experience, well made, and at times rather intense. Nonetheless its story has holes on several levels.It doesn't get off on a promising start due to a prolonged incoherent dialogue between a guy and a girl where somehow the girl is forced to make a delivery unaware of the significance of the importance of the content she delivered. Now, you get a gang that invests a lot of money to develop a unique mind enhancing drug, so how come they decided to test it on a random girl rather than in a controlled environment?From the moment Lucy is caught up, the story flies off from there with several gaps which rather grow that get covered culminating in a very bizarre climax.Concluding, this is a theme with plenty of potential but goes nowhere near reaching it. The sci-fi aspect, largely conceals the action and thriller elements of this movie and in a detrimental fashion too.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So bad I couldn't even finish it,"If you are going to give super powers by supposedly unlocking 100% of your brain atleast stop explaining it all the time why it works.

There's also no character development because as soon as her body absorbs the drug she is instantly able to kill anyone, absolutely anyone regardless if they complete innocent bystanders.

"Nothing specially, just Besson","Luc Besson with this film continues its tradition of female heroine, a super woman that easily kill dozens of men with guns. Luc is not a great director but we can not deny him a sort of charm which all his films have - as to have a signature, you just know that the director is Besson. This is light mixture of Matrix and 2001 O.i.S., not bad but not good either. Scarlett in this film played solidly, but we must admit without those of her sexy lips half of the film would not be good. All in all, a fun movie that will entertain in less than an hour and a half, and those younger or less intelligent left in doubt what are they actually watching. Although the film itself has a lot of voids and familiar Besson's visual images, Freeman and Johansson make this movie interesting. As for the end of the film, the message is: live your life, it is worth and the only thing that actually makes it valuable, paradoxically, is time. So take the time and the knowledge that you have, grow and enjoy in life. But remember - without our human feelings, without love we are monsters.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Mish-mash, ridiculous-at-times plot, but an enjoyable action flick.","Luc Besson - director of such hits as Taken, The Fifth Element and The Transporter - offers us another slice of action in thriller, 'Lucy'.The story begins in present day Taiwan, where the titular character finds herself unwillingly forced into becoming a drug mule for a new synthetic drug. Expectedly, trouble soon begins, as after a kick to the stomach, the bag containing the drug splits inside her, entering her blood stream and allowing her to use the other 90% of mankind's theoretically 'untapped' brainpower.The plot begins well, with Lucy discovering her new abilities, with some good old fashioned Neeson-esque gunfight sequences, but halfway through things start to get a little ridiculous. Whereas 'Taken' was somewhat possible, Besson has taken a more science fiction route this time, which unfortunately may lose some people along the way, but no spoilers here.As with the director's many previous movies, there is no shortfall of action. Gunfights galore, martial arts mayhem, and car chase chaos litter the Paris streets during the final act, with our female lead leaving a path of pile ups in her wake. Her new abilities also allow for some interesting sequences.Praise goes to Scarlett Johansson for her portrayal of Lucy. Her acting is one of the best female action leads there has been, and you do feel like you are taken along on the journey with her, providing you can follow the plot. Morgan Freeman, as always offering soothing baritones that help set up the film's premise, but more screen time for him would have been well appreciated.So, Lucy does leave you with the film's thought-provoking message of 'what really could happen if we were to use more than 10% of our brain?'.

"More Fantasy pretending to be Sci-Fi, than actual Sci-Fi, but a fun 90 minute romp.","I'm giving this a 7 because there's a good cast, good production, and I love sci-fi. Unfortunately there is very little real science in this movie. Writer & director Luc Besson stated that ""he admitted that he knew that some scientific assumptions were erroneous, e.g. that humans use only 10% of their brain. Nonetheless, he said that such assumption would be a great start for a sci-fi movie. Well, no that's not a good starting point if it's based on well known erroneous beliefs, in which case it classifies more as fantasy than sci-fi. I knew that going into the movie, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief on that, but the nonsense just kept getting piled on. Like when the drugs first start leaking into Lucy and she begins her ""transformation"", suddenly the laws of gravity are just thrown out the window and she's floating around the room? That's just dumb. I mean you can't even say that she was harnessing the power of her mind at that point, she doesn't even know whats going on. And it just goes on and on. Yet somehow its still worth a watch I think if you just accept that its fantasy based on very little actual science. Special effects and acting are top notch.

"Worth a watch, great sci-fi, cast and suspension","I usually only watch movies with an IMDb rating > 7 and initially skipped this one. But then 2 friends gave it two thumbs up and I decided to watch it. Very glad I did. It does remind you a bit of Limitless, but it is still packed with unique action and suspense. The pros are the great cast of actors, Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman and Min-sik Choi. The cons are that writer/director Luc Besson tries to do too much on his own. I'd prefer a different director/producer/screen writer altogether. Most people complain that the end of the movie is a let down, a bit of an amateur ending in every way. One expects a similar ending to what it is, but it could definitely have been done a whole lot better from a sci-fi point-of-view as well as a production point-of-view. It's as if they ran out of money by 10 minutes before the end. Still worth a solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
First hour great fun,"Flamboyant French director Luc Besson has a penchant for making movies featuring strong young women - think Mathilda (Natalie Portman) in Leon, the titular heroine (Anne Parillaud) in ""La Femme Nikita"", and Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) in ""The Fifth Element"". A similar idea of a youngster turned into a fighting machine was offered us in ""Hanna"".This time, we have the eponymous Lucy - a great role for the beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson - who is an American in Taiwan who suddenly finds herself ingesting a new super-drug than enables her to use progressively more and more of her mind with ultimately universal implications. If this sounds a bit like the plot premise of ""Limitless"" where NZT has been replaced by CPH4, then you can count on Besson for taking the notion further, much further, too far in fact. What starts as fun and merely fanciful finishes up as metaphysical nonsense. There are echoes here of all sorts of previous films such as ""2001"" (there are stargates aplenty) and ""The Tree Of Life"" (there is another dinosaur) and - inevitably - ""The Matrix"" (remember Trinity?).The work is visually stunning with an eclectic collection of images ranging from wildlife to cityscape to biology to cosmology and, since I saw it on an IMAX screen, at times I was close to hallucinating. The soundtrack adds to the atmospherics with use of Mozart's ""Requiem"" and contemporary songs (don't miss the one used for the long credits sequence). And the cast is very watchable with the Korean Choi Min-sik as lead bad guy and the ever-cool Morgan Freeman as lead scientist. Unusually for such an ambitious film, it clocks in a mere one and half hours and I would have been happier with a second hour in the vein of the first. But, heh, it's never boring.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brainless entertainment,"There often comes a movie which is based on a ridiculous premise that is somewhat entertaining. Lucy is one of those.There's no formal introduction of the character of Lucy except that she's living in Taipei. How she got there, who she is, what she does for a living are all left to the viewer's imagination. She somehow gets mixed up in affairs that led her to be a victim of CPH4 (blue crystals) ingestion in large quantities. (We're told by Morgan Freeman that CPH4 is produced by a pregnant woman's body in small quantities to help the foetus develop bones).The more CPH4 gets ingested, the higher percentage of brain she uses and unfortunately, the more ridiculous the movie gets. Lucy uses her enhanced brain usage to free herself from the captors and ""gather"" information about whereabouts of the other victims as her body is now craving more CPH4. She can now see the inner workings of trees and people and manages to diagnose her friend as well. She then ends up in France and makes allies with a cop to track down the other victims and contact Morgan Freeman, all while bad guys are trying to hunt her down.The visual effects and action sequences are good but they can't salvage a poorly scripted movie. One of the ridiculous moments is a call Lucy places to her mother. Any sane mother would have asked ""Are you high or on drugs?"". I don't know how other audience members kept a straight face through that. Plus there are numerous other hilarious metaphors.The final moments are over the top where Lucy becomes an all knowing all encompassing monster as she devours all the remaining CPH4, while the cop is trying to fend off bad guys and Morgan Freeman and other neuroscientists are watching in awe. And then as Morgan Freeman suggests, she manages to ""pass on"" her information.Scarlett's decent acting might be the saving grace for this movie. If you like movies like Crank, then this might be good entertainment. Regardless, remember to use only 10% of your brain while watching this.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wasted potential,"Lucy is gorgeously shot, well acted and rattles along nicely for the first two thirds of the film. There's nothing new here, but it revels in how over the top it is. There is some character development, questions asked about the nature of humanity and a healthy dose of humour.Unfortunately as the film progresses to its natural conclusion, far too much effort is expended on the special effects and little on plot development. Whilst the ending is in line with the progress of the film, that does not make for an interesting story. A twist would have maintained interest, or perhaps less time on how the last 30% of unlocking of potential develops and more time on post 100% potential.Beyond a certain point Lucy herself ceases to become interesting - she's essentially untouchable due to her enhanced abilities, and the tension derives from the normal humans protecting her development. The final fire fight is insufficiently ridiculous - it needed to reach the heights of Desperado rather than remaining loosely grounded in reality, or retaining some vulnerability of the main character as per the similarly over the top The Fifth Element.It's probably worth seeing once, but it's not a buy on Bluray. I'd rate the not entirely dissimilar Transcendence above this and friends have mentioned that Limitless is a better and more realistic implementation of the same idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
isn't it ironic?,"As a long time fan of ScarJo's unique beauty and acting, I have been angered and outraged at the length of time it took for her to get the BW solo movie, and then more outraged at how badly they messed it up. In the middle of all of this, I had zero awareness of Lucy, which says to me that Hollywood did no marketing at all, which is, admit it, another outrage. As we currently sit and watch Hollywood devour itself, I can't help but rejoice, even though I generally disagree with ScarJo's politics...or whatever she has been assigned to say. Okay. Oh, yeah, the movie. Full of so many missed opportunities in the science that it seems reminiscent of ScarJo's actual career, and full of so many ludicrous fabrications of pseudo science that a person wonders if the writers were taking the blue powder (which is not a powder at all, but rather chunky particles), every part of the movie seems like it is a parody of the real world of ScarJo, including time running out.

Only for ridiculous-sci-fi nerds,"This is a fantasy-sci-fi concept/action movie. It has a sequence of actions but no plot, and no dramatic tension. The characters are just sketches. The only people who will enjoy it are individuals who enjoy such: those of us who still like to visit the 12-year-old boy inside. My girlfriend sat with me for this DVD but mostly surfed the web.I went in with very low expectations after reading so many bad reviews, and thanks to that I was surprised to still be entertained. It has enormous flaws to be sure. Some of the acting by, and dialog for, the extras is terrible: I'm pretty sure I could do better as her mother's voice on the phone! The sci-fi is quite preposterous. The cut-scenes of animals felt very old and cliché. The ""wise words"" coming out of Freeman's mouth are careless insults to your intelligence.Lucy's character becomes robotic fairly early in the movie. This doesn't make sense (ever notice how humans are actually *more* expressive than the lower animals, not less?), and it is annoying because it makes for a necessarily boring performance by Johansson. And as Lucy acquires new abilities, I felt like asking ""Why wouldn't she just...?"" increasingly as the movie went on.So what's to like? Mostly it's just a fun concept to nerd-out on for 90 minutes, complete with lots of effective CGI.

"Eye candy with no past, no present and no future","I appreciate the suspension of disbelief, when watching a movie. It's important when embracing each individual movie's reality. Sometimes, however, a movie sets up a reality so far removed from the actual reality, that suspending disbelief to accept everything going on, is near impossible. Lucy's premise relies on a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. It was just too ludicrous, and presented in such a manner, that I had a hard time accepting it as truth - even knowing it was just a movie.The premise of the movie what it is, I found, that I couldn't care about any of the characters. They lacked depth. The movie starts with the fully formed character of Lucy. No background, no way for us to related to her at all. And we're treated to a series of somewhat inexplicably disconnected scenes, with very little actual development. Sequences that were pretty to look at, but had almost no impact on the story or the characters. I couldn't relate to anybody. Or anything going on.Luc Besson has made some movies that were unique in their own right, and movies I'll always appreciate. But this wasn't one of them.

Entertaining hogwash,"For a film predicated on an oft-repeated (and debunked) popular myth, LUCY is pretty entertaining, if a little ridiculous. Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a young woman is pulled into being a drug mule. However, interesting things start happening to her when the drug leaks into her system. Among the complaints one could lodge against LUCY, the biggest one is how thinly written the whole thing is. We are given precious little information about Lucy, and most of the other characters don't do much but further the plot along or provide exposition. Morgan Freeman is probably the most interesting of these, a scientist/professor whose field of research happens to coincide with what Lucy is experiencing. Still, the film seems to be aware of this and wastes no time in getting to the point. It follows a very fast pace, and it becomes almost a game to guess what powers Lucy will access as her cerebral capacity gets closer to 100%. There's also some real-life footage of animals and cool visual effects sequences of cells dividing and cosmic-level events which one will either take as profound or pretentious. I took it as somewhere in between, but leaning more towards the latter. I didn't really get the feeling that the film was going for a particular message, but the idea that wonder is part of what makes us human is an interesting one, as Lucy becomes less human the more knowledge and brain power she acquires. There also seemed to be the idea that knowledge makes us god-like. Altogether, it waxed fairly philosophical for an action film with a threadbare plot. Time will only tell whether or not I really love it, but for now I'm content in saying I liked LUCY a lot. Luc Besson's films have never been known for being particularly deep, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun here creating something that does make you think a little, even if it's based on an incorrect idea.

Just missed the mark,"Went to see this yesterday, my wife and i were really looking forward to this as the previews looked pretty interesting. Caught the early (11:20 AM) show and when I we walked out my wife said ""at least it was short"" and I said ""At least the tickets were cheap"".The film might have benefited from being a little longer to flesh out the flow of events better - it just seems to escalate too quickly without any sense of awe or discovery.I won't give away anything that isn't already in the trailers, but after the drugs invade her body, a normal person might think to themselves that there's something different about me, and experience some sense of anxiety or fear as to what happened to them. Not in this case, it's like ""ok, now I can do this and this and this and this and I'm a super badass assassin too"".

Time is subject to existence not the other way around.,"In critiquing the idea that existence is subject to time, as portrayed in ""Lucy,"" it's essential to flip the concept: time is actually subject to existence. The notion of time in the movie is presented as a linear, governing force that can be transcended or manipulated. However, from a more enlightened perspective, time is a human construct, a way of conceptualizing change and sequence within the broader canvas of existence. Existence doesn't unfold within the confines of time; rather, time is a tool used within existence to understand and measure change and progress. This perspective aligns with the idea that consciousness and existence are primary, and time is a secondary, derived concept.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good movie that had the possibility of being so much better.,"""If it really is CPH4 in that kind of quantity I'm surprised you're still alive."" Lucy (Johansson) is forced by her boyfriend to help with a business deal. When the deal goes south Lucy is forced into a position that she can't escape from. She wakes up with a bag of a new kind of drug inside her with instructions to deliver them within 24 hours. When she is attacked the drugs enter her drug stream with surprising effects. No with the help of Professor Norman (Freeman) she must escape the men who want the drugs back and figure out how to put her new found powers to the best use. First off I will say that this is a good movie but at the same time it is pretty disappointing. I feel like they could have done so much more with this but fell short a few times. This was much better then Transcendence but there was still something lacking to make it totally gripping and exciting. It is very much worth seeing though but temper your expectations.

"Weak story, strong making",I watched the movie at Bashundhara Cineplex Bangladesh with a great expectation. I must say the movie had a very weak story with an excellent making. Certainly Scarlett Johansson was the main attraction of the movie but she also could not do any better than this with such a poor plot. The making of the movie was great. Overall a good movie but could not meet up the expectation as it gave the notion of a great plot without a justified conclusion at the end. The acts of a person who managed to use her brain 100% should not have been like this. What she did could have been done by a strong woman of any kind. I am sure there will be many more movies in the future made on this plot but the initiator failed to meet the expectation. Thanks to Scarlett anyways for keeping the audience at the theater for the full time!,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Compelling and promising start to original science fiction film, gets cliché at end","Can I leave the film Lucy in the oven for a bit longer? Such a strong start to the movie, it just needs to cook a little more before it's ending is done.Luc Besson's original creation of Lucy tells of a woman thrust into the dark drug world of Taiwan, forced to be a drug mule. When the synthetic drugs sewn into her belly leak and are absorbed into her system, her mind's ability is expanded. Lucy turns her new-found potential and magnified powers back upon the mob boss responsible in the form of revenge.The story of Lucy is told seamlessly from three different perspectives simultaneously. The main perspective is through Lucy's experience, the secondary complementary perspective is through the lecture of a neurology professor and the third is spliced imagery similar to National Geographic footage interwoven relevantly to the scenes it mirrors. It is a unique, risky but ultimately effective directorial vision.Luc Besson takes the interesting belief that humans only access 10% of their brain function, aware it is an old wives tale and misinformed, and uses this as a jumping point for an enthralling movie. He assumes completely creative control and takes several liberties with his direction for purely artistic purposes. Lucy examines evolution and human brain function as well as the impact of the inherent human nature on the world environment in a purely hypothetical and exploratory manner. Besson also explores the concept of time in relation to human existence. All in all, the thought provoking views examined by Besson are decisive in opinion and well conceived.Eventually the film gets a bit monotonous, veers away from its initial design and becomes rife with action sequences. Certainly cool as a film, I wish Lucy had invested a more thought for a more complex conclusion.Lucy is a science fiction thriller and novel premise for a fictional action film. Note the word ""fictional"" for scientific proof and legitimacy won't be found here. Don't let that detract from the experience because Lucy is an entertaining and novel movie experience.Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a sorry movie,"Science fiction without logic, movie started strong but only survived because of Morgan Freeman. Lucy literally killed everyone except the bad guys. I mean lol.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Substitues Sci-fi for Phi-fi.,"Honestly? I hadn't really given Lucy much thought. I had seen the trailer a long time ago and completely forgot about it, to the point where when it came out in America and topping the box office I was left thinking ""What film is this? I've never even heard of 'Lucy'."" I had, I just hadn't remembered the name. The trailer instantly piqued my interest with it's whole 10%-100% of the brain dealio. I don't care if it's scientifically accurate or not, if I wanted that I'd watch a documentary. Anyway the point is it's a theory that's always fascinated me. If we did only use 10% of our brains, the possibilities we could unlock at 100% are simply unimaginable. Limitless attempted the same theory, but was decidedly bland and inconsequential. Within the first few minutes, Lucy had surpassed Limitless, and maintained it's quality throughout.Lucy, more than anything, is a philosophical sci-fi movie. It's not about the science, it's about the unimaginable. So yeah, it can get a bit unbelievable when she starts throwing people across the room with telekinesis, but it's the natural path to her destination, which is philosophical in nature and certain to spark debate. The movie, especially early on, is peppered with seemingly out-of-place shots of the order of nature. The scene of various animals getting jiggy with it even made the immature teenagers behind me annoyingly burst into fits of giggles. For me though? It added an extra dimension and weight to the overall themes of the movie. What is life? What's it's goal? Where are we, as a species, heading? The opening lines ""We've been evolving on this planet for a billion years, and what have we done with it?"" speaks volumes.Another key theme of Lucy is that of humanity and how it relates to the natural order of things. We are the only animals with self-awareness, and by extension a sense of morals. Most movies take the human side by appealing to our humanity and highlighting that it's what makes us unique. Lucy doesn't quash that approach. Instead it suggests an alternate viewpoint; that our humanity is what's holding us back and disrupting the natural order of things. The more knowledge and clarity Lucy gains, the more she becomes disconnected from her humanity; from her emotions. She doesn't feel sad or afraid, she doesn't even feel pain. They're all things that get in her way of reaching 100% brain capacity.However, this is still a Luc Besson movie, and Luc Besson likes his action scenes. Amidst all the philosophical ideas batting around, we get a lot of what feels like superfluous scenes that don't really add much. And it's true. They don't add much to the themes and ideas at all. They're pretty much put there to quicken up the pace a bit, provide some light entertainment, and to further the plot along, because the movie does still have a plot believe it or not, but I'll get to that in a minute. The more superficial scenes are very well done, as Besson is known for. Who knew a chase through Paris involving only one car could be so hugely entertaining (if a bit over-the-top; cars flipping and smashing into each other all over the place, in the middle of a busy city)? There's also quite a bit of tension early on. The introduction of Mr Jang near the beginning is surprisingly scary, as you can't help but imagine yourself in Lucy's shoes.The plot is reasonably simplistic. Lucy unwittingly becomes a smuggler of a new drug being put into the market, but a bit of mistreatment along the way results in her suffering a massive overdose of the drug giving her an explosion of cell development (thus the whole brain capacity theory). She escapes and goes on a rampage to recover the other packets of this new drug to keep her mental growth sustained. Feeling lost and confused, she also contacts a scientist who's been researching the theory for decades. Naturally everything comes colliding together in an epic climax worthy of comparison to 2001's Starchild.Scarlett Johansson isn't going to win any Oscars for her emotionless performance, but it deserves commendation nonetheless. Now, I've never been a particularly big Johansson fan. I've always found her to be just a pretty, slutty face adding little to no weight to her roles. Lucy is only the second time I've been genuinely impressed by her work (the first time being Black Widow's manipulation of Loki in Avengers). She starts the film as a bit of a bimbo. Not in a cartoony kind of way as is often portrayed, but she definitely makes a point to make this more human Lucy stand-out from her more cold and efficient Lucy later on. Also, while her performance is fittingly emotionless (as is the point), she does manage to bring a lot of weight to the character. The stand-out example here is with her phonecall to her mother, as she relives memories and experiences she shouldn't remember, like a cat she had when she was barely a year old, or suckling on her mother's teet (yeah, that got the teenagers behind me giggling as well). I wouldn't go so far as to call it a heart-wrenching scene, but it added to Lucy's character development almost purely thanks to the emotion Johansson managed to get across. Again, you couldn't help but empathise.Lucy has been getting a lot of hate, and honestly I can't understand why. It's got a good balance of action and plot, and themes and philosophy. It's 2014's intelligent blockbuster. It's got a little bit for everyone, from a car chase through the busy streets of Paris to the mind-boggling finale, from the tense introduction of the antagonist to the emotional phone-call. Maybe people are just taking the pseudoscience too literally? I didn't and instead I saw the deeper meaning quite unsubtly placed beneath the surface.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Isaac Newton worst nightmare 😂,"I've always loved and adored many of Luc Besson's movies. But ""Lucy""? This one just made me soooooo mad. It's one thing to bend the laws of physics and math for the sake of cinematic thrill-lots of action films do. However, this movie doesn't just bend these laws; it completely disregards and spits on them. Honestly, ""Lucy"" is the epitome of cinematic stupidity, and not in a funny or adorable way either; it's just plain upsetting. No plot, no acting, it's not even a good action. I can't say anything good about it.Feels like Besson got high from eating paint from the walls making this abomination.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ambitious Thriller, But Comes Up A Little Short","Luc Besson certainly knows how to create powerful female characters. In ""Lucy"" he creates the most powerful female character of all time. Scarlett Johanson plays the titular Lucy, who starts off as a student who is victimized by a bad boyfriend and some criminals. At one point you might consider her a superhero. And like many superheroes, her origin involves an accident. But this is a sci-fi film, so she is not just superhero; she becomes much more.Morgan Freeman plays a college professor who studies the human brain. Lucy reaches out to him because he might be the only person who can understand the problem she is looking to solve.This is not just a highbrow story about academia or brain power. Like many Besson films, it includes his style of gunplay. And an unusual chase scene. And bad guys. But he is much more ambitious here, taking the story into the cosmic realm, with side trips that might remind the viewer of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""The Time Machine.""The end result is an interesting film filled with special effects that bites off a little too much, resulting in a sometimes sloppy narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worth every second,"It's hard to watch ""Lucy"" and not feel the need to compare it to ""Limitless"" which had the same basic concept. ""Limitless was a great movie, but ""Lucy"" is an excellent movie - limitless in almost every way.Brilliant performances from all the actors, mind-blowing stunts and action sequences, and not to mention the outstanding and memorable car chase scene which is an absolute must-see for everyone! Nevertheless, the film may come across as somewhat higher grade. So if you are one who prefers ""My Wife and Kids"" over ""The Big Bang Theory"", ""Lucy"" is most probably NOT for you. Although the opening scene is very strong and gripping, the seemingly far-fetched, documentary-esque inserts of hunting cheetahs might puzzle some audience. How is it related to the film? It really isn't. Metaphorically, yes it is. But could they have done without it? Most definitely.The big question: will you be satisfied; is it worth your hard earned money? Certainly. However, the ending might leave you wanting more and feeling as though something is missing. The film is basically one long metaphor open to free interpretation.

She has the power,"Luc Besson has always tended towards strikingly different movies - ""Leon the Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element"" being cases in point... strange blue alien woman doing soprano opera anyone? ""Lucy"", both written and directed by Besson, is probably a 'Marmite' (love it or hate it) sort of film, as whilst it delivers a solid sci-fi story it is done in such a quirky style that some may find it distracting and irritating.Me? I love Lucy!Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) starts the film as a frightened gazelle-like student in Taipei (for reasons unclear in the film) where she is tricked into a dirty drug exchange with local Yakuza (or whatever the Taipei equivalent is) godfather Mr Jang (Min-sik Choi).Things turn ugly when Lucy is forced into becoming a drug mule and when things go unpleasantly wrong the drugs have a radical effect on her body, allowing her access to increasingly large percentages of her brain function. Unable to control the process she contacts brain specialist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) to ask for his help (not that he seems to have much of a say in things as it turns out). As Lucy's powers escalate the need for more of the drug causes her to pursue the other drug mules around the world and a collision course with Jang and his henchmen becomes inevitable.Johansson has been described as a modern day Marilyn Monroe, and you can see where that comes from in her striking curves, bone structure and pouty looks. However (as brilliantly shown earlier in the year in the excellent ""Under the Skin"") she can turn her features to an other-worldly look that suit this film perfectly.Co-star Freeman has very little to do in this film though, which is a bit of a shame: his lines seem to be rather short and sanctimonious. The words ""spare part"" spring to mind. Amr Waked makes more of an impression as the local Paris police chief who has to protect Lucy.Also worthy of note is Eric Serra's electronic score, which suits the mood perfectly.But hats off to Besson, blending '2001' like monkey business with animal sex cut-ins with a journey to the start of creation as a roller-coaster ride of dizzying speed: at 89 minutes, this is another example of 'less is more' in film running times. A brilliant time travel scene set in Times Square is just marvellously done, posing fascinating questions about the origins of intelligent man.The only disappointment for me was the ending which (no spoilers) I found rather perfunctory. However, Lucy is a mainstream film that is both thrilling, gripping and thoughtful in equal measure.

More fun than I expected,"Lucy, of course, is the name of the first human discovered, so it is apt that she takes on the same name. At the start, it is a simple delivery to a Korean mobster. Walk in, drop off the case, get paid, and leave. Doesn't turn out that simple. There are four drug packages, and each one is surgically implanted into a carrier for distribution. The premise is that people use at most only 10% of the brain capacity, and the drug is meant to enhance the ability of a person to use their brain. Her package leaks, and she takes on amazing abilities. And her exercising those abilities is what makes the movie so much fun to watch. Whether one buys into the idea or not, the movie is a lot of fun to watch and very entertaining. And of course, the Korean gang is out to recapture all of the drugs that were surgically placed into their human carriers. And she is determined also to get those drugs.

Luc Besson's comic-book movie,"I think Luc Besson really wanted to make a comic book movie, but since he is now his own sort of ""brand"" of movie-maker, he probably couldn't get a hold of, say, the X-Men or DC or even Star Wars, and why should be anyway. Because with Lucy he decided to just make ALL the comic book movies in one, with one character. This rating means not that it's really an entirely ""good"" serious action movie or a serious look at how human beings are part of this great long thing called consciousness and have evolved for years and years. I'ts more like a colossal, memorable guilty pleasure.Lucy is a fairly crazy look at super powers, and how a humans brain, once going last the ho-hum 10% functionality and by tens of percents, once tapped, we can, oh I don't know, have ""Force""-like powers to push people away with the swipe of a hand, see through walls and people, learn things with instantaneous ability, and control people's actions. Oh, and once nearing the 100% mark, a super computer with the ability to time travel and look back into the beginnings of the universe. Besson has some balls, but I think what keeps this from being totally pretentious garbage, for me, is that it's not taking itself entirely seriously....or, if it is, Besson doesn't pretend he's not making a genre movie, and complete with nasty Asian gangsters (led by Choi Min Sik of Old boy, a welcome presence and he plays every scene to the subtle-over-the-top hilt), and race-against-the-clock suspense. There isn't quite so much action as I expected, or at least from the maestro behind LA femme Nikita or Taken. Or perhaps I could just see that Besson was committing so much to the premise and exploring the bullshit science that I couldn't help but chuckle as Scar-Jo contorts on the ceiling as her body is racked by the mystery drug that, after seeping into her blood following being turned by the Asian gangsters as a drug mule, gives her the initial powers.We see what happens inside of her body as she is given this new drug, and then later when she needs more of the drug how, say, her face starts to melt and she falls apart like some wax figure. The special effects and science here is matched just right for pure wild fantasy. And most of all its good how much the Hero commits to her character, especially early on when she is just a frightened woman put into a terrible situation (when she sees someone shot, at first, it really shakes her up), and then at first when she is finding this power that turns her, in slightest terms, like the Terminator.If there is a problem its that she is so monotone through portions of it that, despite (or because) of the demands of the script, she has less to play with except for her dead-straight voice. Better is near the end where it just gets So wild that she is becoming the Matrix or something. So, in other words, Lucy is kinda stupid and doesn't make sense If you try to think about with full sincerity.But if you look at it as just pure unadulterated fantasy, And a quick one at that at 87 minutes, you'll get something... different from it, that's for Damn sure.

Completely disappointed,"This movie is a complete disappointment. Half of it is made up of cut scenes meant to be symbolical but it is rather stupid. The storyline is illogical and even ridiculous at some points. It does jumps in the story skipping the explanations of some events and explain and drag in things we the viewers never asked or wanted to know.It could be a nice popcorn movie for some who casually watch a sci-fi movie without caring or thinking about what it really has to say or for the ones look it up on IMDb and decide to watch it when see that Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman is in it. The rest of us, who expect at least a minimal sign of science or even logic in a so-called science fiction movie, Lucy is a disappointment, ridiculous and a complete waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nothing Special,I saw this movie last night with some friends. I must admit the first 30 minutes of the film were simply fantastic. The pace and promise showed initially had us all very involved in the film and excited to where the film would take us. Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman were exceptional for this opening act.The reason I gave it a 6 was pacing. The story proceeds much too quickly in the middle 3rd and Scarlett Johansson become almost robotic. The loss of human qualities proceeds much too quickly. This caused me and my group to care very little about her fate. Morgan Freeman was noticeably absent during this portion and his exceptional acting ability was sorely missed.The final 3rd of the movie was simply OK. Some will like the ending while other will abhor it. I will not give any spoilers but my opinion is that the writers and directors tried to be too clever and failed to deliver an ending worthy of the cast.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How could so much talent unite to create something so meaningless?,"I adore Min-Sik Choi. He is among my favourite living actors and blows my mind every time I see him (I implore you all to see Oldboy). Furthermore Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman are actors for whom I hold a great deal of respect for, particularly if given a good script. I also enjoy Luc Besson's work, I consider Leon to be a masterpiece in particular.So when I heard about film that supposedly combined all these talents into a high concept sci-fi thriller, I was hyped. This enthusiasm barely flattered even after the sub-par reviews came in. I hoped that, despite some rough edges an overall interesting and enjoyable film was still possible. I was very much wrong.I will start with the film's pacing. It is fairly slow in its first few scenes (the best part of the film) and shows a little promise, however it cranks into overdrive at around the 1/4 mark and doesn't allow for anything resembling character or atmosphere. This seems indicative of a harsh editing process, just like the script. It feels like deep ideas and characters may have existed in some earlier draft of the script, but not here. Everything is so rushed that it comes of as feeling dumb, flaccid and lacking in any punch whatsoever.Next let's look at the acting. Min-Sik Choi shows promise early on, and does what he can with the material, however he is totally wasted and irrelevant to the films core plot. I almost started routing for him in the end as I was desperate to see him given the material he so clearly deserved. Scarlett Johanson is also clearly trying as hard as she can, in a role that doesn't allow her to show any emotion or personality whatsoever. Morgan Freeman probably escapes with more dignity than the rest of the main cast, as he is basically playing the typical Morgan Freeman stock character, the wizened mentor. The rest of the cast come off terribly, being either annoying, laughable or dull. Particularly Lucy's 'love interest'. His hilariously bad performance almost beggared belief at times.The films features atrocious CGI, it is particularly damming for a sci-fi film when the effects are weak. This factors into the film's pathetic action, which is largely caused by the film's untouchable protagonist and lack of threat in any of the action sequences. A car chase 2/3 into the film is particularly tedious and features some awful lines from our lead.Overall, despite a team seemingly capable of birthing this ambitious project, Lucy falls flat on it's face. I was beyond disappointed as I was genuinely hyped for this 89 minute long train-wreck.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A 21st Century Version of The Incredible Shrinking Man,"I had just graduated from high school - 1956 - when I saw the movie, The Incredible Shrinking Man. I will never forget the ending as he battles what he believes at the time is the last threat to his life, when he discovers - there is yet one more surprise the universe has waiting for him. I pondered it, dreamed about it, and have thought about it many times still, over the years. Yes, I am no longer young. But age and the experiences of years season you, prepare you, inspire you, and when you see a movie like ""Lucy"" - you remember. You may indeed live as long as I have,but in the meantime, take a moment and just read the following, even it you don't order the movie on your Netflix:The Closing Monologue from the science fiction classic, The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957).""I was continuing to shrink, to become... what? The infinitesimal? What was I? Still a human being? Or was I the man of the future? If there were other bursts of radiation, other clouds drifting across seas and continents, would other beings follow me into this vast new world? So close - the infinitesimal and the infinite. But suddenly, I knew they were really the two ends of the same concept. The unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet - like the closing of a gigantic circle. I looked up, as if somehow I would grasp the heavens. The universe, worlds beyond number, God's silver tapestry spread across the night.And in that moment, I knew the answer to the riddle of the infinite. I had thought in terms of man's own limited dimension. I had presumed upon nature. That existence begins and ends in man's conception, not nature's. And I felt my body dwindling, melting, becoming nothing. My fears melted away. And in their place came acceptance. All this vast majesty of creation, it had to mean something. And then I meant something, too. Yes, smaller than the smallest, I meant something, too.To God, there is no zero. I still exist!""Very Lucy Indeed !!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Maybe a Little Crazy But Entertaining,"I have been a pretty big fan of Luc Besson's work in recent memory. He's be responsible for a lot of Liam Neeson's recent projects, like Taken and he directed the Family which was a pretty good movie as well. I thought Lucy was so good for the first hour and ten minutes. I was really shocked that the overall product could be this good. The topic is way over everyone's head but I thought Besson did a good job not to let it get too out of hand. I imagine there is a lot of stuff in this movie that is scientifically inaccurate but I tried to ignore that and I managed to enjoy it. This movie would have gotten a way better score from me if the ending wasn't so crazy, all over the place and hard to understand. I also like the casting of Scarlett Johansson. It nice to see Black Widow doing some more action movies. There need to be some more women action stars now, its no longer a man's world.

I like the concept - the idea of becoming overdosed on what is essentially super strong performance enhancers to become ridiculously good at pretty much everything has huge potential. Imagine if the Matrix and Limitless had a baby and you wouldn't be far off. The problem is that the film bogs itself down with Morgan Freeman giving lectures about the untapped part of the human brain and evolution theory with regards to intelligence, slowing the film to a crawl at times. And when the film constantly darts between a lecture theater and Lucy breaking some faces, it just feels at odds with itself.

Ridiculous French actioner,"Reviewed by Filmmining101:""Lucy"" bears all the expected characteristics of a Luc Besson production: guns, a gorgeous and strong protagonist, climactic shoutouts, stylish action scenes, a great cast and a few philosophical springles enough to tease the brain but not enough to challenge it. Dissecting the debunk case of how humans can unlock their brains' full capability, ""Lucy"" takes this idea and runs with it becoming a laughable film amidst scientific cinephiles and art house junkies. This is not the Luc Besson of ""The Big Blue"" (1988), ""Nikita"" (1990) or ""Leon"" (1994). It is ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) cranked up to 11 within the world of neurons.The French auteur is using a pseudo scientific concept to justify bonkers sequences and a briskly pace, occasionally stopping to have Johansson's charismatic heroine sprouting verbal nonsense in autistic fashion. If you are smart, you have no tact! While the main premise could set up a promising melee between Lucy and the evil drug traffickers, the script introduces several superpowers which strip away the dramatic stakes. The final confrontation is being used to add some entertaining value to an anemic plot lacking urgency or suspense. Lucy is a god and nothing can stop her driving this European production off a cinematic cliff. You will be hard pressed to find someone not laughing their guts off at the sheer absurdity of it all.Besson attempts to present an interesting case about the current state of human nature in a world absorbed by consumption and the loss of identity through a sea of evolving materialism and questionable morality. Be that as it may, the shenanigans are widely inconsistent - Lucy's powers range from becoming telekinesis to matter manipulation (!). Some of these have a few seconds of screentime and are never seen again generating the question of why bother in the first place?Yet, like any Besson flick, ""Lucy"" has its merits. It is well made, Eric Serra's soundtrack is on fire and it boasts a central performance by Johansson who slips comfortably in action oriented roles. Moving the action to Paris is just an excuse for the Frenchman to showcase his city with lots of Peugeot and to convince movie goers that Parisians are actually polite (clue, they are not). At the same time, he wastes his capable cast who are there to collect a lovely European paycheck and the villains are practically non existent (truly a wasted Choi Sik-min).Diving too much into what makes ""Lucy"" a film is like eating ice cream in summer in 50 degrees. It's a waste of time. What you can do though is embrace its entertaining value. Armed with a sufficient amount of stupidity, an appealing lead and wacky visuals, its momentum offers old school escapism. You don't have to unlock your brain to do such a thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Below Average: 4.0,"Even putting aside the ridiculous premise, I didn't really have that much faith going into Luc Besson's latest. The French action legend hasn't made a truly good film since La Femme Nikita back in 1990. That being said, he hasn't made any terrible movies since then either, and this somewhat dubious trend continues with Lucy. As is the case with most of Besson's work, anyone with half a brain will be able to follow the storylne with little trouble. Lucy unintentionally ingests an experimental drug. This raises her mental capacity to ridiculous heights, effects-driven hijinks ensue. Pretty standard stuff really, and the leaps in logic are so glaringly obvious that ignoring them quickly becomes a distraction (why push cars out of the way you could simply fly over them?). Granted, this fact does not seem to go unnoticed by the film itself, as several welcome moments of self-awareness manage to slip themselves organically into the storyline. But even knowing of its inherent flaws is not nearly enough to save Lucy from its cliched, high-concept plot and bring action.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The only thing that did save this movie from being a complete flop was a decent cast and some truly breathtaking CGI.

It starts good - pretty much like Limitless - a failed adult is exposed to a drug allowing her to use 100% of her brain and she becomes super smart and capable in a short time. But then the choices this genius makes and the stuff she does and doesn't do to get out of a dangerous situation, are just plain silly.

Can't say No to Lucy,"A life is what matters. This idiom will prove its meaning through this whole movie. And no one is able to demonstrate this better and more charming as the main actress, Scarlett Johansson as Lucy. Lucy is utter nonsense, utter chaos, love, and modern dialectic. As we are questioning the meaning of life, we rather tend to obey other circumstances which are of different matters. As such we do take notice how a wonderful main actress does a superb job in a fantasy driven action thriller. Not that it would matter, but she does entertain as action hero, in contrast to the nice and sassy blonde chick with the amazing sex appeal, we are used to. But it would be unfair to state this movie good qualities just because of her, there are too many good actors and great performances to mention them all. To be honest, the story itself is the weakest spot of Lucy. Darn it. They could have emphasised a little bit more on this topic, life and evolution, more than the average peeper deserves. Enough of her lips and tits, we wanna see Scarlet (r)evolutionize. Next time, give her a great character, a great team, and a great story. Make her real. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Scripts are the Backbones of Movies,"If ""Lucy"" is proof of anything, it is that a movie, no matter how good the acting or visual effects are, is only as good as its script.Unknowingly and unwillingly participating in a drug trafficking operation where the drugs are bagged and put inside the person's body, the bag Lucy holds within her is broken open, releasing a powerful drug which allows her to use more than 10% of her brain. She can analyze problems faster, perform telekinesis, can telepathically see around the world, and control electrical objects. However, when she realizes that without the rest of the drugs her body will not be able sustain itself, she sets out to find the other bags of drugs until she finally reaches 100%.Roll credits. Seriously, the movie ends right when she reaches 100%. Though some may conclude this to be a film with an open ending, I believe ""Lucy"" to be an entirely incomplete movie throughout. Sub plots are started throughout the movie, but are never resolved or even touched base on after it is started. For example, a cop joins Lucy to find the drugs and he says after one action scene where Lucy easily killed everyone ""I don't think I'm much help to you."" To which she replies: ""But you are. As a reminder."" And then the subject is dropped for the rest of the movie. Never says for what the cop is a reminder for (of what it's like to be human) and the conversation is pointless because it is not referenced at all throughout the rest of the movie.I'm not even going into the concept itself which is taken to the point of being extremely unbelievable to a sci-fi geek like me, and that problem also lies within the script. I think science fiction is supposed to be believable, either based on actual theories we currently use and take it to the next level (Superhero movies, ""Ender's Game"", etc.) or completely ridiculous with its own scientific rules made clear to the audience (""Doctor Who"", ""Star Wars"", etc.). ""Lucy"" tries to do both, but fails. It takes its own concept beyond belief (travelling through time and space with your mind?).Though well acted and directed, Lucy falls flat with its incomplete story and, at times, rather corny dialogue.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Throwaway sci-fi fun,"It's to know how to start this review. Lucy is filled with almost every sci-fi cliché under the sun and borrows so many aspects from dozens of other movies (including ones Johansson herself is in) that if you take it too seriously it'll be completely lost on you to the point of being terrible. It is derivative, vacuous, and slightly shallow.But, and you'll have seen from my score, it is far from a bad movie.Lucy sees Johansson's protagonist of the title caught up in a drug deal gone bad. Through no fault of her own she ends up ingesting the drug and finds her mind and body fundamentally altering and seemingly evolving to a higher plane.Already I can see people screaming 'Limitless', 'X men', and even '2001 Space Odyssey'. They're not completely wrong - this movie borrows so many aspects from these and more that it basically is a compilation of every sci-fi movie you've ever seen.But that said, while it tries to take ITSELF seriously with pretentious twaddle about evolution and psychology, it is delivered stylishly enough to be entertaining.Besson's direction is also good - there are plenty of stylish set-pieces and another of his notable works, Fifth Element, is here in spirit too. The guy does know how to produce a slick movie.The problem is the content, and the way it's delivered. The first half of the movie sees 'correlation' cut offs between what's happening to Lucy and Morgan Freeman's Dr Norman giving lectures to a crowd of academics which 'just so happen' to be explaining the nature of evolution and the primitive stage of human psychology. It's all very interesting but the idea all this is happening to her while he's delivering his very convenient sermons really pushes the envelope. Naturally she finds him and seeks his help 'because he's the only one who can help her'.Another notable flaw is the 'bad guy' is literally there for the sake of being a bad guy. He doesn't exude any fear, menace, or indeed interest, and seems wholly contrived for the sake of there being a nemesis.But, while Besson probably did intend this to be taken more seriously than it ends up being, it nevertheless entertains thanks to quick pace, an intriguing premise, and good cinematography. The visual effects are especially decent.However I have no idea why he thought it a good idea to stick Scarlett in a ridiculously sexy dress for two-thirds of the movie - don't get me wrong, I'm as hot-blooded as any other man and don't object to it, but it was unnecessary, distracting, and it served no purpose beyond eye candy. It certainly wasn't practical for the character's situation.Ultimately it was a fun, silly, well-executed if flawed movie which had designs grander than it was actually able to deliver.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A typical idea that set that bar for its fiction to the absolute max,"I love science. Naturally, I didn't like the extremely non-scientific idea at first too. I remember when the movie came out and people were like ""well people do have limited access to their brain so you never know!"". Absolutely hated that. But should my opinion on the movie be influenced my such unscientific opinions? NO! It's a movie for crying out loud! And generally, your opinion should not be influence by who supports a certain idea.I'm no expert so I'll keep it simple. The movie starts brilliantly. Scarlett proves once again she is not just beautiful. Enjoyed the directing, cameras, etc (with my very limited knowledge).What I loved about the movie was that it took the sci-fi idea of the ""100% brain access"" (such as Limitless) and shredded it to pieces; there's nothing beyond this, and I doubt there will ever be. Some might (reasonably) argue that the end was too much. Ok, yes it was, but that was the point; no movie will ever be able to take this idea to a more extreme level ever again. Plus, it was the only ending that not everyone would expect; anything ""weaker"" and you'd be like ""pff the ending was casual"".On the downside, as we approached the end of the movie, it became a bit irrational, even in its own world. Sometimes even forced. Moreover, the constant attempt to make it sound scientifically possible throughout the movie made me cringe. But I guess I should have been more prepared for this.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great concept but over complicated! 6/10,"Review: Although this movie didn't go down well with critics, I personally thought that it was quite good. It did seem very short and the main character didn't really show off her amazing capabilities in the normal world but I did enjoy it's originality and some of the action scenes. The story of Lucy is quite simple but extremely technical. She was basically kidnapped by a group of thugs who implanted a special substance into her stomach for her to carry across the border. When the substance bursts, it gives her access to part of her brain which a normal person can't understand, except for a professor who is played by Morgan Freeman. I think, the thing that let a lot of people down is that the director over complicated the storyline with technical jargon which no one can understand. He could have easily made it into a more interesting movie by slowing down the process of the brains progression and to see her take her revenge with her new powers but the movie seemed rushed and a waste of a good concept. I was intrigued with her capabilities and we're they were going to end up but I honestly think that Luc Beeson missed the opportunity to make a classic. Watchable!Round-Up: Scarlett Johansson, really isn't showing any signs of slowing down and with profits like she made with this movie, I'm sure that she will be getting many calls from the big studios. With the new Avengers, Ghost in the Shell and another Captain America in the pipeline, she definitely has made the right choices in her career and at the young age of 30, I'm sure that were going to see her challenge her acting skills with some different type of roles soon. Its always a joy to see Morgan Freeman on the big screen but he hasn't done anything major since the poor Las Vegas, which should have been better with such a great cast. He seems to be doing these bit parts which have been pretty disappointing, like in Transcendence and Oblivion so I hope that he will reach his Seven type status soon. As for this movie, I thought that the concept was great but the director wasted to much time on fancy graphics and technical jargon.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $459million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/action/mystery movies about a woman who gets implanted with a special substance which bursts and gives her special powers. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Decent action, acting below stellar...about what I expected","Lucy was about what I expected. A decent action movie with played out roles by Morgan Freedom and Scarlett Johanseen. Probably the two most interested parts of the movie were 1. The action sequences, and 2. The question of, What is the meaning of life?Unfortunately though, the characters in this movie seemed far from original and failed to really excite my interest enough to make me think or be somewhat impressed. Scarlett Johanseen's blah and robotic like acting throughout this movie, in my opinion, shows her lack of depth as an actor (these days) and poor writing of her character. I was disappointed by this, even though I overall enjoyed this movie.I gave this movie a 7 instead of a 5 or 6 because of the well played Korean boss, cinematic display of Taiwan, and the somewhat interested displayed of drug transport in the body.Overall, if you are bored and don't mind poor action and half decent action..go ahead, watch this and you will enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Call me crazy...,"...but i can't help raving enough on this movie. A lot of action movies fall out short on brains, yet this is top of the line. Whether you like it or not, you have to be attentive and focused to understand. Oh, but don't worry, you won't need to, 'cause you will be pinned down to your seat the whole ride.The story actually starts simple, but gets complicated as it goes. A girl named Lucy gets kidnapped in drug deal and something goes on about some discussion about how people's brains work and that we only use 10% of it, and some drug that could make people use their brains to 100%, and... you'll know where it's going at.Simply put, this is one of the best action movies i've ever seen. It tries to merge science-fiction and action, and i think that it's very ambitious. But, sometimes it could come out as a misfire. This one in particular, is not the case.I found every aspect of this movie perfect. From its' opening shot to the final. Character developments aside, it runs briskly and fast-paced at a rate of 89 minutes. Thrills are on the way from one scene to another. Scarlett Johansson runs the show. She gives Lucy's character to life. I don't even notice that it's even her anymore as the movie plays. The other cast done well with their given characters and although they don't give the movie more seasoning, they don't go down to be obnoxious.I heard some people really love and trash the movie at the same time. I understand why. Some will dismiss it as downright silly for the everything-is-possible way the movie goes and all the philosophy is total bull***t. But, that's not the reason to go to movies for pure logic and plausibility, right?. You go to them for entertainment. I think this movie is pure entertainment.Luc Besson has brewed a magnificent, thought-provoking, fun, silly, and sometimes weird and creepy movie. i'm hoping for more like this to come",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lucy,"Lucy is an ambitious sci-fi extravaganza, to say the least. Despite its ambition, for some odd reason, it settled on a mere 90-minute runtime. While I often tend to be a fan of short straight-to-the-point films, here, the short duration is only damaging. As such, the resulting film often feels unfocused and rushed.That isn't to say that there aren't good things in it as well. Indeed, there are quite a few of them. First of all, the concept in Lucy is great. I was all aboard with the idea of exploring how powerful the human brain might be, assuming we were able to access all of its capabilities. And while that concept and everything it brought with was one of the better parts of this film, the way it's was explored and brought to the silver screen, was one the worst. There are so many ideas and so many concepts that it tries to fit into one concise film, that no matter how long the run time would've been, I doubt it could've ever made much sense. And although I do admire the insanity that it tries to control and manage, I can't help but feel that there never was an intention to make a film that would've captured it all in a reasonable manner. However, despite an apparent struggle to contain and showcase all of these ideas, they do create a rather interesting overall product.Now, while there is a lot to like conceptually, there are also some fairly odd choices. They are thankfully apparent mostly in the beginning and slowly start to fade away as the film kicks into gear. One example, out of the many, could be the use of weird parallelisms and metaphors to help the viewer along. Early on, as Lucy, the main character, has to enter an ominous building, the film quickly transitions into a shot of a mouse entering a mousetrap. It goes without saying that Lucy is supposed to be the mouse and the building the mousetrap. Since that much is obvious without a metaphorical example from the animal kingdom, it begs the question, why was it there in the first place, and why were there others like it later? One theory, and this one of my own making, is that we humans are nothing more than animals. Not the most creative, I know, but bear with me for a second. A big part of the film and what it most adamantly tries to say is that we, humans, are trapped by our own constructs. That we would indeed be just like animals, had we not created the rules and laws that govern our lives. That idea, then, opens up the seemingly endless possibilities that could be unlocked with using our brains to their fullest capacity. Could we, potentially, control all matter and thought? Could we, even, travel through time, unbound by the laws of nature? The movie clearly thinks so. And in its attempt to make us think so as well, it paints a picture of the two different beings using those aforementioned metaphors. Animals and humans on the one hand and humans that are no longer trapped by the limits of their brains, on the other hand.As I said, it's a great concept. And although I wasn't a big fan of the heavily used parallelisms, they certainly got the point across. However, the biggest problem wasn't the concept or how it was delivered. What made Lucy difficult to watch, at times, was the clear lack of focus. That concept alone could've easily been made into a movie of its own, and it would've probably been longer than what we have here. But despite its constraining length, Lucy tries to do so much more. At the same time as it's exploring human nature and the deepest questions of our existence, it also tries to create a John Wick-esque action thriller. As a result, both parts suffer. Either this movie should've been twice as long, or it should've focused on being one thing. I think it could've been a great action thriller with the elements of revenge it had built into it. I also think it could've been a great sci-fi film had it only focused on exploring the concept it so heavily relies on. However, trying to combine the two, especially in the way it was done, created a lacklustre result that failed to make me care.But at the end of the day, despite its problems, which there are many of, there is a good amount to like here. As it explores the concept and all the possibilities that might come with unlocking our brains, it creates a visually stunning experience. And the action is also quite fun. And had it not been for the overabundance of ideas that were attempted to be included, Lucy could've been a great film. As it stands, though, it ultimately failed to make an impact on me, despite dealing with such an interesting idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst movie I have ever seen.,"I thought going into the theater that this would be an interesting take on a ""Limitless"" style movie. However the entire film becomes ridiculous, over the top, and plain stupid after the first 20 minutes. Do not waste your time with this film.Scarlett Johansen does an amazing job of playing some dimwitted girl who all of the sudden has super powers, based off the idea that you can unlock 100% of you ""mental capacity"" with some drug. However, apparently our brains are capable of telekinesis as well as time travel, homomorphism and so on. Most of which have nothing to do at all with human mental capability.

There is a serious case of overacting by Scarlet Johansson here. I didn't like her in this one. She is a real hit and miss. They try to use cheap tactics to keep you in it, but it just doesn't work.

Of course it is science fiction, but in a wonderful way. The Movie starts with a very good mix of music, the comparisons with the reality (in the movie) and the different scene with the animals, the parallel Morgan Freeman storyteller, of course the actors, and one of the most important things, that I was so fascinated of the whole movie, all the time, that I didn't think of anything else.

What starts off with promise quickly descends into a generic action film.,"Luc Besson has been a filmmaker that has consistently delivered some of the best action films of all time. From Leon to The Fifth Element, Besson has solidified himself as an action auteur. However, Lucy stands as a perfect example of seeing a legend overshadowed by a long and lengthy career. Lucy stars Scarelett Johansson as the titular character, a normal woman who is injected with a super drug. Before the film really gets going, we don't spend enough time with Lucy as what she would normally be. Before we know it, Lucy is soon injected with a mysterious serum that is some sort of super drug that is simply a more amped up version of the Limitless pill and then we slowly stop caring about her character because she is everything short of invincible at this point. Lucy's premise offers a lot of promise but its execution is something completely different. The action sequences are bland, played out and down right ridiculous. Usually that's a good thing for a film of this type, but what makes Lucy the exception is the terrible editing and poorly written plot. For the first 40 minutes of the film, you're engaged in the film. The story takes off immediately, starting with a voice-over from Johansson that proves to be pointless and useless by the end of its brisk 90 minute runtime. This is half a good film, half a really incoherent mess of a film. Johansson's attempt at being a brutal bad-ass collapses right around the time Lucy starts to access more than 50% of her brain. While her performance is commendable and she gets an A for effort, I simply don't buy it. Morgan Freeman plays virtually the same character here as he did in Transcendence and, much like that film, it gets tiresome after seeing it a couple times. The film descends into one pointless twist after another until you finally are asking yourself ""what the hell is going on?"" There are some great scenes of action that seem very carefully choreographed in the beginning along with a car chase sequence that was pretty awesome as well. Despite these two good qualities, it isn't anywhere near enough to save Lucy from poorly written dialog, terrible plot twists and an overall lack of coherence.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Bad,"The premise that humans only use a small percentage of our brain's capacity has been called into question, but that doesn't really detract from the movie.

Plenty of action scenes including a pretty good car chase and a bit of humor tossed in for good measure.Some of the action scenes are a bit predictable, but near the end of the movie things got so bizarre I could no longer suspend my disbelief.Nevertheless, it's a decent flick and I enjoyed it.

"Crap science, lacklustre action, no real characters","I'm pretty late watching this movie, but that's because I didn't want to pay for it. Reason #1, the science is bogus. The whole 10% thing had been refuted a while ago. I remember when it was all the rage, I think it was the late 80s, or early 90s, at least where I am from. I was a kid, and we were talking about it during a break at school with my friends. Not really a topic for 10-year-olds, but I was weird like that. What I can't remember is when I knew it was stupid. We now do know, there is no part of the brain going unused, or not up to its potential. I'm not going to go into details here, let's just say that when I saw the trailer of this movie, I found it weird how they could use something so archaic.The reason why I did watch it was the reviews. They were pretty good, and promised excitement, good acting. I didn't really get either. The story is quite simplistic. Much of it is taken up by Morgan Freeman narrating. Now I like his voice as much as anyone, but the substance was sometimes face-palm worthy. Also, ooookay, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and it just never did. Maybe if I had actually believed that whole premise of the movie, but since I know it's bogus, I was mostly rolling my eyes. It's not that I haven't seen fantasy or sci- fi that had unrealistic elements to it. However, this time, it felt more like listening to some Christian apologist speak in one of the debates I so love. Totally baseless, junk science. I just couldn't let myself get lost in a fantasy. Maybe if the story actually had a story. It was so cliché, simplistic and predictable, the credits rolled, and the first thing that came to my mind was: ""that was it?"" I want to go up to Luc Besson, shake him, and ask him how he could have made something so boring. It reminded my of those sci-fi shorts that were really just introducing a concept, or an idea. However, those are not fit to be made into movies. They're dry. MAybe he was trying to do that? This from the same guy who made one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time The Fifth Element. I must have seen that one a dozen times. I'll work very hard at forgetting that this mundane thing was also done by him.I saw praise for Scarlett Johansson. She plays the lead character, Lucy. I guess if you can get points for spending the majority of the film with a completely blank expression, then it's okay. Though for that they could have just used Kristen Stewart. She has that down to an artform. Yeah, I'm being sarcastic, just in case you haven't read any of my reviews for her movies. Morgan Freeman is also on the poster. He narrates. He asks questions. He stands around a lot. He sometimes sits. I don't think he was used to his full potential either. Not that people wouldn't enjoy him reading the telephone book, but really...So the story is simple, acting is not really required from the actors, so perhaps it has great fight scenes or special effects? No. Okay, there are brief moments when Lucy does something that looks cool. Like make guns fly into air. Would have been a wow moment in the 60s maybe. However, other than some people shooting up a bunch of places without much opposition is about as exciting or visual as this thing gets. I hope they didn't pay someone to come up with those fight scenes.Overall, I couldn't find any redeeming factor to this movie that would make me actually want to watch it again, or recommend it to anyone. I didn't hate it. Really. Twilight I hated for various reasons. This I was more like shrugging and marking it off the ""to be watched"" pile. Crap science, lacklustre action, no real characters, ... I just don't see a point to what I watched for 90 minutes. I can't give it more than one star. I tried to give two, but really, there is just nothing good about this, I didn't enjoy anything about it. One star it is.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cool factor high but an insult to intelligence,"Luc Besson makes cool movies. Great action sequences and fast pace. Go see this movie if you want to have a fun ride.Now comes the part about why it's an insult to intelligence.We all use 100% percent of our brain. We just do. Think about it. Would you say you use only 10% of your hand or only 5% of your nose. Almost every part of a human being is under use all the time. It's being utilized fully for what its purpose is. The notion that our brain has unused capacity is simply wrong. Our brain is modular in nature and all its parts have a specific purpose. They are all under use, all the time. There is nothing in there that needs to be run at it's ""full"" capacity to unlock secrets of the universe. It's true that with proper training you can use your brain better to remember things or stay more focused. That's just rewiring inside your brain over a period of time which comes with training and good nutrition. I say this movie is an insult to intelligence, because they reduced our potential to unlock the secrets of the universe to pumping a drug in our body. Our generation is already becoming slaves to things like smart phones and the internet, here's a movie that explores the unlimited potential of human mind using a drug. That's plain lazy thinking. Is this what was going through Luc Besson's mind: ""okay so I want to show the human race what they could do if their brain were at full potential...hmm...lets see...EUREKA! a drug could possibly accelerate this process...not critical thinking...not meditation...not hard work...a drug...that makes sense...it's so simple!""I look forward to see Interstellar which does exactly the opposite. I believe Christopher Nolan wants us to believe in our own selves (at our current brain capacity) to unlock secrets of the universe.Also what's up with Scarlett Johansson's ET like mannerisms when her brain ""capacity"" increases. An enlightened person will not act like an alien, they will act like real human beings, they will show kindness and empathy.7/10 for its entertainment value only. If Luc Besson make any claim about this movie being something more than just an action movie then a f**k y** and 1/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
science fiction clearly is not Scarlett Johansson's trade,"The idea behind 'Lucy' is interesting enough: what will happen when mankind uses more than the common 10 to 15% of its brain-capacity? For this idea producer Luc Besson researched in the world of science, having the positive effect of it showing all over his movie.So far so good. However, Besson was less happy in thinking that a subject like this could result in anything more than a common science fiction-film. Not even a prominent lead like Scarlett Johansson is able to lift 'Lucy' from its corresponding flat story.Which inevitably brings us to the conclusion that Johansson wastes her great acting talent here. Or to be more precise: the more Johansson moves away from mankind's common 10 to 15% capacity, the more her acting vanishes into thin air. It is no surprise that Scarlett Johansson's characteristic down-to-earth performance comes out best in the beginning of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Although lacking logic, Lucy is still an ambitious action film held together by a remarkable female driven role.","Rife with analogies and open-ended questions, Lucy is a science fiction film that is every bit slick, stylized and surreal, and everything else you would expect from French action director Luc Besson. Like Besson's previous films, the extent of plausibility is directly proportional to the viewer's cerebral capacity, which, believe it or not, is what the narration is all about.Using one of the most debated questions of our time – the capacity of the human brain – Besson's script begins with the visible one-thirds of a hypothetical iceberg. Documentary-like intercuts stand in for creation and existence with an opening scene on cell multiplication. This is further explained by Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman, no less) who in a conference in Paris, goes on to illustrate the cosmic relationship between death and immortality and how this relates to using 100 percent of the human brain. Freeman's main purpose in this film is to sound calm and calculated like when he presents documentaries, and to make scientific mambos jumbo sound profound, like he does in other films; using that voice, his second purpose is to bust the myth that humans only use 10 percent of their brain. Thousands of miles away, Norman's illustration becomes a metaphysical reality when Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American student in Taiwan, is tricked into working for a Korean drug lord. While another cutaway shows a deer stalked by cheetahs, it suffices to say that Lucy is naïve but not dumb because her focus soon turns to Darwinian survival. This is where Besson amps up the action when Lucy is ingested with an experimental drug called CPH4, a synthetic version of a metabolic enzyme secreted during pregnancy. As a primary effect, Lucy experiences a surge in cerebral capacity. Now at 20 percent, she is literally bouncing off the walls.Before Lucy exacts her revenge, ala dual wielding guns blazing, her transformation is shown at 10 percent intervals. This is fascinating mainly due to Johansson's performance at each interval and her character's evolution into a different being. Without giving away the best parts, all I'll say is at 30 percent Johansson's Lucy is a notch above her Black Widow in the Marvel film franchise, and way ahead of Dr. Manhattan's DC comic book world by the time she hits 70 percent. Then it gets all weird to the point where you question Besson's cerebral capacity while writing the script. With an obvious inspiration from a ton of similarly themed films, it's safe to say that the main plot arcs are borrowed from The Matrix, Transcendence and especially Limitless. Although Besson won't find much praise for originality, you could say his creation of Lucy is as much a new cinematic super hero as his Frankenstein-ish approach in creating her piece by piece. Having said that, it is imperative that the audience appreciates her flaws more than her abilities because it's more about what she is becoming rather than what she can do. Through this creation, Besson's vision is clear but it is still not an excuse for his laughable hypothesis followed by a questionable ending.Besides the unnecessary cramming of anthropology, paleontology, neuroscience and the mind boggling space-time continuum, Besson's forte is in the action set pieces and it shows. From locales in Taiwan to white-knuckle car chases in Paris, to a hypothetical encounter with our ancestral primate, the action is heavy handed even with subtle injections of humour. This might all seem traditional for Luc Besson, given his pedigree for femme fatal films like Nikita and The Fifth Element, amongst other classics. With Lucy, Besson's nonsense and lapse in logic is bearable, and at times enjoyable, thanks to the film's only saving grace and that is Johansson. Fresh off the critical success of 2013's Her and Under the Skin, both science fiction dramas, Johansson could be the new name in female driven plots, even if that means running the gauntlet with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence. But as far as myth busting goes, there's more to Johansson than meets the eye. Blond or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Interesting, but ridiculous","Here we have a movie that I honestly have to say I was on the fence about. There were many rumours swirling that this was some sort of prequel to the Black Widow. Although I knew this wasn't the case, it still made me think someone was just trying to cash in on the Avengers action girl thing which put me off a little bit.After watching it, I can honestly say this wasn't the case. This movie stands completely on it's own for the most part. The only thing about the story I didn't like was the fact it had similarities to Limitless with Bradley Cooper. Although the premise is slightly different, it definitely felt like this was the same type of scenario -- up and coming famous actor is on the verge of super-stardom and is given a slick movie with an interesting drug based story as a jump off point.That said, I enjoyed the story and the acting was excellent. Scarlett seems to be a better fit for me in these action roles rather than the drama or romance movies she does from time to time. I think that time has passed for her and hopefully she embraces these roles, at least for the next few years.I enjoyed the special effects, but I did find it a little far fetched...and yes, I know it's a movie, but hear me out. It was supposed to be kind of based on fact, but they took some serious liberties with this as the movie went on to the point of ridiculousness. It was a little over the top for me in the end and I would have enjoyed if it stayed a little more grounded. There was a particular part with a computer towards the end that I thought was kind of ridiculous and didn't make much sense, but I get where you are coming from if you don't agree with.So in the end I felt like this movie was an enjoyable watch, and I'm glad it was successful, but for a reality based movie it became a little too ridiculous for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If you're the kind of person that likes sciency / sci-fi movies, you will probably not like it","The plot line centres around a popular myth about the human brain, but fails to make it believable. Instead, the script contains about 15-20 mins of pseudo science lecturing by Morgan Freeman, which should, in theory, bolster the premise, but falls miserably as the actual supporting content is pretty ridiculous if you have any basic scientific literacy.In terms of scenes, there are a couple of long sequences where nothing really happens. You'd be well advised to use these for your bathroom break. The same goes pretty much for the first 10- 15 mins where everyone but Lucy speaks Korean and there are no subtitles. Don't worry, nothing that critical happens.In terms of acting, I'm not a great expert, but that film doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would pose a particular challenge for actors like Freeman and Johansson. Morgan Freeman reprised his typical (and probably clichéd) role of an authority figure. If you've seen it before, you will see it again. Johansson, on the other hand, had the more challenging task of appearing confident and unemotional, but also likable.Overall, the plot was uninspiring and the actual writing does little to make it more bearable. There is some nice CGI and a bit of dispersed action and shooting of random people.

Almost There Lucy,"We all know Luc Besson and his style of directing. Lucy had some action in but just not enough for me. It seemed like right when I got comfortable the movie was over. The movie is only 1hr and 28mins but that is plenty of time. Since the movie started out with the plot I thought, ""Great, that means plenty of time for action"", and I feel like it just wasn't enough. Just a tad more would've been fine. But the film is decent. Glad I used my free movie ticket for it though. The fact that it made way more than ""Hercules"" and that film cost over double of ""Lucy"" lets you know something.

"A very intersting theme with an okey-dokey plot + a few problems with some of the characters , the way our protagonists deals with problems = ok movie , I don't watch it again","Besides what I've already mentioned in the title , the only thing I want to say is that is a good movie to see with your dad when he's having a hangover, cause he's always going to tell you every single scene , though you are there and you see it with your eyes .

Flawed yet enjoyable.,"""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale.""The movie explores the famous theory about how we only use 10% of our brain. Our protagonist, with the help of a new drug, manages to use a lot more than that. Scarlet Johanson did a pretty good job as the lead, going from a normal women to an extremely smart and powerful being. And you had to have a wise guy to give exposition about the concept of the movie and who better to have than Morgan Freeman. He was, as always, great.Now the movie had some really cool concepts and ideas, and some REALLY good scenes. But you have to be willing to apply a lot of suspension of disbelief because there is some really unbelievable stuff in this movie. If you go on wondering about the logic of it all, you'll ruin it.The not so good execution of certain elements stopped it from reaching greatness. First of all, the whole Mafia stuff was extremely pointless after Lucy got her powers. They should have focused on her powers and similar plot elements instead. What makes it more annoying is the fact that movie was really short, about 1 hour and 20 mins in duration only. A longer duration with more emphasis on her powers, development etc would have made it a lot better, instead they montaged her powers in the end. Then, like I mentioned earlier, the plot is really unbelievable. Even if you suspend lot of disbelief, you'll still be like WTF in many scenes.The CGI was okay-ish. Some scenes looked good while some clearly looked fake. Don't blaming it much though considering it only had 40 million $ budget.IN a way, this movie was somewhat like Transcendence, great albeit not a new concept and stuff but not so good execution. Good thing for this movie though was that it was still entertaining despite its many flaws. You'll definitely have a good time with it and might even wonder about philosophies and ideas depicted in the film.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Another reason why CGI has ruined life,"While this is impossible, Hollywood should never have been given the keys to the CGI kingdom. Fantasy and science fiction have been turned into absurdity, as evidenced by this awful film. More magic and nearly everything fake, Lucy the flick fits into the nonsensical -- and silly -- comic book movies designed merely to separate money from families and over stimulate the kids. Tell a story? Nah. Employ real acting? Nah. Kill a ridiculous number of people? Sure. It gets two stars because Scarlett is a delight to look at and she's married to comedy nerd writer extraordinaire Colin Jost.

An average movie,"I was very disappointed with the movie, but I guess I had bigger expectations than I should have. Scarlet was the reason I vouched for this movie, and she was appealing and pleasant to watch, but the other actors, except Freeman, didn't impressed me much. The movie started a bit in the rush and was promising a thrilling plot, but it was less than that. Instead we got an average Hollywood spoof with lot of scientific misconceptions, that promised to give us intelligent, philosophical thoughts and it was all except that. The Revolution and Evolution theory was interesting for the starter, but it's a thing that every nature science student is being taught, and the movie doesn't pass anything above that. Almost all other scientific stuff is fiction and that's not the way how science- fiction movies should work. Sci- fi is a genre that should contain fictional elements out of scientific background, not otherwise. But hey, it's Hollywood, and we are somehow used to it. Regarding the action part, Luc Besson likes to rush things and give us fast, wordless, action scenes, but here, he missed the plot completely and therefore I thing he should stuck with plain action movies instead with the wannabe intelligent sci-fi fantasy movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A terrible movie with a few good ideas,"Lucy feels like a misplaced mash-up of silly sci-fi and a weird theoretical documentary, spiralling drearily from its boring beginning to its mind-blowingly pretentious ending. Sadly, it fails in both genres, sacrificing promising action for undue intelligence and coherence for unnecessary visual intricacy, eventually creating a film that is so wrapped up in its far-fetched ideas, it cannot fathom even itself. However, there are certain brief moments in the film that are strangely interesting, occasionally even stimulating the mind beyond what is expected of a common Hollywood action film. That being said, those moments are extremely rare, and barely make up for the overwhelming awfulness of this ridiculous mishmash.The film begins with our hero, Lucy (played by the wonderfully distant Scarlett Johansson), being blackmailed, witnessing the death of the guy who blackmailed her, and crying an awful lot. Even from the beginning, as the dazed lighting, lack of definite setting and deliberately pretentious cuts to random nature shots (which are even more poorly lit) suggest, this movie has a bloated idea of itself, not realizing that it has provided nothing in its initial few minutes to hold the viewer in any way. Even the subsequent scene in which Scarlett Johansson is interrogated drags on for an awful long time, eventually becoming boring and repetitive.The movie eventually finds a premise: Lucy is exposed to some fancy new drugs which gradually allow her to use an increased amount of her brain, turning her not only into a lethal killing machine, but also an omnipotent goon with a Messiah complex. With all this new brainpower (and also the knowledge that she is going to die within the next 24 hours), she decides to bequeath her newfound knowledge to humanity, choosing a theoretical neuroscientist (Morgan Freeman) to be her disciple. This choice is made without any explanation, but whatever.Although my interest in the film remained nonexistent up until this point, I began to feel a certain vile hope creep up upon me, that hope manifesting itself as the promise of crazy, telekinesis-fuelled action scenes. The film had finally slithered past its horrible beginning, its ridiculous premise, and now could proceed into passive, violent oblivion. But, unfortunately, the film saw it fit to avoid such action for completely unnecessary visual eye-grabbers, and mundane sci-fi chatting. The action is thin, kept to a minimum, and slightly disgusting. It feels like the product of the mind of a teenager: unevenly paced, poorly filmed, pretentious, and laughable. Even the characters are unwatchable, being either stunningly wooden, evil, or simply boring.But eventually the film reaches its ending, where Lucy travels back in time and learns everything there is to know. That one short scene should have been a movie within itself. The visuals are breathtaking, but divinely subtle as well, picking apart what we think we know and showing us what is beyond the limits of our knowledge with such ease and fluidity, that it is hard to dismiss it. Of course, it's all unfounded nonsense, but it's stunning unfounded nonsense. Then, as a final reminder of how terrible this movie is, it shows us that all that was just an excuse to make Lucy into God. Huzzah. The End.This film isn't really sure what cinematic path to follow, and its failure to span two at once makes it entirely unwatchable.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Probably hit or miss for most viewers,"This movie has an interesting premise but doesn't do much with it. It has many, many flaws and you'll have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it. A lot. Virtually every minute.See, the main problem isn't that much that the entire movie bases on the myth that we only use 10% of our brain. I am okay with that, you take this one thing, establish that this IS true in the world this movie takes place and then go with it. But everything else isn't any better. Our brain is doing ONE thing: Thinking! So this drug would make us super smart but that's it. But in the movie the drug allows her to do everything from telekinesis to shapeshifting and outright magic. There are lots of scenes with pseudo-science talk that tries to explain this but you don't need to be a scientist to know all of it is more than fiction, it's fantasy.On top of all that pseudo-science you'll also get an even bigger dose of pseudo-philosophy. I don't know if they just mixed every remotely related eseteric theory or if it's the fault of the mostly horrible dialogues, but seriously, most of the science and philosophy talk in this movie sounds like they took all the rejected ideas that Lindelof wrote for LOST but were considered too crazy or corny even for him!If it was just the bad science and corny philosphy, I wouldn't complain, though, as long as it's just a vehicle for a fun action movie. However, it also affects the script and movie.
First, there are many illogical scenes that wouldn't even work within the bad science we get presented. For example Lucy just watches someone speaking a few lines of mandarin and a moment later she is fluent in that language. No matter how smart, you can at best learn the words that have been spoken. Or, later she begins to disintegrate when she is running low on drugs. She literally lost many of her teeth, her skin was peeling off in clouds of dust >and eye was displaced<. Then she takes more drugs and the process isn't just stopped, it magically changed her to the state she was in minutes earlier.But more importantly, the authors somehow wrote themselves into a corner about one third into the movie because at that point she was already a being with superpowers that nobody could match and here adversaries are still simple humans. During her next encounter with the bad guys there is no fight anymore, she just makes them float around.
So, in order to still have some action scenes, what did they do? Lucy forgets about her superpowers, locks herself in with those scientist to have a slow verbal conversation about her current state even though she is about to build a supercomputer and store every information she has. This forces the poor police to fight the bad guys themselves even though Lucy could have dispatched them easily within a minute or so.And once you start looking for things like this, you'll notice them everywhere. The very first thing she does after the drugs start powering here is killing half a dozen henchmen with ease within a second. She kills guards without flinching, even that poor guy on the operation table. But she lets the crime boss that is responsible for all of this go without killing him? And again, later, in the police station, she does it again with the captain of the henchmen? Just so we can have another unecessary encounter with them later?
Lucy does, however, kill a lot of innocent byspenders during her car romp through Paris. I mean, yes, we don't see anybody get killed on screen but come on, that many crashes, flipped cars and so on can't be without casualties.And most of this would easily be avoidable. All they would have needed to do is one of two things:
A) Either tone it down and give her superpowers later in the movie, bit by bit
OR
B) simply let that henchman captain eat some of the remaining drugs at some point so he gets superpowers as well so we can have a proper fight!But as it is this movie doesn't work as SciFi thriller because the science is so bad, it doesn't work as a philosophic or fun movie because Lucy doesn't really do anything with it, but it also doesn't work as an action movie. I don't even know why many claim it to be one, there aren't many action scenes and the ones we have are either unnecessary, short, underwhelming or a combination of those.So, why do I still rate it 6 then? It still got that many stars for the eye candy and generally everything else that hasn't to do with the plot. Johanson played well in the first half (later on she is like an emotionless robot) and the special effects were quite good. I was also pleased to see authentic set pieces in Taiwan (I have family there, so I can tell it's genuine). The movie has a lot of potential but it just doesn't know where to go with this.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This doesn't classify as Sci-Fy,"Sci-Fy as I understand it is based on science. There was nothing science related in the movie, they just inserted a bunch of sciency terms to make superpowers sound more legit.For the record humans use 100% of their brain. The brain has to maintain resting potentials to work properly. Also the movie completely ignored the laws of physics.Okay, now for the plot. Character development: Girl gets superpowers, end of story. Plot: There was an inciting incident, the movie got that right, but aside from that, there was no clearly defined goal for the protagonist and there was no real confrontation for the protagonist.Verdict: There is no redeeming qualities for this movie, both the science and plot have failed miserably.Last comments: I have no idea why respectable actors such as Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman would waste their talents like that.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ugh.,"I really think modern action movies are ruining good scifi. This is a perfect example.Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. Instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feels incredibly stupid. I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I'm accustomed to suspending reality for the sake of fantastical storytelling, but this is just bad. The dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far between.Scarlett Johansson is totally unconvincing at playing the emotionless aspect. She's supposed to play Lucy as if she has no emotions, but instead it comes across as her trying desperately to convince us that she has no emotions. But before Lucy gets her powers, she's also pretty bad, totally unconvincing and probably more laughably bad when she's trying to play a woman with fear for her life. What a misfire of a performance, although she tries hard enough and isn't nearly as obnoxious and as downright ugly as the film around her.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Black Widow is on drugs!,"Quickie Review:Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), is captured by a criminal group run by the crime lord Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). She is forced to be a drug mule for a new designer drug that accidentally leaks inside her. The overdose results in her unlocking 100% of her brain's capacity, becoming an unstoppable warrior intent on getting revenge. The concept of a person reaching super human level capabilities through some drug and then going all badass is intriguing for sure. Also Johansson is no stranger to being a badass in movies, so she plays well as the lead. The problem remains that the movie concentrates so much on delivering on the style that you'll not care for the little substance there is.Full Review:So, Limitless + Black Widow + Neo from The Matrix? Hell yea count me in! That triple threat combo is exactly what I thought when I first saw the trailers for Lucy, so you could imagine I was quite pumped to watch this movie. Unfortunately I underestimated the epicness of that combo and Johansson ends up being so overpowered that the whole sense of danger is taken out of the movie.If you have seen the recent Marvel movies especially Captain America: Winter Soldier you know that Scarlett Johansson has proved to be a great action star. Lucy gave her the perfect opportunity to be the lead in her own action film, and she owns it for the most part. It was entertaining to see the sudden change from a vulnerable young woman to a methodical killer. The powers she has gradually increases over the duration of the movie, but about the half-way point it is abundantly clear that she has become a generic powerful killer. The power takes all the tension out of the action scenes because there is not going to be any real danger for you to care about. As for becoming an overly methodical killer, essentially all character is sucked out of Lucy and you are left with a emotionless robot that you can't relate to.Director Luc Beeson is a very visual director, and that is the strength of this movie. All the action scenes are very well filmed. There are no cheap tricks like shacky cam, the shootings are all very well edited and paced. There is one car chase that is definitely one of the best in recent memory. So I must give credit to the visual style. There is one thing that Beeson tries that I think will get some mixed reactions. In the beginning few times some national geographic type clips of animals are shown to mirror what's happening in the movie. I personally found it to be interesting but then it's not used at all. It's as if Beeson lost all confidence in this experiment. Why do it with half effort? Either follow through or don't do it all.Lucy is not a terrible movie, there are some things to enjoy. As a whole I wouldn't recommend paying full price to watch in cinema.

"Great, unusual concept, but mediocre implementation. Still recommended though.","Fiction / action movie. A truly pioneering concept, what would happen if the human brain could perform at 100% of its potential at the same time (although the 10% mentioned is more just a myth rather than reality). The title itself suggests the development of intelligence and evolution since a discovered skeleton of modern humans ancestor was named Lucy. So an ordinary girl gets involved in drug trafficking before she realizes it, only that the new drug is based on a substance that is produced during the embryonic stage of development. Eventually it ends up in an increased amount in her blood and begins to overstimulate the brain. That's where the imagination and the action begin. Obviously, there were plenty of exaggerations especially towards the end of the film, but this is a fantasy film and not a scientific research. Very good acting by both Johansson and Freeman, a lot of imagination especially before the end and a really unusual concept, which only reminds me of The Lawnmower Man (1992) with the increase of intelligence and the end. Unfortunately, despite the great idea and the very good performances, the film did not have a decent script, nor enough imagination or action as a whole, while it could well be developed for at least another half hour to show more imagination or action with nice effects focusing on the increased abilities. Great idea, but poor implementation. It is recommended, but it could be much better.6.5 / 10 from me",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Crazy concept but entertaining,"The concept this film tries to explore is interesting but I feel like they got lost somewhere along the way while doing so. As the film starts, we see professor Norman explain to a class that humans only use 10% of their cerebral capacity and he proposes a theory of what would happen if we could somehow use more. The idea is good and part of his theories are too. Then we see Lucy, who actually gets to use more than just 10% of her cerebral capacity and we see the changes she goes through as she reaches 100%. My main issue with this film is that I felt like somewhere along the way they reached a point where they ran out of ideas and decided to turn this supposedly sci-fi film into a fantasy film. Some of the action scenes felt a little bit forced and out of place. I did enjoy watching this film nevertheless, the pace is good, the acting is good and the visuals are great.

"Long on fiction, short on science","""Lucy"" is more wish fulfillment fantasy than anything else. Wouldn't be great if we all had God-like powers locked away in our brains just waiting to be released (kind of a metaphysical version of a letter from Hogworts). Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) experiences this cognitive renaissance when she is forced to mule an experimental drug hidden in her abdomen by a vicious Taiwanese drug-lord. The drug, a synthetic prenatal hormone, allows her to vault past human (and physical) limitations and archive 'The Highest Possible Level of Development'. She eventually meets up with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) a pseudo-scientist and expert on the quiescent 90% of our brain while an army of the nattily dressed gangsters search for her. A massive gunfight (borrowing heavily from The Matrix) accompanies a trippy extra-corporal experience (borrowing heavily from the 2001: A Space Odyssey).

Not up to Besson's high standards,"Luc Besson is one of our modern auteurs, with films like Leon, The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita, or Taken. In the Lucy tale, an innocent woman is captured by drug lords who stash a developmental hormone drug in her belly to smuggle it into Europe. Then they make the mistake of kicking her and releasing the drug into her. She turns into a superhuman who can use much more of her brainpower than you or I, and initially kills the drug lords like flies, but then realizes she has a bigger mission.Lucy has an interesting premise: what if the human mind is somehow capable of much more, including telekinesis, levitation, and all those things we occasionally dream we could do. The film posits that current science of the brain is not even scratching the surface, and consciousness can control matter. Fine.The problem is that it portrays current science incorrectly at a level that will make any educated high school student cringe. Nothing is wrong with the premise of the film, but if something transcends our current knowledge, at least present current knowledge as we know it correctly at the high school level. (1) Life arose well over a billion years ago. (2) The 10% brain thing is pop psychology of the 1950s. It's 2014, Luc! Etc. And if high school students will giggle (like the ones who sat next to me in the theatre), imagine someone who knows a bit about the current state-of-the-art in neuroscience!Moral: If you're going to use bad science, as opposed to extrapolate good science, at least don't flash a %-value on the screen every 10 minutes as a reminder !La Femme Nikita is just a much better film in the same genre: a woman turned into a deadly weapon that goes out of the control of her handlers. Lucy is a return to familiar fare for Besson, but he got it right the first time around, and ultimately fails here. If mathematics does not describe the secrets of the universe, how come you can summarize Lucy's important knowledge on a USB memory stick? That's a math-based device.The film features many interesting ideas and shots, like the cutting between Lucy/druglords and a gazelle/cheetah; or the scene about cell division, sex and birth, although the religious crowd will not like the interposition of animal and human behavior. And of course there is the Lucy that started it all in East Africa, whom modern Lucy gets to meet once she controls time. For these and other good ideas, the film still gets a 6. But for the lame science (spewed with laughable authority by Morgan Freeman), lame dinosaur action, stupid plot holes that don't belong in a film with high aspirations, and the ""Lucy is the Matrix"" ending, that's as high as it goes. I recommend seeing La Femme Nikita again instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cinematography showcased visually stunning sequences, and Luc Besson's directing skillfully balanced action and philosophical themes. The writing delved into intriguing concepts of human potential but occasionally veered into over-the-top territory.

"Good graphics, but boring plot.","""Lucy"" by Luc Besson, plays on an intriguing notion that humanity, if capable of using more than just 10% of their brain, could achieve incredible feats, and practically become gods.""Lucy"" is about a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) who quickly finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. When forced to deliver some drugs inside of her lower tummy, the package accidentally opens releasing the drugs into her system. However, rather than killing her, the drugs unlock her brains full potential.Although the movie was not incredible, I did find it visually entertaining. Furthermore, the movie was full of action and interesting perspectives on the theory of evolution. However, the plot was a little underwhelming. There were many times where I was hoping the story's action would be a little more ""up close and personal"", instead, we are given ""Limitless"" meets ""The Matrix"". Which by themselves are perfectly good movies, but they could have maintained some element of Lucy's humanity as it was very hard to relate to what she was experiencing. In the end, it was as if she became like ""Amazo"", or ""Data"", which I understand was the director's intent, but it would have been interesting to see what Lucy would have been like had she maintained all of her humanity.Overall, ""Lucy"" was entertaining, but it is not something I would go and see again. For this reason, I give ""Lucy"" a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great as long as you don't use more than 5% of your brain,"This movie is a terrifically entertaining popcorn action flick that could probably benefit from a little less pretension and a little more common sense. But if you go into this movie just looking for a stylish action flick, it's fun.The movie is based on that old myth that humans only use 10% of their brain, and tries to imagine what someone was like who could maximize their brain usage. When an ordinary woman named Lucy accidentally absorbs a huge amount of a new drug, her brain starts ramping up and she becomes, as the percentage increases, a super soldier, a superhero, and a god.The movie is slick and stylish. It's often gimmicky, as in a scene where Lucy's first meeting with some bad people is intercut with wilderness footage, but it all works quite well.This is the sort of movie you could really pick apart. The problem is not that the 10% brain thing is BS, which doesn't bother me at all, but that the movie is often sloppy in its internal logic. For example, Lucy types on a computer and she's so fast that hundreds of windows are opening and closing, but a laptop is not mechanically capable of that speed. And if you accept that Lucy is using her mind to control the PC, then WHY IS SHE TYPING? And no matter how souped-up Lucy's brain becomes, it wouldn't allow her childhood brain to have taken in the sort of data she recalls.The movie is silliest when it has Lucy describe what it's like to be a super mind. There's a lot of talk about memories and sensitivities and time that all sounds like what someone tells you when they're describing their acid trip. The truth is, if someone were that smart, they would probably have difficulty talking to us at all; we would be animals.Still, it's lots of fun, and I do recommend it for all its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Review Nr 1000:A bizarre mix of guns, Scarlett Johansson and Einstein's relativity theory.","Seen this sci fi gun flick before, remembered it as a ludicrous incredible story. That is true. But if you look at it from another point of view then this movie can still be enjoyable. It sure has got speed, action and suspense.The weakest point however is the impossible ludicrous story. What is the ludicrous story about? Scarlet Johansson becomes a forced drugmule at gunpoint. The drug she carries however accidentally gives her superhuman capibillities, that is the ludicrous part of this story. How ludicrous? Well, she can melt with machines, she can stop bullets, travel through time back to the dinossaurs. Ludicrous enough?Still there is something to be applauded for in this picture and that is it's guts. It dares to try mix a normal gangster movie with vague scifi nonsense. And surprisingly enough I watched it till the end, however bizarre and plain stupid the story was. Normally I really dislike implausible stories, let alone this kind of bizarre time travel story. But somehow director and writer Luc Besson pulled it off. It could have been better though with a more credible story, now it is merely a good action packed scifi B movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Interesting story and enjoyable movie, for the most parts...","I was initially recommended to sit down to watch ""Lucy"" back in 2014, but I skipped on the movie as I am not a fan of Scarlett Johansson. Then in 2021 another friend recommended the movie to me, so I figured there might be something to it, and I sat down to watch the movie.I didn't know that it was a movie written and directed by none other than Luc Besson. And that alone pretty much guarantees some sort of entertainment.And yeah, Luc Besson does deliver with the 2014 movie ""Lucy"". I will say that it was definitely a surprise of a movie, and I was thoroughly entertained by what the storyline turned out to be.Well, that goes for the majority of the movie. It was a great action ride that gives you something to actually think about. But then Lucy reached 70% brain capacity and the movie just crumbled underneath itself. At that point the movie went from being really interesting and captivating, to just becoming downright ludicrous and laughable. Everything that writer and director Luc Besson had established and built throughout the course of the movie crashed hard as Lucy progressed from 70% to 100%. Now, I will not give away what happened here, but it was definitely a slap to the face of the viewers with a cold, dead fish.Visually then ""Lucy"" was a pretty astounding movie. The visual effects department definitely knew what they were doing, and the effects were gradually layered onto the movie as Lucy's brain capacity increased. And it worked well in favor of the movie.""Lucy"" has a pretty good cast ensemble. Now, I am not overly keen on Scarlett Johansson's acting talent, but she actually was nicely cast for this movie and performed quite well. Needless to say that Morgan Freeman delivered his usual spot on performances here. I found it a very interesting, but really great, choice that they hired Choi Min-sik for the movie, because he is such a mammoth actor and really brings something unique with him, so he was a marvelous addition to the cast list.I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie right up to the 70% brain capacity marker, then it was just crumbling to pieces. Had writer and director Luc Besson opted for something else, the movie would have fared better. My rating of ""Lucy"" lands on a six out of ten stars, and it was that last 30% of the progress that dragged the movie down.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Weak,"It's sad to see Besson sort of losing it. There's a footlooseness in Lucy that reminds you of his early stuff: But his early stuff is more enjoyable. It's hard to pin down exactly why. But I'll try.Lucy loses it because it's just plain weak. The premise and setup is morally hazy. It just doesn't compute, in the sense of metabolizing into compelling development. I think that, as time goes by, I have less and less patience for hyperbolic, action-flick, urban fairy tale-style ""evil""; and this flick's setup sequences establish exactly that. Sorry, but I guess I prefer human-dimensioned evil in my urban fairy tales, unless you're pointing the projectile over the wall of my credulity and firing all rockets, like, say, Robert Rodriguez, or a lot of fantasy/sci-fi (like Guardians of the Galaxy).To me the whole sideshow involving Freeman and his coterie was an attempt to gussy the proceedings up with a Greek chorus. It was supposed to add theoretical rigor/gravitas, but just winds up coming off like cheap VO exposition of dubious scientific provenance, writ large.There is a mythic element, and it's the ongoing play on the concept of a young woman moving toward an inadvertent, human-manufactured goddesshood, a la Dr. Manhattan. OK, that's sort of cool, and the film does deliver something compelling on that myth. It redeems the flick a little. But it still doesn't feel like enough. It's not an adequate basis for a 90-minute sitting.In general, I found the film weak, and weakness in a film irritates me.I can't recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fun, but Fundamentally Flawed","The core premise of ""Lucy"" is fundamentally flawed. Lucy is inadvertently given a drug which allows her to access more than 10% of her brain, giving her superhuman powers. For the record, it is NOT TRUE that humans only use 10% of their brain. If you replace the phrase ""unlocked x% of her brain"" with ""unlocked x% of superhuman capability"" or something like that, it's much more bearable. Further, the movie presents itself as a thinker movie, when in reality it is more of an abstract expressionist movie. It doesn't give you literal or realistic explanations for things (anything, really), instead it gives you flashy visual effects designed to give you the sense of what is really going on (which are, admittedly, really cool and very well done). The acting is solid, though as an actor I'd be thinking ""this is bullshit, but I'll say it anyway"". Luc Besson's wacky and weird style with a laser focus on small details remains present, but he has done and could do better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not terrible, if you can get over the (lack of) science.","The main problem with this film is its classification as Science-Fiction, because the science aspect is laughably awful. The myth of humans only using 10% of our available brain power was debunked a long time ago (although I can understand why it persisted given the terrible decisions most of us make on a regular basis).That said, the film does have some plus points - production values are high and the acting is generally good. The first half in particular contains some scenes which generate genuine tension - it's not hard to imagine oneself in a situation (like Lucy) where your fate is completely determined by others and your life is of little concern.Unfortunately the second half of the film is something of a mess, with action and special effects taking the limelight rather than the story or dialogue. It would have been nice to find out a little more about Lucy and how she came to be in this situation.Overall I'd say this film isn't terrible, but I think an opportunity was missed to create an interesting and compelling story.

"Full of action, thrill but this is Sci -Fi","As a story, you'll either love it or leave it. It contains all the traditional elements of good SciFi. At the same time, it's sooooooo outside the box, it doesn't fit into any one genre. It's Action-filled, Cerebral, Intellectual, Metaphysical, Medical, and Gadget driven.In short, it touches all genres of SciFi.When a synthetic drug pushes Lucy (Scarlett Johannsen) to reach her full potential--even against her initial will--she sets off a chain reaction that comes to an unexpected end for those who created the drug... the Drug Lords who've masterminded it... the police who try to stop it with Lucy's help... the unwilling victims who've been coerced into carrying it across international borders.... and us, the viewers. This theme calls into question our biological behaviors, sociological behaviors, and intellectual presumptions. Based on the fact that we use such a small percentage of our human capacity, it asks us to ponder what would happen if we did develop our ""full potential"".

Good til it got weird,"So Lucy was pretty good until it got kinda weird. Weird is probably the best description I can think of for the events that occurred in the latter quarter to one-third of the movie.Conceptually the movie touches a cool subject. As human beings we only use 10% of our brains, what would happen if a person achieved 100% usage of her brain? Lucy (Scarjo or Scarlett Johansson) was exposed to a drug that allowed her to use 100% of her brain.Parts of this movie reminded me of Natural Born Killers in that there were several cutaways to file footage of other things that could be symbolic or relative to what was being said or perhaps felt. There were some exciting moments and some awesome moments, but then the movie got way too esoteric and almost metaphysical. A valid and plausible theory became mystical and almost comical.

"Great film, but surprisingly short","As with most Besson films this one is great. Well plotted, paced, acted and visualised. It is only 90 minutes long, and that almost seems a shame. There was a great deal more which could be explored here, and I would have been happy with a longer film or a series. I guess the reserved nature avoids too much 'using of the force' but I would have like more screen time here. I guess as it stands it the opposite of The Matrix which kind of deals with similar themes but messed up with the sequels. I feel that this film has fallen under the radar. Friends may have seen it, but it lacks the fandom Besson's films usually have. But I don't think it was a mis-fire. It's a good film that simply didn't catch on with mainstream audiences.

"Take an idiotic premise, and then inflate it to the nth degree","So there's this pseduo-science myth that we only use a tiny fraction of our brain capacity.

Now look at that equivalent space in the trunk. If only we could activate that unused potential in the trunk, right? If this movie was working with the equivalent of that flawed analogy, by the end of the movie they'd be utilizing all the potential in that empty space above the car, extending up into the upper reaches of the atmosphere.I'm not someone that demands scientific purity, necessarily. I expect a certain amount of artistic license to be taken for the sake of a more entertaining experience, but they just keep piling on more and more absurdity to this flawed concept, with Morgan Freeman doing a banal voiceover narration of the complete nonsense as if his voice, alone, can overcome the fundamental stupidity that they keep doubling down on throughout the movie.

Return of the 10% of the brain myth,"What's interesting, Luc Besson thought the myth was fascinating enough and hasn't been used sufficiently in other medias to make a new movie about it when it's been proven wrong already.What this movie does well, it's starts a conversation about it for everyone who hasn't heard (enough) about it yet.My first impression was that 'Lucy' is going to be a really bad movie, just existing so that Scarlett gets to be a Superhero as well, since in the Marvel movies she has no superpowers. But 'Lucy' is actually way more than that.Especially the ending was interesting and even if the 10% statement is wrong, the movie could even work if they didn't involve the percentages. In it's state, it is a well portrayed adventure we get taken on and makes you question some aspects of life and your own potential and it's always great when a movie achieves something like this.At the moment I feel torn about 'Lucy'.

Shortly after that we see a chimp in prehistoric times drinking form a lake. Then Scarlett Johansson narrates by saying that is how life begins which was a good introduction.The movie takes place when Scarlett Johansson is studying in Taiwan and is dating Pilou Asbaek a drug dealer she met at a nightclub. Pilous has a delivery to Min-sik Choi When he tricked Scarlett and cuffs her to the briefcase forcing her to make the delivery her self. Regardless of her options she is forced to meet Min-sik Choi, who acts like a dangerous drug lord who kills ends up killing Pilous. Scarlett then discovers that the briefcase contains the synthetic drug as she is forced to work for Min-sik Choi as drug mule with three other men and transport the drug to Europe hidden in their abdomens. However one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen and releases the drug in her body. Soon Scarlett enhances her brain capacity and develops her physical and mental capabilities. She uses her abilities to kill the criminals and flees. However her power does not stop increasing and is destroying her unless she gets more of the drug to stabilize her body.She contacts Morgan Freeman, who takes the role of an authorized brain expert, and becomes her only hope to save her. But the drug lord wants to retrieve his drug and is hunting Scarlett down.Scarlett Johansson who plays the role of Lucy who tired her best to making it look like an outstanding movie. She tired to give her best performance in all aspects on the Lucy's role. Pilou Asbaek had to take the role of an emotional helpless deliveryman which he did a horrible job. I think he could have done a better job if he was given another scene in the movie. Min-sik Choi took the role of a drug lord which he did a good job. Morgan Freeman did a great job on taking his part of the scene regardless of the movie. Amr Waked took the his scene has an officer of the law who ended out on being on Scarlett Johansson side has done a good job regardless of acting as a confused officer.The things I liked form the movie was how it was collaborated and the performance of Scarlett Johansson, Min-sik Choi and Morgan freeman. They are the ones who tired to make the movie seem real. But there are also some drawbacks after the 30 minutes in to the movie is where there is too much fake science and unrealistic events happen. They made the movie seem childish and pointless.The lesson to be learnt here from this movie is trust people wisely. Not everyone act like what they look like. People have a different background regardless of their story. Always looks are deceiving no matter what their character is all about.If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend it for kids from 8-10 years old. Form my point of view this is a horrible and pointless movie ever directed and made. This is the worst Sic-fi thriller movie.When rating this movie, it deserver's a 3 out of 10 because of its unrealistic features.

Carefree Sci-Fi with Lack of Tension,"I have passed this film many times whilst scrolling through Netflix. It is only recently that I decided to watch this movie. Lucy follows Scarlett Johansson playing Lucy, a woman, who, after being implanted with performance-enhancing drugs, obtains marvellous abilities, gaining access to the unused 90% of her brain.Just a brief warning if you plan on watching this movie, this movie is not an action thriller. At least in my opinion. There are many scenes which would lead you to believe so, along with the film's trailer, but, especially in its final act, this movie is VERY much science fiction. Some may be put off by this but don't let this fool you!However, something I noticed whilst watching this film that may not bother you too much, is that, once Lucy achieves the effects of the drugs, she becomes practically invincible, causing the movie to not have much keeping you gripped on the action sequences.Another thing that I wasn't particularly fond of was the sudden cuts to nature to act as parallels to situations in the early first act.Nevertheless, the movie doesn't disappoint. Johansson is incredible, as per, likely due to the similarity from previous role, Black Widow; the action sequences are very well done, it isn't impossible to watch with quick cuts and shaky cam, to my, and many other viewers relief; and finally, the movie is a very fun watch.This movie is just a great time and I recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for anything fantastic or too well thought out in certain departments.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Hardly highbrow, but enjoyable enough","'Silly, silly, silly.' So said 'Graham Chapman' in Monty Python. And that's about the best summing up I can give 'Lucy.' It's completely daft and hardly intellectually stimulating, but – what the hell – sometimes you don't want films that make you think. You just want mindless entertaining fun. And Lucy does the job.Scarlett Johansson plays the titular 'Lucy' – an average sort of girl who ends up accidentally being given a powerful new drug which allows her to use powers no human has ever had before. And, like I say, it's a fun film to watch. It's not perfect though. It starts off a bit 'arty.' There are clips of various 'unrelated' events (like a cheetah catching its prey) interspersed with the main narrative. But these sort of get dropped about half way through the film, leaving you to wonder why they were included to begin with.While Lucy is busy killing those responsible for her new powers, we also have Morgan Freeman – the scientist who just so happens to be an expert on 'expanded brainpower.' His story sort of runs in parallel with hers, although he's basically there to explain what's going on (in the final scene he almost completely 'narrates' the action – it's quite funny!). He tells us that the average human uses about 10% of his/her brain. Lucy is on her way to use all 100%.Expect killing. Expect kind of cool action scenes with Lucy using her superpowers to destroy all those who wronged her. There's a bit of science thrown in there, courtesy of Morgan Freeman to add a few concepts that might make you think. But it's not a long film. It's pretty condensed and everything flows from A-B quite nicely.Basically, the film is about how humans only need about 10% of their brains to function. And you certainly won't need any more than that to understand and appreciate Lucy. Grab the munchies, allocate about 8% of your brain to the film and just enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Freeman is the only highlight of the movie but nothing not even his brilliance is enough on its own to carry it or make it watchable! if this is the best Hollywood has to offer don't complain your profits are failing? who on earth writes this drivel? is some bimbo now advanced to scriptwriter and a even bigger bimbo is in charge what gets made!

Watch the trailer for the fun of it.,"Seeing the trailer; this is one movie I wanted to see. I have mixed feelings. It certainly didn't live up to my expectations, but alternately it wasn't a horrible movie.If, like me, you wanted the movie to be as exciting and thrilling as the trailers... not so much. Some cools stuff as far as special effects but to me they seemed to go downhill after an initial intro to the Paris police.I'm left with... Oh my, what it could have been! But it is what it is. Catch it on TNT or FX when it reaches that level of access or if one of your services offer it free. Not until then.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film is so Good...until the ending,"'Lucy' begins as an absolute thrill ride of a movie, it was Luc Besson back to his best which is non stop action brilliant tied together with relatable characters, it introduced us to a great plot, an exciting action sequence and a bad ass antagonist played by the always brilliant Choi-Min- sik, it immediately got me hooked. As it continued it had a few questions of logic (like all films) but it didn't matter because it was entertaining and was looking like Besson's best since Leon.But then came the ending, it was unanswered, confusing and most of all pretentious, Besson apparently worked on 'Lucy' for about 12 years, which leads me to believe that the ending was over thought, it strikes that during the writing process Besson became more interested in making an ending for himself not rather than his audience.I don't support a lot of the hate 'Lucy' seems to have got, as despite my frustration towards the ending it was still an entertaining and a step in the right direction for Besson, a big improvement from 'The Lady'.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What happened to Senor Besson,"Luc Besson is the name that finally made me waste time on this. He is the guy responsible for the Taxi series and Subway, came to Hollywood with Fifth Element.

Maybe if they had chosen a real actress not soda stream sell-out scarlett it might have helped. But the strange science lesson and the meaningless meandering CGI sequences are torture. The thinly veiled agenda, exposing evolution and dodgy science is no help. I cant recommend this to anyone. I gave it a single star to hopefully balance out the over 6 rating.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good,"So the movie is based on a character (Lucy) who is kidnapped and has a sachet of drugs inserted into her stomach, the sachet leaks and the drug takes over her brain which allows Lucy to gradually reach 100% of her brain capacity.

I was expecting more.,"I think the film Lucy had some great concepts about the human mind, time, meaning of life, etc. However, it is my opinion that these concepts were not made clear to the viewer and not fleshed out as well as they could have been. Maybe I am just too stupid to see the undertones and implications of the writer, but the last third of the movie left me unsatisfied and confused. I did find the CGI and special effects entertaining but much of them were unneeded and seemed more as filler. Towards the end there is a big CGI sequence that I feel the director was trying to use to explain an important concept, but did not seem very clear. Additionally, the characters were terrible. There was no development of any characters, other than Lucy's mathematical progression.

A Bit Far-fetched.,"I'm going to keep it real. The main reason I picked this movie up was Lucy wasn't the best of films but it wasn't bad. It started off pretty good actually, with some nice action and suspense, it kept me kind of interested. It was when the movie got towards the end when everything for me got kind of far-fetched. From the beginning, this film could have easily started a creationism vs evolution debate. That's one of the things that made this film start off pretty good actually. Morgan Freeman's acting in this film was awesome as usual and Scarlett Johansson playing a kind of super hero in this film was great as well. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is caught up in a drug smuggling deal that accidentally turns her into a super human then goes after her captors and is aided by Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). Like I said earlier, it starts off pretty good but towards the end it gets kind of far-fetched. Now I'm not a neuropsychologist but I think there are some feats that are impossible even if you actually used 100% of your brain capacity.

"Silly, but not boring.","Writer / director Luc Besson is determined here to give us superhero-styled escapism stemming from some provocative ideas. The theme is that human beings really only use about 10% of their brains' full potential. So what if someone were able to tap into the other 90%? What would that person be able to do? What would they be like?Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, an ordinary average gal roped into an untenable situation by a guy she barely knows: deliver a mysterious briefcase to a Korean mobster named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). The contents consist of a synthetic drug that supposedly allows users to tap into that aforementioned 90%. It's inserted into her system, and she becomes a rapidly evolving super-human who turns to an eminent professor (Morgan Freeman) and a badass cop (Amr Waked) for help.Ultimately, it's pure fantasy & fiction, and this viewer certainly wasn't expecting anything resembling a documentary. It's very fast paced (clocking in at a mere hour and a half), action-packed, over the top, and ridiculous as all-get-out. Nevertheless, it's fairly amusing on that level, with some violence & gore, and a plethora of digital effects work.Scarlett is easy to watch, as always, and her performance can be monotonous at times, but generally it's entertaining. Freeman again projects effortless quiet authority as the films' requisite brain science expert. Choi is a hoot as the unrelenting villain, and Waked is good as he injects a little dose of humanity into the proceedings.All in all, this is something of a hoot, one that doesn't require the prospective viewer to work their own brains that hard.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could have been good... except for all the horrible flaws.,"Okay, so, the plot COULD have been good, except for the HUGE fact of ""you can only access 10% of your brain"" thing. It's completely misinterpreted! What it really means is, you can only access 10% AT A TIME. You have 100% access to your brain altogether, but you can't access all 100% because your brain is actually quite fragile and wouldn't be able to handle 100% of it being used. The only evidence of close to 100% of it being used is during a seizure, because, as I said, your brain cannot handle that much usage at once. Therefore, the whole movie just has this huge plot hole in it that makes it totally unbelievably stupid. I was severely disappointed when I saw it.

Interesting (Crime meets Philosophy) flick,"Having unilaterally finished writing 'The Fifth Element' at the age of 16; I think it'd be safe to say, Luc Besson is a talented writer. And director.In 'Lucy', although interconnected, Besson does a good job maintaining two unique stories. And by & large, it works fairly well.The only contrivance here, is the means (another goofy designer drug), by which Lucy's odyssey is unwittingly launched.Now, the intermittent classroom instruction by the tenured Philosophy professor, (Freeman), is pretty cool. There is some profundity in this, but it is his later interaction with Lucy where theory ventures in fact (within the framework of the film that is.). And this is not to denounce the film's statements around the human brain. Many of us believe, that higher brain power leads to a lot of what is played out in this movie. I've seen Criss Angel 2x live at the Luxor, (not, including his magic performed at the tranquility bar, going from Table to Table, no more than a foot away. I'm a retired engineer, and what I witnessed on multiple occasions; simply defies everything that is mass, gravity, & space.Well, all that to say, I probably found this movie more interesting and fun than most, and so, the higher score.Scarlett is always a knock out, and a pretty darn good actress.Choi Min-Sik was the ultimate evil, and done well.Amr Waked does a great job as the tough & honest cop, and most importantly, the vehicle by which Lucy can hold on to her dwindling humanity.Visuals: the visuals that accompanied Morgan Freeman's instruction, are right on target, and easily understood. But they were impressive just the same. It was directed well.The changes going on in Lucy's brain as she continues to accelerate her intelligence, is of courses beyond speculative. Maybe even a bit hokey at times. But what are you gonna do here? I liken it to Kubrick's 2001:A Space Odyssey, where Dave goes to ""Jupiter & Beyond"".Rating: Sci-Fi, like Horror, seems to have a lower ceiling going in. There are so many reviewers who are averse to these genre's. My wife is admittedly this way. An 8 is a 10, and they go down from there.Anyway, I highly recommend.Thx Bob R.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not a bad idea but poorly executed with hollow characters,"What would happen if we were able to use 100% of our full brains capacity? Well according to the movie Lucy we would turn into some sort of Jedi Master who can read minds, control objects and human bodies with the mind, suffer bullet wounds with no pain or weakness and eventually turn ourselves into some sort of spiritual being. We would lose all emotion and empathy; we would walk around aimlessly in a robotic, mindless manner and only be able to communicate using awful punchlines and mundane one word answers.Lucy is a student living in Taiwan, she meets a man in a nightclub, dates for a week and is then tricked into delivering a mystery briefcase to a man named Mr Jang. Inside the briefcase is a new illegal drug that they want to get into the big European countries, the drug is designed to enhance the users brain capacity in order to develop mental and physical strength. Lucy and several others are then knocked out and operated on, a pouch of this new drug is then inserted into their lower stomach in order for them to transport it via aeroplane. Then came the point in which the story took a massive nose dive into a complete train wreck of a movie. When Lucy awakes she is informed of what is happening and is transported somewhere unnamed where she is beat up and repeatedly kicked in the stomach. This results in the pouch splitting and the drug being released into Lucy's bloodstream. What follows can only be described as one of the most ridiculous concepts and poorly executed stories I have seen. Lucy begins crawling on the walls and ceiling, has inhuman strengths and can read minds. As her brain capacity grows so do her powers.Lucy isn't a superhero movie and it isn't trying to be but it feels like one but without a hero, its scientific side which it drums down the viewer's throat seems laughable and embarrassingly corny. It is impossible to connect with any of the characters, Scarlett Johansson starts well but then once the drugs kick in she turns into a robotic, dull, mundane shell of a human that merely walks around giving one word answers and really cheesy poorly delivered one liners. Morgan Freeman has wasted his time and effort on this movie, he has a backseat role and does his usual Morgan role of talking slowly and intelligently, which suits me fine if the movie is even half decent.The whole movie just feels completely pointless, there is no character depth or development, you care for neither and have no back story to any of them. There are some huge plot holes which it seems the creators literally could not be bothered to fill and the meaning behind the story which they are trying to deliver is pointless and pretentious. The movie has no aim, the ending is awful and even as you are approaching the end of the movie nothing is building, there is no suspense or interest in what is going to happen.To summarise, Lucy starts quite well, it's mysterious and looks very good visually. But the more you watch the worse it gets, things keep happening and when they do you question it all. It all feels pointless and half finished. I don't think the idea is actually that bad and I think they really could have created something decent with it but it was far too poorly executed.First Half = OK. Second Half = Appalling.The only credible factor about the second half of this movie is the special effects. Some of the effects look fantastic, a lot of time and effort went into them and it shows.

To that I will first say, thank the lord, because even its central premise (the idea that humans use only 10% of their brains) is a complete myth. But its inaccuracy is not (only) what made it a bad movie. There is no plot. The entire plot can be summed up in- Hot girl gets a drug, hot girl gets smart (an inaccuracy in of itself), Chinese gangsters try to kill her. Not only his, but the entire film discusses how dumb and oblivious we are, and how the filmmakers are smarter than us, even though there's a scientific inaccuracy EVERY TWO MINUTES! None of the actors are all that great, Johansen is there to be a pretty face, Morgan Freeman is there for a paycheck, and everyone else is just not noteworthy. The best part of this movie was laughing at when a character said, ""The world's first woman was named Lucy"", even though there is no concrete definition of a woman, ""Lucy"" was not a human nor the first hominid, instead one of the earliest discovered ones, and she was not named Lucy until she was discovered, because of a song playing while she was discovered (Lucy in the sky with diamonds).

Garbage,"It's hard to believe that i'm reviewing this film in February, considering how excited I was to see this film. I would have guaranteed that I would have seen it in theatres. The trailer came out almost a year ago and it instantly became one of my most anticipated for the summer. It's Scarlett Johansson in a Science Fiction based action film, what can go wrong? Especially with the writer director from Leon: The Professional and Taken? It had so many good things going for it, but sadly it was poorly executed.Johansson still had a great 2014 with The Winter Solider and Under The Skin, and she sure earned a lot of money from Lucy. But I think she has to regret how Lucy turned out. It tells the story of a random girl who gets a drug injected into her stomach, in turn allowing her to access her entire brain. Now I have heard from multiple people that we as humans in fact use much more than 10 percent of our brain. Apparently it's actually close to 100 percent. Even putting this aside the movie is garbage. There is absolutely no depth to these characters. None of the supporting characters are given material for us to care about. Even in Lucy's case, the only glimpse of depth was a short phone call to her mother. I guess I'm just not the audience for Artificial Intelligence films. Transcendence, A.I., and now Lucy. Here's hoping that Chappie can right that ship.The film also uses several strange cuts to animals reproducing and other tasks. But it's not like it's in an intelligent and ambitious way, because the cuts stop 15 minutes into the film. We don't get any sense of why they chose to perform this procedure on Scarlett or any back-story with this drug or the people behind this deal. It's a really dull film that is saved by Scarlett Johansson's solid performance and some surreal special effects. It was enough to make the film watchable for 90 minutes but I cant see that being the case for any longer. It tries to be much more ambitious and smart than it actually is. I would much rather have seen a revenge type story with Scarlett going after the gangsters, much like a Taken style film.

None of the characters are deeper or more interesting than cardboard cutouts. Morgan Freeman was recruited for the film, but apparently someone forgot to give him a character too, so he just makes up some meaningless drivel, which he delivers in his wonderful voice. There is little, if anything, I could recommend.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Smart Movie,"I'm seeing all of the negativity people are posting about this movie and I must say something.This movie is brilliant. People are going to get upset because is the argument of brain capacity and what would happen, and the universe. People are always going to argue because its hypothetical. This is a movie, not a documentary.Luc did a great job writing and directing this baby of his. The effects are amazing and he did enough research to fully accomplish this film. He said to himself,""what would happen if we reached 100% brain capacity?"" I'm sure everyone would have their own opinion and in this film, Luc expressed his ideals. This isn't something to get upset over.My favorite part of the movie the changing of her eyes. :) It's amazing.

horrible,"The first 40 mins is cool, very interesting story, then it falls to pieces. Could have been a really cool movie.... But it wasn't. And why would she leave the one guy alive when she's killing everyone else off? Doesn't make any sense at all. What about the drug dealers, no one else tested this crap? Only Lucy gets super powers after taking the drugs? What about the drug addict that gets shot at the beginning, he can't put people to sleep or use more of his brain? Who is this Richard guy and how did he get these drugs? What happened with Lucy on the plane, why did she survive when her cells were breaking apart? How is this going to be a drug people can sell?

"Anti-Feminist ""Transcendence""","While similar to ""Transcendence"" Lucy got a lot of negative reviews, especially (IMHO) from female viewers. It's pretty interesting phenomena, typical opinion in Internet sounds something like ""I have seen trailer, thought it's (wow) movie about strong woman, left disappointed..."" What's so disappointing could be subject of deeper analysis, which is beyond my scope, may be it's absence of love story? Too many compromises protagonist does? Basically it's pretty standard action movie, unpretentious, smooth and visually attractive.

philosophical sci-fi,"The movie has packed all necessary action and visual effect. 90mins fly by quickly, story was told in a good pace and intense enough to keep audience's attention.Some may find the trailer slightly misleading. The trailer showed Lucy, who has been slipped a bag of drug under her stomach and the bag of drug leaked which led to her god-like powers.However, as soon as you start watching this movie in the theatre, you are going to realise it is a sci-fi movie infused with scientific and philosophic facts. More so to the philosophical size.Having said that, the movie probably require the audiences with certain level of scientific education or open mindedness in order to understand or appreciate what's going on. Like Prometheus, lots of people coming out of the theatre scratch their head or yelling BS or stupid.Good job once again to director and writer, Luc Besson.

"An amazing, smart, action packed joy ride!!!!","First off, this is one of the best written, choreographed, acted and thought-out movies I have seen in a long time! The action is intense but so are the mind bending philosophical quandaries and scientific/pseudo-metaphysical theory busting propositions/hypotheses.... I feel like this movie may be too much for some people to wrap their brains around but it has such great effects and fight scenes it could probably keep a teenager occupied for the full hour and a half (if their parents let them watch it). This movie can be compared to others but aren't most movies nowadays ramped up contrivances of past scripts and monologues????!!!! The idea of this movie reminds me of James Bond movies, Jackie Chan movies and the movie Altered States. It has a little bit of everything for everyone (except young kids).

Thanks for the ride. Loved it :),"In my personal opinion best movie for Luke and Scarlet so far. Impressed with the both of them. Deep story. Excellent acting. Based on so much science, not so sure if its science fiction any longer. Well shoot.With out an extra frame the story is told at a perfect speed. Interesting casting with easy to like faces. Attractive choices for locations. But the thing that got me the most is the way Scarlet made her character feel so real. That takes some tight directing. The ending was perfect. Luke hit the nail on the head with that one.The story in a nutshell is about how in one day all questions in the Universe were answered to Lucy by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Its about her making the best out of it and sharing her experience to give it all a purpose. Will watch this more often that I probably would want to admit.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I felt it necessary because I rely on IMDb to give me accurate reviews and i feel that it has succeeded up until watching Lucy. Lucy doesn't deserve a 6.X. Lucy deserves an 8.X.A lot of people are giving the movie low scores because they feel it is unrealistic. This is a fiction movie! It isn't a college seminar. The movie was set up so well that i think a lot of people started to view it as ""educational"" and forgot it is fiction. The movie is beautiful and very well done. It was difficult for me to deal with the character personalities for the first 15 minutes but there turned out to be an excellent explanation for that.It was certainly the most entertaining movie I have seen all year.

The film starts reasonably well, with an interesting premise yet entirely unengaged characters, but then degenerates into a poor crossover between Kill Bill and something Cronenberg-esque.Luc Besson fails miserably at both attempts; the action sequences are clichéd and tedious, while the faux-viscerality of the Cronenberg-esque sections are arbitrary and equally ham-fisted.If you buy it, wait until it's £2.99.

I love Lucy,"I have enjoyed most of Scarlett's films including her work with Woody Allan and Lost in Translation. One recent exception being urrgghhh Under the Skin. What a come back from that one. Given my love of science fiction films this one was, for me, a grand slam.Morgan Freeman was fine, as always, in his supporting role. Special effects also takes a big prize. Visuals galore and even better on our local XD 'IMAX wannabee' size screen.This is a super FUN, action packed gangster/Sci-Fi film that includes the expected (Paris car chase mostly against one way traffic) and also many unexpected moments. The early raw and violent scenes give way to Scarlett's on screen transformation step-by-fun-step.From Neanderthals and American Indians to intelligence as possibly interstellar pure energy the movie never stops to take a breath in its 89 minutes (it did not seem that short)journey.Scarlett owns almost every scene and she does a stellar job. The film tosses a half dozen genres into a blender. Scarlett guzzles it down and runs with it.The script came up with, for me at least, a perfect ending. In this film Scarlett, Morgan, the Paris 'cop' and ultra-evil villain deliver a truly entertaining film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So Cliché...,"As I watched this I thought to myself that there can hardly be anything more pseudo-intellectual than this movie. Scenes are predictable; there is no convincing explanation for the main character turn out to be the way she is at the end - except for the fact that she is Scarlett Johansson - and the fact that Morgan Freeman was thrown in there looks a lot like a desperate decision in the hope that the whole plot would appear any smarter.From an action-movie perspective, nothing interesting goes on either, as the main character seems to be nearly always on top of situations, offering no thrill to the viewer.In fact this is an extremely visual movie showing and attractive star who pretends to be doing intelligent stuff, whereas neither the characters not the plot get to be intellectually satisfactory.In my view, the 40million spent on this movie could and would be better spent on a university funds. And that's about the only thing I can think right now as an alternative for the producers to possibly redeem themselves.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome,"Wow, I really like Scarlett Johansson on screen now. My first persuasion that she was a good actress came in The Prestige (2006) and Woody Allen's 'Match Point (2005)' and 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)' and even the bizarre noire 'Under the Skin (2013)'.In terms of completely capturing my imagination, it'll be hard for her to top her role as Lucy, in Luc Besson's current science fiction masterpiece of the same name. The fact is there's not much about Scarlett's features or symmetry that I'd call beautiful - she has a funny nose, which goes off in a different direction to her mouth, and on the big screen all that is exaggerated just enough to keep you wondering if she's beautiful or interesting, but in the package with her acting, she's phenomenal.In terms of holding your attention, Scarlett doesn't miss a beat and, I'm sorry Angelina Jolie, but she leaves what you do on screen, for dead. She's a movie maker's dream. She's one of the few females who can not only carry a movie, but she makes interesting choices and takes risks with those choices. This is one woman who is not going to die wondering if she left any of her talent and ability off screen. No sir. It's all up there in minute, focused and interesting detail.And for mine, in short, what Luc Besson achieves with Lucy as a revenge movie, is what Tarantino couldn't achieve in two volumes of Kill Bill. I'm a big science fiction movie fan, but it's been a long time since I've had anything satisfy my movie-going instincts on nearly every level.Tim Burton's Mars Attacks was the last, and that was in 1996. This movie, Lucy, is in a class almost of it's own. Perhaps once or twice there were script elements which reminded me of Brad Cooper's 'Limitless', but they were few and fleeting, given the execution, believability and outstanding effects of Lucy. I'm not going to go into the story. If you've wondered whether or not you really like Scarlett Johansson, this should make your mind up. And if you like a thrilling ride/sci-fi/revenge flick this is up there with the best of them. Scarlett's performance is worth the entry price alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I guess 'With great intelligence comes great responsibility' is what this film is all about.,"Honestly, I knew it would not work out. Just like the way I felt about Robocop, the Hobbit, Red 2, and all these crap with those shiny outfits. This disappointment was anticipated so I was not truly disappointed.At the beginning, when Morgan Freeman first appeared, lecturing, and with flashbacks (of documentary) accompanying this scene, I felt this is SOMETHING. The combination of flashbacks of reality and the film, it can be good. However, as it turns out, this short 90 min film has a 45 min of BBC documentary within the package.As the med began to affect Lucy's brain and body, the film started to move into a 100% action film zone. In addition, that is when Lucy the Kick-Ass turned into Lucy the Hit-Girl. In addition, she just started to Kill every Bill (AKA these AWESOME mobsters), and every pedestrian.For the record, I do not really think that with high intelligence means deprived of empathy. However, I heard that God, the saver, the sign of mercy, would eradicate the entire human race just to 'save' them. However, why would you need to kill with super brain? BTW, that Captain (?) with that lovely French accent, what is the purpose of that character's existence? Lucy said something like 'I need you as my reminder'. However, for god's sake, what was he doing there? (Something like nothing?)And then they just started to do Fast & Furious, something like a more violent one of car chasing scene in the Italian Job （and a more rough one.BTW, I think it's time for traffic police to say 'why always me?' like Droba in European Championship (?)）.In addition, when it comes to the 'philosophical theories', this film is just a pretentious using all these 'fake theories' casually and try to use these to impress people like Da Vinci Code did (you can't deny that Dan Brown did a great job). Anyway, there was a thing or two that I agree with: time is the only measure of everything; the only thing that humans do consistently is inheriting the knowledge. What I, as an audience, really want to see in a film about this kind of subject matter, is how this complete exploitation of brain capacity can really elevate the human mind and soul. But all this film has ever shown me is: in the aspect of additional 'super powers': there's a 'XXL hearing aid'; a X-ray scanner applied for body and mind; an invisible 50.1 version 'Google glass'; a 'Vampire Diaries compulsion package on sale'; a really cool control and credible anticipation over gravity, body, objects , mind; a super cool limitless ticket supply of time traveling; in the aspect of emotions: no sense of pain, fear, desire These are all superficiality. Nothing was truly not anticipated.I guess you can say it's something as horrible as the Fifth Element, and I can see why Gary Oldman did not want to work with Luc Besson.In conclusion, Lucy is composed of 25% BBC Documentary, 25% Gangster Squad, 25% Fast & Furious, 25% Limitless and 100% CRAP.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Poor Man's ""Transcendence""","You need to watch the trailer for this. It's rather exciting. But don't bother with the film.

Kept waiting, kept waiting, then I realized it was about to finish.There is certainly a good idea lurking in here somewhere, but I couldn't find it, and neither could Monsieur Besson. Honestly, I was bored. There seems to be a real division in the reviews between loved it and hated it. The lovers, in my opinion, are far too easily pleased by shoot-outs and the notion of supernatural powers. And it was just a notion; there was no depth to anything.Contrary to some other reviewers, I thought Scarlet Johansson was terrible. I assume the woeful overacting in the first few scenes was her paranoid attempt to make sure no one thought she couldn't act when she became the emotionless automaton for the rest of the movie. And Morgan Freeman ... WHAT were you thinking? It's a good job he had to look thoroughly bewildered most of the time. I think he was. It's a paycheck, I guess.The ending ... uh ... yeah.

Complete nonsense,"Lucy (2014) is something in-between of a bad sci-fi film written by someone who doesn't know how the genre works and a basic action film with a very pretentious script.Lucy is too nonsensical and not nearly grounded enough to be an enjoyable sci-fi film since it not only has no rules whatsoever but also breaks its own rules that are not even there (imagine that). I mean, she can manipulate matter, intercept radiowaves, see in x-ray vision, but she still needs to fly by plane, to drive cars, she needs the help of other people to make her a drip only to have at least 2-3 characters in the film.
She says she feels everything and remembers everything, yet she calls her mom to tell her that she loves her, even though she acts completely emotionless all the time. She says she doesn't feel fear and a couple of scenes later she seems frightened when she starts to disintegrate like in The Avengers on the plane. Inconsistencies like these just show how unaccustomed the writers were with the genre.The film also has a drug lord villain who is so unnecessary and incredibly not threatening to her it just makes no sense (also, great job on wasting Min-sik Choi in this). They make parallels to wild nature indicating that she was prey for a predator and then she sort of becomes the predator, but not really and they never come back to this...whatever.I'm not even going to start on the brain capacity usage, ok, a theory is a theory, whatever, but you've got to have rules in your sci-fi story or it will completely derail into absurdity.P.S.

"Overall a treat, A truly wonderful take on the genre","Lucy is not the sort of film you would expect to be so good. It's bizarre concept and fast paced story telling is not the average Saturday night film to be put blankly. Much like many other films it provides a great cast playing the roles in pristine character that really makes you empathize (more with Lucy though) with the characters. I'm not sure if you could call it a superhero film as Lucy is not as such a hero, she is not a villain either, she is super, but not taking any sides. Despite this you find her story very compelling and you want to see her be more of a bad-ass and show off what she can do. Much of this film is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that you could find a lot more believable than iron man or Thor (Don't get me wrong I am all for superhero films like them) and you get to see a bad-ass array of abilities from Lucy. However I do have a few complaints, this film goes very quickly, 1. Because it is good 2. Because it is very short and starts to rush. I think that given an extra half hour this movie could have benefited and made a lot more use of some problems encountered earlier on in the film. And also as much as i loved it I wanted to see MORE Lucy as in, more of her being a bad-ass. I felt also a bit let down by the ending, it is rushed and to be honest I wanted to see a showdown between Lucy and all these guys, It would have been epic. But rather we got a rushed ending that made sense but still was lacking in points, sort of like when you get bored of a book so you skim through the end. It doesn't let you take it all in. And I was also left very confused at the abrupt ending. I could go on but I must urge you to see it and find out for yourself what I mean.

I thought that it would lead to something big, like perhaps she would use her abilities to do great things. However, as the movie continued, it got more weird than epic. The plot started to jump all over the place, ultimately going nowhere. When it ended, I couldn't believe it was over, as if Luc Besson ran out of juice and stopped writing all of a sudden. In my opinion, nothing was resolved and nothing was accomplished.Overall, I am disappointed because I wanted to see a really creative sci-fi action film with a promising heroic female lead but what I saw was one woman's 90 minute psychedelic drug trip.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible...though watchable.,"I wanted to like this movie...I really did.I saw the trailer, and even though I knew the ""science"" behind it was all wrong, I thought it could still be fun.Well, it was a little fun, sure, but frankly it was a poorly made film with a terrible script and hackneyed ideas.Have you seen Limitless? They did the same plot better. Have you seen The Avengers? Better use of Scarlett Johansson. Even The Lawnmower Man has the advantage of not being so pretentious over this film.The script is probably my biggest complaint- nothing is natural. Every line is ""on-the-nose,"" and clearly just there to move the story forward, without giving us any reason to care about the characters or to believe what's happening is real. Who is Lucy? We never really know, she's been instructed to act like a robot the whole movie. There's one scene where she talks about her past, but it's so unnatural and sudden that I couldn't care about it. The supporting characters also have terrible lines...Why are they after Lucy? It doesn't even matter, they're only in the movie to give Lucy and excuse to fight them.The editing and ""symbolism"" of the movie is also amateurish. There is no subtlety in this film- everything hits you on top of the head with a lead mallet. For example, the film starts off by juxtaposing images of animals with people...which was a little cheesy but I was willing to forgive it if the film kept up the motif. Nope. Just some random images of animals in the first 10 minutes and then never again. Why even bother? It's like the film is trying to impress some ""film school"" teacher. Random shots and juxtapositions happen for no other reason than ""because it makes the film look smart."" It's not, though- it's just obvious and cheesy.There were also no clever ideas or insights to the human condition here...just clichéd messages about life that you can get from any 9th grade biology book.OK, so before you say I'm taking it too seriously, and this is just supposed to be a popcorn action flick, I will admit some of the action scenes are awesome. However, they're the same scenes we saw in the trailer, or we've simply seen them done before in other films, but better.I would not recommend this film, at least not in the theater. Rent it or stream it or whatever, but this isn't a film to pay good money for. There are much better films out there about the same idea.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Luc Besson can create masterpieces - what happened.,"Read so much about this movie before deciding to see it, loved some of Besson's earlier work - Fifth Element, Leon, Taken, Nikita etc. but was hugely disappointed with this. Johansson was miscast & not believable, Freeman well below his best - admittedly not for the first time & the entire movie seemed to be complicated for the sake of it. Honestly just wanted it to end. If this is the course that Besson is now going to take then I for one will not be following. Thought he had his blip with the Transporter nonsense but it seems he can fall lower still. How someone that can create Leon can come up with this is beyond comprehension.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sci-Fi Thought Explosion,"Lucy is interesting from start to finish, just don't expect to feel connected to reality for very long. The acting was jam up, it was very enjoyable to see Scarlett play a lead role, dominating the scenes.Typical nuances such as multiple languages with no sub-titles, it does allow you to feel just as confused as Lucy did at certain moments which adds to the audience connection to her character. I believe the other languages were Mandarin and Korean.One of the amazing draws (for me) to this film was the lack of profanity. It brought a sense of appeal to my ears, I personally left the film wondering if even a single vulgarity was used. I know some people have lost their ear to catch the curses flying because it is the norm; to my knowledge there were only 3-4 used... wow. I'm proud to say we can still do that. Ironically, it was a foreign made film, not from Hollywood. That should say something about true filmography... you don't need nudity, profanity, or blood/guts galore to draw a crowd or earn your buck.I will note that there may be some things children and even the immature audience aren't ready to see, so I agree with the R rating.If you are ready to taste a true Sci-Fi action, mind-blowing experience, check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One More Reference,"To add to the bibliography, another show in the this genre is ""The Sixth Finger,"" The Outer Limits (October 1963). David McCallum plays a miner with ambition. He volunteers for a process to ""advance the intelligence of mankind."" He is administered drugs, and enters a machine that initially takes his mind 20,000 years into the future, eventually reaching 1 million years of evolution, and a sixth finger. As he advances, he progresses from reading minds to telekinesis, callously stopping the heart of a cook who he perceived as a threat. Eventually he reaches the precipice of human development, prepared to shed his human body and become a creature of pure energy. Along the way, he also evolved from contempt for ""lesser humans"" to realizing total peace and oneness with all life before the simple town girl who loves him brings him back to his ""normal"" state, and he dies an unfortunate death.

Relentless Impossibilities,"This apparently isn't the first movie that takes the myth of human beings' 20% limit access to their brains, the obvious comparison to this is 2011's Limitless, but that one uses the concept for only gaining all knowledge from memories and dealing with drug side effects. This movie takes beyond the advantages, it gives a theory that reaching to100% percent might also turn people into some sort of a superhero. Through it all, it's just too ridiculous to take seriously. Fortunately, that is not what the film wants, it just examines every single detail of this absurd idea without hindering anymore subplot. Lucy is just an intense rapid fire set of unrelenting imaginations, while it's pretty dumb, it's still a pretty amazing thing to experience.The plot is plain simple; it goes from a task gone wrong to a basic revenge thriller. The film has two palpable things to describe: one is the chase sequences that feels like playing Grand Theft Auto, knowing all the cheat codes, and then type them away to get an easy escape. The other is the exposition of the idea that appears to be a wannabe The Tree of Life. This combination of chaotic action and dumb science does come in handy, but it doesn't bother building anything larger to the themes of the story other than explaining the brain and human existence. Even though it's quite preposterous, the film does have a sense of fun. It takes no limits and let Lucy's abilities flow, even if it controls space and time. These sequences are just too priceless: the grandness, speed, and wondrous visuals that display on screen will keep giving you the endless frenzy you'll get in recent memory.Director Luc Besson is never afraid of showing off these things, no matter how stupid it all sounds and looks. No storyteller could express such ideas like Besson. The action scenes are pure mayhem, from bloody violence to cars crashing like it's not a big deal for the heroes. As the plot goes, it gets dumber and dumber, but that is, in the end, the point of the film. Any argument against it is invalid, stray whatever it has in mind until its package of imaginations explode. The acting doesn't need more than it already has: Scarlett Johannson just do what she has to do. There's human emotion then apathetic superhuman emotion, it's all wondrously effective.Lucy doesn't really need to prove anything smart, another comparison is this year's Transcendence although both may have different concepts, how they push their limits are somehow the same, except Lucy embraces its silliness, therefore that is its own charm, a sci-fi that recreates science only to let the spectacles get out of hand.

The worst movie Luc Besson has ever made,"I'm a Luc Besson fan. He usually creates saccharine portrayals of a shiny underworld, and it's great fun. This movie was different.Summary: Scarlett Johansson absorbs some blue crystals, attends the William Shatner School of Acting, and proceeds to deliver absurd dialog for the remainder of the film. At no point will you care about any of the characters, and at no point will any of the 'science' make any sense.To call this Science Fiction is almost an insult to the genre. There was no science, just a poor impression of its most superficial elements. It was sloppy in every way, all of the performances felt dull and phoned-in, and the story arc wasn't engaging or cohesive.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing effects and a great concept but a terrible story.,"Firstly, the main reason why I found this movie terrible is probably because I know that the ""humans only use 10% of their brains"" nonsense to be, well, nonsense. If we only used 10% of our brains, that means we wouldn't even have our basic five senses as the control of these senses are scattered all over the brain. From a scientific standpoint, it is just not logical. And even if we pretend for a second that this is possible, unlocking the full potential of our brains wouldn't allow us to control matter or other people, or feel the world and its existence. This is why I found this terrible.The reason I say it has a great concept is based on the drugs entering the system and giving her abilities. I feel that without all that content on the brain they could have done so much more if they had just added more to her background. The trailer itself looks really promising, but in reality the trailer is better than the film.The story had a lot of scientific information added in, but it had a lot of philosophical material in it too which I did not get the relevance. Plus it contrasted scenes of the wild when she was being captured. Personally, I do not like juxtaposition of scenes that are not actually from the film to be in a film. It just emphasizes the fact that what I'm watching is not real.Even though I did not like this movie, the visual effects were still incredible. The colours were visually stimulating and complimented the movie well. Though the acting was not terrible, I felt it to be a bit dry.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Masterpiece,"""Lucy"" is an absolute masterpiece –exciting, enjoyable, and backed by cutting-edge scientific research on fields like quantum mechanics and neuroplasticity. Besson's handles with masterful, seamless simplicity several different timelines and spaces. Both Freeman and Johansson come up with excellent performances, as does the rest of the cast and crew. The film is great from a technical standpoint, but what really matters is the profound sense of empathy that Besson manages to convey. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie with an open and attentive mind and heart. You might just walk out of the theater a bit more intelligent and appreciative than when you walked in.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lucy: beauty AND brains!,"The average human purportedly only uses 10% of their brain; watching Luc Besson's Lucy will only require 1% (if that), despite the director steering his film into pretentious metaphysical territory during his 2001: A Space Oddity-inspired finalé.Scarlett Johansson is Besson's eponymous protagonist, who taps into the full power of her mind after accidentally overdosing on a new narcotic. As the drug courses through her body, the young woman becomes more and more powerful, absorbing vast amounts of knowledge and cerebrally controlling her surroundings, before eventually becoming an omnipresent super-being. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), an expert in the human mind, can only look on in wonder.While the film pretends to say something profound about the existence of man, what it is really about is packing in as many flashy special effects as possible, crashing a load of cars, emptying loads of guns, and briefly showing Johansson in her bra (which is almost worth the price of entry on its own). It's all very flashy, and, despite its pseudo-loftiness, very trashy—a film to watch when you want to give your brain the night off.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You should only watch a Besson movie if...,"if Jean Reno is in it (plus the 5th element).

"""Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it? ""","Luc Besson has always been one of the most creative and original filmmakers therefore he has been one of my favorite directors. Besson, known for strong female leads, continues to do his best in Lucy. After Mathilda in Leon we get another woman who doesn't let herself to be kicked around.Scarlett Johansson, always delivers an amazing performance. In Lucy she perfectly captures all the ranges of her character. From the scared, clueless woman to the fearless, no nonsense all knowing, all powers possessing ""god"". Morgan Freeman does his standard routine of an explaining professor but there is nothing wrong with that he fits into the story flawlessly. Amr Waked as the policeman Pierre Del Rio, who helps Lucy is a great addition to an already diverse cast. Besson always had knack for attention-grabbing villains and Mr. Jang played by Min-sik Choi is no exception.Despite the fact that the trailers made this film seem like an action ride this film is more than anything a celebration of humanity. The theory that people use only 10 percent of their brain is proved to be false but here it is used as a metaphor. By which Besson is trying to say that we are not using our fullest potential. Imagine, if we really tried hard enough to not be that lazy, to be more creative and to be adventurous. So the film's message is wrapped around a summer action fare but I think that most moviegoers should not just pass this along as a science nonsense and give it a second thought.I have also loved the use of inter cutting to documentary shots to emphasize the situation the character is currently in. For example the shot of the mouse approaching the mousetrap. By this Besson proves that there still are new and fun ideas how to present an idea. I also love how some films are just definitely written by Luc Besson and you can sense from a mile away. The premise, ideas and action scenes are just so Besson you know nobody else could have come up with them.In short, if you love Scarlet Johannson, Luc Besson's work, an amazing scifi film with some message to give you something to think about, then Lucy will certainly will be an enjoyable time at the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lots of shooting & action. Not much of a plot,"This movie suffers from the same things that a lot of other recent films do: reliance on action, CG, and lots of explosive color. However, it fails in too many ways. Lots of foreign language with no way to know what's being said leaves the audience in the dark. Symbolism used but never explained, I didn't get a lot of it until I read the information on wiki explaining it. All this leaves a lot to be desired; the director and screenwriter have failed on a grand scale to tell their story. Any movie that you have to see multiple times to understand it, or need to read the director's explanation after watching it, is poorly written. As this is one of those, it doesn't qualify as decent entertainment as a movie. Perhaps it does as a puzzle. But most people don't want to go view puzzles without the information of how to put them together; in this way, this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle of a monotone piece of cardboard, cut up into a thousand pieces, so you have no way to figure out which piece goes where. Still, the light show was enjoyable to watch, much as a fireworks display is. But it's basically meaningless without knowing what it's supposed to represent.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Laughable premise but slightly entertaining nonetheless.,"While the premise and concept of this film is absolutely ridiculous, the special effects laughable, and the plot without actual resolution, the movie still finds a way to be at least slightly entertaining. I think that mostly stems from Scarlett Johansson doing a great job with the character and the movie, however outlandish, is actually a little bit interesting. It still isn't worth your time but it isn't a complete waste of time and being under and hour and a half guarantees that if you feel that it is, at least it didn't waste much of it. I do feel that they missed an opportunity to make a great movie though. There is a time between the film starting and Lucy becoming a superhero/magician/Neo that I thought we had a real gem on our hands.

Another Video Game Movie,"Really...it took the director ten years to make this? But for ScarJo, I would have passed on this movie. She's on a career arc toward Streep territory in my world. But, I digress. The premise for the story is not new and the director hasn't really made any effort to put any imagination into it. He doesn't do much with the characters, instead pretty much leaving them to their own devices. Ordinarily not a bad idea when you are directing two major talents, but all he had to do was watch ScarJo in Under The Skin to see what could have worked better here. What we as viewers are left with is a vapid story which seemingly exists as a platform for car chases and gun fights with stereotypical cops and gangsters. While watching I imagined the director sitting on his couch at home playing violent video games and using those as his inspiration. Poor Morgan Freeman meanwhile plays pawn to special effects that add nothing, but clutter to the screen.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hilariously bad.,"If there are two thing that are annoying, they are pseudo-intellect and pseudo-science. There's only one thing that can make it worse, and that's when it is shoved down your throat in the most pompous and aggressive way. Sure, we can forgive Star Wars for midichlorians, but Lucy is beyond forgiving. It puts forth every debunked myth like it is the most intelligent thing ever said, such as dolphins being more intelligent than humans. And let us not forget Lucy's cringe-worthy speech about how 1 + 1 does not equal 2. And apparently having more brain activity means you lack the capacity to feel emotions, which makes no sense. And does anyone remember how she suddenly knew how the surgeons should be doing their job out of the blue? Even if she was at 100%, that knowledge came from nowhere. I don't think I need to poke out any more flawed logic throughout the film.Aside from Lucy being a generally unintelligent pile of filth, it is lacking in any artistic quality. The flashbacks to nature throughout the beginning of the movie were so out of place and absurd that it made me laugh out loud. No, it's not that I didn't understand why they were put in the movie. Yes, I get it, she's like a mouse in a trap, but it just didn't work. Scarlett Johansson's performance was hilariously bad as well. How did she go from ""Her"" to this filth? She spent the entire movie twitching and speaking monotone. The movie had basically no story. It simply existed because the director thought it would be cool to see a person progressively get more intelligent, and that's all that happens. The foundation of the movie is intelligence, yet Lucy never says one intelligent thing in the movie.This movie is only good if you want a good laugh.

"Besson, Being, and Time","Lucy is the name given to the fossil remains of female hominid who lived 3.2 million years ago (the first woman, the movie calls her). Lucy is also the name given to the main character of this movie, the first person to use a greater, much greater, percentage of her neurons.Lucy starts out as some very ordinary girl who for some reason finds herself in Taiwan and dating some hustler named Richard. He begs her to deliver a case for him to a man in a hotel lobby. She's not interested. He handcuffs the case to her wrist, puts $500 down her blouse. Off she goes to ask for Mr. Jang. Next thing, Richard who has been watching from outside is shot and she's dragged away. Jang doesn't speak English and is suspicious. Lucy is forced to open the case. There are bags of blue crystal drug in there. Jang offers Lucy a job. She declines. Next, she wakes up with a scar on her abdomen. She and 3 other guys have been implanted with a bag of the new drug and are supposed to deliver it to the rest of the world.Lucy is placed in a room where she's abused by some guy, she resists, he beats her up. The bag in her abdomen leaks and she's affected by the drug. At first she gains physical strength and other strange powers. She leaves the place after shooting up the bad guys, goes to a hospital to have the bag removed from her body. She notices how her mind and skills are expanding.Parallel to this we meet some scientist named Norman who is giving a speech in Paris about what it would be life for humans to use a greater percentage of their neurons. Lucy calls him showing him her skills. She's living proof of what he's been theorizing about. She tells him she'll see him in Paris. As she travels to Paris she develops the skill to control other people, but mid-flight her body almost vaporizes so she has to inhale the rest of the drug she's carrying with her. She also alerts the authorities about the other 3 mules.In Paris she meets a cop she's been communicating with. They catch the mules and take them all to Paris. She meets the scientists and has no choice but go all the way and take all the drugs and to see what will happen. But, the Asian mobster is also in Paris determined to get his drugs back.Lucy isn't so much about the action. It's...who would have thought...about the ideas. And who would have thought that it would be Besson to come up with a rich philosophical movie, a movie not even about French existentialism but about German metaphysics. The issues covered include--being vs. having, reproduction vs. immortality, matter and energy, and being and time. The science is a bit hokie, but the philosophical ideas are solid. That said, of the philosophical action movies (The Matrix, Inception), this one is the weakest when it comes to the action, the philosophical ideas also, aren't worked out, just hinted.Still, I enjoyed Lucy a great deal. Johansson does a good job. I wasn't crazy about the robot-like acting near the end though. If you catch the ideas and references, the movie gives you a lot to think about. While the movie doesn't quite develop the questions it wants to ask, it comes up with the answer and the answer is indeed philosophically significant.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A film who's reach exceeds its grasp,"After viewing the film Lucy tonight, I feel compelled to give a review of a film I found very ambitious albeit it a bit perplexing.The film is directed by Luc Besson of Fifth Element fame and stars Scarlett Johansson as the titular Lucy and Morgan Freeman as a university professor studying the abilities of the mind. To start off with, I found the directing to be rather good in terms of economic story telling and the classic show don't tell rule. There is actually far less exposition in this film than in others with similar aspirations of philosophical grandeur. There are some scenes where characters who shouldn't really know what Lucy is doing at a given moment yet they conveniently explain it for the audience but these are plot contrivances and I think over all the screen play is well paced and efficient.The acting is definitely not Oscar bait nor is it done with any subtly but I felt it was more than serviceable. Scarlett Johansson sells the awkward demeanor of her character pre-powers very well. The problem I had with her performance was her monotone personality after getting her cerebral abilities though I am fully aware this is likely due to the way her character is written. Though one thing I did like a lot was the confidence Johansson was portraying after receiving her powers despite her line readings being a tad flat. She definitely sells she knows she's a bad ass and she pulls off struggling with her detachment from humanity well. Morgan Freeman is pretty much good in everything he does and he certainly sounds like a learned scholar in this film. I had definite flash backs to Through The Wormhole with his performance here even if his science is a tad off.Luc Besson was certainly adequate form in this film. I found his camera work was lacking in the artistic department but he made up for it in by building suspenseful moments and exciting car chases and action scenes. It wasn't Die Hard by any means, but it was a fun ride watching Lucy execute her powers. A real problem with his directing is the intercut animal kingdom sequences which forces the metaphor on you. There is no subtly here the film tells or shows you everything you need to know and there's not a whole lot of room for interpretation. There's no real ambiguity.I did enjoy the special effects. I think it struck the perfect balance in terms of CGI scenes showing the human anatomy in real time(think Fight Club but a bit more grandiose in its approach and having real sets and characters. I don't think the effects are grounding breaking or anything but they definitely serve the film well.Okay, now onto the screenplay. I think this is probably the biggest flaw in the movie outside of plot contrivances because it simply tries to explore concepts I don't think the film is capable of doing. They spend time talking about human evolution by Johansson narrating, the creation of the universe, what in this meaning of life and how far Homo Sapien has come. These are all concepts I enjoy exploring in a film that has more nuance. In this movie it's all shoved into your face a bit too heavy handed though I will say they did show us the connection between this philosophical concepts instead of just telling us how they do. I think that's good story telling but the problem is the film doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an action flick? A chick flick? A female James bond movie? The story moves at an abundantly fast pace but what is and doesn't take enough time to really explore these concepts. Any scene that has these concepts are given just enough time to let us know there is a theme there but it never explores it adequately. It's like the film is shouting ""hey look this is a metaphor for this"" and ripe with obvious parallels. These are great concepts to explore but they need to be more subtle. It's as if the film thinks it's smarter than it actually is.I didn't even notice the score too much to be honest though I did like the sequence with Mozart's requiem. I wish the film could have had more of that gravitas instead of the subdued score pieces. I have heard once before that you don't remember good music because it integrates so well into the film you don't even hear it. It just puts you in a subconscious mood. If you subscribe to that line of thought then you might like this soundtrack. I perform more bombastic background music to put me into the scene more.To surmise my thoughts so far; I think it's a film with great ambition that it doesn't have the motivation to achieve. I was expecting to see a fast paced, run n gun supernatural powers type of film so I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or Full Jacket. The film tries too hard to explore huge concepts and it is simply not deep enough to convey those philosophical ideas though it does get the benefit of the doubt for at least trying.... The acting is serviceable, the action is fresh and there are some really heartfelt moments within the film that may touch or dismiss you.The film feels like it's the ADD, Youtubed instant gratification version of 2001: A Space Oydessy in terms of what it is trying to accomplish. Its theme and metaphor can never match the flawless implementation of the subtext in Kubrick's classic though it desperately wants to be the action version of those philosophical questions. The film doesn't know what film it wants to be and I think that's the crux of why I believe this film is only serviceable.My final review: 7/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Racist smoking pile of stinking garbage !,"First, I must say, I had high expectation from this movie; the beginning of the movie looks fairly promising - the premise is promising, it looks like ""Limitless"" (2011) set in Asian city with more action. But as the movie goes on, it become quite apparently how bad this stinking pile of turd this movie is.Before this movie, I didn't know Luc Besson is a racist. In the movie he purposely cast ALL asians as either villains (the korean gangsters, or the triads) or they are the props to be killed for no other reason then for comic relieve. Two instances stands out - when Scarlett Johansson's character shot a taxi driver simply because he can't speak English; and another instance when in the hospital, Lucy simply shot an Asian patient on the operating table in the head simply because she needs the surgeon to stitch her up. Had this being a white patient the plot would had been how Lucy using her vast intellect to cure this patient thus showing how much superior she is - but instead, the plot portrays asians as not worth saving.And then there is the subtle racism that shows in the dialogue - such as ""Who Speaks Chinese, Anyway?"" and the rest of the drivel that came out of Analeigh Tipton's mouth. The tone of the movie also seems to convey the idea that white people were been victimized and oppressed by the Asian (gangsters). The other one is how Luc Besson subtly portray Taiwan as a lawless city - when you can fire pistols in public and not a single cop is in sight! Scarlett Johansson was simply walking around with pistols in hand and not a single person noticed or a cop in sight to stop her. Taiwan (like most Asian countries) forbid the ownership of firearms - thus a person with pistol will instantly stand out - let along a TALL BLONDE WHITE GIRL like Scarlett Johansson walking in pistols and submachine gun! The SWAT would be all over her in minutes - especially in Taipei as it is the capital with the most police force.The plot is fairly simplistic and predicable. The acting were pretty awful too as Scarlett Johansson's character turn into a robot while the rest of the cast were pretty forgettable.Overall, 1/10. Avoid this stinking pile of turd like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beyond Beyond,"Lucy goes beyond science fiction, beyond science, beyond physics, beyond astronomy, beyond religion and approaches that unknown reality of why and how time exists... if at all. I would assume most people who argue the science/religion nonsense have never even stepped on the threshold of the reality that all things are connected, up to and including infinity. Wires and God don't get it. But Lucy presents us with the most accurate theory of the connections that go beyond even what the human mind can even imagine about the ultimate reality. This film is most likely so deep that most humans will just shrug it off as too deep, or even ridiculous. But watch it and see. (smiley face)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a mess,"Even without watching the movie it was obvious that Lucy is going to be far away from being a science fiction film.

Lucy would be a good thriller. The opening starts tense and holds for 10-15 minutes and then everything collapses. There's an interesting message film wants to convey - ""the only unit in life is time, the rest is conventionality developed by men"", but this message is covered with a big pile of nonsense which I didn't have interest in digging. All the science baloney Morgan Freeman is spilling out does neither make sense, nor brings a smile. But some moments I was thinking that Freemen himself is going to give under his silly text and laugh out.From filmography's perspective Lucy isn't in a better shape. Movie starts and ends with something clearly inspired, but much more plain than 2001: A Space Odyssey, couple of poorly produced fistfight and shootout scenes, two minutes of Taxi-style chase and uninteresting sequence of disjointed plot chunks.P.S. Can't recommend Lucy even to Scarlett Johansson fans. I wen't to the movie without any high expectations, only because of my pal being into Johansson, but excessive nonsense covers up everything else.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Very good, very special!","How much does it mean to have a cool story and a good director! Actually, it's the most important, for any film. And, this one has a generous script and a top notch professional director. I've always liked Luc Besson, starting with ""Le Dernier Combat (The Last Battle),"" which fascinated me when I first saw it a long time ago (seeing it recently, I did not like it anymore) . Moving through ""Subway"", ""The Big Blue"", ""La Femme Nikita"", ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", Besson has become better and better, more spectacular, more refined. Climbing with this ""Lucy"". The first movie in which I like Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman (I'm not the fan of anyone). But here I liked them both, very much (secret: good story, good director) And all the other actors are good. Spectacular filming, stunts like I've never seen, fights as I've never seen before, all new and innovative. And, an editing like I've never seen before. A spectacular, dynamic film, from the first frame to the last, not one second of boredom. Very good, congratulations to everyone, I will always see it again with great pleasure. It's all worth the congratulations, because the result is visible, they worked hard on this film, and with a great achievement!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I have not seen this movie, but let me explain why you shouldn't","First of all, people CAN access 100% of their brains, just not all at once. Look up ""10% brain myth"" if you don't believe me.So, right out of the gate, you have to your suspend disbelief to enjoy this movie. In addition to this, the way Lucy is portrayed in the movie is probably not very accurate.1) Because Lucy is using a large portion of her brain a lot, she needs lots of energy. I have not seen any commercials with her eating a Big Mac in order to keep her brain running at peak performance.2) Her brain would more than likely overheat from functioning at such a high level. I haven't seen any ice packs on her forehead in the trailers.3) She would probably need an IV (for fluids and nutrients) and a catheter to maintain her on-the-go, demi-god lifestyle (in addition to a feeding tube).I'm sure there are lots of other issues with this movie.

a bold sci-fi thriller that depicts the origin of life,"You could say it starts off as a bit of a joke. Or just a really bad version of a 007 wanna-be- bad ass replica. Even Johannson's acting starts off as a bit of a joke; literally, she seems to be laughing more than crying herself through the first ten minutes of the film. However, Lucy transcends with every passing minute – as if the quality of the film and it's acting were corresponding to the percentage of brain capacity that the protagonist female- gone-super-human android is using. It is one of those films, whose idea clearly surpasses cinematographic capabilities - time, space, gravity, and the origin of cells that build life and our reality - it is one of those films, that you watch skeptically, but are patient and open to giving it a chance. You watch, learn and enjoy, but after that start are all the while still deciding whether this is total guff, whether you have been ripped off at the theater counter, and served quantum-physics starters-pack drivel with some Scarlett glitter on top to cover it up? About midway through, I decided to give it a chance. A real chance. A chance at blowing me away and taking my mind to places unexplored, allowing my brain synapses to dance and go wild, tying together all my theories about life with what I was learning whilst fixing my eyes upon the screen. It worked. The key is, to see film as art. To take what you can get from it. Not to criticize (and believe me there was a lot of moaning and dis-missing going on in the seats around me) but to make the most of it. Yes you CAN. Once this happens (and there have been a lot of films where it just doesn't happen) you are free to go and experience that wonderful world of time, intelligence and purpose of life that is Lucy. Maybe I am an optimist who was fed cyborg-bull crap and went off on it – maybe I fell in love with the idea of being- and playing Scarlett's part, but in any case, I am glad to have seen this film, as it let me exit that cinema with sharpened senses and let me glide into the night feeling alive, thirsting for knowledge, finding life intelligent and beautiful.

What Happens When You Reach 100 percent?,"Lucy is a film directed by Luc Besson who is known for bigger action films. In the past I have enjoyed some of his film like Léon: The Professional and The Fifth Element, however recently he hasn't been directing much, only writing for franchises like Transporter and Taken. While his films are usually action packed, this film is a prime example of squeezing all of the action into the trailer. This is my review of Lucy.Luc Besson not only directs this film, but he also wrote it as well. As I just mentioned above Besson has been writing a lot of big action movies lately like Taken one and two, and also 3 Days To Kill. I enjoy all three of those films, some more so than others, but they are generally fun. This film lacked that fun especially in the script. The characters are not developed well at all, and frankly caring for Lucy never really happens. We just want to see action, and instead we are forced an insane plot(nothing wrong with that in a film like this) and far too much useless banter. With a short runtime, this film suffers even more. With lack of character development and such a short runtime, its a wonder we understood anything Besson wanted from this film. So in the writing department Besson gets a below average rating.Now onto the directing, also done by Luc Besson. While Besson has taken some time off from directing action films, he generally knows how to do it. The same can easily be said here. While his script fails to bring in much action at all, when the action does hit(mainly towards the end of the film) it is filmed amazingly. The acting that Besson helps guide on the screen is not bad, but not great. Scarlett Johansson as Lucy and Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman lead this cast with some fine secondary actors like Amr Waked and Min-sik Choi(who plays a fantastic bad guy). Sadly as I mentioned in my comments about the script, the characters are so poorly progressed that caring about them never really happens. Jonansson delivers a nice performance and I will give her credit for that, and credit as well to Besson for leading her in the right direction with this film. So, overall Besson does a passable job directing as he leads a nice action scene towards the end of the film that looks amazing, but sadly the action is almost not there minus a couple very short scenes.Eric Serra composed the score for this film, he has previously scored such films as Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds and The Lady, both directed by Luc Besson. This score is generally forgettable. When the action heats up(it happens so seldomly that don't expect much) his score gets much better, and is passable. As a whole the score is nothing to brag about though.Overall if you were expecting a bigger action film, then you will be disappointed. If you were looking for a film with at least a somewhat good story, then you will also be disappointed. The film however is really short(just over eighty minutes without credits) and moves by pretty quickly without much drag, so if you feel the need to waste some time, then this film may be worth it.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

You will need to use %100 of your brain just to stay awake!,"Decided to go watch this movie as ""Sin City! A dame to kill for"" was not available. Oh my Lord, I should have just got back into the car and gone home. I decided to write this review to balance out the fact that people seem to be giving this a 9 or even 10 stars, with some going to the extremes to say its the best film they have seen (Really????)First i'd like to say I've given this film 3 Stars for three reasons,1. Morgan Freeman. Again the man delivers a great performance, dazzling us with his voice, epic timing and delivery.2. Special Effects. Which are fair throughout3. Scarlett Johansson. Pleasing to the eye, does a good job at the beginning but then boring throughout.The movie begins with the question ""What have Humans done with life on earth"", and you would assume that this is this question that the plot is structured around but in attempting to answer this question the film veers drastically off course. We are lead to believe that Humans only use %10 of our brains and that all we should be striving for is more brain capacity but as Lucy receives more and more brain capacity all she really does with it is destroy every object that gets in her way (including civilians) in a linear mission to some how pass on the information she receives from her heightened brain functions.The Character development is non existent, as a viewer you feel nothing for the main character. The best that Luc Besson could come up with was a 30 second phone call Lucy has a with her mum about how much she loves her Mum and Dad (This is just lazy film making). This phone call takes place just seconds after Lucy kills an innocent member of the public having surgery on the operating table, then we are led to believe that the doctors agree with the half assed reason for the killing and then help her with her own surgery.The Film then clumsily takes us on a cheap roller coaster ride where Lucy receives more brain capacity which has unexplained consequences, such as telekinesis and interacting with phone receptions (What???). We meet more boring and unnecessary characters that provide no real interest to the plot and are just more meat for the grinder, before the film finally ends by Lucy hitting %100 capacity and it is reviled what Humans are capable of when they hit this magical feet of evolution???...... What is it I hear you Say? Well i won't spoil the end but believe me that you are just left with an unbelievable feeling that you are expected to believe this ""God awful tripe"" is what Humans should be striving for.The film ends with some really good special effects but fails miserably to convey its message to the audience.

"Tried too hard to be smart, ended up being kinda dumb","I get where the director was trying to go with this movie. I appreciate the attempt, however to me it simply fell flat.Scarlet did well with the character, who overall wasn't very engaging.I seldom say this about movies, but I think this movie may actually have been better if it were just a little longer. I needed to have some more backstory for Lucy, which was never given, thus resulting in my utter lack of emotional interest in her well-being.Morgan Freeman did the Morgan Freeman, and just basically played Morgan Freeman in a lab coat.Other actors were forgettable and uninteresting.I also instantly had a problem with the ""man only uses 10% of his brain"" setup, as this has been debunked on multiple occasions. Knowing this kinda threw the whole premise of the movie out the ""believable"" window.So in conclusion, I don't mind having watched this movie, however I could've lived a perfectly good life without ever actually seeing it.I wouldn't recommend it for the simple fact, that better movies exist out there that are worth actually recommending.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Better than I expected,"When I went to go see 'Lucy' I expected to see a good action film starring the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. I got that. What I also got was a surprisingly intelligent Sci-Fi premise with interesting and creative visuals. Even though Scarlett Johansson is famous for being a pretty face I think her performance in this film prove she is more than that. I suppose I shouldn't have been so surprised considering the Writer/Director is Luc Besson, a French filmmaker that is responsible for such films as: The Fifth Element, Leon: The Professional, The Taken movies, The Transporter movies, and La Femme Nikita (a.k.a. Point of No Return).I've read around the internet that 'Lucy' is a dumb movie because the ""humans only use 10% of their brain"" premise is a myth. I find it funny considering all the other ridiculous premises that exist in Science Fiction. That leads me to the conclusion that these people don't know what Science Fiction is. It's not a 100% accurate representation of proved science; that would be call Science Fact. Science Fiction takes pieces of real science or things that exist only in theory and explores what that would mean for humanity and our society. Don't think about the premise of 'Lucy' as ""What if we could use 100% of our brain because we only use 10% of it"". Think about the premise as ""What if we had limitless access to all knowledge in the universe? What would we do with it?"" It's an extremely relevant premise, considering we are currently living in the information age and the ease at which we are able to access information is growing exponentially.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
disappointed...I guess,"I guess disappointed is the word I would use. Possibly from the previews that were shown, possibly from my own expectations. I saw the cast list and figured if it had the first few actors listed, this would be a reasonable movie. I was let down with the clichéd story line, acting by the A-list actor, action scenes. The acting was not the best by the two lead actors, seemed shallow and almost forced at times. Story line was clichéd, it has been used so many times, this variation didn't do the movie any justice. The action scenes were a definite let down, I expected more, possibly my mistake in expecting more. Some scenes were good, some good special effects, the idea of the story was different, not a total loss.

"A few holes here and there, but a solid, interesting film!","I went in expecting to like this film, and I walked out enjoying it a lot! Yes, the premise is a bit silly, and you do have to suspend disbelief. What this movie is, more than anything realistic, is very imaginative. In the Era of uber 'realism' and nolan esque 'everything has to make sense' and alternately the stupidity of Michael Bay, this move had a nice balance, and just had fun with it's insane premise. Scartlett Johannsen did a fantastic job with this movie. She really has a knack for Sci Fi, and she is a top notch talent. This movie was about the right length. If you go into this looking for an art house film, don't bother, it's not for your pretentious tastes. Get over yourself. There is probably about as much real science as there is pseudo science. That is to say it's partially grounded in reality. It's not like the movie makes any illusion about the fact that some of the stuff in it is simply made up. I will say that Luc Besson could be served by hiring a writing consultant. There are some scenes that were kinda lazily set up. It doesn't ruin the film, but it might take a step in the right direction in having his films taken a little more seriously. Also, there is the signature rocket launcher scene (every one of Besson's films has one). This was fun. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved it until the end.,"The year is 2014. I've got a rare day off work, a free movie pass and figure a matinee would be a great way to pass a couple hours. So I look at what's playing and see ""Lucy"". It's a movie by Luc Besson which is good. I liked several of his movie. It's a movie starring Scarlett Johansson that I really liked. And the trailers for it looked interesting so I figured this was my movie.And like the title says I enjoyed it. There were aspects of philosophy, science, some kick ass fight scenes and then came the ending. There are very few movies in which the ending made me angry and this was one of them. They could have handled it in such a way that would have been better but they chose to end it the way they did. I felt cheated by it because it was such a let down.The story itself deals with the titular Lucy. She's a young woman who in order to make some money agrees to deliver a briefcase. But that's only part of the deal and she wasn't informed of the rest. Instead she's drugged and forcibly turned into a drug mule where this new synthetic drug is literally stitched into her and will be cut out when she reaches her destination. However one of the bags bursts and she ODs on it. Things get really strange and she starts to develop terrifying mind powers as she races to find a way to punish the people that did this to her and if there's a way to save her life.We're taken on a ride in which elements of science, philosophy and what it means to be human are explored. A lot of people criticize Scarlett's wooden acting but this is explained as being her having gone ""beyond"" emotion due to the drugs in her system. And then at some point near the end it just takes a hard left turn into something I just didn't care for. I can think of a half-dozen different ways they could have handled it and gotten the same kind of ending but as I said in the end it just fell apart and I felt cheated. Even though the movie itself didn't cost me anything, I still felt cheated.Personally see it for what it is and understand that the ending is really weak.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lacks originality and little to redeem itself,"Although the premise is slightly darker (allowing Besson to mix in Asian mob tropes) and the ending certainly better, Lucy is still just another Limitless.

The Big-Hokum Theory,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsBesson is falling further and further into doldrums; whether it be his recent and even not-so-recent directorial or scripting efforts. ""Taken"" and ""District B13"" aside, and to some extend ""The Family"" (and two of those were only scripted by him), none of his projects in the past 10 years or so even past muster, and ""Lucy"" is yet another massive blotch on his repertoire.The film is beyond inane - it's flaws, plot-holes, and downright absurdity are so vivid, and so many, that it would be a herculean task even to list them. Part farcical-scientific treatise, part messed-up action movie - a film that oscillates between rambunctious disorientation and complete boredom in a heartbeat. And, for a movie that worries about most of humanity wasting its potential, it's ironical that ""Lucy"" is riddled with so many nonsensical scenes. Even though the titular character may find her brainpower exponentially increasing as the film's run-time moves forward, chances are you'll feel your IQ levels diminishing and your intellect being assaulted just as rapidly.""Lucy"" is more or less the same kind of illogical gibberish we've come to except from post-2005 era Besson. Is this really the same talent that gave us classics like ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", and ""La Femme Nikita"".

She and other mules have drugs seen into their abdominal cavities. Unlike the rest, she gets kicked and the drugs are released into her body, unleashing a phenomenal potential.

When she contacted the professor(Freeman), she demonstrates the potential ability of the drugs that enhances her mind. Making her a genius beyond her wildest dreams.

Good For A Movie Night,"First off, Lucy is not a bad movie, it is entertaining at least and has some neat affects, but it makes you lose interest too easily.The problem with this movie is you have no reason to be emotionally invested in the main character. She is drugged and soon begins to develop powers well beyond our understanding and it just continually grows from there. Every person and obstacle put in her path is dealt with easily and she has absolutely no problem that she can't solve because she can suddenly do everything. The other problem with trying to develop an all powerful being is you are still limiting said character to a human way of thinking. We do not know what would happen if we ""unlocked"" our minds because most of what you see in this movie has already been done in comics decades before, so it's nothing new.From the viewer's perspective, seeing someone being all powerful and having no faults, no weaknesses and can literally move Heaven and Earth is just boring. Kid with a magnifying glass and an ant hill comes to mind. Yeah, it's fun to see our favorite heroes beat the crap out of the bad guy, but the plot usually has them fighting some weakness or overcoming some life issue and learning a lesson from that. The entire story arc for Ironman is a good example of a flawed character continually growing from their faults to be a better, stronger person. It's what made the end of 'Endgame' so heart-wrenching for most people.Making mistakes, having faults, even being ""taken down a peg"" helps us connect with a character. You feel what they feel, you understand their hardships and you want to help them. Lucy doesn't do that. There is literally no reason to have anyone helping her, characters or viewers because she can do anything. They don't even make an attempt to have her try to hang on to who she used to be or keep some part of her intact, she just instantly decides to throw everything about herself away, so why should we care? Lucy deserves no sympathy because there's no reason to sympathize. You don't feel sorry for her because she becomes a souless husk as she grows stronger with no emotion. When you have more feelings for Baymax, literally a robot with no emotions or sympathy (he's only programmed to care) instead of Lucy, that should be a red flag right there.I was really hoping Lucy would get to a point where she would realize what she was becoming wasn't who she was and decided to reject what she was turning into. She makes this point in the movie, but it's just glossed over in favor of more gun fights. I know someone is going to say ""it's a movie about becoming more than who we are, to think about things in a different way"", but it really isn't.

And Lucy is very likely my favorite Besson film since The Fifth Element (1997), though other strong contenders include Angel A (2005) and Les aventures extraordinaires d'Adèle Blanc-Sec (2010). In fact, in some ways, Lucy is a reworking of the central theme of The Fifth Element: The appearance of a woman who is a ""supreme being."" Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the title role, and I also enjoyed the performances of Min-sik Choi and Amr Waked. Johansson brings to her role an unexpectedly – for me at least – poignant portrayal of a woman whose humanity is being eroded as she becomes something entirely, unimaginably alien. She actually had me near tears twice. The effects are gorgeous, and we are propelled through time, from 2014 to that ""time"" prior to the Big Bang. The editing, as with The Fifth Element, is superb. And, as usual, Besson works with his tried-and-true collaborators, such as Eric Serra (soundtrack) and Thierry Arbogast (cinematography).That said, the science is, well, not really science at all. The entire film is predicated on the ""Ten percent of brain myth."" This is, of course, complete twaddle. Also, Morgan Freeman's lectures are replete with errors that would have been eliminated by throwing a few bucks at a poor biology grad student. Or checking Wikipedia. For example, we're told at least a couple times that life appeared one billion years ago, when, in fact, the earliest evidence we currently have of life on Earth is 3.7 billion years old. That's a pretty damn big error. And there was a bunch of foolishness about dolphins. However! Truth is, these problems actually didn't detract from the film at all, in my opinion. I think you have to look at what's happening in Lucy as metaphor, and where it takes us in the end is very near to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I give Lucy high marks. It is by turns horrific, transcendent, sad, and beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant,"Went to this movie with several family members. One of whom rarely goes to the movie. Can happily say came away happy.The plot/storyline was excellent. Empathy with the characters. The moment it started you wanted more. I was riveted throughout and wanted it to go on and on. Freeman as usual was fantastic, just his presence in a movie you know it should be good.If you have seen Limitless you are certain to enjoy this movie. Highly recommended to those who appreciate this genre of movie.Will be buying the DVD when it comes out, as I know I will enjoy seeing it again.We continued to talk about the story for weeks afterwards, in a positive way.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hit and miss? Or just miss?,"It's one of those movies - you see Luc Besson, Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson, I mean, how bad can it be? Well, it turns out, not that good.The premise of utilizing more of our brain potential is always intriguing, there's some action and a nice message. But the concept gets tedious and difficult to follow, until it turns out sheer simplistic and kind of silly in the end.If you are interested in catching a ""what-if"" movie about utilizing more than 10% of our brain, go see Limitless, which is enjoyably plausible.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very disappointed and unbelievable story,could have been so so much better","Was really looking forward to this film but found that after about half an hour I was very disappointed. There was lots of silly bits that made the film cheap and nasty which was a shame after all the hype. Was very surprised at the lack of quality considering the actors that stared in it. This film could have been so much better it felt as though the writer had a great idea but then lost interested half way through and found something better to do which is so annoying when you have spent ages looking forward to it why build it up then let us down so badly. Its such a shame that is was too unrealistic and very silly at times when the potential of the film was very exciting,i feel very very let down and would strongly recommend not wasting your time if you don't want to very underwhelmed.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Waau, how great","While a good action film, this film is one that will genuinely inspire you in every way. It truly makes you think about our potential to think deeply about evolution, human nature, and life. I cannot remember a film that has made me think so much about potential. I'm an engineer and have always accepted things as they are. However the film triggers your thinking in that it clearly states that ""it is our ignorance that brings us the state of chaos'. It will really leave your spirit feeling I need to grow and develop.For the first time in my life, I have given a film a 10 in rating, this is a definite must-see for all action/sci-fi lovers as well as those who have an interest in humanity, history and the incredible gift that is life.Wauuuu, how great",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
keeps you on charge till the end of the movie,"In short this movie drops light to muse over the purpose of our life. Special effects are done well. Of course there are drawbacks of the movie which can be just discarded (as you have to take best part from anything). It keeps you on your feet until you see what happens when a person gets 100% brain performance. Definitely worthwhile to sit and spend 84 minutes of your precious time for this science fantasy movie. I thought movie will be similar to *Limitless*, but it far beyond that fantasy. Anyway I got a pleasure by watching it, thanks for the director and actors and all involved for such a unexpected movie in the end of 2014.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much better than I expected,"I went into this film with very low expectations, having seen the reviews on IMDb I really was not hopeful that this was going to be any good at all, I had a gut feeling it was nothing more than a remake of Limitless with bigger stars to give it a better chance at the box office.But, I can say I was pleasantly surprised,whilst this film obviously has resemblances with Limitless, it also reminded me very heavily of Lawnmower Man. I found the script well written & well paced at no point did I feel the director was adding filler to make the film longer. Johansson & Freeman are excellent, this again shows what a talented actress Scarlett is & one who is obviously capable of being so much more than eye candy.To add to my recommendation my partner who generically hates every film absolutely loved this one, so she gives it a 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
That was disappointing.,"That was disappointing. Those were the first words I spoke after this movie.Trailers had me hooked. I had to go see this movie. After all, the 3-minute trailer at the theater really built this movie up.

I know she's the A-list actress right now, but Jennifer Garner or Angelina Jolie would have been a much better.It wasn't worth the $6.50 matinée price I paid.

Easily Hooked In,"This movie starts out slow paced with interesting cut aways and references to life and the human intelligence. Before you know it, tension and drama build and you're sucked into a story that you cannot pull your eyes away from the screen. Luc Besson takes a very interesting and alternative imaginary view into the idea of the human brain becoming fully unlocked. While similar to Limitless, this take on the potential of the human brain goes further into science fiction/action based drama. Can't forget about the quick witty comedic lines that are known best from the mind of Luc Besson. Scarlett Johannson and Morgan Freeman make a great team together as soon as they join together on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Potential Undelivered,"A woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic.This could of been a good movie, if only the script writers were better.

Pass this one by for a better summer fare.Scarlett Johansson as Lucy was quite good Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman didn't seem to be used to his potential. The rest of the cast was questionably following the script but because it was so bad it lowered their role to that of a B-movie. Anyway you get the drift.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Why I loved this film.,"I loved this film for many reasons. It's only fair to say though, that in my opinion, an archetypal cult classic is one of the most difficult types of films there is to make, and they don't happen often. So I it is with the highest praise that i consider this to be an archetypal cult classic. The way that writer/director Luc Besson chose to present this incredibly thought provoking idea, was brilliant. This was some heavy duty philosophy, and rather than try to deliver something that could have easily turned into an over produced philosophical info dump, he borrowed, authentically I might ad, from the world of super heroes, took us on a brilliantly paced, exciting, and original journey that allowed us to follow his thought process and see the potential implications of his vision, through the use of analogy. Of course Morgan Freeman was stellar. The casting was wonderful, and the roles well acted. Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job. Remember, there are not many female roles like this to draw from, since it's only recently that roles like this exist for women. She is a pioneer and I believe she nailed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
can be watched once,"Movie is OK. Few scenes are super ex: Lucy talking to Morgan over TV, Radio,phone etc, Lucy meeting ape. Action scenes are good. No boring moment. But I'm notsure what director want to convey from the movie. Disappointed with no story line up. Lucy can use her 100% brain power because of a drug leakage. What next is not clear. Should have shown some advantages for the human kind.I think few scenes are narrated in a very spoon feeding manner which is not needed. ex: When villain is about to meet Lucy, Lion hunting deer scenes are shown up. Was surprised with the abrupt ending of the movie. Climax action scenes should have been more better.Few scenes resemble that of Matrix. Overall OK kind of movie.

A mash up movie thrill ride with cinema only special effects,"Lucy I gave it 10 out of 10, this review contains no spoilers.It has a tongue in cheek air whilst paying homage to many great films over the years... 2001, Contact, Matrix, Transcendence, The Time Machine, Inception mixing in car action scenes on a level I have never seen before.It has a kick ass pace and is an eye candy fest. I felt particularly moved by it and was sad it had to end but just like the Maxtrix it leaves a lot of unanswered questions and you just want to know more. I hope they leave those questions unanswered because sometimes a story works best when your imagination has to delve into the possibilities a movie like this can put up. For those who were expecting deep answers from this movie you will be disappointed but for a thrill ride with a lot of wow moments this movie definitely delivers. I hope there is a special edition with more footage because I feel it could have been longer but apart from this a nice little number.

Worst Movie Don't Watch,"Literally I got an IMDb account to warn people not to watch this movie. Literally nothing happened in it. NOTHING!!!!

Critics might rave about this movie but let me tell you, you definitely won't be entertained. I could feel the whole theatre sleeping. The trailer looked real interesting but the only parts in the movie that were even good was in the trailer. I advice anyone to go watch any other movie instead. My cousin joked about asking for his money back after the movie. It was god awful. The movie also left me so confused. The ending made the whole movie seem pointless. I have to write a thousand words about this movie and I don't think a thousand words can sum up how awful this movie was. I have never written a review for any film on the internet before but I wanted to warn people. If you are curious go watch this movie but you have been warned.

A simple and joyous pleasure for the eyes and the mind. Just Enjoy!,"No Spoilers -
This movie is really about Luc Besson bestowing a beautiful, stunning, and highly entertaining experience on us which also manages to be very thought provoking. If I had to compare with others by him I'd say it's sort of like Leon meets 5th Element. That means gorgeous eye-candy and stunning action-oriented performances. Yes, you ARE intelligent enough to disassemble its more out-there premises - but, why bother? Just enjoy the ride. You won't regret it.And BTW, the track heard over the outro credits is NOT on the Eric Serra CD (since he didn't write it!). Also, missing is the Mozart Requiem and ""Sister Rust"" (for the same reason) that set the perfect background for vital scenes. But they can be had if you search diligently, FWIW.

Good subject but Americans ruined the film,"Subject is really good, and could be really interesting.Only problem when Americans touch anything.Guns, violation, over explained scenes, too slow and long talks, too much cuts, too much effects :(

Thought-provoking!,"Writing: The script of ""Lucy"" is funny yet serious, and it's written and performed really well. The conversations are both interesting and funny, mixing comedy with drama and crime. The script was truly clever and meaningful, getting a 10/10 from my side.Music: The music in ""Lucy"" is really cool and fits the movie's futuristic feel. The cyberpunk vibe songs make it even more exciting, improving the whole experience. The music in the movie is not just background noise. It plays an important role in setting the mood for each scene.Cinematography: The cinematography in ""Lucy"" has two distinct parts. The beginning of the movie feels exaggerated and like a parody, similar to Bollywood films. However, this ""unprofessional"" approach strangely works, keeping a serious tone despite the dramatics. The second part of the movie changes things up, showing visually impressive action scenes that are surreal and unrealistic. The police car chase scene is really exciting. The movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is just the right length for a tight and engaging story.Overall: ""Lucy"" is a unique sci-fi movie that combines surreal elements, exciting action, and a thought-provoking story. The film is unique and memorable because of its storytelling and visuals. It stands out from other films in its category.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
chain reaction,"Though it's a sci-fi movie and we use to see some crazy events in these kind of movies, this film just trying to save the day with overrated acting. Lads, for the sake of god, working with someone hot and blonde and making her the unusual hero or heroine of the film, DOES NOT make the movie awesome. This stereotype of movies just gain the undeserved and overrated attraction of the off-grade audience. Yes we may have some action in the movie (though it's cheap and again overrated), but there is no way that any of these action scenes (blow-up scenes and hair changing, light speeding, turning into a black stone or liquid) turning into logical back-grounded parts.

No idea what the director wanted to accomplish.,"Remove all the dialogues from this movie or change it to some non- English language like a lot of them are anyway and you will have a fine superhero movie.But in its current state it looks like the film-makers just started shooting some awesome looking scenes, doesn't matter what mountain,horses,lions,space,earth,planet,big bang,lines,circles and whatever else comes to mind. After that they made the actors speak some heavy sounding philosophical quotes.After all that when they were tired they and their brains was only working 10% they came up with kind of a tag-line. ""We are using only 10% of our brains, what if we started using all 100%?"" which is actually a fallacy, and needless to say they connected all those previously shot independently wonderful scenes through that tag-line and this is the result.Watching this is like watching a child playing with a supercomputer. This movie could have been about anything, mortality, values , logic. but in the end it's ultimately about nothing. Just an independent collection of scenes.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting premise but flawed execution,"I never knew Lucy would turn out to be a nice superhero film. All I knew about it was that a woman Lucy breaks the barriers of human brain capacity reaching its maximum. Now the idea that having such a brain capacity will give you the ability perform telekinetic, mind control,control of electromagnetic waves and what not seems a bit too far fetched but it was fun and engaging to watch up to a level. I think that's how you might like the film, ignoring the science aspect of it.The movie begins with man tricking his girlfriend named 'Lucy' (Scarlett Johansson) into delivering a package to some drug-lord in Taiwan. Then it turns out it contains 4 packets a powerful drug called CPH4,one of which which then Lucy is forced to deliver by placing the packet in her belly along with 3 other people bearing the remaining 3 packets. The packet leaks when the buyer hits Lucy hard into her belly and the drug mixed into her blood gives her the ability and power the whole movie circles around. Well now intentions are to go after the drug lord and find the other 3 packets before they are misused.Once the search for the drug lord and drug sets in the action pumps up. We already have seen Scarlett in action as Black Widow of Avengers but here she shows the emotional depth of her character quite well too.Attaining such brain capacity and knowledge Lucy seems to be losing her humanistic ideals (which is again questionable) and she is having hard time digesting such power. Scarlett does it all with ease. Morgan Freeman is also there playing a professor expert in neurological science. He also adds some scientific and philosophical ideals into the film in the first half which was good to watch. Also some thought provoking questions about our existence of life, death,time,emotions and about being humans are raised which really boosted it in sci-fi department. But all this falls apart with an over the top climax going far beyond its reach. Also many of the action sequences become illogical due to Lucy's powers itself. She can hack into any system in the world yet the bad guys reach the destination earlier than her, you know just ensure there is final face-off.Actually Lucy gets a chance to kill the drug-lord for good early in the film but he is just kept injured so that he meets our heroine again at the end. Also it goes into full on '2001:Space Odyssey' mode at the ending which is supposed to wow us but up to the point things had become quite silly to accept any seriousness in the story despite the good visual effects and CGI.There some points in the film where it is better to keep doors of your brain shut and not think too much about what is going, it will help to enjoy this one more. Lucy is weak on story and script, also tries to reach the stars beyond its capacity yet despite its absurdness Lucy is somewhat an enjoyable ride and watchable action flick. Main credit goes to Scarlett who carries the weight of the film with a fine performance.RATING:[2.5/5]",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It just gets worse the more I think about it,"Now, I love movies and I have seen plenty worse than Lucy but for some reason this movie just rubbed me the wrong way and I found myself getting genuinely mad as I watched. This movie stars Scarlet Johanson as Lucy who, early on in the movie is kidnapped and used as a drug mule for this drug that enhances people to use 100% of her brains capacity and, after it gets into her bloodstream, it allows her to do all kinds of supernatural things. Plenty of people have a problem with this premise and I don't really. The film Limitless deals with a similar subject and (although Limitless handled it better and more realistically) I could suspend my disbelief for this premise. And after this moment the movie begins to fall apart. First off I was baffled by some of the director's choices in this movie. A situation would occur and it would suddenly cut to a 'symbolic' show of a similar situation happening in nature like a mouse walking towards a trap or cheetahs stalking prey. And it just seemed so... Pretentious. I get what's he's saying but there was not a hint of subtly in this symbolism. And the whole script just seems so convinced it's being new and groundbreaking it forgets to be any of those things. Stuff just happens, it'll display some impressive visual effect with no explanation of what, how or why and you can tell we're supposed to be amazed saying ""what does it all mean?"". I'll tell you what it means: nothing! There are plenty of other annoyances in the movie, Morgan Freeman's inclusion is pointless, the ending just seems preachy and uneventful. It seems like we're watching everything unfold with no stakes or consequence, and that brings me to my main complaint. Lucy is boring and empty because there are no stakes in anything going on. As soon as she gets these powers there is no conflict or competition. People chase her with guns and try to fight but none of it matters, she can just knock out a whole room without any resistance. We are never told her limitations because she has no limitations, she has no threat. Resulting in her character being boring, undeveloped and leaves all the side characters on the side line because there's nothing they can do in this situation. She's so powerful she needs no help and has no competition resulting in the side characters useless and all of the action scenes are boring and unsuspensful. Lets also not forget how Lucy is a terrible person once she takes the drugs, before she was quirky, Scarlet Johanson played her well but as soon as she becomes a god she is just dangerous. She shoots an innocent cab driver in the leg because he doesn't speak English, drives recklessly and even kills a man while he's being operated on because he apparently 'couldn't be saved anyway'. Nice protagonist writing there. And the ending... Oh my god. The ending. I won't spoil anything, mainly because there's nothing to spoil. After all of the efforts and 'conflict' in this movie amounts to nothing and the movie ends as if it's taught us something so deep but all I learned I wasted two hours of my life watching NOTHING If I were you, I'd skip this one but if the premise interested you I recommend Limitless starring Bradley Cooper. It's much better than whatever this tried to be",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Darwin would be so proud!,"Lucy is an interesting science fiction movie that takes Darwins theory of human evolution and turns it into a science fiction fantasy on the same level as an X-Men movie.The story follows a young woman named Lucy (Scarlet Johansson) who is forced by a Korean mob boss to smuggle a new kind of drug overseas by way of surgically implanting the packaged drug into her lower stomach. She fights back against her captors and ends up getting kicked repeatedly in her stomach which ends up splitting the bag inside her stomach mixing the drug into her system. Almost immediately her body and cells react violently to the drug as she begins to adapt to it on a cellular level ultimately speeding up the evolutionary process which gives her brain access to the untapped potential of the human brain which makes her smarter, faster and stronger.This isn't the first science fiction movie to explore the idea of accelerated evolution using chemistry and it won't be the last. The storyline isn't that different from the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy the only difference being that instead of humans it's Apes and instead of an illegal drug it's a new advancement in chemical science. Although Planet of the Apes is just a bit more realistic than Lucy in terms of how evolution actually works but neither movie are close to being realistic.I did find Lucy to be very entertaining it's a fun action movie with enjoyable characters and gorgeous visuals. The action is like a cross between The Matrix and John Wick combining things like characters being suspended in mid air and fast gunplay.My only real gripe with this movie is Lucy's character basically evolves into what can only be described as a powerful mutant from the X-Men universe but even the X-Men comics and movies idea of evolution is more realistic than Lucy's and that's saying something.I recommend watching this movie if you enjoy science fiction action movies as that's pretty much all it is an entertaining hour and a half movie that you say ""meh it was okay"" to after watching.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
