Still good 20 years later!,"I did not realize it's been that long until I wrote the title for this review... time flies. But the good thing about it, is that Kill Bill doesn't feel dated. I guess that's the advantage of making an homage movie with elements that are purposefully reminiscent of old movies... the final result is pretty timeless. This is pure Tarantino having fun creating something straight from Wire Fu and Chambara movies I'm sure were part of his childhood. Other movies may have more impressive fight choreographies but to this day the Lucy Liu / Uma Thurman fight is one of the best executed: pacing, cinematography, music... just perfect. Highly recommended as a classic Tarantino that doesn't age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's Blue Period is OVER!,"Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie's Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he's lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is ""poor"", or that there are ""no memorable lines"" (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as ""steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine"". He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride's thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker's tool is not his pen: it's his eye.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Bill Is One Hell Of A Thrill,"Pros:
1. The bright colour palette does a wonderful job at highlighting the over-the-top nature of the film.
2. The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal.
3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes.
4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed.
5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes.
6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly.
7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances.
8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes.
9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.Cons:
1. The slow-motion used is extremely unattractive and pointless.
2. There is annoying minor usage of stock action screams.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Cinema has rarely been this exciting!,"Having seen Tarantino's 3 previous films, going into the cinema, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting. With 'Kill Bill', Tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified: he IS the most daring, original - and entertaining! - filmmaker of his generation.

Tarantino made an amazing Collage with this movie. ‚≠ê,"I can't explain why you like this movie so much. I don't know how rare this feeling comes to me. Actually this happens only for this movie. I don't know how can I explain why I like this movie so much. I don't like that much Samurai movies, I don't like that much Gangster movies. I don't know how this movie effected me this much. Is it revenge? No it doesn't have the greatest Screenplay.I really don't know why. If someone would say ""This movie is so nonsense, they're in modern times, so why are they fighting with Katanas? At least for not dying they could use guns."" I would agree and can't argue.Tarantino made an amazing Collage with this movie. But the things is I wasn't familiar with those, at least not one by one. So that's also does'nt explains completely why I like this movie so much.So it could be the technical aspects. Right?Yes it could be but I don't know any other movie that I rated 10 without amazing storyline.Revolutionary acting scenes could be the reason.Or maybe just the brilliant chosen Scores carries the movie?I don't know there are so many things that could be the reason. I think all of them effects the movie positively. It has simple but effective screenplay that based on revenge. It has great action scenes, great technical aspects, great scores. Most importantly it is the Collage of so many things. It's the only movie that brings you the taste of Western with Samurai movies and so many more.

No.Mr. Quentin Tarantino is rather extreme, yes, and it's lovely! And No. Kill Bill is not realistic, but it's not meant to be realistic! Just like... Lord of the Rings, that's not realistic either!

The art direction is beautiful! The camera angles are perfect... just Gorgeous! The lighting, the sound, the dialogs... and of course, the details! No one works with small details the way Quentin does. I must also say that the soundtrack is brilliant and the whole film is just so well casted! Uma Thurman is perfect in the leading role, Darryl Hannah has never been this good before, ever! And Chiaki Kuriyama, even though she has a quite small role, is excellent, even better than she is in ""Battle Royale"". David Carradine is painfully perfect, Michael Madsen is ALWAYS excellent, but never as good as when he works with Tarantino. I must also say that Sonny Chiba was great. I've never been a big fan of Vivica A Fox until now, and I used to think that Lucy Liu was just your average actor but she turned out to be fierce.

"Instant classic, but not for all audiences.","I know it's a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven't seen one of my favorite and refreshing I've seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short, but distinguished list.Kill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.The movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.There are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.I wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just don't like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I don't blame you but it's still worth your while seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

An adrenaline-driven coaster-ride through gratingly bold and captivating martial-arts extravaganza.,"Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

Doesn't have to build up to the action because it's all action!,"Like many of Tarantino's films, this movie features exaggerated, action-packed, and gruesome fight scenes, but with a darkly comedic element. The main plot of this film is an anonymous woman who is referred to as ""The Bride"" is shot by a man named Bill, with whom she used to be acquainted with. She is then in a coma for four years and when she awakes is fearless when preparing to fight Bill and the other members of his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. While it is in the style of a classic, action-packed thriller, this movie is anything but ordinary. With exaggerated and comedic, but still suspenseful fight scenes, intelligent dialogue, stellar acting, and more this is a must-see for all Tarantino fans, martial arts movie fans, action movie fans, and anyone else who wants to enjoy the first two of four hours of purely entertaining from start to finish action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

This movie was brilliant!,"Man, what a film. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references. I also thought the use of B&W throughout was extremely effective. The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.Kill Bill was a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient China. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's swordplay, at no point did I feel that it looked scripted or fake. Even when fighting against more than 50 Crazy 8's, it replicated admirably the incredibly one-sided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years ago.All in all, a great and original film!

Well made action film,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works.

"Kill Bill is one of the brashest, boldest and bloodiest movies I have ever seen, so look over your shoulder, because........... 'Here comes the bride, with only one thing on her mind, a roaring rampage of re","It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully.

Armed with a Samurai sword and a deadly blend of martial arts skills, Uma delivers action, violence and passion as she plays out the character with beautiful precision.Need i say, this is excellently directed, brilliantly scripted and cast, and should be in everyone's Tarantino collection.10/10 Second only to Pulp Fiction.

Revenge Is Never A Straight Line,"Quentin Tarantino is certainly a cinephile's director. Many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works. An undeniably distinctive auteur, Tarantino is often criticized for self-indulgence, but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a vision.""Kill Bill"" feels like a schoolboy's dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds. Take Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"", infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime, and accent it with pop culture references, especially some strong musical numbers. The result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythology.Uma Thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation. A perfect blade is fashioned for her mission, and it amplifies her lethality. Thurman gives a multi-leveled performance full of emotion and cold determination. She faces some strong adversaries and their minions, and she suffers through the terrible toll of her quest.Stylistically, KB plays with slo-mo, bold colors, silhouettes, and ""Crouching Tiger"" physics. Tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlessly.In one of the film's best moments, Thurman faces off against Lucy Liu, circling to the strains of Santa Esmerelda's introduction to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""---one of the greatest dance tracks of all time. In a less subtle scene, she takes to the dance floor in a break-dance killing frenzy to ""Nobody But Me"" by the Human Beinz.A major question for each viewer is: how much gore is too much? Tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment. In fact, he glorifies it in this film which, for my sensibilities, is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance. In one scene he creates a literal bloodbath (bath of blood). Consequently, this film is not for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's Worst Film To Date,"Before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review, let me clear a couple things up. One, I usually love Tarantino--his directing, writing, the films he's produced, etc.--and two, the reason I didn't like Kill Bill Volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violence/gore. I love that stuff and that's the only part of the film that I found even mildly entertaining.Instead, the problem with Kill Bill Volume 1 is that it is extremely boring, almost completely lacks suspense, has awful pacing, and makes a number of self-indulgent stylistic missteps.I say ""almost completely lacks suspense"" only because of the first, relatively short section, where Uma Thurman's character, a former ""hitperson"", fights with another of the same kind, played by Vivica A. Fox. Suspense arises here because we don't know who the characters are yet, we don't know anything about the plot, we don't know what their motives are, etc. There is a sense of venturing into the unknown, where anything could happen.However, after this, Tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of non-sequential story construction, and the bulk of the film concerns Uma Thurman's attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed. That saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something we're already aware of. It has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell _that_ story for the fiftieth time, this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two, and you're trying to read a book while they're telling it.Yes, Tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a ""homage"" that geeky fanboys can have a party game with--the one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of Hawaiian Punch. Who cares? That in itself doesn't make Kill Bill a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story. There is a reason that DVD's consisting only of promotional trailers aren't usually bestsellers.Yes, there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in Kill Bill. However, there aren't enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a story.And yes, as I mentioned, I thought the over-the-top violence/gore was entertaining. If looked at isolated from its context, Quentin almost outdoes Sam Raimi ala Evil Dead here. However, and this is a big however due to having to consider context, Raimi's gallons of blood worked much better-because they were in an engaging, suspenseful story. In Kill Bill, the violence was almost boring.In an effort to be ""retro hip"", Tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as President Bush in an Iraqi mosque. These are ubiquitous and varied, ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning (and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue), to the strained inclusion of Sonny Chiba, to the ridiculous presence of a female Japanese band who can't sing or play their instruments--even though they're only trying to play I-IV-V ""rockabilly"" (and by the way, if this is what Tarantino think counts as quality music, what was he doing as a judge on American Idol?), to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene. The latter is there just because Quentin and the fanboys think it's cool. For me, however, it underscores both the problem with most anime and with Kill Bill--yes, the subject matter, the violence, the attitude, etc. are interesting, but the animation, the storytelling, the pacing, and just about everything else sucks, and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices (such as the Caucasian-looking, big-eyed characters in anime). 'Forced' is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in Kill Bill. Even the foot fetish stuff didn't work for me this time around, and I share the fetish with Tarantino.I'm not usually one to recommend tempering self-indulgence, and I suppose it doesn't matter anyway, since at this point people are going to love Tarantino films just because they're Tarantino, although if this film were made by anyone else, it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 Jeremiah Chechik-directed The Avengers instead. But if this is a sign of the quality to come, if Quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes _just because he likes it_, like a mega-budget mix-tape for a new girlfriend, I'm not watching any longer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A cross between mud wrestling and figure skating,"It's certainly arousing to see a woman in a skintight motorsuit get smeared in sweat and blood and guts for hours on end and Tarantino certainly revels in the humiliation of his muse.The camera dwells with relish on her bruised and bloodied face as she pleads with Bill to spare her life, before she gets shot in the head. We share an intimate appraisal of Uma's potential as a comatose sex object. We partake in every painful fumble when Uma, her legs paralyzed and her nightgown drenched in blood, drags herself to safety.And it goes on and on and on: she gets buried alive, beats her fists into a bloody pulp trying to escape, then, covered in dirt, staggers across the road: a horrible mess of a woman, a mindless zombie. Funny, to be sure. But also something else.All throughout both films she gets shot, stabbed, slashed and thrown across rooms with such remarkable gusto, and she slams into walls and furniture with such satisfying thuds, that you start to wonder how the hell you're supposed to maintain an attitude of ironic detachment and cool appreciation of Tarantino's kitschy aesthetic.Underneath the stunning visuals, the beautiful choreography, and clever references, is the rousing lure of sadism and brutality. If only Tarantino would be honest about it, instead of coming up with a paper-thin ""strong woman"" motif to justify his indulgence.""Kill Bill"" is thrilling and pretty, but also dishonest and demeaning.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of my most favourite films,"When I saw Kill Bill for the first time I just fell in love with the film. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback...with a vengeance. Casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place, Uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place. My favourite member of the deadly viper squad is Elle driver the one with the eye patch I also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital, I was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in Vol 2. They never showed Bill's face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because I never knew what the actor looked like before. The two best scenes are:1. The animated sequence because it was a different story from the film's which made a suitable mood for the perspective. Overall it is the best idea ever the other two films I've seen with animated sequences are Lola Rennt a German movie & Karam an Indian movie and both of them are my all time most favourite films as well as Kill Bill.2. The sword fight with the Crazy 88s just before her revenge with O-Ren-Ishi because it was so unexpected when hundreds of them jumped out of nowhere ready to fight. I thought it was going to be simple because Bill was the main target but it turned out to be more difficult.The main reason why it is one of my favourite is because I'm a huge fan of revenge movies and Kill Bill gives a very deep insight of the topic e.g. Like the Old Klingon Proverb on the screen before the film which is ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" & when Hattori Hanzo said that ""Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest and like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost...to forget where you came in"". It definitely deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 and Vol 2 was also good but not better than Vol 1.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A movie of visual splendor and a mixture of styles.,"This movie is a visual experience of different styles, all combined with also some trademark Tarantino elements.The movie is obviously a case of style over substance. In essence the movie is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning. This however is exactly like how Tarantino intended it to be. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is simple, straightforward, completely over-the-top but above all beautifully shot and superbly directed. The movie its story comes totally secondary, as Tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several, mostly Asian cinema, styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual over-the-top looking sequences. His aim was style and with that this movie most certainly does not disappoint.Always when looking at a Tarantino movie, it becomes obviously that he's a big movie buff and movie lover. Tarantino really shows his love for- and pays homage to Asian cinema and especially anime. Most notably of course in the animated segment (that is great by the way) but also in almost every action/fight sequence in the movie and its violence. It gives the movie its own unique style and an overall atmosphere of 'coolness'.The violence is definitely brutal and straightforward, as gallons of blood are spilled in this movie. But all of the violence is done in such a, deliberately, over-the-top and fake looking way, that it becomes entertaining, rather than shocking or stomach turning. It even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times. The action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot. When things get too graphic the movie simple conveniently switches to black & white or turns to other creative cinematic solutions.The power of this movie is definitely in its visual style and overall style of directing. The movie uses different themes throughout the movie but yet the movie manages to create one big unique identity. The movie never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling, though it all widely differs from each other at times. I think that this is mainly thanks to Tarantino's directing, who keeps the movie and different styles all on one and the same line. Visually the movie is also definitely helped by Robert Richardson fantastic cinematography, who should at least had been rewarded with an Oscar nomination for it.The movie is filled with some big name actors, though not all play a significant part in the movie yet (see ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" for that). Uma Thurman is truly superb as the Bride and I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. She also was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for it. Also really superb in her role was Lucy Liu. Again, also her best role yet.Not of all the trademark Tarantino elements work out well in the movie I definitely missed the typical trademark Tarantino dialog in this movie and for also for most part the trademark non-linear storytelling felled pointless and didn't really served a purpose for the story. It therefor really isn't Tarantino's best but it's definitely his most experimental and most visually orientated, style-full, splendid movie.Unusual, over-the-top but strangely intriguing, entertaining and overall brilliant. Yet another Tarantino must-see!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
one of the best films of all time,"Arguably this should not be a difficult film to review. It is nothing less than brilliant. The story, the direction, the musical score, the casting, the acting, the dialog, the fight choreography, the inset homage to past films ... brilliant.Just brilliant.What makes this film tricky to review is not the film but ironically the film-maker.I do not know the deep background here but I am guessing that QT, at the very height of his creative powers, locked himself in a cabin in the woods for a month and put this opus together. And essentially (in the view of this reviewer) not only created one of the best films of all time but essentially defined his own career by setting a bar so high that even his own future work could not equal it.And there you have it. The hard part of the review.The film is perfection. But in my view QT has yet to produce anything that comes close either in terms of final product or even in terms of effort expended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""A Bloody Ballet of Revenge: Kill Bill Volume 1""","Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece-an adrenaline-fueled revenge epic that redefines the genre with style, flair, and unapologetic violence. From the moment the iconic yellow jumpsuit-clad Bride, played with fierce intensity by Uma Thurman, bursts onto the screen, audiences are thrust into a world where honor, vengeance, and artistry collide in a stunning ballet of blood.Tarantino weaves together a stylistic tapestry that pays homage to a plethora of genres-from martial arts films to spaghetti westerns-while maintaining his signature blend of dark humor and poetic dialogue. The action sequences are carefully choreographed to perfection, showcasing breathtaking sword fights and explosive showdowns that leave viewers both exhilarated and breathless. The sushi shop showdown is a standout moment, where Thurman's unstoppable fury meets a cadre of masked assailants in a whirlwind of expertly crafted combat.Cinematographer Robert Richardson captures each scene with a striking visual aesthetic, alternating between vibrant colors and shadowy noir vibes, enhancing the film's overall impact. Coupled with a pulsating soundtrack that seamlessly ties together the narrative, every scene is a work of art-each frame begging to be paused and appreciated.Tarantino's talent for character development shines through. Each member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad is more than just an adversary; they are richly drawn figures with their own unique stories and motivations. David Carradine's enigmatic Bill looms large, a haunting presence that adds depth to the unfolding drama, and his relationship with the Bride is layered and complex, setting the stage for the ultimate showdown.""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is not for the faint of heart-its brutal violence and graphic imagery may challenge some viewers, but for those who embrace it, the film delivers a cathartic experience unlike any other. As the Bride embarks on her quest for vengeance, the audience is taken on a wild ride filled with jaw-dropping moments, unexpected twists, and an empowering narrative of resilience and determination.In a world filled with cookie-cutter action flicks, Tarantino's bold vision breathes fresh air into the genre.

Not quite Pulp Fiction but really good.,"I saw a sneak preview of this on Monday night and really liked it. Very violent and action packed. Some of the most intense fight scenes I 've ever seen. The blood flows in this movie like Niagara Falls. It doesn't have the quotable witty dialog that that the other Tarantino films have but it is replaced by action. The song ""Bang  Bang"" done by Nancy Sinatra over the opening credits is perfect and relays the sadness in this movie. Everybody talks about how Tarantino copies other films but this is like no movie I've ever seen. Of course this film is not for everybody and you will either love it or hate it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Overrated Tarantino film,"Kill Bill wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but it was still another good movie by Quentin Tarantino.

The ending is such a good hanger too!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"Awakening from a lengthy coma, the expecting ""Bride"" (Uma Thurman) embarks on a lethal killing spree to avenge herself on those responsible for killing her fianc√©e and to find out just what happened to her unborn baby. She has a past - formerly a soldier in the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" - she formerly dated it's leader ""Bill"" (David Carradine) - and so in theory has her work cut out for her as she seeks her revenge. Well, except that is, that the aforementioned ""DVAA"" could not hit a barn door with an Howitzer. Despite their overwhelming numbers, their supposedly expert training and resilience, ""Bride"" mows through them as if they were wheat to her combine harvester. This film has no jeopardy whatsoever. Thurman looks great and packs quite some charisma into her performance, and Tarantino presents a quirky style to the story, but that story is hackneyed and unremarkable. The characterisations are undercooked and frankly nondescript and the fact that we know there is to be a part two, only robs this all too quickly of any sense of menace. Gory and bloody, yes but so what? A strong and feisty woman lead? Yes, but again - so what? The action scenes are well enough choreographed, but the whole thing has a relentlessness to it that really underwhelms. This director usually makes good use of his soundtrack, and the strong and powerful tones of Nancy Sinatra do tee this up well, but afterwards I'm afraid it just descends into mediocrity and I really struggled to appreciate anything different or innovative about this. Disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of the coolest movie I've seen,"I honestly didn't know what to title this review so I've gone for that childish line. But bare with me, because it does make sense. The film is absolutely brilliant and I loved it. I have not much else to say other than to describe it as ""it's cool"". During the action scenes I'd constantly be going ""oh that's awesome"", ""oh that's so cool"" and so on.The one thing that really stood out was the amazing choices of music. I don't know how Tarantino does it, but he absolutely nails the music choices every time and this is no different.The action scenes are shot so magnificently and you guessed it, contains a load of blood and gore. Exactly what you expect and exactly what you want.I like as well how it's clearly written with the idea of this being 2 films, rather than the sequel being rushed to completion because the first did well at the box office (which is why 95% of sequels are made and why they are usually never better than the first). I'm going to go ahead and watch the 2nd film now. But yeah, really loved this film. Must watch in my opinion!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A classic action movie that manages to do everything right.,"This is one of the best, most perfectly balanced, hilarious, action-paced and thrilling movies of the genre.I am a newcomer to Tarantino's work with this being the first of his movies that I've seen, but now I 100% want to see more. Yes, it's gory and violent, but in such an over-the-top way, it makes the movie almost cartoon-like. I am delighted to finally see a well-executed badass female lead in a movie, what with the field being dominated mostly by men, and on top of all of that it still manages to be perfectly, sarcastically funny without being annoying or cringey.Throughout the movie there was never quite a still movement. And somehow the fight sequences were just so balanced and well-choreographed - often, when I'm watching a movie, after a solid few minutes of blood and death I get kind of bored at the repetitiveness of it all. But here, especially during the climactic fight scene with the Crazy 88, I was completely enthralled.Revenge is an oft-used plot device, and can sometimes come off as clich√©d just because of the sheer number of times it's been used, but Tarantino's visual style carries this film in a way that I don't think I've ever seen before. All these unique little quirks that have been incorporated in, from having all the blood-heavy action sequences shot in black and white to make it a little easier on the eyes to the anim√©-esque snippet in the middle, have made this a film that I will not forget in a while.Wow. Just wow.-Sasha.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"As Time Goes on, I Dislike it More and More...","I just felt to write this critic as being a true follower of Tarantino that I believe needs to be expanded. His work in ""KillBill"" is somewhat intense and entertaining, but as time goes I can't help finding weak spots on ""KillBill"". I think people are trying to find a reason to admire it. Quentin is a movie lover, and this movie is his ultimate homage to his movie library of favorites. Yet I found somehow deviated of what his sense of homage is. ¬øIs his tribute to Old Westerns Spaghettis and Oriental Films just a pastiche of unnecessary blood, mistaken for art, and his intended ""cool"" characters lose flame as they blade swords into rambling, yet somehow interesting fights? ¬øHave we granted permission to Quentin to do as he pleases with the camera? The Power we gave to Quentin led him to believe he could enjoy the Midas Touch. His handling on the filmical elements are wonderful, yet the movie lacks a message and a clear concept more than a mixed tribute. His passion overwhelmed him and audience accepts it as a work of art by a master mind. I'll grant you the latter.

Kill Bill Vol. 1 2003 Review,"Brutal and kick-ass. Kill Bill really brings it all from a fun and iconic score, to some savage action that leaves you wanting more.
Kill Bill has an extreme lead protagonist with Uma Thurman as The Bride. And finally, we get a character who doesn't have extreme plot armor, fails and gets back up, and has true challenges and threats. That all combined gives you a lovable character that has you cheering for her for the entire film.
On another note, the cinematography and editing merged with the vicious, blood soaked action is something to be cherished. It's so simple in its execution, yet there are some really beautiful shots and scenes in this film that stick out so much.
The black / blue silhouetted fight scene is definitely one of my favorites. There's even a short animated sequence in this that threw me off at first but really fits in snug with the rest of the film.
All in all, I think it's safe to say that Kill Bill officially is one of my favorite action films now. Simple in the best way possible, giving light to some brilliant performances, an iconic score, and some fun, brutal action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Quentin's back---badder,bloodier,and better","Well,ladies and gentlemen,it's a new millennium and Quentin Tarantino has got a new movie for us. After changing the popular film landscape in the 1990's with the classics ""Reservoir Dogs"",""Pulp Fiction"",and to a much lesser extent,""Jackie Brown"",Tarantino spent a half a decade in hibernation,accompanied by little more than a television set,a movie projector,and collection of Johnny Cash records and a bong. But now he is back after a six year hiatus with ""Kill Bill"",a thrill ride with the grand style of his earlier films and a brilliant tribute to those Shaw Brothers martial arts flicks of the 1970's and the action heroes of that same decade with includs Charles Bronson,Telly Savalas,Burt Reynolds,Clint Eastwood,Fred Williamson,Steve McQueen,Jim Brown and James Coburn. ""Kill Bill"" is also a chockablock of references to bygone movies like ""Master Of The Flying Guillotine"",""The Wu"",and the television shows like ""Hattori Hanzo"". This contains many of the elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining and he continues the tradition of that to.You have the wicked wit,the funky score,the hip-retro cultural artifacts and lots of non-stop,brace in your face action that is not to be missed. Also once again,he has divided the action into chapters with voiceover narrattion to boot,plus he's even got a new trick up his sleeve in which the story is told with some fancy Japanese anime. Basically the film gives much of the screen time to actress Uma Therman and she carries the film with the assurance of a golden diva that she is. The film rises and falls with her,and Thurman pulls that off beautifully in one of the best performances of the year. Thurman plays a professional assassin,attached to a criminal group of bodacious martial arts-trained killers(Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Lucy Liu)who are lead by the unseen,shadowy Bill(unseen in the first installment played by David Carradine). Among the crew she was called Black Mamba,but otherwise simply known as The Bride because she was betrayed on her wedding day when they gunned her down and left her and her near-term child for dead. But she gets her revenge against the ones that tried to kill her and from there the story is a thrill ride of sorts leading up to the next so expect the unexpected. However,a lot of body parts get slashed here and some of it is very gruesome includes scenes of decapitation of heads and a half a head,a leg in severely cut off and a Achilles Tendon gets slashed,a eye and some fingers get chopped off too. This film also has brought back some really good Kung-Fu stars from the 1970's which includes Sonny Chiba,aka ""The Street Fighter"",and so many more....... I'm surprised that martial arts actress Michelle Yeoh is not in this one. And by the way,what Quentin Tarantino movie wouldn't be correct without his main man Samuel L. Jackson in the role as The Organ Man. Jackson,however was in two Tarantino films including the role he should have gotten the Oscar for in ""Pulp Fiction"",which also starred Thurman and opposite Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown"".However,the film ends in a cliffhanger so we will have to wait for the next installment which will be out in early 2004. Be forewarned,this not for the kiddies,so use caution when seeing it. In all,one hellva thrill ride.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Bill is the reason we go to the movies,"Kill Bill is a funny and exciting movie to watch, totally Tarantino style. Is there blood? Yes. Tons of it. Do the characters curse a lot? Yes. Quite a lot. Is it realistic? Not much. Pretty exaggerated in a lot of aspects.Kill Bill follows the story of ""The Bride"", an ex-assassin that tried to leave the ""killing lifestyle"" after knowing that she was pregnant but instead got betrayed by her old assassination squad, the Deadly Viper, leaving her in a coma for 4 years, she now must seek revenge.This is the type of movie that just FELLS GOOD to watch. My dad used to go to the movies to watch Bruce Lee and now i go to the movies to watch Kill Bill. I don't go the movies that often but when i do my goal is not come out from the theater deeply inspired, crying or almost falling asleep. When i go to the movies i want to have fun watching something well designed, a small piece of art. And that's exactly what Kill Bill delivers. The great visuals, a soundtrack that perfectly fits the film, the crazy fights and the creativity in creating the characters and their story just make this film so entertaining to watch.

Escapism of the highest order.,"Described by writer / director Quentin Tarantino as ""a 'duck press' of the grindhouse cinema he'd absorbed over 35 years of his life"", ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" serves as an exhilarating, wild, genuinely visionary epic tale of a character concocted by himself and Uma Thurman. Uma plays ""The Bride"" (whenever her real name is uttered, it's bleeped out, to help accentuate her ""Man with No Name"" quality). The Bride had tried to quit the organization for which she worked, and get married, but boss & lover Bill (David Carradine) sent his lethal international hit squad to eliminate her and everybody at her wedding party. We follow this character as she determinedly hunts down each and every person who did her wrong, and dishes out some thoroughly enjoyable revenge. Tarantino funnels the various martial arts pictures, spaghetti Westerns, and anime that he's admired into one distinct and potent stew, made in a great comic book style, executed with panache and divided into various chapters in a ""Pulp Fiction"" manner, moving back and forth in time, and the pieces are never, ever hard to put together. This is fun and exciting story telling that never shies away from the red stuff, with KNB delivering splatter so unabashedly over the top that it's endlessly amusing. Tarantino's use of soundtrack music is extremely eclectic; what original music there is, is composed by The RZA, but tracks from a rich variety of composers & artists - Bernard Herrmann, Charles Bernstein, Frank Mills, Quincy Jones, Isaac Hayes, Luis Bacalov, Zamfir, Tomoyasu Hotei, Riz Ortolani,and Ennio Morricone make for an excellent listen and a soaring accompaniment to the action, which culminates in a breathless, amazing job of swordplay as The Bride takes on scores of henchmen. The cast is just a pleasure to watch, with Uma an utter delight; it's also fun to see Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Liu as her intended victims. In fact, the whole cast, also featuring Julie Dreyfus, Michael Parks (once again playing Earl McGraw), Chiaki Kuriyama of ""Battle Royale"" fame, and Michael Bowen as sleazy creep Buck (as in ""I'm Buck, and I'm here to..."") is a blast. Michael Madsen briefly sets up his role for Volume 2, and Carradine is only present as a voice at this point; Tarantino having originally envisioned this as one long movie that got broken up into two parts for theatrical release. It's a particular treat to see martial arts legend Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba as the old sword maker who takes a liking to The Bride and is sympathetic to her mission. Even at an hour and 51 minutes, the pacing here never flags, and the movie is just plain fun, with a delightful contribution by musical act The 5, 6, 7, 8's who perform covers as well as their own songs. Right from beginning to end, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" kicks a whole lot of ass. Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Tale of Betrayal and Revenge With Lots of Blood,"In Texas, on the day of her wedding, the pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) is shot in the head by her former boss Bill. His squad of international assassins slaughters all the persons present in the church. The reasons are not explained in the story, but The Bride actually did not die and stays in coma for four years. When she wakes-up, she looks for payback and prepares a list of persons that must die. The first one to be killed is O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and then Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox).  The story, a salad of Steven Segal's `Hard to Kill', `Karate Kid', Ang Lee¬¥s `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and many other films, has so many blood as `Freddy Vs. Jason', but is a great entertainment, with lots of action and black humor. The screenplay is very original and violent, a trademark of Quentin Tarentino. The story is presented in a non-chronological way, and the reasons of the massacre have not been presented yet. In Brazil, only last week `Kill Bill Vol. 1' was released in the movie theaters.

Maybe I'm at just the right age to appreciate the oddball references to pulp TV and film. Tarantino is obviously having fun. There isn't a wasted piece of film anywhere. Uma Thurman surprised me. I've never had much reaction to her before, aside from Pulp Fiction. She's quite effective whether she's trying to move her big toe or slash another of the 88. I've got to buy the soundtrack. Who'd believe that you could have music of Zamfir (the pan flute guy) and the theme from Ironside in the same film?The dialogue is priceless and reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"".

Do you doubt it?,"OK, we all should know by now that Quentin Tarantino has a special affinity for blowing people's minds. In ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", he goes all out (and continued it in ""Vol. 2"").

"Great violence film, but incredibly slow-paced and lacks story","Kill Bill is not only a martial arts film, but also one where the violence is depicted in a stylish and bloody way. As a whole, the film was shot in an artistic way with great acting and artistic dialogs. Colors are simply gorgeous and the music is unbelievably profound.However, the pace of the film is incredibly slow. I'm not saying it lacks fight scenes. What it lacks is the story, so there's nothing to fill in the blank between action sequences. Sometimes ridiculously long shots occur with no obvious reason. What's also worth mentioning is, the last fight scene in the film is also slow as hell. Two women fight with sword and it's about ten to eleven hacks, while the fight scene lasts for several minutes due to some weird long shots where the two actresses stand still there doing nothing...As a whole, the film is a piece of art, but don't go looking for deep plot or thrilling pace.

From what I understand (although the only other Tarantino movie I've seen is Reservoir Dogs), this movie isn't like his other movies because his other movies capture real life violence, and as Quentin says, ""This is the kind of movie characters in his other movies would go to see."" This is because the characters in his other movies are very violent, and they would want to see movies that are violent in a comic book way (Tarantino is excellent at dramatic sampling, and one of the great things he does in this movie was add an interesting black and white cartoon sequence for Lucy Liu's character). This movie is also divided into sections which also adds to the comic book feel.This is one of those movies where you are constantly being reminded that it's a movie with its comic book feel, whereas with a film like Resorvoir Dogs there is less genre and cinematic sampling and the audience gets the feeling they are watching real life being portrayed on screen.I can't capture my enthrallment with this film. I felt Beatrix ""The Bride"" Kiddo's (Uma Thurman) hate throughout. The sound effects and music were very oriental and captured the cinematic and classic 70's Asian feel. One can definitely tell that Quentin is a film geek. There is so much influence in this film: Spaghetti Western, 70's Kung Fu TV show, and some Brian Depalma thrown into the mix. Quentin even says that he takes the best parts from movies he loves; therefore showing the average movie-goer why he has always loved it so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Tarantino Experience: all flash and crass sass,"A juggernaut of technical wizardry, this Quentin Tarantino film (product?) is winking and nodding but not especially human. A die-hard of the neo-Western (where Japanese samurai flicks meet the new-fangled Old West) and TV action thrillers, Tarantino is the master of quick, canny scenes of carnage. It gets awfully bloody, but not in the NC-17 way. No, Tarantino is much too cute, and his imitativeness isn't exploitative or schlocky (as much as he might like it to be). He gives showy roles to many fine actors, and Uma Thurman seems to inspire him to new heights. But he also gets easily sidetracked and becomes self-enamored of scenes that don't play, plod along or get too cheeky (as with the opening bit featuring Vivaca A. Fox, which is good but not quite as solid as the rest of the film). ""Vol. 2"" is more story-heavy, and gives the actors better room to emote, but also features lots of outlandishness, sometimes just for the sake of a cheap, quick laugh. The trickery, comic mayhem, wild ambushes and female ass-kicking don't amount to much in retrospect. Both volumes include some lovely moments, successfully lowball comedy, and they refuse to let up, but do they honestly turn the audience on? I felt exhausted instead of keyed-up.

Horrible,"First of all, I'm a huge Tarantino fan. I've got a gigantic 6 foot poster of my favorite movie, Reservoir Dogs, hanging in my room. So I was extremely excited before seeing Kill Bill. But ten minutes into it I felt like crying. This movie has none of the great things in it that made Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, or Jackie Brown great. It is just Tarantino showing off while trying to make some money. And if you think I'm wrong, just think about it. He split this movie into two just so we would have to pay twice to see one movie. And his excuse was that we ""aren't ready for a three hour long kill bill"". WTF is he talking about.I'm going to give this a 1 vote to bring down the average since Kill Bill doesn't belong anywhere near the top 250. (only there because Tarantino's name is stamped on it).

Violent yet beautiful vengeance,"To the average moviegoer,""Kill Bill"" comes across as a nuanced film that appears shallow litered with flamboyant violence. And yet nothing could be further from the truth. Remarkably unique blend of various genres drawing from an abundant of influences constructing something very much his own. A bride (Uma Thurman) awakes from a long coma no longer carrying the baby before hand. Only revenge motivates her now to hunt down the assassination team that betrayed her, and once a part of. Breathtaking fight scenes function the same as dance numbers would in a musical. Stunningly beautiful and completely innovative.

"In a nutshell, the best movie I've seen in 5 years  (****)","The day I saw ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was the first time I've ever seriously contemplated staying at the theater and seeing it again right afterwards. That's because it is literally so stuffed with cool stuff that it was hard to mentally process it all. I remember that at one point near the end, I was literally trembling with anticipation of what was about to happen.Quentin Tarantino (writer and director of 3 great movies, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"", and ""Reservoir Dogs"") returns after a 6 year absence and if you need any proof that he's still got the magic touch, this is it.Unlike his other films, which were all witty, tough-talking crime dramas, ""Kill Bill"" is a martial arts movie. The ultimate martial arts movie.Uma Thurman plays The Bride (her real name is kept a mystery, and is humorously bleeped whenever anyone says it), a former assassin who is beaten and shot and left for dead on her wedding day by her old crew. She wakes up out of a coma 4 years later, escapes from the hospital and sets out on a mission of revenge against them, and especially against their leader, and her former lover, Bill (David Carradine).That story is pretty old, but a good martial arts movie doesn't need any more.I simply can't describe how good this movie is. I haven't been this involved in a movie, from scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment since, well, ""Pulp Fiction"". The two films are very different, but both have the same shifting time-line structure, bad-ass attitude and utterly brilliant soundtrack.Speaking of that soundtrack, I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many moments that are a PERFECT match between picture and sound.The performances are, across the board, perfect. Everyone (including Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah as her enemies) is completely convincing, but obviously, this is Uma's show. Her character is one of the best in the history of kick-ass, vengeance-seeking good guys. Every smile, cold stare, punch, kick, and tear running down her face you feel all the way down to your soul.Yes sir, QT's still got the touch.Not only is it the best of the year, it's the most invigorating, soul-stirring, heartbreaking, exciting, awe-inspiring FUN time I've had in a theater in many a moon.As most people know, ""Kill Bill"" was originally intended to be one movie, but was nearly four hours long and was cut into two ""volumes"". This was the right decision, because 4 hours of this and my head might have exploded. Plus, believe me when I say that where it ends truly leaves you chomping at the bit for ""Vol. 2"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A seemingly miraculous feat of technical and conceptual innovation.,"If there was one thing we knew about QT prior to Kill Bill it was that he was a perfectionist. If there was another, it was that he was a master of dialogue and character-driven film-making where his visual flourishes were expertly but subtly woven into the background of his films. Thus, when he decided to make his next feature a full-blown action film QT was not only entering new territory but was determined to show us that his mastery of the visual side to film-making was just as sharp as his mastery of the verbal side.One might have argued that he was already accomplished in this respect. After all, there were moments of technical mastery such as the tracking shots in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He gave us an extraordinary example of how split-screen technology can be used to move a story forward in Jackie Brown. His use of the camera in frenetic scenes such as the 'Mr. Pink getaway' scene was as raw and effective as the best action directors and his limited interference with the camera in the majority of his dialogue-driven scenes were indicative of a very disciplined mind reminiscent of the greats such as Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Allen, and of course Kubrick. However, QT believed (and with some justification) that action films are, from a technical point of view, the most difficult films to make well. And if he was to prove his worth as a director he would have to make it is an action director.To say that QT was successful in his desire to cut it as an action director is an understatement of ""gargantuan"" proportions as Kill Bill is an action film that goes beyond any that came before it or have emerged since. Not content to toil in one of the many action sub-genres, QT bridges at least 4 genres from Spaghetti Western to Japanese Anime, seamlessly interweaving the different styles and pushing the boundaries of their conventions to the point that the viewer finds his/herself witnessing a broader yet unique and singular genre of QT's own creation. With each passing scene, QT squeezes, twists, and stretches traditional conventions to find new ways to lure the viewer into his frenetic world of pure vengeance.And this is precisely what makes KB such an extraordinary film-going experience. It is the profoundly imaginative manner in which he conceives of and executes the action scenes that is the most jaw-dropping aspect to this film. This film is built on a seemingly endless series of conceptual flourishes that usurp and assimilate traditional samurai, Kung-Fu, anime, and western genre conventions onto his unique and broader platform. Take for example the moment when the bride plucks the eye out of one her assailants, signaling the film's switch from colour to black and white. The act which becomes more significant to the story in Vol. 2, is a conceptual bridge to the traditional samurai sword-play film convention of filming bloody scenes in black and white so as to avoid censorship. It is with this convention that QT heralds the imminence of blood-shed, and if the eye-plucking is anything to go by, a lot of it.Of course, one mustn't limit one's review of KB to its technical innovation. It is after all a QT film and like all his films its fueled by his typical razor-sharp dialogue and dazzlingly original characters. This is of course yet another factor that raises it above your typical actioneer in that the time is taken to give each of the main characters a back-story and mutually contradicting layers. Naturally, QT's peerless casting plays a part here as he chooses actor after actors who inhabit these layered characters in ways that retrospectively speaking it would seem only they could.The gang of assassins on whom the Bride is wreaking her revenge are played by an unlikely ensemble of actors who each exude a unique brand of cool which is expertly tailored for a film of this nature. Populating the background of this story are an array of characters which together with the actors who play them (e.g., Gordon Lui, Michael Parks , Sonny Chiba, David Carradine) represent a knowing and sometimes audacious nod to the genres that KB is exploring.Central to the film's casting of course is Uma Thurman as both volumes of the film rest on her shoulders. Most important here I believe is that Thurman never once stops being a woman. I have found that one of the most consistently irritating features of heroine-centred films is the tendency for the woman to act like a typical male, specifically, macho hero. Nowhere in the course of this film is there a trace of this in her performance. Instead, we are given a rather interesting portrayal of a woman clinging to her revenge mission as though there was nothing else to live for. Throughout the film, she demonstrates an authentic anger, composure, emotion, and cunning that is distinctly feminine.However, the real star of this film is QT. Ultimately, KB is a reflection of an intuition for film-making that goes beyond special. As the film progressed, I found myself repeatedly re-evaluating a director who I had already considered one of the greats and each time elevating his position in that hierarchy. I almost regretted that KB was 'nothing more' than an action film as films of that genre are often looked down on in acts of ignorant film-snobbery. However, like QT argues, great action films are not easy to make. They involve the choreography of words, sound, and physical movement into a unified whole. KB is a testament to this ideal and as a result it is a memorising piece of film-making that in terms of technical and conceptual innovation is matched only by 2001: A Space Odyssey and Citizen Kane. Seriously!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Stylish revenge flick.,"A pretty fun if slightly trashy movie in my view. To me it's more the kind of movie that fim students or due hard fans may get excited about but leave the casual viewer a bit frustrated while watching. It's a film without ideas for one thing, largely a 2 hour blood bath without any kind of character growth. The swosh sound effects and over the top blood splatters show the film is not to be taken 100% literally and that may account for the enormous almost ludicrous jumps in logic which occur including much of the hospital scence or the apparent ease with which you can bring a sword onto a passenger plane if you wish. The tone is so mixed your not sure if it's meant to be a comedy when funny moments are often followed by moments that can feel quite serious. There's also some logic gaps again like a complete lack of police action. I'm leaning towards it being a comedy, the ridiculously unrealistic gore and the comically bad digital effect of the airplane.The climax is pretty superb in terms of its fight choreography and music though and giving you some satisfaction there but the style can't really substitute for substance. 7/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

This is American cinematic gold that is an absolutely must see,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a woman who was formerly in a gang of assassins who decides it's time to get out of that business, get married and settle down. The night of her wedding her colleagues show up and almost kill her. She wakes up from a coma hell bent on revenge.This movie is directed by legend Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) and stars Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), David Carradine (Death Race 2000), Daryl Hannah (Wall Street), Michael Madsen (Species), Lucy Liu (Chicago), Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day) and Julie Dreyfus (Inglourious Basterds).This movie is as close to perfection as you can get. The cast is very well selected and have perfect chemistry and style to fit Tarantino brilliantly written masterpiece. This movie has cool settings, fun circumstances, and a tremendous soundtrack. The action choreography is a fantastic blend of grindhouse, samurai and martial arts. I adored the cameos by Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu. Tarantino does a great job of working in subtle things like the background cartoons, the hospital sex reference and the pussy wagon truck.

Not sure why the bad reviews,"I am being bemused by the reviews of some pseudo critics who are bashing Tarantino calling this movie stupid etc. So I felt the urge to rebuke some of the negative criticism by saying this: A movie is supposed to entertain not to be clever or sophisticated. If I want something of that nature, I read a book.After a long day's work and after doing my home chores all I want is to sit on the couch and get entertained. And boy did his movie deliver? It sure did and then some.To understand Tarantino's comedy requires a certain breed of people who are are not necessarily clever nor sophisticated but witty and nonconformist.I'm my opinion Kill Bill is a great action movie which covers everything a complete movie is supposed to deliver. It has comedy, smart dialogue, well built characters , a good story and great actors to deliver on all of the above.But without the grand master to orchestrate all this Kill Bill would have been a flop. Instead Tarantino delivered a successful movie which I enjoy watching at least once a year when I want to have a good laugh, see a martial arts movie with chopped body parts but mostly to kill the daily boredom.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The dialogue is fantastic as with any Tarantino film. He is a genius with words. While e not his best screenplay, it's very much enjoyable.

An Absolute Masterpiece,"This movie was so good. The story, visuals, sound. By far one of the best movies i've watched in 2022.Story:
The Story progression of Kill Bill was really smooth, it never left me feeling bored ever. It is constant action and really fast paced, Uma Thurman plays the role of Black Mamba/ The Bride so well i couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.When watching Kill Bill i would recommend keeping in mind that, Kill Bill isn't meant to be realistic. For example, Black Mamba massacres i believe 100 yakuza in 10 minutes.Visuals:
Kill Bill has amazing visuals, every fight scene in the film ( and believe me there are alot ) is filmed so well. Sometimes it feels as if you are playing a video game, because of how the film just plays out.During the Yakuza Massacre, the film swaps to black and white ( for the ratings ) this choice added an interesting element. This film also exaggerates things and doesn't take things to seriouusly, for example O-ren Issii played by Lucy Liu decapitates a man and a fountain of blood sprays from his neck.Sound:
In some movies, sound is overlooked for plot/ story. But it adds so much to a film, Kill Bill has some of the best sound design i've heard in a movies. Every Katana Swing, Kick all sound so sharp like your actually there.One of my Favorite scene is where Black Mamba fights Gogo Yubari. Gogo uses and meteor hammer and ever swing she does sound so crisp and polished. This scene had no music in the background, all you can hear are the swings of the katana and the meteor hammer, giving the scene more tension then if they added background music.In conculsion, I believe Kill Bill is one of those Movies that you have to watch before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bloody and exciting,"Style is the word I would choose to describe this movie. The stylistic choices made by Quentin Tarantino in this film are admirable. From the start of the movie to the end, you get to experience so many different cinematic choices and all of them look stunning on screen.The movie gives you everything that you can expect from a Tarantino film. A non-linear story structure? A story that's dark and gritty but very easy to follow? Gorgeous action scenes with an element of gore attached to them? Everything is present here.But that's not all. You get more! As I mentioned above, Tarantino implemented a lot of stylistic choices in this film, there's a scene that is completely animated like a Japanese anime, there's a scene where it's in black and white to intensify the action sequences and go all-out on the gore element, there's a scene where people are fighting as silhouettes while the background is lit which looks amazing might I add. The camera work is also Top-notch, there a several tracking shots that look stunning and certain camera angles that make the film feel different with each scene.The story is simple to follow, and it does a great job to make the viewer sympathize with our protagonist ""The bride's"" hunger for revenge very early. Dialogues and background music are also great. Keep in mind that this is a very action-heavy movie and the action for the most part goes from TENSE to a bit too CARTOONY but I wouldn't blame you if you would ignore that because it still looks awesome nonetheless.I have but one flaw with the film though, and that would be the rather weak villain played by Lucy Liu. Her acting was good in my opinion but she didn't feel like a formidable foe for ""The bride"".It's a great movie, as expected of Quentin Tarantino, definitely recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Fast, brutal, and stylish. Quentin's back.","Quentin Tarantino's fourth feature film, ""Kill Bill,"" is a rollicking rampage of revenge. Fast, brutal, and stylish, the film reunites some of QT's favorite elements from well-known Asian martial arts films with an American twist. But have no fear, people of Japan--Quentin pays true respect to the classics of the genre, and the individuals who made them. He takes what most audiences are unfamiliar with and presents the varying shreds of material as a splendid mainstream whole (even down to segments of anime).Sure, we have had to wait for another installment because of fat cat Harvey Weinstein, who was after the big bucks when he suggested the film be split into two separate ""volumes,"" but I think I actually prefer ""Kill Bill"" as two pieces. It just builds up the public appreciation for the film and provides us with a good catcher, and a hanging end. The matinee serials that ""Indiana Jones"" paid homage to used to do the same thing--I see no true problem with it. (Although I don't feel that having to pay for extra tickets to see the rest of the movie is a move made without marketing behind it.)It's been a long six years since ""Jackie Brown,"" and for Quentin, it's all been spent on trying to make this movie get made. His breakthrough was with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" one of the greatest films of all time, and his 1994 modern-day masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"" truly named him one of the best directors of this generation. (He has proved he can also act, too, in some of these films.)""Jackie Brown,"" a very good movie (but admittedly not a great one), disappointed many of Quentin's fans, and so he has spent all of this time since that feature film trying to bring ""Kill Bill"" to the screen (an idea that originated during filming of ""Pulp Fiction,"" when he created the film's tagline almost ten years ahead of schedule).What he does with ""Kill Bill"" separates him from being another one-hit-wonder director. ""Kill Bill"" isn't as realistic or perhaps even as meaningful as his other films, but it's a masterpiece in its own right, filled with excessive bloody violence and revenge fantasies that come true. We all wish for a bit of revenge now and again. Some of us get it, and some of us don't.The Bride (Uma Thurman) decides that she wants to get even with the people who tried to assassinate her four years ago, and she'll stop at nothing until she does. The Bride (whose real name we never firmly grasp) was massacred by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah) at the altar four years ago. Bill (David Carradine) was behind it all (""You find me sadistic, don't you?""). But four years pass and The Bride wakes up from a long, deep comatose. Some of her first thoughts?""They killed nine people. They should have killed ten.""There's not much you can say about a movie like ""Kill Bill"" without giving away important plot points or funny moments. Much of the film relies upon Uma Thurman to keep it afloat, and she impressed me very much with this movie. Some of her one-liners and deadpan expressions will go down in cinema history as some of the best--and funniest. (""Your name's Buck, and you're here to--"")Tarantino has stuffed ""Kill Bill"" full of martial arts references. Tarantino (who used to work at a video store before he directed ""Reservoir Dogs"") is a huge fan of movies, and he's admitted to watching (on average) two or three a day. He's a film buff's director, a guy who actually knows something about film. Even The Bride's outfit she wears throughout much of the movie is that in Bruce Lee's final movie.It's a disgrace that those Hobbits received Oscars over ""Kill Bill,"" a much more exciting, involving, and relatable movie. I'm sorry, but although I found ""The Lord of the Rings"" well made, it was also a large knock-off of other films from the genre, and I think Jackson tried to bring too much depth to a story that simply has very little. I can't relate to Hobbits and wizards on magical quests. We can all relate to revenge. And I'm going to get a lot of nasty letters for saying that.But Tarantino has delivered a truly original film, and one that should have been nominated for (among others) Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Director. I'm sorry, but it's true, because this is a finer and more original film than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" installment, despite how much of an impact they have had.This shouldn't turn into a rant, which is why I am going to end my review by saying that ""Kill Bill"" is a film unlike anything I have ever seen. Yep, it's pretty strange, but it's also pretty fun and extremely well made. Quentin hasn't disappointed.

Well for me it's the special feeling of Hong-Kong nostalgia mixed with perhaps the best soundtrack I've ever heard (the ending sequence with the pan flute music beats everything made up to date), hell I even bought the soundtracks of both movies, and I have never bought a soundtrack before. Be careful though if you don't like blood very much because there is A LOT. Yes I think that just because it's a hyped Tarantino movie it makes it even better I admit that, it gives it like an aura making it even better. Anyway I sum up the movie as being a philosophical gory journey through music perfection and a hail to all movie making. 10++ /JonDan",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
GENIUS!,"This movie was intense, creative, unique, not to mention BRILLIANT and all around simply hardcore! Never in my life have i found myself so excited about a movie after leaving the theater. Never in my life have i found myself telling everyone i came in contact with to see this film.

It's definitely not a film for everyone. But if you can stomach it...you will be amazed by it. I give mad props to Quentin Tarantino. This film is like nothing i've ever seen before.

''The Crazy 88'' becomes ''The Dead 88'',"Wow, Tarantino. Yesterday I watched Kill Bill, Its truly a great movie, almost all details of the movie are first rate. The plot is astounding, the action is exciting, the effects served the purpose they needed to serve, the acting was pretty good etc. Being that this was Tarintinos creation this was expected; It truly made 45 minutes feel like ten.Kill Bill is about a former hitwoman, known simply as The Bride after being put into a coma due, to an assassination attempt at her wedding by her former lover, Bill and three hired women assassins; going on to get revenge on her attempted killers while, the movie carries a 1960 Japanese movie's gimmick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Rollercoaster of Martial Arts and Stylish Filmmaking,"The film serves as a visceral blend of martial arts, revenge fantasy, and stylish filmmaking. Vibrant colours, eclectic soundtracks, and compelling characters make it a rollercoaster of sensory experiences. The lead's portrayal is both vulnerable and deadly, offering a multi-layered performance. Exquisitely choreographed fight scenes, particularly the showdown with a notorious gang, stand as spectacular in their own right. Despite the violence, the film strikes an artful balance between homage and originality. However, the non-linear storytelling and stylised gore might not be everyone's cup of tea. Overall, it's a cinematic experience that demands attention and rewards with artistic audacity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"The film tells revenge like a wandering dance. The first person main line plus narration is really good, it can be super succinct to talk about complex multi line. A lot of caricature's exaggeration performance technique and the memory which flashed back wantonly.

There are a lot of long shots in the dance hall, but they are of little practical significance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Another singularly insignificent piece of crap,"Quentin Tarantino is brilliant in his use of animation, B&W and memory scenes but in spite of all that this film still misses on all levels of being a quality film.

I wished this film was more than a cheap 70's karate film knock-off but that is at best it's most endearing quality.

Kill Bill Vol. 1 slashes its way through sword wielding extras in Tarantino's trademark style.,"His ode to Japanese cinema, merging Western tropes with Eastern aesthetics. Blending stylised filters, utilising excessive spraying blood and embedding the art of Japanese animation. Tarantino directs the absolute heck out of this revenge thriller, temporarily acquiring the souls of Kurosawa and Miike to combine epic samurai showdowns with modern limb-slicing gore. Not to mention turning Thurman into the ""Thurminator"". Despite not being the greatest film in his illustrious filmography, it's definitely his most technically proficient. After being left for dead by a group of assassins, a bride seeks revenge by eliminating two of the five members after acquiring a legendary Hattori Hanzo katana.Tarantino, for me, can come across as pretentious at the best of times. Divulging into his own self-indulgence more times than Jackson appears in his films. Don't get me wrong, he's no Malick, but it's a turn off rather than a turn on. Fortunately, his intent focus on the directorial flair as opposed to the ambitiously ostentatious dialogue found in the majority of his earlier films meant that Kill Bill was able to overcome his wearisome wit.Immediately it kicks off with Thurman decimating a sub-urban house with nothing more than a few kicks, knife slashes and a cup of coffee. Tarantino setting the bar high with pleasing choreography, proving his versatility as a genre director. The ornate top-down tracking shots to showcase the set designs. The ingenious use of profoundly heightened volume of stock sound effects found in classic Japanese arts, especially the profound swinging of a sword. Swoosh woosh! Or the impalement of a blade through the chest, as if it came directly from 'Dragonball Z'. It's abrupt. It's harsh. It's Tarantino in a nutshell.Then the narrative switches back and forth between the present time, the aftermath of the wedding and even further in the past with character backstory, presented in absolute stunning anime. The erratic narrative jumps do skew the momentum on multiple occasions. Although many will initially reject Ishii's backstory style, it compliments Tarantino's creative exploration into Asian cinema perfectly and even allows more bloodshed to spill off the screen. Limbs flying in every direction, heads imploding from bullets and Japanese steel piercing the hearts of innocents. A perfect chapter.Chapter Four (atleast I think it was) dips the pacing with an overextended sequence at a sushi bar which unfortunately doesn't particularly highlight Thurman's acting range. But Tarantino brings it back into sixth gear with the inevitable Chapter Five that every viewer will claim to be their favourite segment of the volumes. And it's true. The showdown against the Crazy 88 is one of the greatest sequences in cinematic history. Commencing with a glorious one take walkthrough of the interior before issuing Thurman with an endless wave of subordinates to slash through. Beautiful. The perfect blend of two continental cinemas.My only gripe is Tarantino's excessive over-stylisation choices to which he chose to shroud the onslaught in a monochromatic filter. It's better in colour, believe me. Atleast it concludes sensationally with a gorgeous duel with Ishii in a snow-filled garden, leaving the viewer to eagerly anticipate the sequel. Praise must be given, yet again, to the soundtrack. As with all of his films, the blend of songs and an original score is sublime. Actually, it's perfect. Complimenting every scene audaciously with excellence, particularly the slow-motion entrances.And that's pretty much how one could describe this film. Excellent. It's not his best, but to allow Thurman, Hannah and even Liu to shine in a gory sword-wielding extravaganza, well it's something special. Authentically Western with the exuberance of Japanese cinema. An outstanding love letter by a craftsman at the peak of his power.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Brilliant film please read this for advice on how to get the most out of it,"Tarantino is truly a genius. The way he drops Subtle hints throughout the movie and little Easter eggs you miss the first time watching for all of his films. Uma does a fantastic job showing the emotion, brains, and depth of her character. What makes this movie so good and what makes movie like pulp fiction so good is the way that it's pieced together. Tarantino's films don't just go start to finish they jump around, different chapters, different tools like anime and flash backs. I often don't fully understand Tarantino's films the first time watching because they are so intelligently made they require multiple viewings. The violence and gore is extreme in this film but extremely un realistic/exaggerated and not in the slightest bit disturbing or scary. There's not a lot of movies that can pull of violence that is overly fake and exaggerated but this movie makes it work. If you enjoy the movie after you watch and it's your first time watching I am going to give you some amazing advice. First think about this movie for a day or two think of different scenes and the mystery. Second watch the movie again and look for things you missed maybe even watch it for a third time. DO NOT WATCH KILL BILL 2 RIGHT AFTER!!!!! Although this movie has a volume 1 and 2 you have to remember that this film was created in 2003 and volume 2 in April of 2004. To actually get the best experience like you would've in 2004 when kill bill 2 came out. Please don't deprive yourself of the mystery's, unanswered questions, and the thinking that this movie will cause you to do. Wait about a week to watch volume 2 so volume 1 is still fresh but you have had adequate time to reflect. Hope this advice and review is beneficial.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's samurai saga,"Kill Bill Vol. 1 is an out-and-out Tarantino classic, with its quirky action and unforgettable soundtrack being the main highlights. The BGM is central to the film's unique vibe. Personally, I liked Bang Bang, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood and the Japanese track Shura no Hana, they drive the film's rhythm perfectly.The cinematography stands out as usual, no surprises there baby; it's Tarantino's child, after all. I really liked the dramatic blue lit fight against the Crazy 88. The silhouette shots whether it's the stark contrast of the Bride in the neon lit showdown or the stylized blue-toned lighting which added a visually arresting quality to the film.The final battle scenes were eccentric. While Tarantino's trademark long takes and elaborate action sequences are engaging, some felt unnecessarily stretched which affected the pacing imo. Despite this, Usha's performance as the Bride was captivating, she anchored the film with her commanding presence and emotional depth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Female icon!,"This film has made me want a samurai sword more then anything in the world, the switches between black and white to colour and the animated scenes all contain the same level of excitement and the plot is very well thought out.

Her acting in this is great and it captures her role very extraordinarily well due to her witty responses, lust for blood and most of all revenge!

About as silly as they get,"Kill Bill (the first one) is the silliest movie I've seen in years!  It's sillier than Blazing Saddles, sillier than a Monty Python movie.  It is very cartoonish.  Part of it even is cartoon, (although it's that highly stylized Japanese cartoon).  Uma Thurman plays a good role, but I thought she used to be good looking.  All the murder, mayhem, incredible martial arts, spurting blood, severed limbs, funny character names, and goofy plot twists will keep you munching your popcorn with great animation. This silly piece of fluff is filled with fantastic violence, totally unbelievable plots and characters. Keeping all that in mind, it is hilarious from beginning to end!

Run of the mill and sappy action,"Uma Thurman and the gang use special effects for most of the action, and it comes off as hokey and convoluted. The brief appearance of Gordon Liu as their instructor could have came right out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The rest is typical Quentin Tarantino with him pushing the actors for forced and contrived performances which bury the plot which is ludicrous and yet ends up boring by midway anyway. Tarantino often makes movies that make me cringe, and this was one of the ones that really set up the pattern in his filmography for brutal action with nasty one-liners. None of these actors can really fight in real life, so he brought on Liu for guidance. It's pretty dumb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Slice of Cinematic Perfection,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the action genre and earns its place as one of Quentin Tarantino's most iconic works. A bold, electrifying masterpiece, the film seamlessly blends style, storytelling, and homage to create an unforgettable viewing experience. For many, it stands as one of the greatest films of all time, showcasing Tarantino's unparalleled talent and distinct vision.From the opening moments, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 captivates with its dynamic fusion of genres, paying tribute to classic martial arts cinema, samurai films, and Spaghetti Westerns, while infusing them with Tarantino's signature flair. The film is a visual and auditory marvel, featuring vibrant cinematography, striking colour palettes, and a meticulously curated soundtrack that sets the tone for every scene, elevating both tension and excitement.Uma Thurman's portrayal of The Bride is nothing short of legendary. Her performance is fierce and deeply nuanced, embodying pain, vengeance, and unrelenting determination. Thurman's physicality and emotional depth anchor the film, making The Bride one of cinema's most compelling protagonists. The meticulously choreographed fight sequences, particularly the iconic battle with O-Ren Ishii (played with equal brilliance by Lucy Liu) and the Crazy 88, are masterclasses in action filmmaking-gripping, stylish, and unforgettable.The film's pacing is impeccable, alternating between visceral, high-octane combat and quieter, suspense-filled moments that build tension and deepen the narrative. Tarantino's attention to detail is evident in every frame, from the richly crafted sets to the seamless tonal shifts-whether it's the anime sequence recounting O-Ren's tragic backstory or the playful yet razor-sharp dialogue exchanges.What sets Kill Bill: Vol. 1 apart is its balance of homage and innovation. While it draws inspiration from the greats, it reimagines these influences through Tarantino's unique perspective, making the familiar feel bold and exhilarating. This ability to reinvent classic tropes speaks to Tarantino's genius, ensuring the film's lasting impact and relevance.In conclusion, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is more than a film-it's a cinematic experience that continues to resonate with audiences. With its unforgettable characters, breathtaking choreography, and Tarantino's unmatched directorial precision, it stands as a timeless masterpiece. For fans of stylish, genre-defying storytelling, this film is an essential piece of cinema that demands to be seen and celebrated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Good movie definitely amazing for most,"Finally, watched Kill Bill and it was nice. I would say it deserves the hype however it did give me more or less the same feeling as when I watched Pulp Fiction (small spoiler: nothing much occurred in that movie). Yes, there is a plot, a nice one at that however they have run-of-the-mill storylines but somewhere in there; in both of the films they were made exciting.After a bride and her small gathering of 9 are gunned down during the wedding, she wakes up from a 4-year comma and proceeds to hunt and kill all who were a part of her almost-death experience.The whole production was quite good. The acting was quite good as all the actors were world-class. The fight scenes are quite nice though looking overthought but with how they shot it - it was amazing and tense.(except for the fight between the bride and O-Ren Ishii at the end - that was amazing with the music and all).Great shots also that have produced nice still shots.Favourite parts are shared between the music and the animation. Twisted Nerve and Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood were always classics even before I watched this movie. Animation is something you expect in an actual anime not something like this.Overall good movie, probably not my type however I officially understand why people like Quentin Tarantino. The man makes good movies.I will most probably be watching the second movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Stylistically unbelievable,"Quentin's ode to kung fu films is a visual and cinematic masterpiece. We'd never seen anything like it in the cinema, and I remember being completely blown away, similar to Pulp Fiction and The Dark Knight.Thurman stars as The Bride, a deadly assassin left for dead at her wedding by the titular Bill and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Part 1 shows The Bride emerging from a coma and exacting revenge on the first two Vipers, Fox and Liu.Liu in particular is utterly awesome as O-Ren Ishii, a lethal Yakuza leader surrounded by her own crew of psychos for the Bride to cut through.

That scene in which The Bride is killing the 88s is just one of the most glorious scenes I've ever, well, scene. But I found the characters very bland and I found I couldn't care about any of the characters. The action sequences (apart from the incredible Crazy 88s scene) weren't very well shot or directed.

"In one word, awful","I caught Mr. Tarantino's latest piece at the Stockholm Film Festival and I was greatly disappointed, to put it mildly. This film is a piece of sh*t. There's just no two ways about it. It stinks.The characters are flatter than racoons on a highway, and the depth and development of the story is put to shame by most Italian operas. There is no trace of the intricate story building of Pulp Fiction, nor of the empathy for the characters sometimes found in Jackie Brown.All we get here is an endless orgy of √ºber-cool nasty people in designer clothing cutting off feet on highly stylized stage sets, with fountaineous gushes of blood the high-point of the fun.The action scenes are tired, bleak copies only. They have already been done better in countless asian genre movies. Uma Thurman fights a large number of black-suited opponents at the same time? Well, wasn't that already done in Matrix II? It's not really funny the second time around, is it?There is no longer any originality in Tarantino's work. Everything is borrowed, everything is an hommage to something or other. But with no focus of its own, no vision to guide it along, the movie just disintegrates into a hodge-podge of stolen scenes and stolen ideas. Kill Bill just doesn't have a ""soul"".

Putrid potboiler glorifying gangsterism with comic book characters,"This has got to be Tarentino's worst and hopefully it will stay that way.

Not my favorite Tarantino....,"It says alot giving ""a half of a movie"" 8/10, and it still are far from my favorite Tarantino. The Kill Bills proves one thing; in the right hands style trumps substance. And Tarantino is aware, making this a very stylish, simplistic tale with two handfuls of ingredients, like the manga style origin story of Lucy Lues character. Uma Thurmans The Bride will go into film history as one of the icons, because she is just way too cool. The fightscene with Fox is insanly good choreographed, with QTs usual style of fun factor when the daughter arrives with 2 bloodsoaked women. His love for Asian cinema has never been more on display, even getting Sonny Chiba to guest star. The problem for me is the dialogue. It's so ""I'm telling you this, because you are watching a movie"". It feels so far from organic, that the movie lost me several times. Specially Michael Madson and his very strange monolouges. So nothing is perfect, even from Tarantino. And it's almost impossible to rate a movie that's half a story.

"Cutting Through the Mixed Bag: Kill Bill Offers Stylish Action and Over-the-Top Violence, but with a Hollow Plot","Kill Bill is a movie that is sure to polarize audiences, and for me, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there is a lot to appreciate about the film, including its stylish visuals and dynamic action scenes. However, for me, the overly dramatic style can sometimes feel a bit forced and detract from the overall impact of the film.While I appreciate director Quentin Tarantino's love for over-the-top violence and stylistic flourishes, there are times when it feels like too much. The film's revenge plot can sometimes feel a bit hollow, and the characters can be difficult to fully invest in. However, there is no denying the impressive craftsmanship on display in the film's action scenes, which are expertly choreographed and executed.All in all, I would give Kill Bill a 6 out of 10.

Or even an artist drawing, perfect and brilliant masterpiece. While I'm watching the movie, i'm thinking, this is truly like i'm watching an artist doing his art. Every single shot, scene, dialogue, set, is thought of thoroughly and immaculately. Even the choice of music and the animation were great!!The exaggerated fight scenes with the blood baths were like dark humor in a sense. Blood spraying and nonsensical yet brilliant fight scene. This movie is Vulgar and violent yet extremely entertaining! Even though i don't like action movie, I enjoyed the hell out of this. Very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of Tarantino's best,"This is a great action film and surely stands amongst Qurntin Traction's best works. The screenplay is just faultless and you couldn't ask for more from this kind of film in that regard. The transitions etc are extremely well done. Really good acting too and Uma Thurman should be proud of herself for this movie. The dialogue is actually pretty good too in my opinion, some criticise this element but like most of Tarantino's films I think it's very well written.The plot is a simple one regarding revenge, but the film doesn't need anything more. The action is great enough to keep you watching and it all results in an unforgettable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"A very impressive work, despite its flaws","Although cleverly styled, and filled with some fantastic performances and direction, Kill Bill Vol. 1 suffers most from trying to find its tone through its clever, although complex storyline. Quentin Tarantino has no doubt made another very impressive film, and one that will be surely admired. However, Vol. 1 of this series of films is by far the weaker half. The film struggles with finding which tone to take, balancing many ideas, but never sticking to one, and it is because of this that the film can sometimes feel a bit frustrating or hard to follow. That being said, there is plenty of impressive moments in the film to catch your eye. The action sequences are fantastic, although a little drawn out. Uma Thurman shines as her character the Bride, and truly brings the much needed lifeforce to this revenge driven story. The writing can be a bit messy, but is very interesting concept wise, and very intriguing to follow. In the end, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is an impressive accomplishment, bogged down by a few hard moments.

Revenge and the Black Manba,"Comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead. The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that ""if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there."" Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, "" Black Manba"" as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake"" team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action. In the end, what can be said of Kill Bill One? If this film is fantastic, I can't wait for part II. (of which there is) Excellent. ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"This movie was a bloody, violent mess... and I loved it! Uma Thurman plays an absolute badass that you love to root for and, under the direction of Quentin Tarantino, gives a stellar performance.
If you've ever seen a Tarantino movie, you just about know what you're getting: violence, killer dialogue, beautiful cinematography, astounding score... feet shots. And this movie gives it all in abundance.
This was a really exciting movie. I found myself on the edge of my seat, eyes fixated on the screen, distractions coming up left and right around me and on my phone, but my eyes refusing to look away from the screen for fear of missing something.
There's not a second of screen time wasted in this film. Tarantino gets right to the point, telling his story without gimmick and leaving the audience genuinely wanting more (lucky, at the time of my watching, Volume 2 is also available for immediate watching so the ending doesn't leave too much of a cliffhanger for me).
Some of the creative choices behind this movie are unique and also add to the charm of the film. The decision to strip certain scenes of their color or to portray certain scenes using anime were extremely interesting and added a certain extra kick to the films that is uniquely Tarantino.
This was a fantastic bloodbath of a revenge story that delivered just the right amount of everything it needed to be a true cinematic success. Quentin Tarantino once again proves himself incapable of producing a ""bad"" movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Bride was killed,"The movie is amazing, every part of it, accept the Action, Uma Thurman killed the Bride with her unathletic movement and sword swinging, keep in mind she had trained for 3 months 9-5 straight to be more athletic, and yet she was so bad that honestly the character of The Bride was Killed, if they had the resources we have today and what actor put themselves through today, I think this move would have been one for the decades, but I just can't look past the horrible sword swinging and dishonoring a Samurai sword, past that the music and Quentin's work with the camera and everything else, just everything else was perfect honestly, I loved it and still enjoyed it very very much, Thanks Quentin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Wildest Tarantino Film,"In this first volume of Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino makes an incredible homage to b-movies. I find it interesting that they censor the name of our protagonist and still manage to make the viewer care without knowing her name. The music is fantastic as well as the anime part, both aspects help a lot to make this film the great tribute to b-movies that it is. You can see in each of the dialogues how Tarantino is a master screenwriter. The bloody violence is taken to the extreme, which makes the film more fun because it is so exaggerated instead of disturbing it is funny, and the action is also, which sometimes becomes a bit extensive.Good photography, incredible shots, and great editing.

Definitely one of Quentin's best movies, up there with Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained etc. Uma Thurman was the perfect casting choice for The Bride.

It's equal parts laugh out loud hilarious and incredibly over the top, but it never forgets its place and is amusing the entire way through.The action and choreography is absolutely stunning, especially the battle featuring the crazy 88. The soundtrack is also notable, mainly for its strangeness. Stylistically it's goofy as heck, but it's that zany Tarantino humor that truly makes the audience laugh out loud. There are a couple of issues I have with writing here and there, but it's easy to forgive these faults for the rest of the adventure is nutty and incredibly entertaining.It's safe to say that it is one of the most entertaining flicks (if you don't mind gallons of red paint) ever crafted, one that confines itself to no boundaries and leaves no stone unturned in The Bride's quest for revenge.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Nice spin on exploitation genre,"The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens after 4 years in a coma. It was her wedding day and she was pregnant. She was attacked and now she has no child. She's after vengeance on her attackers. She kills Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who has since become a suburban housewife. Then we see she has already crossed out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Then it flashes back to the wedding and when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) tried to kill her in the hospital. She's saved at the last minute by a call from Bill (David Carradine). The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre, but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling, mixed media, and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish. And it's beautiful when the action is so well done like the battle with O-Ren Ishii.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill Quentin,"It's not by chance that the credits give this the honor of being the '4Th Tarantino Film', 4 being the number associated in some parts of Asia with death. But it's not the abundance of gory executions the ominous number should be referred to, but rather the final demise of any creativity that this bold icon of shoddy plagiarism represents.Kill Bill is the ultimate exploitation movie, and reflects all too well the complete lack of ideas of this era of Hollywood globalization that which until now we thought was best portrayed by the Matrix trilogy. Kill Bill takes the omnivorous homogenizing machine one step further the 'tribute' into 'cut and paste' land. At its worst, the movie is a repetitive cartoon.At its best, this is a clever pastiche of spectacular scenes all of which give the viewer an uncomfortable feeling of 'd√©j√† vu'. But indeed, that's what many film viewers like to pay for anyway, as the 'tell all' movie trailers of late seem to indicate. No surprises, lavish special effects. The problem is that Tarantino never gets even close to the spontaneity of the many low-budget flicks he tries to imitate. Sure, it's possible that the protectionist US movie and cartoon market has saved many viewers from experiencing the original versions of Quentin's 'tributes'. And the product is definitely sleek and polished, but who wouldn't have achieve such shine with the power of the then almighty dollar?Like Stone in 'Natural Born Killers' Tarantino switches back and forth between 'real' and cartoon reality. Unlike Stone's stylish MTV era animation, here we have only apparently more appropriate anime-style gore-fests. The graphic style is reminiscent of early seventies anime, but the action is all 'Okuto No Ken'. The use of sharp, overexposed black and white for the grisliest scenes is excellent, but wait, where did I see that?The Japanese scenes are pathetic at best. They really look like the product of a fanboy, who oh-so-desperately tries to recreate the texture of his wet dreams, failing miserably at giving it a life of its own. The icon for this effort is Lucy Liu's casting as O-Ishii 'cottonmouth', as clumsy on the set as she is desperately trying to utter Japanese that doesn't sound completely inadequate to any minimally proficient viewer. Here the director loses a great opportunity to dub the less-than-capable actress with a Japanese voice actor, maybe with intentionally poor lip-sync. Now, that would have been clever, and would have also spared my ears. The 'best of worst' performance is however the 'table speech' at the Yakuza conference (I suspect the only research done for Kill Bill was adding Black Rain to the movies-to-copy pile). Thankfully Liu delivers the speech in English. Too bad she is lousy at that, and, in any case, we heard that stuff from Honey Bunny, in a better movie. Ironically Tarantino is at his best when staying away from Asian-themed schlock and indulging instead in sharply exposing the Ugly American. The Texas scenes are memorable, as the ugliness of the hospital comatose rape word. Unfortunately even that's where self indulgence and self referencing abound. The Pussy Wagon reminds nostalgic viewers of Zed's chopper, and the hospital ward his dungeon. Unfortunately, in show business you can pull that kind of trick once: the second time, sorry, you are repeating yourself, albeit stylishly.I resisted watching this embarrassing excuse for movie until both DVD editions where in the cheap movie rack. Now I wish I waited a little longer.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A plus B movie,"Yes, it's got a b movie plotline. Yes, it pays homage to everything from Shaw Brothers Kung Fu flicks to Spaghetti westerns to Kurosawa to every exploitation movie ever made. It even has a Japanese anime sequence. And yes, I realize that, as I've described it, Kill Bill: Volume One seems pretty unoriginal.But mark my words, it's like nothing you've ever seen... Nothing.I also realize that from the trailers, the movie looks kinda silly, and it is. But there's something going on beneath the surface that I can't quite put my finger on. I've only seen it once (four days before offiicial release at a press screening) so I'm not quite sure what that thing is yet. Rest assured, I'll see it a few more times before it's all said and done.However, I think much of it has to do with the performances. Uma Thurman just plain blew me away. Much will be said about how physical a performance this is, and that's true, but that's not what impressed me the most. What really got me was the raw emotion she brought to the role. In a film where many implausable things are taking place, she grounds us in a stark reality. And what about that Luci Lu? After Aly Mcbeal, the Charlie's Angels movies, and Ecks vs. Sever, I had all but permanently stricken Mrs. Lu from my cool book. Well, she is absolute dynamite in this film! She's frightening, funny, sly, and even sympathetic.Much will also be said about the film's violence. And yes, it's gleefuly violent. Cartoonishly violent. Ironicly enough, the least cartoonish violence in the film is in fact a cartoon. I defy anyone to not be disturbed by the amime sequence. But after a day or two, you'll start thinking about that opening sequence. Nothing funny about that. Then you'll rethink The House of Blue Leaves segment. Yeah, it's funny, but there's something about it that's just... unsettling.I've tried to claim that this movie might be serious when actually, I'm still not sure. But I've thought about it constantly for the past three days, so there must be something deeper going on.Then again, maybe not. Either way, kudos to Mr. Tarantino for, yet again, making a movie for an audience of one and getting away with it.He's 4 for 4 in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I love It!!!,"This movie is super packed with wall to wall martial arts action! Kill Bill is the story of an assassin that became pregnant attempted to start a new life then was attacked for leaving the group she worked with. She survived the attack on her life and sought her revenge on her attackers once she woke up from several years in a coma. This film is loaded with great actors such as Uma Thurman as The Bride, Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and David Carradine also appear in this film although their characters don't truly manifest until Kill Bill Vol. 2. While it is easy to get lost in the action and get turned off by some of the over the top highly improbable special effects, this film is really just fun to watch and try to figure out what is going on in the mind of Quentin Tarantino as he produces films with such a unique style of editing and transition between scenes. While some of his films can be hard to keep up with kill Bill is pretty easy to follow but sometimes hard to watch as the ""blood and guts factor"" can be a little rough. The major focus of this film is the story of The Bride and her journey to exact revenge on her attackers and she does this in fabulous fashion! It seems that there has been such a decline in great martial arts films over the last few decades and Kill Bill Vol. 1 is defiantly a film that could light a fire in this genre. The theme of this film is purely revenge at its finest! To be more precise, revenge against the individuals that tried to destroy her life and ended her chance to be with her family. A true story of revenge reminiscent of films such as ""The Punisher"" and ""Gladiator"".Some of the things about this film that really stuck out to me similar to most Tarantino films, were the many transitions through time the story jumps back and forth through the timeline to help piece the story of The Bride together. Also the different shots in which the characters are captured truly presents the actors in intense dramatic fashion, some of the unrealistic gore was slightly over the top but I truly believe that simply captures Tarantino's style in film production. This series is definitely on the list of my favorites when I just want to sit back and watch a good fight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Awesome use of everything action!,"Last night I saw the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life: Kill Bill. This movie did everything I wanted it do and then showed me what I had no idea I wanted to see. Quentin Tarantino made the movie that I always wanted to make and did the same stuff I have dreamed to put into a movie. For this I hate him because he made my movie and it looks awesome. That being said, he's created an awesome satire on the traditional action movie with his combination and use of setting and story telling.Tarantino uses alot of signature moves in his 4th film, for example starting the movie en medius res and detailing each point before backing up or moving on to the next. The score (which I belive is orginal) has an offbeat 70's feel to it with some very classic chords that could have been taken right out of a Bruce Lee movie.Although at times it is a bit jumpy when it comes to the plot the movie isn't really made for the plot here.

Part one of a three plus hour film.,"Kill Bill: Volume One (2003) was the first part of a three and a half hour film. Instead of putting out a three and a half hour grind house picture, the directed split it in half and got two movies out of the production. Quentin Tarentino knew better than to try and direct the action scenes himself so he hired Yuen Woo-Ping to direct the action. When you combine The Bride Wore Black, From Bombay to Nagoya and Lady Snow Blood you get one of the most interesting films of 2003.The movie is about a woman simply known as the Bride (Uma Thurman). She was a member of an elite team of assassins known as the DiVAS (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox). All of it's members had code names of poisonous snakes. Well, she wanted to leave but it ain't so easy to leave the business. After being in a coma for nearly five years, The Bride plots her revenge to get the rest of the Vipers and their ring leader Bill (David Carradine). The road to revenge is filled with a lot of obstacles. Can The Bride achieve her goals and eliminate the DiVAs or will they be able to stop her dead in her tracks?I didn't like the American release but I saw the movie again on a Japanese import D.V.D. and I was quite impressed by the uncut version.

8.5 ?? How many people Tarantino payed for reaching that ?,"We have been waiting many years for this new Tarantino movie. It was better waiting more and get something else. How people could rate this mess 8.5? Unbelieveble. This movie seems a chinese movie from 35 years ago which has been remade using famous occidental actors. The plot is pretty cheap, banal and simple. The movie is monotonous and also a little beat boring. Based just on some sword duel (all identical) and that's it. It is not spectacular, too few crowd in the movie, nothing is new. The real vote for this movie should be 1 but, as other many times, the director of the cinematography helps the director to raise some vote more using nice games of colors and giving a nice look to a real useless filmband. I'll don't see for sure the next one (Kill Bill chapter 2). I already know that, after killing, in this one, 3 of her 5 ennemies, Mamba will kill the other 2 in the next one. Just one difference: the duel between Mamba an Bill will be longer. For that reason she killed 3 people in the first movie and just 2 in the second one.

Very poor film,"The fighting scenes were slow and boring, especially uma she looked all lanky and unnatural it was just funny watching her.QT thought he could get away with it by having her cut someones arm off now and again.The last fight scene with lucy lu, what was that, it was nothing, just two un-coordinated women looking at each other for too long.I was hoping uma dies throughout the whole film because u don't care for her at all. If your going to have a basic plot the action has to be great and the characters likable, it wasn't they weren't.The line where uma says something like, she looks like shes wearing something from a star trek movie summed it up for me, QT a geek and a joke. I cant wait for his war movie maybe he will make some more star trek references.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino at his best,"I'm a big Tarantino fan. Though clearly not as good as ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Resevoir Dogs,"" I genuinely enjoyed ""Jackie Brown."" And since blessed with the opportunity to watch ""Kill Bill: Volume One"" before its theatrical release, and being one of the first to vote for it on IMDB, I feel obliged to offer the following advice to all those who have bothered to look up this movie on this web site: Buy your tickets in advance and see it on the day it opens. ""Kill Bill"" is Tarantino at his finest -- intelligently irreverent and violently entertaining. I would love to describe the opening scene, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for any prospective audience member: it can't be described -- it must be experienced. It's absolutely hysterical.""Kill Bill"" is a salute to the spaghetti Western and cheesy Kung-Fu film as only Tarantino can deliver it. ""The Village Voice"" described ""Kill Bill"" as one of the most violent films in the history of American cinema, but I would strongly disagree. I have a hard time stomaching extreme violence -- odd for a Tarantino fan, I realize. I turned my head whenever [unnamed character]* gets his head blown off while riding in the car in [unnamed Tarantino film]. The violence in ""Kill Bill"" is purposely excessive; it's like what you would expect from an R-rated cartoon. ""Kill Bill"" is the only film in which I have laughed uproariously after watching someone get their head chopped off.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give ""Kill Bill"" a TEN.*Info left out to avoid spoiling it for anyone out there who is totally new to Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Love this film, first time seeing it and the stunts are phenomenal","""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" showcases Quentin Tarantino's mastery of martial arts techniques, resembling a virtuoso violinist racing through ""Flight of the Bumble Bee"" or an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for ""Lady of Spain."" The movie's story is a distillation of the universe of martial arts movies, elevated to a trancelike mastery of the material. Tarantino's story engine is revenge, with the opening scene where Bill kills all members of a bridal party and leaves The Bride (Uma Thurman) for dead. She survives in a coma and is awakened by a mosquito's buzz, reminding us of Manny Farber's definition of the auteur theory.The Bride is no Emily Dickinson, but she reverses her paralysis in her legs by ""focusing."" She vows vengeance on the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and as ""Volume 1"" concludes, she is about half-finished. She wipes out Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Kill Bill: Vol 1 , is a film by Tarantino, features a blend of black and white, slo-mo, and bleeped names for effect. The animated sequence, which takes us to Tokyo and introduces O-Ren, is sneaky and allows Tarantino to deal with material that might seem too real in live action. The scene deals with a Mafia kingpin's pedophilia, which works well in animated long shots but would get the movie an NC-17 in live action. Before arriving in Tokyo, The Bride obtains a sword from retired Hattori Hanzo, who is hesitant to use it. Later, the sword must face Go Yubari, O-Ren's teenage bodyguard and a major in medieval studies, who uses the mace and chain as her weapon. Thurman wears a costume identical to Bruce Lee's from his last film, which is not intended as coincidence or impersonation. The Hannah character whistles the theme from ""Twisted Nerve"" (1968), which could be a leakage between parallel universes in the movies. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Bill (David Carradine). The movie is all storytelling and no story, with motivations having no psychological depth or resonance. The characters consist of their characteristics, suggesting a parallel universe where all of this makes sense in the same way that a superhero's origin story makes sense. In a sequence where The Bride single-handedly wipes out O-Ren and her entire team, including the Crazy 88 Fighters, we are reminded of Neo fighting the clones of Agent Smith in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" except the Crazy 88 Fighters are individual human beings. The Bride wins because she kills everybody without getting killed herself, and as far as the martial arts genre is concerned, it might as well be the heroine. All major characters except Bill are women, with the men being emasculated right out of the picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Fast paced cult action flick that mocks oriental martial arts films and B-type movies,"Quentin Tarantino has done it again. This time he returns with this odd western spaghetti/martial arts/action movie that turns out to be brilliant in it's content and in it's message.The story centers around a woman only known as 'The Bride' (everytime someone says her name, we can hear a beep), that was brutally mistreated on her wedding rehearsal, along with her groom and friends (all killed), by a gang known as the Deadly Viper Organisation led by a man only known as Bill. Even with a bullet in her head, she doesn't die and swears revenge on all that were involved in the massacre. And here begins a wild ride filled with fights, samurai swords, and a lot of blood.Once again, Tarantino delivers us a fun-filled crazy plot, different from his last movies, and in which with 'Kill Bill Vol.1', he exploits ironically this unusual western spaghetti flick mixed with hard martial arts action, that of course mocks the oriental flicks of the same genre and uses the B-type films main theme: vengeance. The result is a bloody fast paced action movie that really achieves what it's meant to achieve, and that's to entertain.Uma Thurman is brilliant with her deadly 'Bride' role, and she rocks with her legendary Hattori Hanzo sword. She highlights this movie. The rest of the cast are an interesting choice and we get to know four members of the group. The O-Ren Rishii animated introduction was an excellent point by the way.RZA gives us a strange but adequate soundtrack with pop, country, rock and oriental influences.Finishing up, if you're a Tarantino fan and want to see a flick filled with bloody martial arts action and a story about vengeance, then 'Kill Bill Vol.1' is a success in those patterns - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Best Tarantino movie for me,"I think this movie has too many good parts. First off all, it has a developing story, which is great. It's soundtrack became a classical one. It's fight scenes are perfect, I really like Hattori Hanzo (I don't know why), and Uma Thurman acts very good in the movie. It became a cult in cinema history I think, and everybody must see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Temporality and Sadism,"First point, Kill Bill vol.1 and Kill Bill vol.2 are of course the same film, cut in two for reasons of theatrical exploitation, so there is no point in doing two separate reviews.It is a strange object, monstrous and sublime, devoid of any narrative credibility, mixing heterogeneous and sometimes almost ridiculous elements that are difficult to love all of them, but carried by an epic breath and a limitless passion for cinema.The film is a truly enjoyable festival of staging effects of all kinds, varying depending on which part we are in and drawing on the very sources of the genre in question. When Tarantino uses a shot of Sergio Leone on the boots of killers on the move, he is obviously not trying to hide. The quote is obvious, sincere, passionate, and above all effective in the context of the scene.The actors' performances are also enjoyable and exciting. Thurman is explosive and sensual. Michael Madsen is always fantastic with Tarantino. Great moments of sadism, one of Tarantino's major themes, dot the film and form its underlying spirit.What for me is the other great Tarantinian theme, temporality, is explored by an extremely rich and risky narration, structured with virtuosity by chapters, temporal leaps and flashbacks, which allow us to highlight the decisive moments. This is perhaps the most impressive aspect of a double film which, although disparate and imperfect, carries everything in its path.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Sensationalist Splurge,"Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee and martial arts movies has captivated audiences around the world for nearly two decades. It is brash, action-packed, and bold. The central theme of vengeance, however, is not something that should be so easily touted as righteous. How easily can we be swayed to support a character like The Bride? To err is human but to forgive is divine. I cannot omit the great spectacle the film is though. Kill Bill soars in its practical effects and creativity. I especially enjoyed the anime styling of Oren Ishii's backstory. Much of the movie is steeped in smart artistic decisions such as this. Kill Bill is a movie I enjoyed but not something I will re-watch without sincere contemplation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Thumbs were kind of going up, but were chopped off","I saw the movie in the local cinema and well, I went in with mixed expectations and left with mixed feelings about the new Tarantino movie. I expected to see a lot of milking of seventies cinema, television and music and I think Tarantino milked the whole decade dry, or what was left of it after his earlier movies, in this first part of Kill Bill. The main reason I want to see part two is to see what could possibly be left to milk from the seventies to fill up the second part of the movie. As a fan of seventies cinema, television and music I feel irritated by the use of the Green Hornet theme music and other such milking, it feels cheap and too easy to me. But these irritations aside I loved Uma Thurman in this movie and it's great to see her carry a lead and hack away like she means it. Hack away FOR A WHILE, that is, not for a whole hour. Halfway through the big lengthy kung fu massacre I was really starting to look at my watch and thinking this is ridiculous by any standard, comedy, horror, drama or whatever. Can we just kill Bill and get it over with?",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Top notch action,"If you are into revenge flicks this one is the all time best. But you must see both volumes together to get the whole story. Great action and fight sequences, kind of like John wick but a kick ass girl instead. Uma plays her part exceptionally well and comes across as quite the bad ass. Stellar cast, seeing ""quai chai cane"" (kung fu tv show) David Carradine as the villain is fun. Very much like a comic book as it progresses from one villain to the next on Uma's list as she wipes them out. I watched this on a whim only because it is a Quentin Tarantino movie, plan on watching all of his movies in a binge watch. Lots of vicious violence and lots of blood and gore. Not for the squeamish and definitely not for kids. Lots of foul language, brief nudity, no questionable content, but lots and lots of action. Be sure to see volume 2 after this, it picks up where this one leaves off. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
KILL BILL,"Yes, I'm reviewing both Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together because they were filmed simultaneously and tell a single story. I don't think there's much difference in how they should be analyzed, as they complement each other well. My overall impression? They're great films, but they fall short of perfection.Kill Bill captivated me with its opening suspense, maintained a steady pace, and concluded on a strong note. Both the first and second films offer gripping entertainment. I gave them a solid 8 out of 10. The reason? Despite the engaging narrative and stylish execution, certain aspects hold it back for me.One of the first things I noticed was how exaggerated the action scenes are. While inspired by kung fu films and Bruce Lee's choreography, the fights in Kill Bill feel absurdly over-the-top. Characters fly across rooms from a single kick, and the Bride's sword slices through enemies like butter. I understand it's not meant to be realistic, but the spectacle sometimes feels closer to a superhero movie than a martial arts film. The choreography lacks the grounded artistry you'd expect from something paying homage to the genre.The cinematography also frustrated me during the fights. Rather than allowing the camera to linger and let us see the flow of the action, the film constantly cuts to different angles. In one-on-one battles, this choice disrupts the rhythm and makes the fights feel less fluid. It robs the audience of the chance to truly appreciate the combat and creates a disjointed viewing experience.As for the story, while entertaining, it's undeniably simple. It's essentially a revenge tale with a straightforward progression. The Bride is betrayed, left for dead, and seeks retribution against her former allies. While the plot serves its purpose, it doesn't offer much depth or innovation. The emotional weight of the narrative is weakened by the film's lack of consistency in its characters' behavior and logic. For example, the Bride's sudden empathy in moments like the showdown with Vernita Green, where she stops fighting because of a child entering the room, feels forced. It clashes with the sheer brutality of her mission and the trauma she's endured.Tarantino also seems to force humanity onto his characters in ways that don't always make sense. The Bride, for instance, shows no qualms about using guns or other tools when necessary but then inexplicably leans into the ""honor of the sword"" trope. The same goes for Bill himself, whose traditions and philosophies feel out of place in a story that otherwise disregards such nuances. Moments like these make the film feel inconsistent and undermine the emotional stakes. The Bride's final confrontation with Bill exemplifies this. After everything she's endured, her decision to engage in a drawn-out conversation with him instead of ending things decisively feels contrived. It's as if the film sacrifices logic to create a dramatic payoff.Overall, Kill Bill can feel more like a ""gang bang movie with swords"" than a refined homage to martial arts cinema. The violence is excessive, the characters exaggerated, and the scenarios often border on cartoonish. While this style undoubtedly has its charm, it risks alienating viewers who prefer a more grounded approach.That said, the film still delivers on entertainment. Its stylish direction, unique aesthetic, and memorable performances keep it engaging from start to finish. While it won't linger in my mind as a masterpiece, I'll always cherish the fun and excitement it provided.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The unseen depths of each character is felt through great performances, editing, writing, and directing.

All of the Asian cast are exceptional and are given key moments to be over the top and charismatic. This is complimented by quick but sensible camera swipes and a clever party-like soundtrack.

A Mixed Bag,"I hadn't seen this since its cinema release, and had almost no memory of what I thought of it then. Revisiting, I occasionally found it a bit too self-conscious, especially in the first half. Aspects of the film's approach to race and gender feel queasy now. But there's no doubting the sheet wattage of Thurman's powerhouse performance; and whilst the violence (inevitably brilliantly staged) is mostly too OTT to be truly upsetting, it does have a visceral, adrenal thrill to it. The last 40 minutes or so is blisteringly realised, and there are moments of visual and technical inventiveness that take the breath away. Like much of his work it's a mixed bag- albeit one that's refreshingly below 2 hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Action and style make up for a weak script.,"Tarantino is a true talent in the eyes of many. Few debuts have been as handsomely constructed and powerfully original as Reservoir Dogs and few films have been as enjoyable and influential as Pulp Fiction. Both celebrate the art of script writing that awarded the supreme motor mouthed auteur with an Oscar. However with Volume 1 of his martial art epic Kill Bill, we see his weakest script work yet. The dialogue is slightly clunky at times and reams away from his most celebrated work but what it lacks in lines it exceeds in action. Compared with the other so-called action films released that year Kill Bill screams talent. Crash zooms, jump cuts and glowing crimson abound. The final 30 minutes or so of this film, where Tarantino flexes his action muscles are some of the most thrilling of the year. It should be clear to most that with this film Tarantino is showing us a different side of his world, and in terms of action and style he simply excels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
plenty of action + no story = bad!!,"i'll make it short:the fight scenes are filmed quite good. problem i have with it is that uma thurman's swordplay by no means matches that of any asian martial arts actor. the only reason it looks kinda good is that they made a cut after each of uma's swing. it must have taken an eternity to film. the sword fights in hero or zaitoichi are far more impressive. heck, any asian martial arts movie will show you more impressive scenes. but they might have something this film doesn't have: a story!and that is my main gripe with this 'piece of art'. a 247 minute movie cannot consist of only a handful of action scenes with no story. it gets boring quickly. normally i don't have a problem with long movies, but kill bill's simple story would even be insufficient for a 70 minute movie, let alone a four hour movie!! it's ridiculous. a good movie (especially if it's in the top 100) must have a good story. only good action's not sufficient.but you have to be realistic and see what kill bill is: a remake of scenes from old action films and a minimal, bound together by a ridiculous plot, made up in 15 minutes. i can't see anything original in here, except for putting it all together in one (or two) movies. even the camera angles are 'borrowed'. same with music, story, scenes,...save yourself some time and money: don't watch it. watch the originals..",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I Still Think It Should Have Been One Movie,"I just watched Kill BillThis movie is brilliant, the techniques Tarantino uses and masters are nothing short of genius. There is black and white, slow no, anime and a name that is beeped just for effect. It is just great filmmaking.I once read a review that said it was ""all storytelling, but no story"" I disagree with that.I was annoyed when it was split into two movies and I whinged about Miramax being greedy etc, and argued what scenes should have been cut from both movies too make one classic, but over time it has not bothered me as much.Although, I think it could have been a lot tighter. There's a lot of padding to be found here, and it's probably the result of trying to stretch a single three-hour movie into two 105-minute features. I will say it is devoid of Tarantino's usual dialogue too. The number of quotable lines and memorable non-action sequences is small here.As far as the performances go, Uma Thurman does a fine job as The Bride. We admire her tenacity but we never identify with the character. (This is a problem with a revenge flick, where we're supposed to root for the hero and despise the enemy. Neither is the case here, especially since we never see Bill.) Lucy Liu is a joy. Vivica A. Fox has virtually no screen time. Same for Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah who were being held back for Volume 2. We only hear David Carradine's voice. For me, Sonny Chiba does the best acting job with his role as a sword-maker.Kill Bill grossed $70 million dollars (against a $30 million budget) at the domestic box office",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Quintessential Martial Arts/Revenge Film,"Quite possibly the greatest film I have ever seen.Tarantino has really outdone himself on this one, from the art direction to the music, every little detail of this film was clearly hand-picked to give the maximum effect.The action sequences are plentiful and are full of excitement. Drawing influence from 1970s martial arts films, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 brings martial arts into the new millennia. This film is not for everyone however, as it is incredibly violent (as expected of Tarantino), though the violence is very well done and adds incredible excitement to the film.My favorite scene is the fight between the Bride and O-Ren Ishii. This scene is excellent in the way that it contrasts Japanese fighting and setting with Spanish music. The whole film is this way, contrasting things that you would not otherwise expect to work, but somehow, through Tarantino's mastery, does. The scene leading up to this one in which the Bride fights members of the Japanese Yakuza is also very memorable.In short, 10/10. This is the quintessential martial arts and revenge film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Amazing but incomplete,"I loved this film so much, maybe it isn't the most realistic but it is not supposed to. The plot may not be engaging for all but for me it was, just an almost murdered woman who lost, or at least thinks she did, her unborn daughter seeking for revenge on those who were involved.
Some of the shots are just amazing, the action is impecable and constant throughout the film, there are almost no flat points, plus we get some doses of comedy here and there.
Either way, even though I liked this so much it still feels a bit incomplete, maybe some scenes were longer than they could have been, therefore making this movie shorter or adding a bit more information, development to the characters or building a stronger structure for the plot.
The fact that this story is also divided in two parts contributes to making the story feeling incomplete, as the film was coming to an end I noticed it as it was slowing down and, somehow, closing this first half of the story, but it just didn't feel all that right to me, I feels, well, incomplete, and it is, but I just wish it wasn't so noticeable.
I made my complaints look a lot bigger than they were, this is just an amazing film, socking from the beginning, exciting action, an incredible and strong protagonist, good humour and a well managed plot (outside of what I've already said). One of the best action films I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Designer violence festival from the bucket-of-blood school of film making.,"A woman - with a past in a cartoon style assignation squad - is left for dead on her wedding day and vows the path of bloody revenge.The thing that hard-line critics and hard-line lovers of this movie both agree on is there is no real story here and - more bizarrely - little of the Ping-Pong dialogue that the director (Quentin Tarantino) made his name with. Maybe the fact that the movie was sliced in half is part of the problem - until I actually see Part II I will have to reserve judgement.To date QT has made one great movie (Pulp Fiction); a very good movie (Reservoir Dogs); and a very average movie (Jackie Brown.) You can see the direction this paragraph is going already - because this is below average. Hong Kong Fuey was made on the cheap for an initial audience that didn't have the education or the appetite for much thinking - why celebrate it on a big budget? What is that all about? It is like filming a hardcore porn film with the budget of the movie Titanic!(There is a movie called ""I Spit On Your Grave"" that was about an abused woman taking revenge on her abusers. Chicago Times'es Roger Ebert thought it was the worst movie he had ever seen (it is dreadful true). This has pretty much the same plot, but has more killing, blood and sadism - but he gives it top marks. Confused? I certainly am!)Lead Uma Thurman - here called only The Bride - confuses me as an actress and a person (married/divorced/married/children/divorced all before 30) and is a little strange looking with her model legs ending with massive policeman's feet. Yes she can act a bit, but like Lauren Bacall (who she most resembles) if the script is bad so is she and vice versa.UT is the best thing in this, although I don't believe her for one second.When you carry a fully grown guy on the end of a sword (as if!) wouldn't it buckle your knees a bit darling?Tarantino is in love with her in the classic Hitchcock mode and fashion. He knows he is too ugly and dorky to get in to her pants through natural means so he uses the casting couch and excuse-to-be-with approach. Well done, but it is all a big lie and we both know it. Given her fast turn over record on men there isn't much future in it either.QT fails because he is tasteless and doesn't have a natural censor to call upon. More is often less. He oversteps the mark and loses control on most films he makes and here he gets plain silly. There is no other word for it. We linger on a woman squirting blood from a severed arm - but we linger for no reason other than to give the audience a cheap thrill and the less said about the ""comedy"" rape the better.There is a lot of sword fighting and severed limbs in this movie - so much so that you are sick to death of it before our semi-climax (we only get to the half way point, remember!), which is more of the same only bigger.Like having a three course meal made up of the same dishes over and over again.Tarantino is smart in knowing how to fit music to scenes (often obscure pop) and how this lets us linger for little reason on people doing nothing much more than walking down a corridor. He is a good introducer and while avoiding some clich√©s he celebrates others. Hong Kong cinema can do no wrong in his eyes.To his credit he has not repeated himself in any of his efforts but this is an experiment gone wrong and the high marks and good reviews shows that more people are closet sadists than I would have imagined. Maybe that is too harsh a term, it is more like the scene in the school playground when the school bully is beating the living crap out of someone and everyone is circling round thinking it is great and urging them on because it isn't them on the receiving end.

Tarantino.  Still clueless after all these years...,"Let me just say that I have never been a big fan of Tarantino from the start so don't let my comments get to you too much. Tarantino has always been and still is... clueless. What amazes me is how high a ranking this movie has at IMDb. Tarantino never was and is not a fan of martial arts films. But more importantly, he has no respect for the martial arts genre nor for the Asian culture. I truly feel that Kill Bill is a result of Mr. Tarantino watching a few ""martial arts"" films, then cashing in on the Matrix influence (i.e. American public now loves martial arts fighting.) All I can give him credit for is finding a good martial arts director. That's it.Now before all you Tarantino fans go ballistic on me, let me explain my disgruntlement. Tarantino claims to have paid homage and tribute to many genre, including spaghetti western and martial arts films in Kill Bill. But I ask, just how do you pay ""homage"" to a genre when you are insulting it? Case in point... Tarantino lumps Chinese and Japanese into one genre and one CULTURE. Anyone with HALF interest in martial arts OR Asian films will tell you that they are completely different. There are obvious references to Bruce Lee. Uma Thurman is wearing a yellow jump suit with a black stripe, as does Bruce Lee in ""The Game of Death"". She fights the final battle in a Japanese garden, as does Bruce Lee in ""The Chinese Connection"". In fact, I am nearly positive that the garden in Kill Bill is exactly the same as the garden in the final battle scene in Chinese Connection. BUT TO HAVE THIS IMAGE OF BRUCE LEE FIGHT IN THE SAMURAI STYLE IS SHEER IGNORANCE AND IDIOCY. Having a Chinese icon fight in a Japanese style is like having a Jew fight with a swastica banner engraved on his/her chest. It just doesn't make sense. Most Asian nations were oppressed by the Japanese before WW2 and ""Chinese Connection"" explicitly depicts this oppression. Turning it around and having the hero, in this case Uma Thurman who is obviously suppose to represent Bruce Lee, fight in the style of the enemy is a complete insult. Perhaps if you are not familiar with martial arts and the identity and the genealogy from which it spawns and what it means to the culture, I can give you a glimpse of the magnitude of the insult by saying something like ""Rap music was invented by Vanilla Ice"". Get the point?I guess ever since Tarantino made a fool of himself at the MTV Movie Awards by constantly saying Jackie Chan's name incorrectly, my esteem of him as a director, but more importantly, as an intelligent individual, plunged like a 747 on fire. But this ""tribute"" to martial arts film is the icing on the cake.I love action films. I always have and always will. Fight club, The Matrix, and every Jet Li films will always have a place in my movie library.But this hodgepodge, confused, rip-off of a film is not anywhere near the ""classic"" status that has been given by the members of IMDb. Furthermore, it seems that a vast majority of the people here believe that if you copy ONE movie, it's a rip-off, but if you copy a dozen movie, it's a tribute... Well now I know the magic formula. My next movie will be Obi-won will be searching for the Lost Ark but is opposed by the Mummy and Scorpion King so has to go to the Godfather for help. But since the Godfather has been killed by the Joker, Obi looks for help from Conan the Barbarian, who is currently in battle with Aliens...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill Bill vol 1.....Tarantino's back!,"Tarantino's first movie of the new millennium is nothing short of a classic masterpiece, like all of his movies of course! This one in particular is filled to the brim with tributes to old Kung-fu chop-socky films, Japanese movies, and anime, and of course the usual pop-culture references, a staple to every Tarantino film.The movie starts off with a rather disturbing look at the main character known as The Bride played by the fabulous Uma Thurman, and the title character, who we do not see but hear his voice on this volume, Bill. Later we figure out the story is all about a woman who wants nothing but revenge on the people responsible for beating the living crap out of her on her wedding day while she was pregnant, killing everyone who was there that day, putting a bullet in her head and leaving her comatose for four years. The responsible ones, besides Bill are the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The squad members in order of appearance are Vernita Green, played by the gorgeous Vivica A. Fox, Oren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu, Elle Driver, played by Daryll Hannah and Budd, played by Michael Madsen. The Brides quest for revenge takes her all the way to the other side of the world in search of one of the members, later on returning to America and continuing her vendetta against the remainder of the squad. Yes, as you've all heard there's lots of blood and gore on this one, especially the scenes in Japan, but the movie has many laughs, some of them involving a scene of The Bride in Japan with a bartender/sword maker played by the Japanese movie legend Sonny Chiba. There's also excellent music to top it off, borrowed music of course but that makes the movie even more fun to watch as is usual in all of Tarantino's movies. There's also a very well made, and bloody anime scene in which it describes one of the member's origins.I know there will be some people that will probably trash this movie for his excessive gore and violent content, but as far as i'm concerned, this is still a masterpiece, maybe not another Pulp Fiction but worthy of being in your collection if you're a fan of Tarantino's work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Awful awful awful!,"Good lord was I disappointed with this movie. I had been waiting for months to see it and absolutely abhorred it almost from the first five minutes on. All style, no substance, filled with ridiculous, glitzy gimmicks and detours which ring as some of the most self-indulgent I have ever seen in film. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were great films, but Quentin Tarantino was so high on himself making this picture it makes me sick. And once you get through all the gimmicks it's really a very boring movie. I probably would have fallen asleep if it weren't for the fantastic amounts of gore. The cliffhanger at the end was pretty cool, I'll give it that. At least good enough to make we come back and see Volume II. But this movie was terrible. I know i'm in the minority on this one, but it was just utter crap. Crap! CRAP!!!!!!! CRAP CRAP CRAP!!!!!!!!! Peace.1/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Quentin Tarantino At his Best..!,"Even though i love QTs work and all his other classics like pulp fiction but i think kill bill has to be his best work !

Killed the critics but didn't quite kill me,"In quite stereotypical Tarantino fashion, the director of 'Pulp Fiction' converged together a critically acclaimed revenge movie in which Uma Thurman would play a Bride on the rampage! To me, 'Kill Bill' never quite lived up to the hype but I certainly wouldn't discard it nonetheless.Thurman's Bride is battered and bruised by her previous boyfriends (David Carradine) mobsters and thugs in - what was - an act of jealousy. In an act of revenge, Thurman regains her strength to kill each of Bill's (Carradine) assassins before finally taking her revenge on the man in question. This first film revolves around her attempts to murder the dangerous O - Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).The violence that is present throughout never really appealed to me to much. Not only is it over the top but also quite unrealistic.The story is paper thin and there are no real twists or turns in this gruesome tale. However, having also seen volume two, I can say that the plot there was much stronger despite a slower pacing.Still, Thurman's acting is fantastic while all other cast members are also faultless in their roles.I can't call it award worthy - even though it was - however I definitely wouldn't give it the brush off on a Friday night.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"A very good movie, a very shameless release","I guess you can leave it up to Quentin Tarantino and the good people at Mirimax to make a franchise out of one movie. Unlike films such as The Lord Of The Rings and The Matrix, the cutting in half of Kill Bill was an after thought. Tarantino believed that people wouldn't be able to handle a 3-and-a-half hour Kill Bill film, which is ridiculous because, bringing up Lord Of The Rings again, I know that many people went to see screenings of all 3 LOTR films back-to-back. Now that's one long movie, go ahead and do the math, and that just shows how devoted fans can be. And now, Tarantino has ripped off his loyal fans, charging two separate prices for one film. And don't get me started with the whole bare bones DVDs with the intent of releasing special editions in the future ""multiple bites of the apple"" issue. Just shameless.But, you have to suck it up. It's a pain, yes, but underneath it all we do have a quality movie here. After waiting more than half a decade since Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino has come back to films with a vengeance. This time around he borrows from and references so many movies that it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all. For me, at least, since I'm not exactly a huge fan of the martial arts genre. But that's okay, because Tarantino interprets it all in a way that is pretty clever and enjoyable. In a way it's the merging of American and Japanese styles of film-making. There's martial arts and anime, but there's also some jive talk, so ya know, it's a good mix. And I have to say that it undoubtedly features one of the best action sequences of the last decade.The cast (or human props if you prefer) is well thought out and of good variety. Uma Thurman, the star, is obviously the stand-out. She's a little bit scary and a little bit sexy, she just kicks butt. She does absolutely everything necessary in what she calls her ""role of a lifetime"" and surely needs to be regarded from now on as one of the best female action characters in cinema.It sucks having to pay twice the amount of money for one movie, but as far as this particular half goes, it is really enjoyable. There's no doubt in my mind that vol.2 is the superior half, but this is a fun film loaded with action, gore, and all the things you could ever want from a Quentin Tarantino film.My rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I'll kill myself if I have to sit through this again,"I'm a fan of QT and much admire his earlier films, but sorry sports fans, Kill Bill is a tedious piece of junk. That Tarantino planned at one point to release both ""volumes"" as one three-hour film is astonishing. After the first hundred severed limbs, I couldn't stop yawning. With its inexorable cartoon violence; the predictable BS posturing of virtually every major character; and the obvious trajectory of its threadbare plot, Bill is technically flawless, emotionally antiseptic, and dramatically dormant. Clearly, QT has spent himself.  To be fair, Reservoir Dogs was a masterpiece; Pulp Fiction, audacious and brilliant...tick tock tick tock... Then Jackie Brown, a nice adaptation, but hardly earth shaking.  And now comes Bill, which owes everything to cheesy, grade-C, 1970s Japanese fight-flicks.  Buckets of blood and meat-grinding mayhem do not of themselves make for scintillating cinema.  The trick that eludes Tarantino is how to keep the viewers' attention while he attempts a hybrid of Seven Samauri and the World Wrestling Federation.  The sensual aspects alone should have been enough to sustain interest, but no.  Ultimately, Bill becomes an exercise in fever-pitched tedium.  Perfecting the cinematic equivalent of crap is hardly an achievement, no matter how well-crafted the montages.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Ridiculous and Overrated Piece of Cinema,"I was looking forward to seeing ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"" as I had enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction"" and I had heard good things about the movie.  I heard it was extremely violent, but I've never really been one to be upset by blood flow. Now, having seen the movie, I can look back see that the violence was merely a cover for the lack of plot and the lack of just about everything else.I'll start off by relating the good characteristics of this film (of which, however, there are very few).  The movie is extremely stylistic, and some of the well-choreographed violence is worth seeing.  The lighting and the black-and-white sequences are also well-used and well-placed, respectively. Some of the music, I felt, was also fitting, but it irks me that they took some of it from mastermind Ennio Morricone.However, this film becomes almost a mockery of film in general.  Tarantino believes in sleight-of-hand, and he is very good at using it.  The fight scenes, are, as I said, very stylistic, and an unrealistic amount of blood spurts everywhere in different scenes.  Yet there is so much red and there are so many ridiculous situations, that the viewer tends to forget that there is very little plot to be found anywhere in the movie.  Also, good acting goes by the wayside, and I believe it an outrage that Thurman won or was nominated for any award for her performance.  The biggest disappointment, however, was the screenplay.  While ""Pulp Fiction"" contained violence, it did not distract anything from the brilliant and entertaining dialogue.  ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" does just the opposite.  The use of violence tries to distract from the screenplay, which is inept in the first place. The dialogue is minimal and childish.All in all, Tarantino has failed.  I may see Vol. 2 to see if the movie redeems itself, but he'll have to correct many of his mistakes.  However, I have forgotten to mention till now that there is one ""chapter"" in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" that reminded me of Tarantino's talent: Chapter Four: The Man from Okinawa. This scene alone manages to redeem the movie, along with some good stylish segments.  I said above that Tarantino failed, but failure for him is an average movie by anyone else's standards.Final Grade: C.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino's comeback does not disappoint,"Kill Bill: Volume 1 marked the return of Quentin Tarantino, one of the most innovative directors of our time, after a six-year hiatus (his previous film being 1997's disappointing Jackie Brown). Even though it was split into two parts, the first two hours of Tarantino's epic bloody masterpiece still resides with me as the better of the two.While this film really does not get into much of the key story line that Volume 2 taps into, it still introduces us to ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman). She's a deadly assassin who was once part of what was known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She decides to leave the squad one day, settle down and create a family. The squad feels otherwise, and their leader, Bill (David Carradine), sends the squad to kill her. The entire wedding party is decimated, and they leave The Bride for dead with a bullet in her head. Four years pass where The Bride is in a coma, and what proceeds after she awakes, is the start of a personal vendetta to kill all the members of the Viper Squad who ruined her life.It may not sound like much coming from an auteur like Tarantino, or very original for that matter, but his brilliance makes it original. Through his stylish use of dialogue, story telling, martial arts and especially camera angles, he creates an absolutely amazing film that makes us remember why he was anything to talk about in the first place (along with a beautifully drawn anime sequence). This film is something to see to believe. It has its intensely violent moments, but it's done so tastefully that it ends up looking like a modern piece of artwork, and not something horrifically violent. The choreography in every scene is just so perfect, that it cannot be seen as anything but art. His gigantic colour palate, flying between uses of black and white, to all sorts of colours, is just astonishing. It really brings into question why this film missed out on an Art Direction nomination at the Academy Awards that year (or any award for that matter). It is intensely violent yes, but the way it is done is artful and brilliant.Thurman is fabulous as the blood-soaked weeping Bride, and she makes for a great anti-hero for the ages. The way she comes at this role is just so hard-nosed and strong, that it gives wonder to where all this acting talent has been bottled up for so many years. A faceless Carradine serves as the main antagonist, and serves excellently in the scheme of things. The supporting cast, featuring Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and Sonny Chiba all are perfect in their roles, no matter how short. But the real supporting character to watch for is Chiaki Kuriyama, who first got noticed in Battle Royale. She had a bizarrely frightening aura about her there, and it translates flawlessly to her role here. For as small as the role gives her, she steals the show, and proves her worth. If only she could continue getting roles like these.Another key greatness to the film is in the music. As has become standard for Tarantino, much of it is ported over from old tunes from the likes of much older Japanese Martial Arts films. But, just like those older Tarantino films, they flow beautifully into the film. Every blood soaked arts filled image has excellent and memorable music to go behind it that leave powerful visual images in the viewer's mind. They give it an authentic and distinct feeling that is so much different than most modern Hollywood made film. In a way, it just shows how Tarantino can make every facet of the picture work, and make it visually astonishing to the eyes.As long as you can stomach the intense graphic violence, Kill Bill: Volume 1 is not one to have missed out on since it's initial release. This homage to the great Martial Art films of yesteryear is both insightful and brilliant. Tarantino has returned with a vengeance, and I can only pray he keeps it up.10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino showing he can do more then just gangster films,Prior to the Kill Bill movies being released Quentin Tarantino was known as a guy great at making modern gangster movies but this movie shows clearly him having a good grasp on other genres.In Kill Bill Tarantino is able to step into more genre type of movies and does it with a splash. Bringing together some of the best martial arts fight scenes outside of Hong Kong movies. A strong female lead who empowers women to be more then just a cute little thing on the arms of their men.Lucy Liu does a great job as one of the fellow assassins who eventually becomes the most powerful crime lord of the yakuza in Japan.Tarantino borrows a lot of stuff straight out of Bruce Lee movies to pay homage to him and other movies of that nature.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

An amazing Tarantino film.,"I have greatly enjoyed this movie. I watched it with a couple of friends and one of them had already seen it and was very exited to show us.

Samurai masterpiece,I think that this film is a clever masterpiece. If I could say that there's anything wrong with it; it's that its almost too clever (if that can even be something wrong). From the beginning Tarantino absolutely just bombards you with various amounts of imagery. What I find absolutely interesting about it was the combination of colors used from the set design to costume. From start to finish this film is just completely psychedelic. This film is also stunning when it comes to the sound effects used. You get this real sense of a subliminal mythology; and there's even an arc between films when you see the product of cigarettes advertised in this film that's mentioned in Pulp Fiction. But the thing is just when you think Quentin's run out of ammo...wait...there's more...,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Sooo............What.....,"I feel schizophrenic about this movie. On the one hand I thought it was well directed, cinematic ally clever and beautiful. I thought Uma Thurman was terrific along with the rest of the cast.I saw both I & II back to back which is probably the best way to see them. I kept looking for a reason for the madness and I came to the conclusion that the madness exists purely as a clinical and stylized exercise. It reminds me a little of surgery, however, in surgery there is at least a purpose or hoped for outcome-to save the patient. This movie is obviously not interested in the patient only in the clinical exerciseBy the time we are supposed to care it is way too late. This movie is a pop intellectual experience, not unlike a video game. It has all the right moves, music, camera angles, profanity,etc. Once the game is over, no one cares....The package is glittery and seductive but empty.

Disappointing to say the least.,"My opinion of Tarantino is... mixed. I enjoyed Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Hateful Eight as well. Some of his other movies... not so much. I am yet to watch Reservoir Dogs.This movie is a bit brainless. It's just fighting and blood from beggining to end. One thing Quentin is good at, is making entertaining action sequence and for that I give him lots of credit. There aren't many directors who are more entertaining than Quentin in this aspect.I find his over the top killing sequences humorous, and the way he lightheartedly deals with death, but in some other topics... not so much. This movie references pedophilia and rape in a very sick way, and tries to pass it off as comedic. Not my cup of tea.After watching the second movie (which I enjoyed a lot more, it's a 6 or 7 for me), this movie feels very pointless. The plot didn't advance much here, he could very easily condense this into one movie. This starts with a short introduction on the story and then killing for the next hour, it's just weird.Initially I'd give this a 3 because it feels very pointless and plot-less compared to the second movie, but his quality action, originality, and Uma Thurman drive this up to a 5.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"cool, stylish, empty","Quentin Tarentino's 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' is the perfect film for today's 'trendy chic' movie going audience. Casual in its violence, flashy in its visuals, and conspicuously lacking in content and theme, the film is a genuine triumph of style over substance and a testament to the art of 'cool.' Here is a film so self-consciously arch and emotionally detached that it plays more like a live action cartoon than a drama set in anything remotely resembling the real world (in fact, one section of the movie literally is a cartoon). The 'plot' is, essentially, one long drawn out revenge scene with Uma Thurmon as a young woman systematically seeking out and killing a band of assassins who left her, her unborn child, and her entire bridal party for dead on the day of her wedding.Yet, what person in his right mind goes to a Tarentino film in search of a meaningful storyline? Indeed, the thing that counts in a Tarentino work is the director's obvious love for both movies and movie-making, a love which is visible in every frame he commits to film. 'Kill Bill' is Tarentino's affectionate homage to the martial arts epics in which characters defy the laws of physics and gravity as they perform their deadly kabuki-type ballet with knives and swords. In this pastiche of ninja melodrama and Japanese anime, at least half the film's running time is spent on elaborately staged swordfights and kickboxing sequences, all of which are filmed with the utmost brio and verve. The violence is, indeed, gory and graphic - with dismemberments galore and fountains of spurting blood - but so preposterously overblown that the violence eventually becomes abstract and thus doesn't offend us much while we're watching it. Thurmon doesn't have much of a chance to develop a character here, but the steel-eyed intensity combined with the strange sense of vulnerability that she brings to the role makes her fascination to watch nonetheless.Yet, for all its cinematic joie de vivre and visual inventiveness, there's something a bit unsatisfying about 'Kill Bill Volume 1' after all is said and done. Perhaps it's the fact that the film feels so much like a clinical exercise in style that it lacks the power to really draw us into its world. We watch it with an air more of detached bemusement than of emotional involvement. Perhaps, too, the absence of anything much going on beneath the surface leaves us with little of substance to take home with us once we've left the theater. I suspect that this is the very effect Tarentino is going for here - that if we were made to care deeply about anything that was happening on the screen we would somehow be violating his code of 'coolness,' that we would be simply reacting to movies with the kind of programmed emotional responses the director is clearly militating against. The problem is that, while we can appreciate all that on an intellectual level, we are still left feeling relatively empty and unfulfilled by movie's end. Perhaps, the completion of the story in Volume 2 will help to rectify that condition.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The perfect mixture of art and entertainment,"I did not know that this movie has also a lot of haters who gave it only 1. I am not a blind Tarantino fan who gives every Tarantino movie 10 out of 10 and I am not one of the critics who try to cover up the flaws in his movies, but we should accept that he is a very good filmmaker. Personally, my favorite Quentin Tarantino film by far is Kill Bill Volume 1. It is quintessential cinema, also a pure mixture of art and entertainment. Kill Bill Vol. 1 has one of the best opening sequences ever, black and white visuals and that great music. I believe that put his directing talent aside, there are two things that he is great at: writing dialogs and music. Like Romance and Cigarettes, Kill Bill is a music collage from the old goods. All the tracks are great and the important thing, so coherent with the content. Visually and even including content, Kill Bill is one of the most colorful movies so far. This was the first cat fight I saw and probably there is not any other better. It seems that to shoot a cat fight scene is very hard rather than planned choreography. People don't fight in front of children in this movie, I know that Tarantino is not such a sensitive director, but I appreciated it. The second part of the movie is like a very stylish modern Western like No Country for Old Men. It is slow paced like Once Upon a Time in the West etc. The plot of the movie is also one of the most engaging and exciting ones, a revenge movie wouldn't be better. As for the anime, how a creative director Tarantino is. I had not seen any anime before, it made me like anime. However, this is quintessential anime, so my favorite in short length. Honestly, still I am not an anime buff at all and I haven't seen anime for a long time, but this is special for me, I watch it as occasion serves. The assassination part was too short, at least to me, because I did not want it end, that's the only problem. The maps recall atari games. Animes, atari games, Tarantino uses all of them. When I was a child, I loved the scenes in the movies which the hero of the movie chooses a weapon, sword from the collection, for example Red Sonja. While watching Kill Bill, I recalled Red Sonja. The story editing after the bride goes to Japan is weird (from the plane till the motorbike), in other words, there are time lapses, but this is not a flaw, it does not make us feel like the editing is scratchy and may be otherwise, the movie might have been pretty clich√©, but still Tarantino could added somethings. The sword fights in this movie is the greatest, the longest, the most entertaining one and the most stylish one. I forgot how many times I watched this chapter, almost 50 from 2003 till now? The violence here is not sick at all, like Hostels or Rambo 4, it is not 'explotationish' like Saw movies and it is not disturbing like Romero's zombie movies, yes it is extremely bloody and violent, but somehow looks pure mixture of art and entertainment. It also deserves to be put in action cinema anthology. Especially editing and choreography is great. The last chapter. The place, atmosphere had seemed me superficial when I watched the movie for the first time at theater, but after, I thought that may be it is supposed to be. This chapter is so reposeful and still, it is like relieving tiredness part, not only for the characters, but also for us. Then, great Spanish-like music and Carnage of Flowers, my favorite track. By the way, I couldn't decipher the meaning of the ewer. As for the ending, one of the most impressive finals ever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Arguably one of the most potent treatises on 'genre' film-making that you'll ever see,"After seeing Kill Bill Volume one tonight I am certain of two things: 1, Quentin Tarantino, mastermind behind Kill Bill as well as the smash hits Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, is the only filmmaker that can walk the tightrope of doing an unfortunate rip-off and a brilliant homage without falling onto the wrong side. And 2, I agree with his logic now of splitting his epic in two parts, if only because of the climactic battle between The Bride and the Crazy 88 fighters- any attempt to top this within the same time frame of a three hour+ motion picture is ridiculous. By doing so, Tarantino leaves us with one of the most violent (and I mean that as a compliment, since when violence is frowned upon in movies that means it's impressive instead of tongue-in-cheek like in horror films), visceral, and definitely entertaining films of the year. After seeing it once, to which I'll probably see it again, I can say that it's my favorite movie-going experience of the year.The Bride, her nickname in the group Black Mamba, is killed off (or so they thought) by her fellow partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. When she awakes from her coma four years later, she regains her consciousness of what she must do- kill the four partners, and then her boss Bill (played by the immediately recognizable, if only by voice, David Carradine). In volume one she goes after Vernita Green (Copperhead), and O-Ren Ishi (Cottonmouth), and like in Tarantino's past efforts the story is told in a non-linear style that gives answers first, questions later. But these story elements are, unlike his past films, just little details. Even to those who won't like Kill Bill and I know they have their understandable reasons - for Americans this will be one of the most violent films they may ever see, and for marital arts/kung-fu fans on Asia this will be something standard, however in parody. But the violence is done with the message that it's all stylized, and that Kill Bill is a triumph of style over substance is a compliment the haters may feel poking at them (I'd say though that kids under the age of 12 and character-study film buffs should stay clear of this one). As an avid film-goer, I found that there was so much to soak up in Kill Bill that at the least it contained some of Tarantino's most daring direction, taking chances that paid off, and borrowing to the point of a true transcendence of the material.One thing I love in a movie, personally, is when certain images or scenes stay in my head long after the film is over, and there are a few in this one that are still buzzing in my head as I write this commentary. The climax is impressive, yet the sequence that had me completely riveted was the Japanese anime sequence detailing the background on O-Ren Ishi. Like much of the rest of the film, it has bloodshed, intense close-ups, and quick editing. But there was just something about this whole sequence, the emotion that came through it. I'd have to say it's one of Tarantino's finest moments (and equal credit goes to whoever directed the animation, which ranks second to Toyoo Ashida, director of the classic Fist of the North Star), right up there with the overdose in Pulp Fiction and the opening in Reservoir Dogs. In fact, I also think an equal amount of praise should be given to cinematographer Robert Richardson, contributing heavily to Q.T.'s vision, and his usual editor Sally Menke for putting it all together. Kill Bill volume one accomplishes what it was hyped for- it's a spectacular showcase for devourers of grind-house cinema (while I've never seen any grind-house films, surprising I know, I felt I had seen so much of the genre in this one effort) and for Tarantino's main fan base. And while it is often assumed his fan base if mostly comprised of some film buffs and a lot of guys who like guy-action-movies, having Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox, and Lucy Liu (who all contribute great fight/stunt work by the way) turns Kill Bill into something of a chick flick as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"This is me, at my most masichiostic","Was there a cooler film in 2003 than Kill Bill?  I don't think there was. Kill Bill has all the elements of what a good time at the movies is all about.  The way a director stays fresh and interesting is to continue to broaden his/her horizons, not rehash the same thing they've done three times before.  Let me point out some of Kill Bill's strong points and then some weak ones in my eyes:  While this picture may not have captured the exact ""way of the samurai"", it did show what revenge is capable of.  I would like to remind people that no one waits for the other person to attack anymore, there's no such thing as a fair fight, so honor is right out of the window, and The Bride had all the motivation in the world for what happened to her. So, her fight at the House of Blue Leaves, was justifiably violent and unmerciful.  Sword fights aren't tennis matches.  They can be permanently fatal.  All the actors established a character very well, and how great was the anime sequence?  Kill Bill is not trying to be anything, it's trying to remind people of a type of film that has been forgotten.  It's a love affair of Tarantino's( just like Uma is to him)  and it shows.  There are plot holes in the first, such as her sitting in the Pussy Wagon for 13 hours while no police, or medical staff from the hospital check the dead man's car when they see his keys missing.  And I would also say the catchy dialouge Tarantino was known for is fading, as it wasn't too strong in this film. But, there are some things I would like to be explained in the 2nd film and I wait in anticipation for them.  This is what going to the theaters is all about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Revenge is boundless and relentless.,"Acclaimed groundbreaking director and writer Quentin Tarantino directs and shares writing credit with the starring Uma Thurman...KILL BILL: VOL 1 is hyper-kinetic with prolific violence and graphic carnage. An homage to martial arts with Samari swords. Cinematic eye-candy that culminates with an ultra-violent showdown. This action-packed thriller is about an assassin bride(Thurman), who is brutally attacked on her wedding day and left for dead with a bullet in her head. After emerging from a four year coma, she is hell-bent on dealing out revenge upon her former boss(David Carradine)and his deadly international squad of assassins that betrayed her. Payback is Hell on earth. The kill-or-be-killed finale is outrageously ruthless and still finds ways to sneak in a bit of humor.(A Tarantino signature).The supporting cast includes: Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Julie Dreyfus, Sonny Chiba and Lucy Liu. An eclectic soundtrack features: Nancy Sinatra, Charlie Feathers, Al Hirt, Zamfir, The 5,6,7,8's and RZA.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Fine action flick,"Might contain spoilers.First thing, before watching this movie,please make sure, that the realism switch in your brains is turned off. Otherwise it could be tad hard to fully enjoy this visually very stunning movie.So, what goes on in ""Kill Bill""? Well, 'The Bride', played by Uma Thurman wakes up after 4 years coma and wants to have revenge on the people who caused this state to her. So slash, slash, bang bang, boom boom. That's about it. This could have been one lousy movie... happily it isn't. It is action at is finest.Main character is 'The Bride', who is having her roaring revenge against 'Bill', played by David Carradine, not shown in vol. 1., only heard as a voice. Lucy Liu does fine job as a half Japanese Yakuza boss, prettily dressed in kimono, but from all the baddies in 'Kill Bill' is one-eyed 'Elle Driver' portrayed by Daryl Hannah.So, what else? Yes, there's lot's of chopping in this movie, and I mean lots. So I can honestly say, not for the smallest members of your family. All action is very cartoony and visually impressive.I liked it worth of 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Far-fetched,"I love action movies, including other movies by Tarantino, but this one and it's sequel are not credible, and reminded me too often of bad asian kong-fu films, where the heroes float in the air and jump up to the next floor. The plot itself is not believable in most parts, and there are many logical discrepancies. It doesn't make sense that a person can beat dozens of opponents simultaneously at one minute, and the next minute fight very hard to stay on her feet against a single other person. Things happen with no good reason. The whole movie is based on an event that does not make sense. It is given that there is lots of hatered towards the hero from her adversaries, but not a single good reason why. I would not go into specific examples only because I don't want to enter spoilers if you still want to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The opposite of art,"Over the course of approx. 12 years, Tarantino has only done one thing: take other people's ideas, mash them together, and call it his own. This is no exception. In fact, it's the best example.Literally everything in this amalgam was taken (without permission) from another source. Plot points, dialogue, costumes, locations, music, even characters themselves were stolen and placed in this film. Like the movie all you want to, but it won't change the fact that this is perhaps the most unoriginal movie anybody has ever made.Some day (hopefully soon), Tarantino will steal from someone who doesn't want to be stolen from, and he will be sued for every penny in his unoriginal pockets. But as for the movie itself...what can I say about it that you can't see for yourself by watching other films? Nothing. Many many many people have caught on to what Tarantino has done over and over again since 1992, and many many many people really don't appreciate it.Keep this in mind if you decide to subject yourself to this horrible excuse for a film: the person who supposedly wrote pulp fiction actually wrote this. This is what that person is capable of. Someone by the name of Roger Avary wrote a vast majority (if not almost all) of pulp fiction...and True Romance...and Natural Born Killers...and perhaps even Reservoir Dogs. But it doesn't end there. In part two of kill bill, Tarantino even steals some more from Avary! It's no wonder why they aren't working together any more...and it's painfully obvious that Tarantino's movies are suffering because of it.So I have a challenge to anyone and everyone in the world: name one director, besides Tarantino, who has done nothing in their entire cinematic career except steal other people's work. Name one other director, living or dead, who has created nothing on their own. I'll bet my house that you can't.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Weak and overrated,"I enjoyed ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" so I thought Tarantino's latest flick would be something that I could enjoy on a sunday night.Maybe the theater I saw the movie at had something to do with my negative reaction to it. The theater was full of faux hip movie goers who laughed at every cross film reference, blood spewing limb severing and any lines that even bordered on being witty.This was supposed to be a homage, of sorts, to Tarantino flicks. I guess an amalgamation of B movies can be called a homage, I call it lazy and uninspiring.  There's the battle of blue leaves which is reminiscent of the 100 agent Smiths in the Matrix Reloaded.They are all wearing masks like Bruce Lee in the Green Hornet.Now, why anyone is supposed to think a reference to the Green Hornet is brilliant or even a sly reference is beyond me. Donning Bruce Lee's ""Game of death"" suit may have been inspired by nostalgia, but beyond that, it doesn't add anything to the movie.Plus, the action scenes in the movie are old hat. I've seen these moves before in the Matrix, Blade, Crouching Tigert and even Charlie's Angels. Uma flying through the air to land on a balcony?Seen that in CTHD. Uma utterint witticisms while kung fuing multiple attackers? Seen that in Charlies Angels. Uma wielding a sword in blurring movements? Seen that in Blade 2. Animation blended with human portrayals of violence? I've already saw that in a movie called Natural Born Killers.The fight between Uma an Lucy Liu is not exactly groundbreaking either. Two people fighting in the snow? How does this become one of the great scenes in cinema history?I left the theater feeling like I had wasted my money.  I didn't share the gushing emotions of the would be hipsters that left the theater, gushing about how ""cool"" and ""mind blowing"" this flick was.  The next time it's decided that audiences are expected to hail a below average flick as brilliant..someone be sure and let me in on it.Because it's obvious that I missed the memo on this one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"A Breath-Taking Action Movie, with Talking Heads on the Side","Kill Bill: Volume 1To use a metaphor, if `Reservoir Dogs,' `Pulp Fiction,' and `Jackie Brown' all feel like Ford Caminos cruising down a back-alley L. A. street at about 35 mph, then `Kill Bill' is a Yamaha crotch rocket motorcycle zipping down the highway at 150 mph.  The difference is extraordinary.All of Tarantino's trademark details are in Volume 1.  Everything from Red Apple cigarettes to the box of cereal that appears in every Tarantino film. Including the level of violence in his film.Violence is a strong subject in Tarantino films, which turns off many less-capable viewers.  It is that same strength of violence that propels Kill Bill above the rest.  Everything from Tarantino's trademark gun-related blood splatters to an exaggerated number of Kurosawa-esque arterial spurts, to an anime short to the levels of blood that had to be color-filtered into black and white as in `Raging Bull', the body count and the severed limb count rise above every mainstream Hollywood movie before it.As this is an action movie, this is not completely unsurprising. Unsettling images and thoughts are another hallmark of Tarantino, and this one pulls it out in spades.  Lucy Liu's character is set-up with a particular disturbing Aeon Flux-style anime short that involves a gruesome murder and the mention of child violence.  Actually, there's two potential moments of child violence.As such, Tarantino again masters his ability to call back to movies of before to bring these characters and moments to life.  Cliches of Hong Kong `Chop-socky' Martial Arts films and American westerns to edgy modern cinema such as `Fight Club' and back to Japanese Samurai epics are resurrected in an age where they are not appreciated because of their. age.As such, there is little room for the swaying character development that is a hallmark of Tarantino.  A meager revenge plot facilitated with assassins and other unsavory characters.  But no one should care if it's a little shallow on the plot - it's fun, fast, disturbingly high-intensity action at its best.How would this movie compare to the `Matrix' or `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?  Kill Bill never loses sight of the major themes and the strength of the central character to push through to the other side, as both of the previous movies do with their artificial complexity.  Instead, Kill Bill uses a multitude of cinematic ideas to express the same thought and process: Revenge.Rarely does a movie deserve its hype.  Kill Bill: Volume 1 deserves it, and more.10/10.  Tarantino scores BIG with this action movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Sexiest killer ever!,"If you said to me that I was going to die by the hand of some of the women of this movie ,I would die a happy man for this film is any martial art expert wet dream. Pretty girls with swords, gory deaths and the dialogue made by Quentin Tarantino ,sign me in!!The movies follows the Bride as see goes on a vengeance quest to assassinate the people who try to killed her in her wedding day. God an other mass killing in a wedding ,it makes you think if R.R. Martin inspired Tarantino or the slaughter in this flick the producers of the series in the Rains of Castamere! Who knows, but it is fun to try to connect two amazing productions for it is confirmed by Quentin him self that all of his movies are in the same universe! So he is not a uninitiated to this idea.The dialogues as we all know by now are quick, quotable and create tension by themselves alone. Every character is unique and you come in a few minutes know his story art, temper and ideals. What would you expect after innovative killings ,sharp dialogue and great cinematography, the other strong point of Tarantino is that he can flesh out characters in a matter of seconds ,there very few directors and writers who can do that. So that flick deserve rightfully its cult status and more than a decade after it is in everyone list of amazing flicks.If you haven't seen ,as the man said himself :"" The *beep* you were doing the past years ,living under a rock?"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

a romp in the blood soaked vengeance,"The Bride is on a path of revenge. Left for dead by her old colleges, she's out for their lives after their failed attempt on her life. She is left in a coma for four years after the massacre at the church in El Paso, soon as she wakes up, she doesn't waste time. Her we are taken through her first two victims; O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. First on her list is O-Ren Ishii, who has become Queen of the Tokoy Underworld. Her second victim; though first in the movie, is Vernita Green.Kill Bill is another great film for director Quentin Tarantino. Quentin has dropped a lot of the heavy dialog that he's done in his other films, and has replaced it with outstanding action. Kill Bill is a patch work of film influences and references, ranging from Japanese samurai film; the later half very heavy in this, Chinese martial arts, animation, spaghetti western and a range of others. Some parts are ripped right from other films, but are given that Tarantino feel. Though they range from all different sorts of cinema, Tarantino has done a great job and joining them all together to create his own world for this bloody tale. The violence is vulgar and very bloody, yet its very mesmerising. There is a beauty to it that raises it beyond pointless violence. The blood though does come by the truck load; it flies everywhere. The animation sequence of O-Ren's past sits so perfectly, it doesn't seem out of place, heightening the Japanese influence.The action is nothing short of outstanding. This has the best fight sequences in an action film. The battle of the blue leaves blows the burly brawl from The Matrix Reloaded right out of the water. It's great to see that Tarantino didn't rely on CGI for the fights, making it all the more realistic. They flow so well and are choreographed wonderfully.The fight between The Bride and Vernita, though short is so fast paced and high in energy.All the acting is perfect. Uma Thurman is just brilliant as The Bride, you cant fake tears like she did when pulling herself into the back of Buck's Pussy Wagon. She brought so much dignity and malevolence to The Bride. Lucy Lui is so elegant and ruthless as O-Ren, its shocking how one minute she is laughing and smile then next she is chopping some guys head off without a second thought. Vivica A. Fox though not having a major role is very good as Vernita. Sonny Chiba is just hysterical as Hattori Hanzo.Kill Bill is violently beautiful, darkly funny and has a soundtrack to die for.

Asian Cinema's poor bastard son,"Before you can fairly review 'Kill Bill' please watch some true Asian cinema first. Such as: The Killer, Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, Shogun Asassin, Lone Wolf series, Ninja Scroll, Fist of the North Star, Crying Freeman, Blood, Invincible Shaolin, Master Killer, Legend of the Wolf, Five Deadly Venoms, Battle Royale and I don't recommend it, but the Guinea Pig series. Then, honestly see if you don't say Kill Bill is simply a poor copy of truly gritty cinema. Hell, QT even got Woo Ping, probably the best stunt choreographer of all time, thats why the fight scenes are so good, in essence he copied everything from the best of Asian cinema, except a good story. Liking Kill Bill is like liking frozen pizza, then one day going to Italy and tasting the real deal, big difference. I have seen all the movies I mentioned, and each surpasses Kill Bill in violence, story, choreography, or all three, people are heaping undue praise on QT. Real creativity is watching 'Hidden Fortress' then making 'Star Wars', but that was in a galaxy far,far, away. Hollywood nowadays is ""the asians have a movie called Ringu, I hear its scary"" ""well let's copy it for America"" ""Ringu 2?"" ""copy that too!"" ""Ju-on"" ""copy!!"", and the zombie moviegoers are none the wiser. Want to see an AMAZING movie? City Of God, its what QT wished he could have made.

Luckily for us, QT knows Americans can remember violence much longer than great writing so he can reap his rewards.  I'm not even going to compare this film to the thousands of Asian KungFu knockoffs.  Everyone knows a Hollywood-produced movie will succeed if it's the first time an American audience ""discovers"" it (The Matrix, Jackie Chan flicks, etc -- none of which are consdiered novel by HK cinema standards)..Why can't QT make a picture with the qualities of other acclaimed directors like Kubrick, whether it's visual (2001), dialogue-driven (Paths of Glory) or both (A Clockwork Orange)?

"A Different Tarantino, but still pure Tarantino. Many will love, some will hate it. Bottom line, EXCELLENT MOVIE.","KILL BILL Vol. 1 is many more things than almost any other movie. It has many, many layers, despite the fact that it is essentially a one-note revenge story, and really there is nothing wrong with that.NO SPOILERS.One of the many things that make this movie excellent is its character development. Every substansial character is so well-developed with their stories and characteristics revealed on the screen.Worth pointing out, the movie is at times ridiculous, surreal and fantastical, and it works, especially in the homages. The flying and floating and high leaps, the bride having a samurai sword on the plane in open view, the gushing and spraying of gallons of blood are obviously not to be taking seriously and are fun to watch.KILL BILL is also very emotionally draining at times. The bride getting shot in the head, her comatose body being used for sex, losing her baby, her family, her everything. O-ren-ishi seeing her parents being brutally slaughtered in front of her. Vernita Green's 4-year-old daughter seeing her mother murdered.The black and white sequence at the showdown at the house of blue leaves will be controversial. The way I felt about it is that the change from colour to black and white is like a symbolism of the bride's killing of dozens of people, the killing eventually just becomes cold, emotionless, plain to the bride. And then colour returns, and after killing a few more people she lets a young yakuza go, which is very appropriate of her because of the reason she is seeking vengence.The last 30 seconds are as good as it gets in terms of ending the first volume and segwaying for the next.Excellent movie, great action, acting, story, visuals and homages, and much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A bullet has been put through her head on her wedding alter and she has been left for dead; the culprits - her ex-comrades, leader Bill and a bunch of others. But she doesn't die; not just yet. After remaining comatose for four years, she flips her eyes open. First realization - the baby she carried is gone. Second realization - human tongues don't taste very good. Third realization - she has been immobilized from her knee down. Final realization - someone needs to die.Tarantino's movies have a raw power about them and you can observe that through each of his films. He doesn't delve in being creepy or mysterious. If it's murder, it won't be a carefully injected air bubble in someone's vein; it will be a knife in the eye. Kill Bill takes this to a splendid new level. The movie is certainly not for the squeamish, and even those with otherwise strong stomachs should ensure that they haven't eaten anything volatile before watching it. The gore is immense, the blood flow relentless and the violence would probably make Gandhi pee his pants. At the same time, it doesn't disgust you, and only Tarantino could pull of something like this.The film has all the necessary ingredients of a vintage Tarantino flick. His direction has a certain child-like quality about it. The title itself seems like a ten-year olds attempt at creativity. The movie has been made as neatly as a courtroom drama - hard camera shots, clever dialogue, rising tension - but underneath, it's an almighty mess; something like a monster dressed as Santa. There is the trademark from- the-trunk camera shot, and this time he even puts in a bonus from-a- bullet-hole-in-the-head shot.Similar to Tarantino's second movie (Pulp Fiction), Kill Bill too doesn't rely very heavily on its plot, which is virtually non-existent. It is driven by the execution. Movies are meant for escapism and the director knows this. The story has been stretched to a point where it becomes almost farcical, which is also an escapist's paradise. Things that would have been awfully heinous otherwise become rather likable in the hands of Tarantino. Added to it is a dark tone and black comedy which make it highly even more compelling. Call me despicable, but there is something oddly appealing about cornflakes drenched in blood.It is the subtle things that catch your attention and define the beauty of the movie. The cinematography is breathtaking. Right from a bullet leaving a gun to the large-scale mass murders every scene is awe- inspiring. There's B&W, slo-mo and censoring of names. There is a part in anime; a montage about the past of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), a deadly assassin, Tokyo's mob-boss and number one on The Bride's hit-list. Perhaps he did it to show a relation between O-Ren's half Japanese ancestry. Or maybe he did to avoid getting an NC-17 rating (there's a paedophilic goon, O-Ren's a kid; add two and two).The eclectic soundtrack by RZA can be termed as one of the most befitting ever heard in Hollywood. It reached #45 on the Billboard 200 album chart and #1 on the soundtracks chart; so you see what I mean. It builds tension superbly, often causing feverish excitement. If you close your eyes and listen to the music playing during the battles in the movie, you can still feel the adrenaline coursing through your body ‚Äì that's how amazing it is.Uma Thurman does a wonderful job as the vendetta-seeking, yellow-haired bride. She clears all sexist misconceptions from your mind about men being better at war than women. She is lethal and ruthless with an ever- present sardonic smirk on her lips ‚Äì a true femme fatale. You have to give her credit for managing to hold onto her expressions while performing things that are absolutely nuts.Vol.1 does not offer a satisfactory conclusion, leaving expectations of a second part, which Tarantino duly followed it up with. It leaves many questions unanswered, many people unkilled and many viewers thirsty for more bloodshed.However, while parting the movie does teach a very important lesson ‚Äì when you kill a woman you need to make sure that she is dead because if she isn't, boy, you are screwed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
conic movie,"Directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a 2003 film that pays homage to samurai and kung fu genres. The story follows a character known as ""The Bride,"" who embarks on a relentless quest for revenge after a brutal betrayal by her former assassination squad.The film is renowned for its unique visual style, blending stunning action sequences with over-the-top violence, creating a cinematic experience like no other. Tarantino's masterful use of diverse music enhances the emotional impact of the scenes. Uma Thurman delivers an exceptional performance as ""The Bride,"" portraying a fierce, complex character driven by justice.Critics have praised the film's originality, with Rotten Tomatoes noting that it is ""an elegantly crafted revenge film that overflows with style."" It's a gripping mix of action, artistry, and memorable soundtracks, making it a must-watch for fans of genre-defying cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
QT's gor(e)geous return!,"Six years after Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino tackles a new genre, one that has been exploited hundreds of times in all the B-movies he so deeply loves: the revenge flick. And in terms of style, Kill Bill: Vol.1 has a kind of ""B"" look: very little is told about The Bride (Uma Thurman) and her motivations. All we know is she was an ex killer, who was brutally attacked on her wedding day and shot in the head by former boss (and lover) Bill (David Carradine). After a four-year coma, all she wants is bloody revenge. And bloody it shall be...Actually, a lot of people complained about the excessive violence in this film (a Finnish critic, whose opinion I don't share, compared Vol.1 and Sin City by defining both movies ""a pointless violence choreography""). Come on, how can anyone take those scenes seriously? They are beautiful, but SO surreal: you lose a finger, and half the blood in your entire body bursts out like it was a volcano erupting! That's the brilliance of Tarantino's work: the movie is 5% talking, 95% killing, but the gore is so unnatural you can't help laughing at it and just enjoy the whole thing.As I said before, Kill Bill: Vol.1 is more style than content: those who expect the usual pop culture-related dialogue will be more satisfied when they see Vol.2, as will the people who want more insight on the characters. There is though one person we get to know more about: O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), the number #1 on The Bride's death list. But in the end the best scene with her happens to be completely silent: her slow motion entrance in the House of Blue Leaves. It's an excellent sequence, brilliantly scored by Rza (the first time QT uses original music).Oh, I almost forgot: there is one thing left from Tarantino's earlier films: impeccable acting. Vivica Fox, Sonny Chiba, Daryl Hannah and the aforementioned Liu and Carradine (who doesn't show up that much, actually) are great, but the film really is a one-man show, or rather one-woman: Uma Thurman was, to put it mildly, BORN to play the lead in this movie. She's so mesmerizing, no wonder QT calls her his ""muse"".An almost perfect film, with only one defect: the last line spoken by Bill, which spoils the second part's main surprise. Apart from that, it's hell of a movie!9,5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Favorite Movie (speaking for Vol. 1 and 2.),"Ha okay so this is actually my all time favorite movie. Some of you will totally agree with me and others are probably thinking uh what the hell is your taste level. Okay so i figured out with this movie its a love or hate. There is no middle ground. You cant watch it and say thats okay. You'll either watch it and be like YES! QT has done it again. Or you'll sit there and be like this is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen! thats just the effect the movie gives you. being said I'm one who absolutely loves every inch about it. i love the fight scenes, i love the dialog. and i love the acting most of all. i can actually watch this movie appreciate the acting but still enjoy the story at the same time. I think this is Carridines best and i know others are like nuh uh kung fu is the best...um no. He did such a great job playing Bill. and its hard to play a character where its 99% evil. but do it in the unique way he did it. so carridine is good. next uma...i mean who Doesn't think shes a good actress. and i like that she does movies like this. shes great, i love how she delivers her lines. amazing. then as for the others...Micheal madsen, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Lu, and vivica fox. they did a great job too! i love this movie, i think you should definitely watch if you haven't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Beautiful ridicioulusness,"This is a very Tarantino movie. It has all his signatures. It starts slow with his common non linear storytelling style and we are escalated into a great conclusion. I would like to tell more about the story and the morale of it, but there isn't really a story unless people dying in a vendetta is one, and we don't really learn lessons, unless ""don't mess with people who will kill you in a vendetta"" is one. The dialogues are strong and heavy. Definitely the deepest part of the movie. It was delivered via some nice acting. This is a ridiculous movie tho. The amount of squirting blood is laughable. Of course it was meant to be somewhat satirical - the sound design emphasizes this -, but still, I despise this type of self-serving killing. The ""epic"" mass sword fight - while I understand its place as a cathartic event in the story arch - just evokes the worst clich√© action movie tropes.The biggest strength of this movie is picture. It is beautifully creative. The wide range of techniques used here make it visually appealing. The compositions, the many angles, closeups, superimposition, split screens, color, black and white, light, silhouettes and even an anime scene. The movie is a showcase of good visual storytelling techniques. Sound design is also interesting. They used it to make the movie slightly more quirky. Its just at the edge where it is hard to decide whether it was done in seriousness or as a joke.All in all, it comes recommended given that you can endure the overwhelming amount of nonsense bloodbaths this movie has. For the impactful dialogues and the highly artistic picture it is worthy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Stylized violence and it works,"The first vol in Kill Bill, is basically a stylized violence with a mix of many styles Tarantino is inspired by. But it's still well crafted although it doesn't have much substance and the dialogue isn't THAT great, which Tarantino films are known for. It also follows Tarantino's trademark of not going in the chronological order, which makes the film better because it gets more anticipating to find out how Uma Thurman's character got to those points. The first vol starts out with a bang, literally and metaphorically, it's action packed with a lot of blood and fighting, mainly in order to get the audiences attention. I also liked the mix of Asian cinema style in this, but gives it his own style a bit. The visual and the style is the main highlight of this movie, and it's mainly the reason I enjoyed this movie. Not one of my favorite Tarantino movie, but it's still a pretty good vengeance film.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Lots of Style, Little Substance","In Kill Bill I, Quentin Tarantino continues his tradition of paying homage and simultaneously insulting every genre of film vaguely related to his projects. This time around, it's the Tarantino version of Fists of Fury or any of 1000 other martial arts films with lots of wire-work, people who become black-belts in a month or two because they are motivated by revenge (though they skip the part where they develop muscles) and cartoon-violence and gore.Uma Thurmond plays a double-crossed and angry woman who was beaten to the point of death on her wedding day, along with her entire bridal party. Bill is her former employer and also the guy responsible. And her former work associates are the people she's out to kill.Predictably, the characters are, at best, two dimensional, the violence is nicely filmed and almost never ridiculous-looking, and the gore is hilariously ridiculous and the script is as serious as the absurd predicaments it creates. A whole slew of ethnic stereotypes comprise the main characters, and Uma Thurmond's protagonist is a walking clich√© about a woman scorned, Lucy Liu is a quintessential Asian- American, etc. Bill, of course, is lifted straight out of Charlie's Angels' Charlie - heard but never seen and yet all-powerful.Despite their vacuousness and lack of any sort of depth, there is a certain post-modern catharsis in the silliness and elaborate and expensive production of Tarantino's essentially grade B- pulp films. If nothing else, they are entertaining in a blood-drenched but otherwise unchallenging way. Leave your brain somewhere else and enjoy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Way Over Rated,"I looked forward to viewing this film as I had heard so many positive comments. ""Tarantino's best effort"", ""better than Pulp Fiction"" on and on they went. Soooo I rented it, and was I disappointed. Look, I absolutely loved Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, so I was stoked for a real winner and what I got was a so so film. I still don't get all the blood spewing like a fire hydrant. Even in the cheesy karate flicks this is supposedly paying homage to, the special effects weren't that exaggerated. I guess I'll see volume II just so I know how it ends, even though it is painfully obvious. When Quentin latches on to something it seems he is possessed to the extreme and it shows up big time in this film. Look for the Red Apple cigarettes and Uma jolting up from a coma, nice references to Pulp.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Fantastically entertaining,original and amazing","Kill Bill vol.1 is one of the most exciting and stylish action movies made in recent years. It doesn't conform to Hollywood conventions and as a result is very fresh and entertaining. It takes the age old revenge formula and injects new life into the premise and comes up with some real originality. Kill Bill is vastly different than any film out there,thanks to its witty dialogue,imaginative plotting and fascinating characters. Kill Bill vol 1 doesn't really offer much in the way of emotion but that doesn't matter. This is a wild ride of a movie,one you do not want to miss. It provides awesome action and a steady supply of humor.This is a very original creation and is one of the most stand out films I have ever seen. It may not be quite as good as Pulp Fiction or even Kill Vill vol 2(Tarantinos other great works) but those films were masterpieces,in my opinion anyway,and the fact that it isn't as good as those films doesn't put it down in any way. So if you are a fan of Tarantinos work or you just want to see a really original,crazy action picture,this movie is for you",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Best Movie of All Time,"This movie to me was the best movie I have ever seen. I quote it everyday. The script is magnificent and the camera shots are brilliant. The characters are well developed and Quentin T. Couldn't have chosen a better cast! It is pure genius with all the references to other movies. The plot is detailed and superb. I love that he used his own car in the movie as well. The 2nd movie in the series matches just as well in content, possibly foreshadowing a 3rd movie in which Vernita Green's daughter Nikki will perhaps face off with Beatrix Kiddo's daughter Be-Be. That would be an amazing Trilogy in which case I would watch it as soon as it came out. However, It has been so long since the last movie I fear Quentin has given up on the third movie idea. Let's hope for the best and all you Kill Bill'ers out there can sympathize with me in my longing for the 3rd!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece,"NO SPOILERSWhen I first saw Kill Bill, I truly loved it. It's a masterpiece. I had never seen a film, since The Usual Suspects, with such a good screenplay.The film itself its about this woman who wakes up from a comma and wants revenge. No more details... So you can see everything I'm telling you.The film is packed with crazy action and hilarious, extreme, and excessive use of blood. The acting is good. But that's not the reason that made me love it.If any of you have seen Pulp Fiction you will notice that Quentin never tells you what's inside the mysterious suitcase... He does exactly the same in Kill Bill, but this time, with The Bride's name. Every time someone is going to call her by her name there's a little disturbing, but at the same time funny, sound made. It's that kind of sound that the TV shows play when someone is cursing or saying ""a bad word"".If you haven't seen it and you consider yourself someone, PLEASE, rent it or buy it RIGHT NOW.It's a true masterpiece packed with those little details every Tarantino's fans like.11/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Tarantino's 4th film. It's different, but still impressive.","When I first heard of Kill Bill in 2003, saw the trailer, etc. I though this has to be crap. Just violence, and violence and no structure. then I forgot about it. The a few years later I started looking into Tarantino films. I saw his newest one, Inglorious Basterds, and I though; ""wow, this is pretty good"". It was refreshing to see someone with a unique and classical directing style. Then I saw Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and already I considered him one of the greatest directors ever. Then after having seen Death Proof (not his best by the way) I figured; "" you know what? it's about time I sit down and watch Kill Bill volume 1"". So i sat down and saw it, and these are my thoughts on it.Despite not being the kind of movie I like, I really liked this movie. Okay that sounds weird, but it's how it is. Revenge movies, and Japanese movies, and especially anime is on the bottom of my like list, hate me if you wan't but I fail to see the attraction to it. However, this movie is so well made, I put all of that aside. The tag line ""Tarantino's 4th film"" as if it is very relevant, is well placed in it's context. When I saw Reservoir Dogs I though; ""no way this is his first film! It's too good"". He made two more films, and didn't disappoint, so his fourth movie surely had to be a cinematic masterpiece, and I personally think it should qualify as such. It has a visual style both corny and artistic at the same time. He really taps into the heart of a good exploitation film. It is a surprisingly profound movie.But now that I've praised this movie, I guess the complaint should be written down as well. I only have one complaint about this movie, which isn't actually much of a complaint. The violence. And don't get me wrong, I am not against violence in films in any way. inf act I often think it's very important to make a good and shocking film. However I think that there is only one thing that stands int he way of Quentin Tarantino's artistic abilities; he's need for violence. His Grindhouse feature following Kill Bill; Death Proof proved this point. The violence got in the way of the story,a nd the story got less impressive. I understand Tarantino's need to channel his violence ideas through films, but I'm afraid he might go too far one day. this film an example of how that might one day ruing his films.Having set that aside, I give this movie a 9/10, and finish by saying, I really look forward to Kil Bill volume 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's genre film,"After long threatening to make a pure genre film - a film the plot and episodes of which are constructed by genre convention, and always secondary to the enjoyment of the action - Tarantino has produced a quirky but faced-paced homage to the Chinese and Japanese martial arts films of the 1970s (and some of their American clones as well).There's certainly no denying that the action sequences are rapidly paced, and professionally shot and edited. The story is loose and a little hackneyed, but that's exactly what a genre-film plot ought to be, since it is really just an excuse for the action. So of course the dialog is riddled with clich√©; that also is as it should be.I suppose most of this will be missed by those unfamiliar with the '70s martial arts film; but they may be able to enjoy it as just an irony-laden action film of the current era.At any rate, anyone who thought the Chiba Street-Fighter films fun stuff, or who harbored a secret passion for TNT Jackson, will certainly enjoy this film.The one weakness is Uma Thurman. She was well-cast in Pulp Fiction, but I haven's seen anything with her that I've liked since. Here, she is just way too ""over the top"" for this kind of film. The martial arts hero has to be cool unless really really angry - but Thurman has her rage-meter pushed to the max from beginning to the end of this film, and it gets awful tiresome after a while. Wish they had brought over Sue Shiomi for this one.Finally, a word about the sequel, Kill Bill II; and the word is BAD. Worse sequel to a good film I can remember.But this first film is a lotta fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino blends beauty and carnage to create something just short of genius,"In Kill Bill vol. 1, Tarantino uses amazing artistic technique and cinematic skill to create some of the most poetic moments in film. However, Kill Bill is shockingly violent. Unlike Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill's violence does not always contribute to the movie's greatness. At times, the movie's carnage adds to the art, increasing the visual and emotional power of the movie. At other times, the viewer must wonder about Tarantino's intentions, as the director pours bucketfuls of blood on shiny floors. Kill Bill floats in and out of the realm of greatness, the opening scene is a symphony from Beethoven, yet occasionally Tarantino gets caught up in the carnage and the movie temporary loses everything else. That Tarantino can masterfully juxtapose this violence with his artistic ability is only half-way redeeming. The dialogue, usually good, sometimes stunning, sometimes passable, reflects Kill Bill's tentative grasp on greatness. Kill Bill is overall, a great movie that fell short of greatness, yet definitely worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

What A Piece Of Crap!,"I saw this movie when it was in theatres and wondered why on earth anyone would spend money and put out such an effort to make such a piece of crap. A friend recently told me it was in the IMDB top 250 and I was surprised. Now that I've looked and I've seen that is so high in the list, I have to say it one more time - What a piece of crap!I have previously greatly enjoyed QT movies.  Pulp Fiction is certainly one of my favourite movies.  It was an infusion of several different simultaneous plots into an entertaining, solid and complete movie.  I can't say any of these things about Kill Bill V1.  It is a vengeance movie with nothing more than a lot of fighting, a lot of blood and no reason to give a damn about anyone in the movie.  I could care less about the characters portrayed by Uma, Lucy or Vivica.  Yes, they're all hot, but that's not enough for a whole movie.Unless someone offers to buy all my popcorn, drinks, a hot dog, some licorice, a box of Milk Duds AND pay for the ticket, I won't be seeing part 2 in the theatre.

"Style over substance, sure, but is that a bad thing?","So what have we in this movie? A simple and rather silly plot, and lots and lots of blood. Normally this would spell disaster, but when Tarantino directs you know you can expect good things, and that's exactly what you get.This movie has a lot of style, and it's style that drives it and style that builds it. The plot revolves around The Bride (her name bleeped out in this movie), once a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, codenamed Black Mamba. But she leaves her boss and boyfriend, Bill, to marry somebody else. Bill is upset, and kills everybody who attended the wedding, and has his Squad beat the pregnant Bride into a pulp, before shooting her in the head, only a second after she informs Bill the baby is his. She wakes up four years later, bent on revenge. And from there on, the movie is about her vendetta, going through the Squad before getting to Bill. The movie opens with a battle against Vernita Green, a.k.a Copperhead, but the main ""villain"" in this movie is O-Ren Ishii, codenamed Cottonmouth, and now the boss of the Yakuza. Uma Thurman as the Bride, and Lucy Liu as O-Ren are magnificent, and give strong performances, as does Sonny Chiba as the retired Japanese sword smith, Hattori Hanzo. But the true focus in this movie is not the amazing acting, but the amazing battle scene. Bloody, yet amusing. Quick and stylish. And accompanied by a magnificent soundtrack.You will enjoy watching this movie, because it is entertaining, and nothing more. But therein lies its charm. And a certain revelation at the end of the movie will make you ache to watch Vol. 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

VERY Entertaining!,"The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill....what can I say?  I'm a big fan of Tarantino, and I don't have to explain how anticipated his next film was.  One thing about QT that I can always appreciate is how different he is when it comes to subject matter, style, etc etc.  Kill Bill is probably the most straight-forward piece he's done to date.  The signature styles and techniques of QT are here as well, and he employed some new ones also. Quite frankly, Kill Bill is a damn good movie.  I want to hold off on deeming it a classic until I see the whole thing.  But from what I've seen so far, its a film that will set new boundaries in cinema....the way his other films did.I'm not a huge fan of Uma Thurman, I thought she was pretty good in Pulp Fiction, but she's VERY good here...I didn't expect her to be as convincing as she was.  Being a HUGE fan of kung fu movies (particularly from the 70s-80s), I loved the casting of Gordon Liu....although I would've liked his showdown to be a little longer. Bruce Lee's yellow jumpsuit as worn in 'Game of Death'....very nice homage to the master.  I'm not at all a fan of Lucy Liu, but suprisingly her casting here is not half bad.  Vivica Fox on the other hand.....is only here for style, she didn't serve much purpose at all. The story of Kill Bill, one of revenge, is straight forward but very intriguing.  The way QT presents the film, its almost like he thought of every possible technique/style he could think of and used it in Kill Bill. Things like the B&W sequence and the Japanimation sequence add a whole new twist to the film and is VERY creative...it works perfectly.I didn't like the fact that they cut the film into two parts, but I can't wait to see the second part.  Vol. 1 is a little short; nevertheless they cut the film at a good place, setting up the second part very well.  A VERY entertaining film, QT has done it again.  This is shaping out to be a milestone in filmmaking, hell it probably is already.  Vol. 2 will only cement Kill Bill's place in cinema history.  A truly monumental film. Bravo, QT, bravo!*** 3/4 out of **** stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Style Over Substance,"Kill Bill is an epic film that is split into two volumes, though one story, the two volumes cannot be more different in it's execution. Kill Bill, when I first watched it as a whole, was definitely entertaining but as time went on I have watched Tarantino's films over and over again, I started to lose that feeling that I had with this film and changed my perception of it. Kill Bill may be epic but it lacks something that keeps it from being his best work.Kill Bill: Volume 1 is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is simply a revenge-action story. This approach is not a problem for me because it allows me to digest it simply and avoid ambiguity in it's storytelling. Jackie Brown was an example of Tarantino taking a conventional 3 act structure and making it his own. Kill Bill: Vol 1 follows that approach but making it much more epic and somewhat adventurous. The thing about Tarantino's writing here is that he has written something that is much more mainstream friendly than compared to his previous work, which in a way is great because I think that's what he really wants, is to exploit these dying genres and styles to his films for the mainstream audience. Tarantino has written a protagonist that we know very little about, yet we enjoy seeing her kick-ass and reaching closer to her goal. The film is full of dialogue, though not as punchy and indulgent as his previous films as the dialogue here is more reliant on it's attitude and delivery. The most enjoyable part of the film is truly the last half of the film where she is up against O-Ren Ishii, and honestly it is so interesting to see these two battle it out because of all the backstory and hype that is being given to us of O-Ren Ishii, it makes her seem like such a challenging opponent.This is the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino and between the two volumes, I can definitely say that this first volume is much more fun and entertaining to watch. The reason this film is so appealing is that it is enforced with such style mainly influenced by the Asian cinema, particularly in the 70-80s. I don't mind that the film is stylish but it can only do so much. I am more disappointed with the film's screenplay rather than Tarantino's vision and direction. Kill Bill is the mark for Tarantino, when he started paying homages to his personal attachments in films, and he continues to do so in his latter films. The first three of his films has this technique in delaying action and giving us more of the characters in their most normal moments, but Kill Bill strays away from that by upping the violence and action almost to the point unbelievability. Also, the audience must lower their rational thinking when watching this as the film doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a reason why this is viewed over and over again by it's fans.Kill Bill is also the start of Robert Richardson's collaboration with Tarantino as his cinematographer. Richardson has worked on prestigious films for most of his career, and worked with prestigious directors like Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, and Rob Reiner. Out of all of those directors, I think working with Tarantino allows him to experiment more with the camera and create something more unique. Kill Bill may not look like a unique film as the way it looks feels more like something you have seen before and that is the response that it's supposed to get from us. Kill Bill's photography pays tribute to the shots found on Sergio Leone's films, or the clich√©s that are found in Asian action films. Kill Bill's image looks colorful and at times being so saturated it loses the sense of naturalism.Kill Bill is also the start of Tarantino relying on a film score in driving the musical side of the film. His previous films were full of soundtracks that go exquisitely well with the scene, it's the same outcome here but just replacing it with a score from RZA. The score for this film isn't cutting edge or the best I have heard from a Tarantino film but it is stylish enough that it goes with the director's vision. There are spots in the film where you can hear musical segments either made by Ennio Morricone or inspired by it.This film is primarily driven by Uma Thurman's performance as The Bride and she does a great job, though this isn't my favorite role from her. Thurman has to play this character who is clearly emotionally and physically traumatized by Bill's actions but at the same time project a shade of a bad-ass assassin who is fueled by anger. I don't think anybody else could have accomplished this role physically. As the film doesn't take it's self seriously, it does hold Thurman back from showing her range in acting. Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii was great; she was fun, exciting, dangerous, and bitchin'. Liu stand out scene was when she was at the table with a group of Japanese gang leaders, as she managed to come off as frightening but at the same time give off a comedic under tone in her acting. The bulk of the villains are not seen until the second volume, so for the most part it pretty much covers both of these actresses.Kill Bill is definitely an example of style over substance but it does well enough with the former that it doesn't lead off as such a terrible movie. Do I wish the script was better, yeah maybe it needed a bit more, but that isn't enough for me to dislike it. Give it a try but I suggest lowering one's expectations and rationality before heading in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
7.5/10 - Embraces Its Absurdity in All the Right Ways.,"""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""Taking a short break from my journey through the IMDb top 100, I decided to watch this Tarantino classic I was yet to see - Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The reason I chose this film in particular was my great love for every other Tarantino film I've seen so far, and the fact that I've heard that this film is utter and pure fun. It's been a while since a film really blew me away, so I thought I might as well give it a shot.By the way - at the time of writing this review I haven't watched Vol. 2 yet, but this is the next film I plan on watching.Plot summary: a former assassin wakes up in a hospital after four years of coma. The coma's cause wasn't an unfortunate accident, nor was it the work of some stranger. Bill is the one behind it all. Bill shattered her life to tiny little pieces, laughed in her face and threw the pieces into a river of acid. From the first moment she wakes up she knows: a bloody revenge is the only way from here on out, and she will execute every single one of those who ruined her life.The opening scene is an awesome slow burn, a dramatic introduction to the villain and a great way to give the story a facet of mystery from the very beginning. I thought that the movie might be more serious and dramatic than what I've been told, but I think I can say with confidence that this is the least serious Tarantino has ever taken himself, from what I've personally seen.I like the absurdity of this film, you know? It has style, for sure. Lots of it. The brutal scenes, the sharp soundtrack by the RZA, the fricking *anime sequence*. It's quite badass, not gonna lie. And it's really memorable. Feels like a video game in some ways, and I'm all here for it. The whole samurai thing works really well, too. The action sequences don't blow me away, but they're quite solid and unique.I think that what I lack here might be corrected in Vol. 2, but I'm still gonna say that I wasn't that invested in the main character. I mean, what we've seen of her backstory is surely more than enough to fuel a burning, searing drive for revenge. I just don't feel like she has a lot of personality, at least in this movie, and especially when compared to the villains here (that are evil in a really fun way). There were some moments of dialogue that felt like they should've hit harder, especially with her. (Even though throughout the film the dialogue has many well-written and iconic moments - not as much as the other Tarantino stuff I've watched so far, but still).Kill Bill: Vol. 1 leaves me anticipating to Vol. 2, for sure. It's iconic, action-packed, fun and pretty badass. It embraces its absurdity in all the right ways, and I'm totally here for it. I think that more drama, or at least more depth to our bloody bride, could make me appreciate the main character, and the film overall, much more, but the question I have will probably be answered in the next film. Had a pretty good time. Feeling a 7.5/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Charlie's Angels on acid: An insult to kung fu movies,"Kill Bill is an extremely pointless movie.  Bad acting, bad editing, poor character development, some fight scenes were OK but nothing compared to Zatoichi films, old Jet Li films or even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's empty, it's hollow and it's much worse than Jackie Brown.  The stylised violence is so ridiculous that the audience laughs at it.  What is this world coming to when people laugh when someone's head gets cut off?What is the point of all the violence anyway?  This movie is a sociopathic juvenile fantasy and there is no way that it came from the heart of an artist.I've heard several comments about how Kill Bill is an homage to kung fu and anime movies, and this may have been QT's intent.Unfortunately for him, it comes across as stereotyping and an insult to kung fu movies at best, and appropriation of voice and prejudicial at worse.Yes, Tarantino can put together a great soundtrack and a slick, stylized pa ckage, but this movie has zero substance.  If Kill Bill is the emperor, then he has no clothes, he is up there on the screen buck naked and boy is he ugly.  Don't believe the hype.And does anyone else get the feeling that vol 1 and 2 are just one movie cut in half so we can pay twice to see it?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
One of the only two movies I have ever walked out of.,"Let me preface my comments with the following qualification: I have very high standards when it comes to movies and Quentin Tarantino has consistently failed to meet them.This film was no exception and is, in my opinion, his worst ever. Pulp Fiction had the novelty factor going for it. Now that the genre is established, one has to fall back on plot and entertainment value.Kill Bill Vol 1 has neither plot nor entertainment value. I'm sure this was some attempt on the part of Tarantino to salute a classic genre which is equally low quality but manages to under-achieve on a fraction of the budget: B-grade kung-fu films.When you're in college and you're broadening your horizons, watching B-grade kung-fu movies is a requisite activity. After you leave college however, you realize that your trappings of irony such as listening to They Might Be Giants and watching B movies is just that - trappings of irony.Tarantino would have done well to leave his trappings in college but thanks to Hollywood's propensity for beating then fellating a dead horse, we have all had this insufferable piece of feces inflicted upon us.Interesting cinematic genre blending and special effects do little to add to a film that has no plot and blood that sprays out of people's necks and arms like it's being pumped by a hose.If you enjoyed Army of Darkness, this film is for you my friend. For those of us with taste, don't waste your time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Another Quentin Tarantino hit!,"Yes, I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, but deservingly so!Aside from his visionary directing and writing, he has a knack for casting his films to perfection.

No interest initially,"(please note i have not seen Vol2 yet)Have to admit I have only just watched this film over a year after its cinema release in New Zealand.I had no desire to see the movie based on the feedback i had read/ been told regarding the violence for the sake of violence, my partner highly recommended i see it...so i did...on DVDThe movie is in my personal favourite top 15 of all time movies...like Peter Jacksons (lord of the rings) early splatter movies (brain dead, meet the feebles..etc) it is artistic violence. Please be aware that i am not making similarities to Peter Jacksons early movies in general as they are in different leagues.Artistically directed, and, like all Tarantino's movies, very good choice of music, and used appropriately throughout...love his use of music in all his films.Uma Thurman...fantastic...harbouring such hatred in the way she does..pulls it off perfectly.... can really feel her pain and I felt like cheering her on.Character interaction superb, the inter-racial aspect gave the movie more depth also (ie Japan/America)The blood spraying like a fountain from limbs was a bit over the top, other wise gripping and prefect in all aspects9.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"wonderfully stylized, but as false as a gusher of blood","Don't get me wrong, I think of a 9 of 10 as pretty high praise, but it's no #77 on the top 250. That kind of rating should be for films which are about something more than live action anime. Tarintino does do a wonderful job at capturing and honoring the mood of today's violent cartoons and yester-year's B-movies. And those recurring gushers of blood are hilarious in a ""Yeah I'm sick but it sure can be entertaining"" sort of way. Tarintino also does a credible job incorporating a great variety of styles and approaches to the material, but the film's continuous winking at itself telegraphs that the plot is secondary and you end up wondering how much of the film is Tarintino and how much is second unit directors and stunt coordinators. ALSO, and this may be me and my watching Kill Bill, Matrix II, and Blade II all in the same weekend, but I'm awful tired of scenes where a horde of attackers supposed there to assail the main character take their turns politely waiting to get their butts kicked instead of just zooming in and dispatching the hero's ass like they should. Oh Quentin, if you could put this much love into something that really mattered ... sigh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Makes up in blood what it lacks in substance,"I saw this film upon its release in 2003 and have to say that I wasn't impressed by it. While the film definitely has entertainment value, it lacks substance and didn't do much for me. Since then, however, I've seen a lot of the sort of films that Tarantino took influence from when it came to this film, and upon a repeat viewing of this first instalment of 'Kill Bill', while my niggles are still there; I enjoyed it much more this time around and have to say that Tarantino definitely achieved what he set out to. The film is an amalgamation of the sorts of films that Tarantino loves, all strung round a revenge theme. Clear influence comes from the martial arts, pinky violence, exploitation and western genres. The plot is exceptionally simple and focuses on a wedding day massacre at the hands of a group of people known as 'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad'. The only survivor of the wedding day massacre is the bride, who despite getting shot in the head, was not killed. Four years after the wedding day, she wakes from her coma and vows vengeance on all those who spoilt her big day...Tarantino does his usual trick of not telling the story in a linear fashion, and here we get a segmented chapter method of getting it across, which works fairly well. I would say that I am a fan of Tarantino's style, but at times he can be a little too 'quirky' and it does his films no favours. Take the first fight scene in this film between Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox - the idea of having the two women fight each other with household items is great...but then the kid comes home from school and the whole thing is too unlikely to be believable. The fight scenes are obviously the most important thing in a film like this, and the aforementioned scene is good in spite of the mentioned problem. Other great fight sequences in the film are good too; the bloodbath at the end being the most spectacular part, with the preceding fight that sees Uma Thurman pitted against a ball and chain wielding Japanese schoolgirl being the most interesting. Tarantino usually does casting well, and this film is no different. We also get a good soundtrack that fits the film well. One of the bigger risks in this film is the animated segment, and for me it's not a good thing. However, despite my problems with the film; it's hard to deny its entertainment value and the amount of blood on display (so much that certain scenes had to be shown in black and white!) is definitely a bonus too. I won't say that this is a big favourite of mine, but I am glad that I gave this film a second chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Filled With Action,Violence And An Inspired Cast,","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a terrific movie with a great story,fantastic cast,brilliant characters and plenty of violence,maybe a bit too much violence for a sensitive viewer.It is without a doubt some of Quentin Tarantino's finest work,with an outstanding performance from Uma Thurman,who seemed to be in to her crazy,insane,revenge seeking character The Bride all the way through.I think basically everyone who was part of this movie was interested in it,there's no wonder the movie was so long that they had to break it up in to two parts.The Bride (Uma Thurman),a master assassin,is out seeking to kill a man she has a great history with,however,Bill has sent out many people to get her,but they myth have no chance against her as she seeks her revenge.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Its alright I guess,"Another tarantino movie that's horrifically overrated, who could've guessed. I do have mixed feelings on this film. First off, one of yhe main reasons I dislike this film is because I despise the main character. It's crazy how in a story where everyone seems pretty well developed the main character is extremely shallow and one dimensional.Uma thurman is alright but she isn't brilliant or anything like that. Even the story itself was kind of mediocre. That being said, it's execution was phenomenal.

A Little Overrated?,"OK, I'm not trolling this movie, but I sure did feel that this movie was horrible in my own personal opinion. Sure, it did have some wonderful aspects and unique stances in its own ways, but all in all, not my kind of movie.This is supposedly a homage to Japanese action movies, which I seriously dislike (again, just my opinion). I have seen some Japanese action movies, which was all just violence, blood, screams with an entirely peculiar story. I'm not trying to be racist here, but I do feel that Japanese movies lack a sense of dramaticism or storyline that actually makes someone think. Rather, it's just endless bloodshed with a story that's out of the line. Well, Quentin Tarantino (one of my least favorite directors) is paying homage to that. Not so much to pay homage to.I saw this movie through the DVD. I've seen the rave reviews it received and even trusted Ebert and Roeper's review, and I decided to see what all the craze was about. Once I pop it in, it begins with a noirish sense of black and white mood. As the film progresses, it combines Japanese anime and real filming, which I thought was pretty interesting and amazing at the same time. It was though-provoking and very classy, and I enjoyed that part. But then, it just got into endless violence and fake blood actions. One by one, Uma Thurman hacks away at the bad guys and they lose their limbs and body parts, screaming in the most comedic ways. Instead of feeling a sense of sadness for those who died, I actually laughed and pointed at the baddies. Story was pretty simple. It was just a story about a woman who wants revenge against those who betrayed her, in which she made an enemy's list. She goes on a rampage, slicing anyone in her path.I kid you not, Uma Thurman surprisingly freaked me out when she played ""The Bride."" Who in the right mind would want to meet a woman who can slice you up in any second? She was clever and skilled, and she practically killed anyone in her way, even innocent bystanders. I actually felt scared by the seriousness of her character and was frightened by the actress herself. Very well in acting, I have to admit. All were professionally done.Alright, the only parts in the movie that actually got my nerve was the simple corniness of the film. The bad-guys were honestly horrible actors and they just screamed in the most funniest ways. The cartoony feel was purposely made by QT in order to make it feel as if it was a comic book, but I didn't feel that premise going on. Instead I felt a movie with just the cheesiest amount of blood ever. I was obviously disgusted at how much this movie showed blood. It was simply a gorefest rather than a movie itself.I believed this film did have its awesome moments, but all in all, it was just average, and I couldn't see the reason why it was so raved about. But once again, all in all, that's my opinion, not yours.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
an awful B movie,"This is a horrible movie. If the intention of the producer of the movie was to provide entertainment for psychopaths, then he did  a good job of it. I have seen many action flicks that have gratuitous violence but at least the hero has some redeeming qualities that makes them likable. The hero an assassin is just as evil as the other assassins she is hunting down. This movie is no better than watching an ultra violent video game. Entertaining if you are the one fiddling around with the paddles making the character move on the screen but not if you are watching it. watching 5 minutes of the worst Jackie chan flick is more interesting than watching 1 minute of kill bill.

Breath-taking,"Okay, I will admit. I have been a big fan of Tarantino's works for a long time. So my expectations of this one were high indeed. And Tarantino delivers. It is hard, it is violent, it is fast. And expertly done, as always. And the musical accompaniment is, while somewhat peculiar, as with most QT films, of very high quality, and greatly helps setting the mood of the film.No one but QT could tell a simple tale of revenge that lasts over 4h (including part #2) without it becoming boring. Here we see that it can work, however: one simply never gets bored, not for one second. Call it Tarantino's magic. Visually: a feast; the actors: brilliant; the story-telling: gripping.So, is this ""instant classic"" material? It certainly is. Is this one of the best movies Quentin ever did? Oh yes.

Tarentino is that good,"Quentin Tarantino is a legend in film making. The first time I saw Kill Bill i knew it would be good. I didn't expect this movie to be as good as his previous movies, but personally I think he perfected his film making. It is simply the most entertaining movie a director can make. The action, the comedy, the thrills, the action & the action. They all add up to one of the best movies ever created. Some of the scenes in Kill Bill never seize to amaze me. How Tarantino came up with the ideas for some camera angles & movements is beyond me. All throughout the movie are little ideas probably created on set which make the film even more enjoyable The acting was great.

Chick fights are Awesome!!!,"I'm sorry I started with such a tag-line but that's what this movie is all about.So the premise goes like this - The Bride (Uma Thurman) is all bloodied up and lying on the ground at the altar of her wedding, surrounded by armed assassins of a squad, of which she herself was earlier a member of, and who just wiped out anyone and everyone at the wedding. They then shoot her, in what appears to be a death-blow but then she instead slips into a coma and wakes up years later to avenge the execution of her husband, baby - she was carrying during the massacre; and everyone at her wedding. Then begins the journey of 'The Bride' - name not mentioned anywhere in the first movie - who sets out to take revenge!Uma Thurman does a great job as a sexy expert assassin out on the loose. She sparkles with her charisma and style, that it makes her bloody revenge look beautiful and fashionable. Lucy Liu as the wicked O-Ren Shii, the head of Tokyo underworld and the bride's first revenge targets, is still-faced like a mannequin but that suits her role of a mind-controlled assassin.In a revenge-flick like this the action sequences have to be flawless and yes they were. There is also a flashback of one of the characters in anime, which serves as a nice assortment in a 110-min long medley of brutal massacres. The action, the stunts, get better in every scene. The Japanese Samurais defy gravity and jump around as if they are weightless..You have to be a brave-heart to watch the entire film without having a nauseating headache. There is so much 'Red' in the movie that it puts Spain's La Tomatina festival to shame. Every time a limb is lopped off (and believe me it happens a lot), there is blood just spurting out like a fountain and the killer is spray-tanned in blood. You have one scene where the massacre is so bloody that the entire action sequence is shown in black and white (However, in the Japanese version this scene is in colour).This film is not without its goofs and flubs like any other Quentin Tarantino film but I didn't mind because its entertaining and fast- paced. There was not a single second in the film during which I wanted to keep my eyes off the screen. It is a must watch for all the action junkies and more so for people like me, who love films like Resident Evil, Underworld, Aeon Flux et cetera etc. and who love to watch the leading ladies wield guns and swords like they are Barbie dolls...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"If Revenge is a Dish, Kill Bill Vol.1 is Lip-Smacking Delicious!","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is Quentin Tarantino's giddy homage to the movies he grew up with‚Äîthe Hong Kong chop-sockies, the spaghetti Westerns, the Yakuza-samurai actioners, the Japanese anime and the American blaxploitation flicks, reshaped by the writer-director as a sort of reverie of adolescent enthusiasms.The plot has a direct-action vividness suitable for a video game that walks a pretty straight path, especially for a Tarantino film. Cleverly constructed in five labeled chapters, from ""The Blood- Spattered Bride"" to ""Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves,"" the movie expounds the tale of The Bride (Uma Thurman with the look of a chiseled humanoid, in a physically arduous role) whose rural El Paso wedding is invaded by The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and turned into a bloodbath, leaving her trembling and bloodied. Four years later, rising out of her comatose state, she sets out on an unwavering mission to systematically eliminate her former cohorts one by one, beginning with the now domesticized Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and the formidable O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), before tracking down Bill (David Carradine), the eponymous focus of her vengeance.Firmly in fan-boy mode here, Tarantino prepares his revenge dish like a skilled chef, chopping and tossing it in an astounding spectacle that's as alluring as the meal itself. And because it's Tarantino, the bloodletting is in full flow. With heads severed and arms lopped off, he pelts us with stylistic jabs even as spouts of red spray the screen. It is a homage all right, but with an extra dollop of ketchup! Tarantino relies on delirious, high-octane camera work, an exhilarating musical soundtrack and wonderfully choreographed sequences (watch O-Ren's origin story told as a spectacularly brutal 7-minute anime or the designed-to-be-legendary showdown between the Bride and the Crazy 88s or the final confrontation between the kimono-clad Ishii and The Bride against the floating snow-flakes) to punch up a story that never loses its intoxicating magnetism.Kill Bill is Tarantino's highly idiosyncratic and deeply personal excursion into a world of movie-inspired unreality. An unapologetic pulp scribe, Tarantino thinks nothing of dropping scores of allusions to the beloved pop culture of his youth into The Bride's universe.

A triumph of style--over substance.,"I'd like to keep this short--so I'll jump straight to the meat. The term originality, so often used in any review of Tarantino's work, should never be applied to this movie. There is nothing NEW here--but such is Tarantino's excellence that even this hackneyed material seems new. The revenges story is as old as Greek tragedy--maybe even older. He even throws in the old, clich√©d mother/child motif. Let's face it, revenge drama, even with female protagonists, is nothing new at all. Worse, let's just face it. It's a BAD plot--because we know the outcome. The protagonist might suffer. Might get beat up. Might even fall into a coma for 4 years. But eventually they will WIN--this is never in any doubt. Perhaps this total predictability is why I don't much like this type of film.The use of continuity in this film was as usual, confusing and jumping through time. The first big fight, killing Vernita Green comes AFTER the climactic death of O-Ren at the end of the film. Hate to tell you Quentin--Brilliant in ""Pulp Fiction,"" boring here. It was new ONCE. Just once is all you get.Where this film shines is the usual strengths--Quentin's use of Mise-en-scene, character, and of course music. Only Quentin Tarantino can take a scene of O-Ren and henchfolk entering a bar, and make it as heartstoppingly cool as the scene is in this film. THIS is brilliant movie-making--I wish the rest of the film lived up to that level.Unfortunately, the creativity stops there--in endless Homages to all the different fave movies of Tarantino. Spaghetti Western, Hong-Kong Grind, Anime--all here. Unfortunately, I feel that the uses of all these other styles--ultimately leads to no real style of his own.I realize that Quentin Tarantino did NOT intend this film to be original--it is rather an affectionate nod to styles that have influenced his own style. Unfortunately, I'd rather watch ""Adaptation"" and see something completely new. Perhaps when he finds his own unique style again I'll return to his fold. I can only give this movie 7 out of 10.PS to Quentin--Good Job At Cannes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I am stunned,"That there are so many sheep out there whose goodwill towards Tarantino extends towards giving this film anything other than a firm thumbs down.What a mess.

Most critics agree it is his worst film by a country mile.I am prepared that the whole thing should be redeemed by Kill Bill 2. But this on its own, Kill Bill 1 is rated so highly on IMDb that it makes the Top 250 above films such as Butch Cassidy, Life of Brian, Annie Hall to name just three.

an apparently trivial story transcended in a stylish treatment,"""One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces"" (Pink Floyd, One of These Days, Meddle, 1971).I have often written in some reviews on this site that I wasn't a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, a cinema-going filmmaker with a mind-boggling culture. It's true that I have never been very taken with ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). As for ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", I had deemed it as ""violent and hollow"". I maintain the first epithet but I jettison the second one now. I watched it again last Saturday night with its other brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" (that I hadn't seen before) and I changed my mind about it. I realized that I had overlooked it and I would go as far as saying that I found it much better than Tarantino 1994 film.The staple story doesn't carry much weight. A wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the Bride who spends four years in a coma. When she wakes up, she's got one sole word in her mind: revenge. On a scrap of paper, she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all. She also keeps the best for the end: Bill. This story is for Tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons: comic strip, spaghetti western, samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences. And animated by a cinema passion, the filmmaker couldn't resist to the desire to include film-loving details throughout the Bride's adventures. Thus, the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well: ""the Bride wore blood"". It's of course a hint at Fran√ßois Truffaut's film, ""la Mari√©e Etait en Noir"" (1968), a film on which Truffaut himself didn't have a warm spot. I have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and Tarantino isn't afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous efforts.The technical command of ""Kill Bill: Vol 1."" leaves speechless. First, I would like to congratulate Tarantino for the cinematography he tapped. It enhances bright colors, especially the red and one thing I noticed: in the first sequence of the film, Uma Thurman drives a vehicle with red seats. In Jean-Luc Godard's ""Pierrot Le Fou"" (1965), the red is also a dominating color. In one scene, Jean Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina are in a car with red seats. If I don't understand at all the symbolical function of the red in Godard's highbrow work, in Tarantino's work, his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the Bride's motivations. Red is revenge, violence, death.This revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance. It's tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but it's necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona. And throughout these chapters, Tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions (to pay homage to the samurai film among others) and the contents. Thus, one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a Japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments (the scene when the BRie kills some 80 masked enemies, Tarantino borrowed a device from Hitchcock he used in his mind-boggling ""Psycho"" (1960): to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood. Besides and while I'm on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights, they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate, even outclass the ones of ""the Matrix"" saga. And as many film buffs know it, one of Tarantino's recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence. For ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", he didn't shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies, slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun. Thrill-seekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the Bride before facing Lucy Liu declares to them: ""don't try to get back your missing parts!"".Tarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the Japanese man who sells to the Bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window, the one whom the Bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list (you guessed who it is of course) or when the Bride tries to move her big toe after her coma.It's exciting cinema as one could wish and for Tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up, he delivered the goods: to spend a truly great cinema moment. The different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity. What about my judgment of the volume 2? The answer in my review about it.NB: there's perhaps this unlikeliness in Tarantino's scenario. When the Bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking, thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again. But during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure. Why don't they find her again after such a long time? It's a minor detail.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Overrated?  Too Stylized?  No.  Beautiful.,"This movie is awesome.It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but, it's what I consider by far the coolest.I loved Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs.  I love Japanese animation and culture.  I love violent films that hold no punches.In this movie you get to see revenge.  You get to see it really hardcore, the way it should be dramatized.  You get to see throwbacks to old Bruce Lee and kung fu films.  You get a beautiful tale of revenge wrapped around homage to a genre that didn't mind if it was goofy in parts... as long as the point got across:It's not pretty when you chop off a head or a leg, but, it most certainly is...... meaningful.The characters are awesome.  Even characters whose names you don't become familiar with are excellently done.The movie was so cool that there's really no way for me to make it make sense to you.People say it's Overrated... these people like to think their opinion is golden and everyone else's isn't.  They just want attention.  Direct your attention instead to this movie.Don't watch this movie if you are easily offended, or if you don't like action sequences.  If you hated Pulp Fiction, this isn't for you.The choreography of music and action and cut-sequences and dialogue in this movie has a ""masterpiece"" flavor to it.  Yes, there are a couple parts that you can pick out and say ""This was done poorly"" in the action sequences... HOWEVER, the fact that you would do that, indicates that you should not ever return to a theater and waste your time or money.  You missed all that beautiful stuff that's too hard to describe, and let yourself grunt about a silly-looking sword scene?Awesome Cast Perfect Directing Beautiful Music Well Written Script Intelligent Violent Animation Sequence Perfect Blend",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino at his best,It maybe nearly 20 years on but this masterpiece still stands out among everything Quentin has directed - produced afterwards.

Tremendous fun!!,"Let me just get one thing out there: this movie kicks ass!!! That thought repeated through my head many times as I leaned back in my seat, eyebrows raised, and took in the film for the first time.There is little in the way of emotional attachment. That might be for the best. While you can certainly empathize at times, Uma Therman's character ""The Bride"" (a.k.a. Black Mamba) seems mighty grim as she pursues a quest of revenge against her former colleagues.The plot, like the title, is laughable. Black Mamba gets ambushed on her wedding day. She survives, drafts a hit list 5 names long and sets out to get her revenge.So how could such a simple storyline with limited emotional involvement turn into 3 hours worth of sheer movie bliss? Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, that's how! The genius is in the details. There's an abundance of nasty surprises that will challenge your tolerance and keep you wide awake. The slower interludes are loaded with tension, intrigue and humor.No one's lovable, but everyone is memorable. Uma Thurman is terrific in the lead. You see her character from a few different aspects. Usually she's nasty and pitiless. Occasionally she's cute. At one point she has an outburst of grief that's pretty riveting. Lucy Liu is great as O-ren Ishi, the boss of the Tokyo underworld. While obviously lethal, she somehow maintains this beautifully elegant, almost fragile presence, all decked out in her kimono. Her henchmen are colorful and imposing, like the earlier James Bond heavies. Bill (David Carradine) is genuinely mysterious, all the more so because they haven't shown his face yet.And then there's the action. The combat is phenomenal in its execution and mind-numbing in its scope. Just when you think that has GOT to be it, they keep piling it on. One sequence is the new Mt. Everest of Kung Fu. Seriously. That alone is more than enough to keep this film on the map. Be warned: it's not harmless Jackie Chan-style slapstick combat. The blood and gore is overwhelming.As you would expect, the music selections are devastatingly cool, and they come from all over the map. There's '70s funk. Pan flute w/ orchestra. Tex Mex. A Japanese schoolgirl power trio. You name itIt's not just the music that's eclectic. Kill Bill is a very vivid fusion of American, Chinese and Japanese genres. (At least these are the most visible elements ¬ñ bear in mind that Tarantino seems to have seen every movie ever made anywhere.) The Japanese settings are stunning, and there's an entire segment beautifully done in a Japanese animation style called anime. This degree of savvy and reverence for the region is extremely rare among Western filmmakers.All these elements are combined with great virtuosity to form a supremely entertaining movie thrill ride. You never know what's going to hit next, but whatever it is, it is likely to saturate the senses and challenge the brain. I didn't want for it to end, but I must admit: that level of intensity for 3 whole hours would be a bit much. So I can understand why they split it into two installments. Some people bitch about the severance, but I enjoyed volume 1 enough to see it twice and I can't wait to go shell out more dough and see volume 2.Most American action films indulge in their gratuitous carnage behind a veil of contrived morality. This has come to irritate me enough to turn me off the genre. One thing I find very refreshing in Kill Bill is the absence of such pretense. It's all thrills and spills; no apologies, no disguises, no lectures.Critics who object to this film seem to do so because it fails to pander to their various expectations. Here's a little news flash, people: it's Quentin Tarantino. If you go in expecting a repetition of his previous work or a movie that is in any way conventional and/or predictable, you're going to be disappointed ¬ñ and you deserve to be. I went expecting something bold, exciting and original, with plenty of violence and a few surprises. I couldn't have been more delighted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Ultraviolent Masterpiece !,"Since the day I started watching Tarantino films, by god! He never lets you lose focus of the story. He wants you to pay attention to what's happening on screen. Non-stop pounding, sword dicing action that only here to please you one thing for you viewing pleasure.... The Art Of Action! Kill Bill Vol.1 contains a simple but yet very complex tale of revenge themed movie that sets out what it sets out to do. To Kill Bill. And yes. Violence everywhere. Guts spilling off. Limbs flying god knows where. Swords swooping. A** kicking on every scene. Every shot, every scene are executed extremely well. Incredibly stylized visuals and camera movements that honors every influence that Tarantino watched when he was learning how to do films on his own. I mean not just taking stuff from the West but from East as well. Marrying together to make a well crafted action film though with slightly depth in the story telling and plot.Uma Thurman eventually did an amazing job playing the character of the no nonsense ex-assassin on a mission bloody violence and revenge for the one he loved the most. The other rest of the cast also did very well in their performance. Lucy liu should be credited too. Angela Basset was really convincing in this role as both a mother and a assassin which to me spells as a no brainer but delightfully it did balanced well. While not much to say about this part of Kill Bill, there are a few scenes where the movie reveals some details and backgrounds of some the characters. Though I've said there's not much we can talk about in this part. Its more action driven and a feast for the visuals. All I can give you based on what I felt, revenge is best served cold fellow audience!Rated 8.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An Excellent Action Movie,"Kill Bill is, as you can clearly tell by the title, is an action movie, mostly focused around killing Bill. It's clear with just one look at this film that it's going to be a action-packed, bloody thrill ride. And boy, it sure is.Kill Bill, although somehow managing to pull off a 2 hour run time, feels too short. Not too much happens, and that's where it seems to suffer the most. It is a two-part series, so that did leave hope for more development. Still, it felt like the productiveness of the movie was lacking, and although we certainly got to witness some amazing fights, that was really about it.The fights themselves, however, are great. Their bloody, fast, and very cool to watch. Fun Fact: The movie actually received an X rating (above R) for violence, and one of the final scenes had to be toned down. Tarantino did this simply by taking away the color and making the whole scene in black and white. Color or not, this was still a great scene. The action is all so over-the-top that it's actually funny, yet still so cool to watch.Overall, Kill Bill Volume 1 is very entertaining, and a whole lot of fun. It lacks in story and development, but if you like violent movies as much as I do, then this is certainly one you need to see. It's easily one of the best action movies out there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Watch out, Crimson Batman!","This film should come with a warning that it is only suited to those adults who never outgrew watching Batman on TV, and would like to see the same thing with swords. Despite its many pretensions - and a great opening scene - the ""movie"" immediately degenerates into nothing more than a cartoon. The ""acting"" ranges from pathetic down to non-existent, with Thurman on the top end. A lot of it is based on people reverentially pulling swords out of sheaths and then pushing them back in, and similar ripponese mummery. The special effects are right down there with the acting, with awful gaps between what Thurman, for example, does in FX and what she can do on her own.And what is it with this being Tarantino's fourth film? Perhaps he's aiming at Beethoven and Mozart status, and we can look forward to speaking in hushed voices of ""Tarantino's Fifth"". Oh, and we have ""The Making Of..."" titles too. What claptrap!Altogether, though many try to justify it as homage to this and that, or coo over its uniqueness, it is only a silly pastiche, thrown together in the expectation that enough people will be fooled into paying for it. It insults the viewer, especially viewers like myself who think Tarantino does have some talent. You wouldn't know it from this turkey. Don't waste your time on it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"The cold, brilliant recipe that is Kill Bill","Revenge is a dish best served cold, after all.For the recipe that is Kill Bill, consider Quentin Tarantino as a multi-million dollar blender who mixes the best of styles in his deep pool of talent: take Hong Kong action, Bruce Lee movies, nostalgic 1980's ninja movies and mainstream highlights, pour them into the blender and sprinkle the product with Tarantino's own trademarks and rapid-fire dialogue. Also pepper with film with homages and references. Finally coat the film in a rich glaze of adrenaline-pumping, decadently gory and heartstopping kinetics. Oh yeah, and serve with a killer soundtrack. Cold.Needless to say, style alone cannot carry a film ¬ñ no matter how sprawling with flair and fury it is. Kill Bill therefore tells the compelling story of one woman's revenge against her former assassin-colleagues who, on the day of her wedding, marched into the church and killed everyone there, including the bride's fianc√©e and her unborn baby. However they botched their way through their most important task: killing the bride. Now she wakes up from a coma four years later with one thing on her mind: killing Bill and the deadly viper squad who did this to her. 'Kill Bill vol. 1' thus tells the first half of the Bride's long, bloody, brutal and heartfelt journey for justice as she seeks out her enemies in parts of the world.First let me say that this is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, simply because it is a perfect amalgam of everything I like in both style and substance. The colourful format mixed with black-and-white visuals, the brief anime sequences, the chapter format, the atmospheric and eerie soundtrack and finally the fantastic story of cold, calculating vengeance ¬ñ none of these components work on their own in the sense that their sole inclusion could support a film ¬ñ but Quentin stirs and melts them together with with a bafflingly good skill that completely floored by non-existent expectations. On top of this, he applies an incredible kinetic energy to every part of 'Kill Bill' which makes the occasional slow-paced and introspective pauses all the more poignant.The whole film is due to the aforementioned poised on the brink of overkill. It needs to be said. Ideas and visuals are bottled up under a lid but bubbling to come up at all times. It is enjoyable madness. However 'Kill Bill vol. 1' is not devoid of faults. These are no overriding or fatal shortcomings, but rather a small collection of scenes that simply do not work. The detective scene with Michael and James Parks going into the El Paso church after the massacre is incongruous and redundant, serving little more purpose than to give Tarantino's long-time friends their token cameos. Another scene that does not work for me is the dialogue-driven piece between Thurman and Fox in the kitchen after they've got their bitches on in a world-class cat-fight in the beginning. Their conversation feels staged, long-winded and purposely plot-propelling not to mention far too formal given the context and the histories of the two characters.But indeed these are minor slip-ups and with the amount of good weapons in Tarantino's directorial arsenal, one can hardly hold it against him. Even the uneven pacing of 'Kill Bill vol. 1' is immediately forgiven when he plunges into to spinning martial arts violence and homaging goodies, all filtered through his own creative (...and sick) mind. Enjoy the coldly served dish.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Flippin' awesome!,"I just saw this last night, and loved it! I was expecting something like, 'Jackie Brown', which I hated. Something, slow and dry and bloody, from what I'd heard of it. But, I was really surprised, and in a good way. The film leaves you guessing, and a little tense at times, and more importantly, hanging at the end! Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui, duke it out in this four-star blood bath dedicated to old Japenese and slaughter films. It's a definite Tarintino film, and it's hard not to recognize his determination to achieve a sickening result, that will leave you numb and grossed out from what you've just witnessed. But, that doesn't go without saying, that his talents almost supercede the acting abilities shown by Thurman and Lui. Both, learned Japenese to play the leading roles, and both obviously went in for some training, to be able to fight in certain scenes of the film.It's far too bloody for anyone under seventeen, and my recommendation is that you not eat before viewing. It's one of the most violent and bloody films, although I have to admit, there are some horror films which are a bit more disturbing and violent, this left me feeling just a little bored seeing all the killing.

It's good but not as good as it hopes to be,"Uma Thurman kicks backsides in Kill Bill vol.1 but it's lengthy run time doesn't have enough of the entertaining action scenes.It's length of 110 minutes should have been cut back to a max of 90, without question. When we consider the story of a revenge seeking woman, out to even the score against the assassination squad that left her for dead, the emphasis has to be on action, action and more action. The 20 minute histrionic period from the half way mark damages the movie, being so slow I almost thought someone was going to start walking backwards. It's just so unnecessary and annoying. The hunt is on, the stage is set, and then we get the Yakuza doing their impression of a soap opera. Other than that, I enjoyed this movie and Thurman is great in her role. Particular highlights include the hospital scenes and the final confrontation with O-Ren Ishii and in general the fight sequences are well done. The colours are also quite stunning, making for a great visual experience.Aside from running too long it also tries to be humorous which it doesn't manage to do most of the time. The script also lets the movie down in its odd, Shakespearean style. I'm not really sure what they were trying to do there. The subject matter calls for rough and tough dialogue and should have left the silly jokes out entirely.

Utter rubbish,"Having enjoyed Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown, I really looked forward to seeing this film. To say that I was disappointed with it is the understatement of the year.The main reasons I loved Tarantino's previous efforts are the fast moving story-lines, the slick, witty dialogue and the feeling that you are seeing something stamped with the mark of a unique and talented film-maker. None of these appear to be present in Kill Bill. Instead, all we have is a slow-paced killing spree adorned with some of the most pretentious film-directorship I've ever seen.There are so many arty, slow-motion, knife-wielding scenes that it is hard to stay awake through the boredom; the worst of which sees Thurman slaying about a hundred people in a never-ending scene that is so pretentious and self-indulgent as to defy belief.If this was Tarantino's first high-budget effort it would have flopped spectacularly. He seems to be on one big ego trip and he has sacrificed everything; engaging characters; entertaining dialogue and compelling story-line, in order to achieve something that he hopes will appear cool. Fortunately for Quentin, there are probably enough people in the world who are shallow and insecure enough to pretend to like this film just because it's cool to like it. In that respect, these kind of people and this kind of film are meant for each other. I just hope I never encounter any more in my life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
you can't be serious,"Tarantino's latest movie is pure crap. Should we blame the relentless Americanization of culture or simply Tarantino's burn-out? Martial arts are neither martial nor arts anymore. Just a big, boring, and sickening Rambo-like Grand Guignol. Ironically, when American directors realised that bullets killed too fast they resorted to ju-jitsu, karate, and Japanese swords and strung out the killing thing. The sheer silliness of yakuza hitmen using a katana instead of guns or of a Chinese-American woman as their ""godfather"" do not seem to bother Tarantino. What really matters is chopping off as many heads and limbs as possible and disembowel a fair amount of people. The underlying philosophy of martial arts is completely lost but the Schwarzeneggerian nature of modern politics is finely exposed: shameless, gratuitous violence and blood-shed. I am ashamed of those 20 people or so who applauded while I am glad nobody else in the theatre followed their example. Outrageous is that Tarantino claimed he took inspiration from Sergio Leone, a remarkable Italian director who by now must be spinning in his grave with shame and embarrassment. But after all, you know, it was ironic! I'm actually still laughing.ahahahahahahahahahahahahahStrawberries in the Supermarket by Emir Kusturica, that's irony.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Uma Thurman for the win...,"""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a woman waking up from a four-year coma and she starts seeking her revenge from a group of assassins who tried to kill her.

The most intense movie experience in...,"...now long? I'd say at least ten years.QT has given us another gem. He combines a classic revenge story with a pastiche of the kung fu movies he grew up on.The only weakness is in the backstory. With the exception of Lucy Liu's character, we know nothing of the other character's past.Tarantino wisely pushes such things to the back burner. We know that Bill and his assassins killed nine innocents and nearly killed The Bride.There it is. She has no name. The only time she mentions her name in Part 1, it is bleeped. (And again an moment later when Viveca A Fox says the name) She doesn't need a name. She isn't a person so much as a force of nature.There are two main set-pieces: the Bride's fight with Vernita Green (Viveca A Fox)and the big battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Both are intense and will leave you limp.Not enough goodies on the DVD, though. <sigh>Nine stars. Watch the DVD, then go watch Part 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
comments,"""the blood escaped from the body like it was a fountain"" or ""How was Uma able to take a Samurai sword on an airplane?""These comments kinda frustrates me, if you didnt know, this was supposed to be a tribute movie, a tribute to all the film genres that quentin loves. And especially (of vol. 1 that is) the japaneese samurai genre. And if you have seen a good old japaneese movie, you will notice that the blood actually ""escapes the body like it was a fountain"".And for the Samurai sword on the plane. Ive seen people writing it was a riddicoulus(?) mistake by QT to oversee the fact that Uma brought the sword with here on the plane from Okinawa to japan. Do you really think QT oversaw that? What it is, is a tribute to japaneese samurai movies, meaning samurai, the sword and the movies, and all it represents, is such a important harritage(??) to the japaneese people and culture that bringing a sword on the plane should be a normal and common thing to happen. As you see on the plane seats, there are actually ""cop""holders meant for the samurai swords to be held in, or samurai-holders if you'd like!Congrats to QT for making a unforgettable movie yet again.

Anime revisited,"QT here has once again showed his knack for creating fleeting absurd characters, over the top action scenes, and original adaptation from various genres. In Kill Bill, QT picks The main genre ""Anime"" to bring to life on the big screen. If This film were done in pure cartoon Anime, it would just be another Japanese Anime flick, but here we have Anime without the cartoon.(Except for a few brief moments)The violence depicted here is absurd and over the top, exactly what we would see in many cartoon anime series. It is not intended to shock, it is intended to stay true to the anime genre as if we were watching a true cartoon anime.Uma Thurman aka ""The splattered bride, aka Black Mamba, aka, her absurdly bleeped out true name of ""Beatrice"" is on your typical Anime plot based revenge march from an assassination attempt on her 4 years prior.

big Tarantino fan...but not of this film,"Quentin Tarantino's ego has finally overwhelmed his talents. This shameless self-ploitation film is unbearable for its horrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and bare-floor plot. Its celebrated cinematography, no doubt, is breathtaking. But this is a film, not a painting, and it can't rely solely on its visual elements to carry it forward (in this way it is excruciatingly similar to Eyes Wide Shut, another ego-trip from an otherwise immortal director). The cut is especially deep in that it is ranked ahead of films like Raging Bull, Ran, and Tarantino's own Reservoir Dogs (up there with Pulp Fiction for his best).

Awful!!!,"I have been a fan of Quentin Tarantino since I first saw Reservoir Dogs.  I've been a martial arts fan for over 25 years.  This movie had both, but it stunk.  You can always expect there to be a few cheesy moments in every Tarantino film.  Usually it works.  This time, it didn't.  The cheese ruined this film.  The main characters all had ridiculous nicknames.  No one in this film just bled---if someone was cut, they gushed blood like a geyser or like The Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Lastly the soundtrack and sound effects were irritating and way too loud, though this might have partly been due to a hearing impaired projector operator in my local theater.      Kill Bill had a couple of things going for it, however...  The action in the fight scenes were brilliantly choreographed.  If you're going to see this movie just for the action, go ahead.  You might enjoy it if you can get past all the cartoon violence.  The other thing worth watching in this film was martial arts film veteran Sonny Chiba.  He only spent 5 to 10 minutes on the screen (if that), but he was very enjoyable to watch.  Like Christian Slater claimed in True Romance, he's the finest actor in martial arts films today!  Unfortunately though, we didn't get to see him in action. When they talked about splitting Kill Bill into 2 separate movies, I was upset that I'd have to wait several months to see how it ends.  I'm not so worried about that now.  I'll wait till Kill Bill: Volume 2 comes on cable.  The only way I'll go see it at the movie theater is if Tarantino re-shoots the ending to have Sonny Chiba team up with Uma Thurman's character against Bill (David Carradine).",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino's best remix,"I've been watching this multiple times since midschool, grew up with the poster of Vol. 1 in my bedroom.. But I wanted to rediscover this movie. For that, I spent this past month watching +50 of the movies referenced in Kill Bill that I hadn't watched before. And it added so much to the experience! Characters, fighting techniques and even objects have a new meaning to me now. And it's pretty cool to finally know who Annie Oakley is!Kill Bill is such an epic 4-hour fantasy revenge story and the wet dream of a movie fanboy that grew up watching thousands of spaghetti westerns, kung fu, samurai and yakuza movies. And also pretty much everything else. Quentin Tarantino is a cinematographic DJ and this is his best remix.Soon I'll read David Carradine's ""The Diary of Kill"" and watch the japanese tv-show ""Shadow Warriors"". I don't think my passion for this movie will ever die!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
a movie lovers dream,"In the past, I've refused to rate a film as my favorite, but I have now come to realise that this great work is about as entertaining as it gets.Kill Bill Vol.1 is Quentin's most accomplished film by miles, perfectly melding together thousands of references from past masterpieces to create a post-modern epic worthy of great praise.After about literally at least ten viewings, it still amazes me how visually stunning it is, seemingly never relenting from it's attack on the senses.

What A Rip-Off,"I used to adore this film. If you would have asked me six-months ago, I would have given this movie a 10. Then I got educated. After watching films by Akira Kurosawa the lines in this movie became almost laughable. I can picture Quentin pounding his fists on the coffee-table screaming ""I wanna make a samurai movie!!"". Kurosawa's films had a certain nobility to them, which is sadly something that Quentin has yet to master. I think the problem was that he tried to hard to replicate the ""cool"" feeling of ""Pulp Fiction"". The redeeming thing about this movie is that it almost feels original. Only in a few spots did I roll my eyes at his corny dialog. Lucky for me, I hadn't seen the stinking pile of garbage that became known as ""Volume 2"" yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
This is me at my most... masochistic,Quentin Tarantino brings another unique movie in itself.The first movie i have seen that's been described in chapters.But it was so memorable.So much gory filled scenes & sword fighting at its best.But some scenes are just impossible.Thats the only fault i could find in this.But again thats what cinema is all about.The casting is pretty good.With Uma Thurman leading from the front.Fine performance from her.Lucy Liu also has given a fine performance.Rest of the cast is pretty good.The music is pretty cool.Adulations for Quentin Tarantino for directing such a fantastic film.Its so damn unique.Its the basis for many new films to come in the future.The best scene in the movie is that of Uma Thurman fighting out the crazy 88's.And then there is Bill at the end.Still remember the dialog...This is me at my most... masochistic!!!!.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A genre on its own,"Not even close to being Tarantino's best, but it can be definitely considered the most representative example of his style of postmodern pastiche of genres. It's easy to make references to ""The Killing"" and other ""cool"" films, but let's not forget that Tarantino here borrows from the worst grindhouse garbage and still manages to deliver solid entertainment full of memorable moments and characters. The originality is not in the references - it's in the ways languages that belong to apparently unrelated genres are blended together to create an over-the-top yet coherent world. We see chambara swordfight emphasized by spaghetti western music, animation sequences, and horror B movie special effects to tone down the gorey moments but still make them visually appealing, and it still feels like the same film.The only problem is that the movie is far too long for a style-over-substance action film where a simple revenge story is used as an excuse to have videogame characters fight each other. Especially if we count the two volumes as a single work, a less disjointed and more concise structure would have helped. Useless divagations and non-linear narration are trademarks of Tarantino's films, but they don't seem to serve any particular purpose here, with scenes that could have lasted two minutes eating up huge portions of the running time and climaxes coming up a little too early than needed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A film I'll remember all my life!,"Quentin Tarantino, according to me is the finest filmmaker of this generation. I am a huge, huge, huge, fan of his right from his Masterpiece 'Reservoir Dogs'. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is milestone of a film.Blame the Legend for making absurd & weird films, but no one can deny his astounding talent.

Leaves you hanging but eager to see the final three names crossed of the list,"Fans of Quentin Tarantino's unique brand of exploitation-cinema- worship were forced to wait six long years for his next movie after his underrated love-letter to blaxploitation, Jackie Brown (1997). The result was intended to be a 3 hour 'roaring rampage of revenge' but instead, thanks to the unenlightened head honchos at Miramax, Kill Bill became Kill Bill: Volume 1, a 110-minute half-movie that forced cinema-goers to pay again to see the following instalment four months later. Despite this money-making scheme that I'm sure Tarantino wanted no part of (he still refers to Kill Bill as one movie), Volume 1 is still quite brilliant.Taking inspiration from the kung-fu and spaghetti western genre movies Tarantino no doubt indulged in during his time as a video store clerk (although Vol. 1 focuses mainly on the former), Kill Bill is, at times, a montage of shots, scenes and music from other movies from the 1970's. Yet Tarantino doesn't so much simply copy these films but play on our genre expectations while making it fun to test your own knowledge as a cinephile in the process. The tale is one of revenge, and a simple one at that. Tarantino has no qualms in staging Kill Bill as a one-by- one ticking-off of the bastards who wrongs our heroine, known simply as The Bride (Uma Thurman), who even carries a list of her targets and boldly strikes out their names as they fall.A massacre at a wedding chapel instigated by Bill (David Carradine) and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad sees everyone inside murdered apart from The Bride, who is shot in the head and put into a coma. Waking up four years later, she quickly sets about gaining her revenge on Bill and his four cronies - Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Budd (Michael Madsen), and the one- eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Travelling to Okinawa in Japan, she approaches legendary samurai sword-maker Hattori Hanzo (genre legend Sonny Chiba) and talks him out of her retirement to forge her weapon of death.Told in chapter form, scenes are either extremely talky or outlandishly action-packed. The quieter moments bristle with Tarantino's now- iconic dialogue, while the extended climax, taking place in a two-floor restaurant that is quickly turned into a blood bath, displays the directors then-unseen eye for action. As The Bride takes on O-Ren's gang (dubbed the Crazy 88) and her Meteor hammer-wielding bodyguard Gogo (Chiaki Kuriyama) she hacks and slices her way through them all in a moment that evokes The Matrix Revolutions of the same year, only with real people and an eye for action cinema. Its all backed by another terrific Tarantino soundtrack that is routinely pillaged by TV shows too lazy to find their own music. The ending leaves you hanging without feeling ripped off, and eager to see the final three names crossed off the list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"A Celebration of Overkill, Soaked With Blood and Matched with a Perfect Soundtrack","The most visceral, nonstop, gladly wanton orgy of violence I've ever seen, not to mention one hell of a stylish compilation of influence and homage. Like a cinematic Wanderlei Silva, this is an action picture that just does not stop throwing haymakers until it's finished, and I love it for that simple-minded dedication to its own nature. Uma Thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the double-crossed professional killer on a blood vendetta, as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod. The plot is simple enough, with Thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads she's out to collect with her from scene to scene, but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player. Though it's sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash, the story's split doesn't bother me a bit; in a way it's an appropriate intermission, as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each other's way. Masterfully orchestrated chaos, it's impossible to turn away from the Bride's classic exaggerated fight scene with the Crazy 88s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Quentin, you're fired!","What puzzles me is not the film itself, but the popularity such a piece of non-cinema has risen in this country and elsewhere. The very same plot was already very successfully approached in 1968, by Francois Truffaut, in his 'The Bride Wore Black'. The difference being that, at that time, there really was a story, there really was suspense, and whoever the characters, they all seemed human. In other words, they had FEELINGS. Tarantino seems so much hypnotized by style, that unless you're not a movie-freak, there is no way in which you can't keep on noticing references after references of a superficially exploited collection of stylish movements (mangas, comic strips, Samurai movies, pop culture, watered down atmospheres specific to such or such director, etc.)This time, his only apparent goal is how to overwhelm the viewer under a shower of violence and ox-blood¬Ö No storyline whatsoever, no purpose, no way to identify ourselves with any of the characters, except for Bill's, the only one who seems to have some sort of emotions, and who incidentally is a psychopath (any contradiction here?)After viewing it, mostly in fast forward mode during those endless figures of sword combats, I asked myself what kind of irreconcilable trauma poor Quent must have suffered in his youth ¬Ö And again, the targets of his spurs of most sadistic creativity are either women, gays, colored people, or figures of authority (I let you decide which belongs to which in his 3 previous movies). After having had to swallow the exhibitionist and sadistic stances of a New-Born Hollywood shark, here we are again, force-fed with hardly digestible matter and wondering what could be the next step¬Ö Hard-core porn, real rapes, real mutilations (how much would an actor take to accept to have a limb actually severed in front of the camera?), feces, children's sacrifice??? Besides, the level of language - mostly sarcasms and insults ¬ñ is in total contradiction with the argument of the movie that 'revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold', thus dispassionately. I really invite you to watch Truffaut's version and a real contribution to breaking taboos or at least, to allowing us to reflect on tricky matters such as vengeance.Sadly, Tarantino only talks about Tarantino, and about his obvious failure in processing his personal loads of hostility towards the world or God only knows what else. Pathetic and, even more dangerously, totally deprived of any sense of humor. To be discarded¬Ö Quentin, you are perverting the very purpose of the 7th Art¬Ö Will that be your last film?

I want to throw Tarantino into the path of a Sherman tank (allegedly!),"First of all let me say, I am ashamed at myself for wasting 5 minutes of my life (which I will never get back), writing about a Tarantino movie.I am an obsessive movie-goer.  I live and breathe movies, and consider myself to be a bit of a connoisseur.  I like to think I know a good movie when I see it, and a good director when I see his or her work.To say Tarantino is a talented director, is equivalent to saying Britney Spears is a talented recording artist.  It's all smoke and mirrors, unfortunately a lot of the population has been fooled, and these untalented individuals are making a lot of money.Enough Tarantino bashing, time to bash his movie.  Kill Bill: Vol. I (don't expect a review of Volume II, there won't be one), is quite possibly the most ridiculous, unashamedly bad movie of our time (I didn't think it could get any worse than From Dusk Till Dawn, but it did).  I have to give Tarantino some credit, he has totally brainwashed a large majority of the world's population into believing he has talent.

Art (in my humble opinion) is the practice of expression leaving much to interpretation thereby provoking and inspiring the audience to be involved. This film was not art. It was a lecture. Nothing left to the imagination. Every last detail explicitly laid out to the point of complete boredom. A flat declaration that there is no faith in the interpretive capabilities of the audience. And the places that the audience is left to use their imagination are more in the area of making sense of the huge holes in the film.

"Great Movie, but fails in its intention","What can be said about Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill? Some consider it a masterpiece, others don't. The only certain thing about this movie is that it loses its original intention. In this movie, Tarantino tries too hard to make a sort of replica of the classic Japanese samurai films combined with the well-known martial arts movies. This can be easily seen from Uma Thurman's clothing, the yellow suit with the black line is featured in ""Game of Death"" featuring Bruce Lee. The problem that this film represents is that in virtually every Japanese movie of the types mentioned above, you'll never find massive, senseless slaughtering because the fighting is actually NOT the main idea of those movies, but the preservation of honor along with the demonstration of courage and skill. Certainly this movie has Tarantino's style well-engraved in it. I believe it's been highly regarded by many because it has the name of a well-known director, and most supporters fail to find the true meaning and intention of the film.*Just for reference you should watch a couple of Akira Kurosawa's movies , see which style you like best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Review of this film's madness,"(warning- this review includes speculative comments about the director's sanity that are intended to be humorous exaggerations. This critic actually knows nothing about diagnosing any mental inbalance.)What can I say about Kill Bill Vol. I  that hasn't already been said by hellacious hallucinations of a blood-soaked hobits dancing outside our windows late at night?  For starters, it took everything that we thought we knew about what a movie is (which used to be something along the lines of a 2 hour visual narrative) and slam-dunked it into a small hoop that is hanging up on the door that separates insanity from hundreds of gallons of fake blood. Let me first get one thing out of the way to either entice or warn you off, depending upon what tickles you fancy: this movie is violent. It's easily Quentin's most violent work to date, and considering the fact that his movies are generally as violent as it gets, I'd say this movie hits close to being the most violent film of all time. Unfortunately, in my infant hours of having seen Kill Bill, that is really the only thing about the movie that I can be sure of. So if you're waiting for me to tell you what the movie was like, apart from the extreme violence, you'll have to settle for whatever descriptions can escape this speechless critic's brain. A decent jumping off point would be try to imagine Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets Army of Darkness and you have a small picture of what this movie is like. I, for one, have never seen ANYTHING like Kill Bill. Not in the movies. Not ANYWHERE. It doesn't even resemble a movie in any sense that we're familiar with. It's more like a 2-hour collection of footage depicting the revenge agenda of an un-named Uma Thurman character who has gone through hell, and will gladly go through more hell just to collect her vengeance. That essentially sums up the plot in its absolute entirety. Uma Thurman basically is on a mission for revenge and kills everything she sees. That's really all that happens in the movie. A great deal of the film is exposition, and the back story is pounded so well into us that even we are itching for Bill (whoever he is) to taste the wrathful vengeance of Uma Thurman (whoever she is).  All things considered, there is really nothing for us to work with apart from our crash course in revenge seeking, dazzling visual texture, and half-hour fight scenes. Some might argue that this movie is nothing more than eye-candy, giving us a long awaited taste of the interesting things that Quentin does with the camera. Whether or not this is true, nobody can deny that--if nothing else--Tarantino is the most interesting director of our time as far as seeing how his movies will look on the screen. His style is so independent of convention that, if I had never heard of Quentin Tarantino, I would be pretty sure after seeing Kill Bill that he has never SEEN a single movie in his life. Unfortunately, we happen to know that he is an accomplished filmmaker, which means that the only explanation for Kill Bill's madness would have to lie within the apparent madness of its maestro. And this movie is so bizarre, that if I (and I happen to be a huge 'tino fan) saw Quentin Tarantino on the street, I would avoid eye contact and try to walk in the other direction without calling attention to myself. Because he's not sane. And anybody who thinks otherwise needs to sit down and watch Kill Bill, and remind themselves that the art came from within the mind of the artist.If you're upset because this review didn't help you much with deciding weather or not you want to go see this movie, I apologize fully and offer the following question: do you think you can handle it? Because if you're going to see this movie, you have to be ready to take lots of things with a grain of salt. If you're a film student, or consider yourself a film buff, this movie is absolutely mandatory. I, for one, found myself desperately not wanting this movie to end. Kill Bill was entertaining, and without question, the most interesting experience I've ever had at a movie theatre. Good Luck.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Single Most Incredible Theatre Experience Ever!,"Kill Bill holds a very dear place in my heart. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I liked, nay, loved, nay, MEMORIZED everything Quentin Tarantino hasever been affiliated with. Started with a spur renting of Reservoir Dogs to finding my parents copy of Pulp Fiction which I LITERALLY destroyed by watching so much and within a year I had everything he'd ever starred in,directed,or written under my belt. I'm not exaggerating when I say me,my dad,and my brother have memorized every single line in Pulp Fiction.At the same time I LOVE Japanese and Hong Kong cinema. I've watched almost every ""big"" HK kung fu movie and quite a few of the ""small"" ones. I've seen 14 Zatoichi movies for christ sake,and of course,Battle Royale.Now,enter about nine months ago. I go on imdb and type in the QT man and find that he's directing a 4th film! Within an hour I've memorized the actors in it (SONNY EFFIN CHIBA!) and seen the teaser a good 3 times (I can't even begin to count how many times I've seen it now). This is MY film. This film was ALL I could talk about for the past 6 months and today at school I told EVERYONE ""Eff House of the Dead, it's about Kill Effin Bill!"" and everyone more or less hates me now cause of this stupid movie. SO! How was it?In one word, scrumtulescent.The movie is a train ride from the very beginning. The first thing we see is an AWESOME ""Feature Presentation"" logo, the kind you'd see in a 70's release of a Wu Tang flick. From there we open up on the bloody and scarred face of Uma Thurman as the mysterious Bill talks off screen. An amazing Tarantino soliloquy follows and then the credits. Nothing more than white text on black background while Nancy Sinatra's haunting ""Bang Bang"" plays.Based on this alone you can get an idea of what Kill Bill is like. It's dark, it's bloody, it's gory, but it also has it's little hilarious quirks. This film is so quirky it's insane. It's shot in the Tarantino order,AKA,out of order but at NO point does it seem like a gimmick. At the same time Tarantino has no qualms with completely ruining the flow we've all come to know in the average movie. The best example I can give of this is when Tarantino launches into about a 10 minute anime back story (animated by our friends at Production IG,god bless ya'll) of one of the characters. Literally out of the blue. It does NOT seem out of place or anything at all, in fact, it's a great breath of fresh air.The action is just...god, I can't even begin to explain it. I LOVE old kung fu stuff but lately it's too complicated. The fights go on far too long and involve such ridiculous stunts that by the end I just don't care anymore. This is old school all the way. Excluding 2 or 3 flips it is ALL grounded and it's kept nice and sweet. She doesn't play chicken with 50 guys for an hour, she beheads, dismembers, and mutilates about 80 or so characters in about 7 minutes and it's AWESOME! The violence is so ridiculously out of control that you can't help but just laugh at it but also be amazed at it's entertainment value. It blows anything the Matrix has even attempted out the water and this didn't need a bullet time gimmick.And now we come to the ending. Something that everyone has been dreading since it was announced the film would be split. Does the ending work? Hell, mothereffin, yeah. The ending leaves you with a closed chapter but a plot twist that leaves you in suspense, but not the insane suspense of the Matrix. In the end I'm glad it was split, as I doubt even I could appreciate a 4 hour nonstop gore revenge flick.My only complaint is that there isn't more. I don't mean the sequel, but I mean just more of the plot. I mentioned the anime sequence above. Now, I used to LOVE anime, I was knee deep in it, but I haven't seen an ounce of it in probably 2 or 3 months because it's just all poppy cheery kiddy crap or the same recycled romantic/shounen plot over and over. Well this is anime I LOVE! It's gritty, it's violent, it's dark, it's just some of the best animation I've ever seen. I just wish there was a fullon 24 episode series of it. At the same time, I know once the movie is over I'm gonna want more Tarantino hack and slash fun. I can only pray that this becomes Tarantino's ""Bond"" series where he makes a new installment every few years.I gave this movie a 10/10 but no matter how you cut it, A+, 100%, this is an amazing effin movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
There is something to admire. But...,"""Either you'll love him or you'll hate him"", has everybody told me about Quentin Tarantino. No other alternatives. His style is an extreme, unrealistic, grotesque one, and you can't help but adoring it or hating it. (In my circle of friends, actually, there are much more people feeling the first way.)Well, I have to say that I disagree. My feelings were actually disappointment, some boredom and a touch of admiration for some aspects of this over-discussed movie, aspects that I will point out later. Let me tell first what I found disappointing.After having watched ""Pulp Fiction"", I kept wondering about what people was so enthusiast about in that mess of violence, if it wasn't for one thing: that the gore was coupled with a witty script that, as regards dialog, was reached by very few films I ever saw in my entire life. As a lover of words, I found a lot to enjoy on this side. But what about ""Kill Bill"", at least about Volume One we are talking about here? If you take a look at the ""Memorable Quotes"" section here on IMDb, there is the totality of the dialog in the film. The strength of the movie doesn't lie in the use of words.But there is violence. So much that, in half an hour, you find yourself laughing out loud at the screen as heads and limbs are cut off, leaving only rivers of cartoonish blood coming out from everywhere. Well, as I was laughing, I told myself - Is this really a healthy thing? Is it good that so much people enjoy that much watching a hour and a half of tomato juice - because the director's style wants to remind us every single moment that this is what we're dealing with, tomato juice? Is it good that a supposed masterpiece is made up of a pregnant woman beaten up to a near-death, then shot, then raped throughout her 4-years-long coma; a mother killed in front of her daughter; a pre-teen girl seducing the pedophile killer of her family and having her revenge in bed with him; and so many, so many, SO many limbs cut off? I don't think that this is a healthy thing, and this is why I'm angry every time that I find a Tarantinophile telling me that there is no greatest director in the world. Because all these people will watch the movie with their 6-year-old children and think ""oh, no, my God, there's no problem! Even a kid could easily tell that this is fake!""And so? What is the positive point then? We can turn around this as much as we want, but in the end, what we have here is a non-existing story filled with pointlessly over-acted acts of violence from the beginning to the end. And we find excitement and pleasure in watching them, because they are well-presented, skilfully told and nicely directed, with every right camera angle you need. I'm not sure that this is enough to make ""Kill Bill"" a masterpiece.I promised that I would later have pointed out what the interesting elements of the film are, in my opinion. Of course, there are some. The last thing you can say about Tarantino is that he suffers from lack of originality! And this originality lies precisely in his ability of ""putting the puzzle together"", adding to the mix of citations and past cinematic references the quality of vision he undoubtedly owes at the highest level - and that you can't help but admire, whether you approve him or not.For example, and this is to be found not only in ""Kill Bill"" but in all his production, he's the man of the soundtracks. You can sense it since the opening sequence when you're hit by the voice of Nancy Sinatra with ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" - in this movie, he makes perhaps his best soundtrack achievement to date. The best evidence of it is that it is totally unsuitable to be turned into a Cd compilation, and in this form it is very hard to listen to, but if ""married"" to the images, it perfectly suits every movement, every glance, every breath. Music provides also the only few moments of pause in the entire movie, like the simply adorable ""Lonely Shepherd"" by Zamfir which accompanies the already-classical words by Michael Madsen ""That woman deserves her revenge, and we deserve to die."" Brief but wonderful musical gems are to be found throughout the film and add a lot to the visual experience.Another good thing is what I couldn't describe in any other way than a ""touch of magic"" that you can feel, here and there, in some moments of the movie, despite all the gore and all the violence. The moment in which The Bride, after the furious and oh-my-God-how-long fight with the Crazy 88, goes to the final battle with O-Ren, is one of them. The scene changes abruptly and all the blood is cancelled by the snow, in a white Japanese garden surrounded by a dark blue sky. For a brief moment, you experience peace, and this sensation is without a doubt provided by the director's talent. And this is not the only noteworthy moment - even in the overlong fighting scenes, which I am not a fan of, there is something ""more"" than an immediate level to find.The man definitely has a thing for imagination, and he knows he has. He also knows how to let the public be part of his imagination. I can only warn this public that he also knows - more than any other director I've watched in my life - how to manipulate the audience. When you watch a Tarantino film, ""Kill Bill"" in primis, admire his talent, but try to be aware of this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantinos' Best,"Having seen this three times at the cinema now i was inclined to write a review of it. Kill Bill is quite easily one of the best films i have seen. I was surprised i liked it so much as normally i am more keen on films with a complex narrative and developed characters(Volume ii may help clarify this), nevertheless what Kill Bill delivered was a near perfect cinematic masterpiece. The main reason i loved this film so much was because of its aesthetic qualities. The violence looked almost beautiful, a sharp contrast to that of 'Reservoir Dogs'. The film is very reflexive in so much that Tarantino uses and appreciates a variety of sub-genres. Thurman is perfectly cast as the avenger who seeks to torment and destroy those who inflicted so much pain on her. Its violence but tastefully done.I can't wait for the second installment to arrive and answer some of the questions the first volume left open. Obviously i highly recommend this film but do understand it will not suit all tastes. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
not my kind of movie,"I would consider myself as a great Tarantino fan. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are masterpieces in my eyes and I even liked Jacky Brown. So I was really looking forward to watch the new Tarantino. I wanted to read all informations and news about this Kill Bill almost two years before it actually started. After this long waiting time I was disappointed when I watched it. I missed this special humour of Tarantino which made me laugh so many times in Res. dogs and PF. This movies have been violent and funny at the same time. Kill Bill wasn't funny for me. It was a good action movie ,even a great movie for a fan of martial arts . But if you liked Tarantinos style in his earlier movies you might be a little bit disappointed. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Unforgiving...,"One of two parts of, quite frankly, the worst movie I think I've seen. Certainly it is the only one which sticks in my mind with such a particular distaste.Tarantino takes unique aspects of some great cult movies, cuts them up, and mashes them blindly and carelessly together into a pathetic ill-fitting jigsaw. All attempts at making these into amusing parodies of originals fail, and in my case, left me writhing in my seat fighting the urge not to run out of the cinema pulling out my hair, screaming. The movie takes itself far too seriously to achieve being a good satire.Possibly the most annoying element of the movie, and the subsequent one, is Tarantino's onanistic worshiping of Uma. It sickens me to the gut the lengths he goes to in brainwashing the audience with his fetish. Keep it to yourself, Quentin.Finally, I add, would people stop praising the man for being a genius. He is far from it. I enjoyed Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but these are not enough to make a man a genius. Hundreds of directors have made a 'couple' of good movies. I feel the afformentioned two are the only ones worth any time from this evidently obtuse director.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Don't bother save your time and money!,"When My wife & I sat down to watch this film we knew Quentin Tarantino's style and past films. This film though was definitely the worst we have seen in a long time! The plot (oops was there a plot) is none existent. it is purely a film based on a gratuitously violent video game- Blood spurting, limbs flying - let's just say we were not amused, impressed or enlightened by our viewing. The only & I mean ONLY reason we actually finished watching the film was that we thought (wrongly) that it had to get better! I would rather have spent the 2 hrs that the film took to watch having my genitalia pierced (something that I would loath doing).

"Not Perfect, but The Better Of The Two Parts","There are a ton of reviews about this movie, so I won't go into detail about why I enjoyed it, other than being a fan of martial arts and samurai cinema, I enjoyed the homage.
The weak points of this film - the misuse of the word 'entropy', which should have been 'atrophy', which told me that Tarantino didn't have much proof-reading in his script; musical cues that don't quite fit the scenes; musical cues that cut off suddenly; the dialogue was weak, thank goodness that there was action scenes to make up for that; the Crazy 88s fight sequence, it should not have been in B&W (at least, not for the Blu Ray release), and it was painfully obvious that a muscular stunt man was subbing in for Uma for much of it; bleeping out the name of the Bride. What was the point of that?
The good, or should I say, best parts were: Sonny Chiba's cameo; Go Go Yubari and her fight scene with The Bride.
Overall, not one of Tarantino's best films, but Vol 1 certainly surpassed Vol 2 by a long shot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The intellectual equivalent of a fashion show,"I always love Tarantino's choice of music. This film sounds great. It also looks slick with beautiful people posing around the screen in cool outfits. And that's about it. I loved Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown for many reasons, including their cool understatement balanced by occasional way over-the-top excess. These are the cinematic equivalents of quantum theory and the Sidney Opera House, Kill Bill is the cinematic equivalent of a fashion show of polished and posing airheads--only with lots of blood.Don't waste your money unless that sounds appealing.

Wiggle my big middle finger,"Not cool.There is power in things that are implicit, and when portrayed artfully, more powerful then things explicit.There is no reason for all the gross violence in this movie, and it's largely unattractive.  Explicitly showing violence, especially constantly throughout a film, is a serious cop-out.I don't particularly find that artistic, entertaining, or shocking, more than I find it largely discomforting and somewhat insulting.I don't care about the gushing blood, or even the flying limbs.  Fine. But this movie was just gross.In order for a director to be able to pull off such a bold depiction of violence, there would have to be a largely substantial plot to back this up.There was none.  The movie was about fighting people.  That's all.  The action sequences had at least 100 times more content then the story-line. You'd think this would make for a very intense movie.  Yes, it is intense. But not captivating.  I love being uncomfortable when watching a movie - it's great, that means you're involved in it.  But this movie made me uncomfortable in a way that I didn't want to continue watching it.Perhaps that was the intention.  Fine.  I just don't like paying money to watch people get murdered.  It's boring, and a total cop-out.  Well, not a total cop-out; civilians weren't pointlessly killed, which is good.Other then that, the movie was very stunning visually.  It was definately a treat to watch, in that regard.  That really long steady-cam shot which started out (in a restaurant?) and followed Uma through the entire building then back to the same spot; that was fantastic.But the whole movie was plastic, fake, utterly pointless, and well - annoying.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2,"One of the most acclaimed movies this decade is Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2. Both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the United States (over 330 million dollars worldwide in total) and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesn't have its own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame yet. Directed by the unique and creative Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery, excellent music, and a well-rounded cast of zany characters. Sounds great doesn't it? Well, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as people say it is. As for Kill Bill Volume 2, now that is a spectacular movie. These two movies in actuality is one film, but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long, Miramax decides to release it as two separate films. Despite the rather slow start, Kill Bill finishes so strong you know why Tarantino is as popular as he is today.Kill Bill is about a woman, whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film (known as The Bride), looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal, killing every single person except for her. But before she goes after the man that started the massacre, she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first. Much easier said than done. The first Kill Bill basically is like an action flick, not concentrated too heavily on plot, but more on action. Kill Bill Vol. 2 does contain its amount of intense action, but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just The Bride, but of the assassins, and Bill himself.The first part of Kill Bill is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action. The truth is, there is only two massive action scenes, and both are good, don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes. They range from several scenes of chatter, to an anime sequence, to a long sequence of The Bride trying to wiggle her toes. Talk about slow-paced. To add to that, it took 10-20 minutes before the final fight was finally set up. In other words, she was at the scene of the major fight, yet it took forever for the fight to begin. This first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was Robert Rodriguez editing the film.Tarantino also does this one-take shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene. And this happens twice. The movie is good, there is a good storyline, two jaw-dropping action scenes, good cast of characters(I fell in love with Gogo Yubari, and also the top assassin Elle Driver) and a shocking twist in the end, but overall I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 rather overrated. If there is one thing I love about the first part though, it has got to be the music, especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place. Now enter part 2.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is everything Vol. 1 wanted to be. Volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action, humor, excellent music, brilliant acting, and a very good ending. Volume 2 basically fills all the holes Volume 1 created, and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how The Bride became so skillful. Volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal, as the Bride has to deal with Budd, Elle, and of course, Bill, but gets a little more than what she bargained for. Elle Driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around, and Daryl Hannah (well-known as the mermaid in Splash) gives the best performance of the movie, as she portrays the ruthless, clever, unpredictable, and rage-filled rival assassin of The Bride. Her battle against the Bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 years.The second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together, and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing. This was the pure filming brilliance that I was expecting from Tarantino. Very few flaws in the movie, and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long, and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original, but it did not feel that way. There is not much more to say about the second part, except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade. Kill Bill overall is a great film, overrated, but a superb film nonetheless. Not the best I have seen this decade, but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years.

Quentin Tarantino: Back With a Vengeance!,"""Kill Bill"" is the long-awaited new offering by Quentin Tarantino.  Six years in the making, it attacks with no subtlety whatsoever.  Uma Thurman stars as the Bride, and amazes in this tale of vengeance.  Her battle against Go Go Yubari stands out among all the scuffling and bloodshed.  The movie bears one of Tarantino's trademarks, a non-linear story.  This gives Sonny Chiba's ""Revenge is not a straight line"" speech a certain significance.  Another of Tarantino's trademarks is graphic violence, and ""Kill Bill"" offers plenty, even more so than ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs.""  The battle in the House of Blue Leaves is especially gory!  After seeing the first half of Quentin's labor of love, all I can say is brace yourself for Volume 2!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bloody Good,"I just can't say enough good things about this movie. A real high octane thriller of a movie. Uma Thurman plays the Bride who after sleeping in a coma for 4 years after being left for dead, seeks revenge from her killers. Tarantino offers a visual feast leaving subtle clues in each scene to tell the story; Bills hanker chief with his name on it but you can't see him, Death list 5 already has a name scored off it. Nice wee touches like that. Its not as dialogue driven as his previous movies Its his bloodiest movie yet, more action orientated but its done so well and so blatantly over the top. There's also a Manga style cartoon to tell the origins of one of The Brides Nemesis' very over the top and violent and when it comes to the real life action, its just as over the top. The music is well picked and accompanies each scene perfectly. One of the tracks used was a piece of music Tarantino heard in a hotel lobby in Japan. Only Tarantino could choose so wisely. The movie is a homage to Japanese action movies; like Reservoir Dogs its not 100% original nonetheless it doesn't stop it being a relentless action packed treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

What looks great in anime (myself being an anime fan) translated poorly into Kill Bill. The animated part is pretty good but that's it.

It takes even more genius to get people to mindlessly spout off that this film is one of the best of the week, let alone the year.As I write this, Kill Bill volume 1 is ranked #115 of all-time.

This movie was a joke, while watching this i got a the feeling i recognized this type of movie, i had seen it before, after a while i remembered... Hot Shots! This movie reminds of the Hot Shots movies with everything exagurated. Most of the fightingscenes was just ridicoulus, this actress cant fight. She can act, but she cant fight like shes supposed to in this movie. Maybe the IMDB team should add comedy as genre too cuz i was laughing my a** of at many parts.. Offcourse.. i was only laughing at times when the movie was supposed to be serious. Heres a list of the good and the bad things about this movie.Bad:1) Bad fight scenes, though funny.2) Bad acting. (To bad for Tarantino atleast)3) Stupid plot.4) Stupid characters with eyepatches and Startrekoutfits.5) Boring, i was actually on my way out of the theater 2 times.6) Unbeleavably bad title. ""Kill Bill"" sounds like an indian cheef.Good:1) Tarantino made it.2) Good soundtrack.3) Nice way of telling the story, with chapters like a book.The overall feeling i have regarding the rates of this movie is that people have been waiting so long for the genious tarantino to make a new movie that whatever he would give us they will rate high. Maybe they feel that this movie has to be good, that its them who is the problem and not the movie in itself. Voting high and writing about how much of a masterpiece this movie is might make you people feel smart, but in my eyes you just prove the oposite.Personal rating: 5/10 (would have been 3 or less out of 10 but since its a work from Tarantino i gave it a little higher.)",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A Roaring Rampage Of Revenge or A Damp Squib ?,"How do you review a film that's a montage of so many others? You can look at Tarantino's works one of two ways either as a maverick genius re-cycling popular culture into exciting new forms or as a talent less hack ripping off the real masters of the form. I tend to be in agreement with the first, yes kill bill consistently references (and in some cases downright steals) from other movies but it is melded into something fresh and exciting. Who can fail to be exhilarated by the showdown at the house of blue leaves? Or raise a laugh at the dead pan humour? The other question mark is this a complete film or simply half of one? I would tend to view them as separate films with their own unique styles and feels with Vol 2 drawing more on Leone westerns than Vol 1's Shaw Brothers etc.Taranatino's visual and narrative tricks are brought to the fore, long tracking shots, some strange POV shots (through a bullet exit wound, the usual car trunk shot etc.) although the fetishistic shot of Uma Thurmans feet I could maybe have done without. The story is told in the non-linear segmented form that Tarantino has made an art of since reservoir dogs. The soundtrack is reminiscent of the variety of Pulp Fiction, he recognise sound as such an important part of the medium. The brides entrance to Tokyo is met by a theme that will surely now be remembered only for Kill Bill rather than its original TV series and is as an inspired choice as his choosing of the Delphonics for Jackie Brown and Dick Dale for Pulp Fiction.There are some drawbacks though there is very little of the razor sharp dialogue in this first instalment which before has always been a highlight of his films i.e. The banter between Jules and Vincent in pulp fiction or the Madonna discussion from Dogs, nothing here matches that but there's a reason for as this is a roaring rampage of revenge and in that it succeeds on every level. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Uma Thurman has really ugly feet,"At the time ""Kill Bill"" came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not payed any attention to ""details"". I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and ""fun"" is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a ""fanboy"". ""Kill Bill"" is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless. For movies like this one even ten is depreciation.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
2 very powerful moments,"Well, though having Tarantino atop the credits is something that helps, this movie has many details that make it much more than ""a good popcorn movie"".Let me just mention a couple. 2 very powerful ones.First, the japanese animation. Please, go again to the theater, wait for that scene, and then feel it: people there will be more stressed and involved, than in almost any other movie you can recall. (And, by the way, the simple way the director -not his name, him- put that scene into the story, deserves a point).Second: All the introductory sequence to the last scene --i.e. the way everybody walks in (was it a... restaurant?), Sofie's walk to the restrooms, people dancing... all that, with the 3-girls-band performance as a background, with that very music...--. Boy, that is a really powerful scene!The film of the century? Certainly not. But, believe me, it is a veeery good (popcorn) movie.I join the group: I want to see the 2nd part!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino smoked entire stash on this one!,"Whoa!  Was that one different!  A spaghetti western/japanese action/anime flick.  Although artful and unusual, the gratuitous violence was a bit much. Blood squirting 30 feet in the air?  Do these characters really have blood pressure of 10,000/9,000 or something?Non-linear story line just like Pulp fiction, but not as much story.  Plot was simplistic, much less convoluted than Pulp (I liked PF better). Uma kinda fits her part but doesn't look athletic enough to be the warrior she potrays.  Bill is like Charlie in Charlies angels.  Heard but not seen. Lucy Liu was an awesome cast job. Cool cinematography.  The weird interpersonal shorts are a Tarantino staple.  Will I pay to see Bill2? Maybe wait for dvd.  7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A letdown,"It's difficult for me to judge this movie. Did I like it? Yes. Is it a ""good"" movie? No. I really liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". Not very sure about ""Jackie Brown"". And ""From Dusk Till Down"" may be one of my all time favorites (directed by Robert Rodriguez, tough). But where does this movie fails? The problem is that it looks like a random mix of fight scenes taken from really bad Hong-Kong movies. The blood and guts look so fake and so funny that it can only be taken as a tribute to Monty Phyton's ""Holy Grail"". The plot, if any, is so narrow that we don't even know who those people are or why they are fighting about. I got tired of the action with no plot and my girlfriend got sick of watching that blinded violence. In the end, the film does not leave you anything.But why did I like it? Because it entertained me a lot. Because is a non-stop action movie. But, then again, a lot of b-class movies did the same. So, I will watch the second part; but for Tarantino this is his worst movie to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Fight porn,"Fight porn is what this movie is. Not a lot of dialogue, not much plot, not much character development, but plenty of money shots. The action is relentless so I'm sure a lot of people (read: guys) will love this movie. It is not a classic though. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were definitely better movies, as they had unforgettable characters and terrific dialogue, and great music too. This one has lots of swordplay and spurting blood. There are a few laughs along the way as well, with some interesting use of music, so it is a fair effort.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A poetic splatterfest,"As being one among many that waited quite impatiently for the release of 'Kill Bill Vol.1' being in less than well tempered expectation, hearing what buzz I could lend my ear to about what was to be of this film, When all was said and done I found this film both refreshing and disapointing at the same time. It seems that Tarantino has been plagued with heavy expectations from audiences ever since 'Pulp Fiction'. Just as most fans of 'Pulp Fiction', I keep hoping that somehow Quinten Tarantino could top that masterful achievement. But I have come to the conclusion that Tarantino found the right chemistry, actors, and ideas that put 'Pulp Fiction' in the category that many other films have been placed in. That rare film that becomes a classic against all original odds. 'The Godfather' would be a prime example of this. Francis Ford Coppola had little experience, he was in constant danger of being fired from the project, Al Pacino was bitterly hated by Paramount executives early on, Danny Thomas wanted to buy Paramount pictures so he could play himself as Don Vito Corleone, Studio executives constantly butted heads with Coppola on just about every detail, Time was rushed every day of the shoot back in 1971, and the budget was very tight. Nobody including Coppola himself ever expected that he would pull it off with anything less than b-film results. All is history now and 'The Godfather' has served as a blue print for countless projects that were to follow. Yet even more amazingly Coppola pulled it off again and did an even more impressive job with his handling of 'The Godfather pt. II'. The interesting point of this is that situations, examples like Coppola's two Godfather films and the success there of is seldom achieved. Of course who can argue with the success of other classic achievements as well like the films that George Lucas, Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg. That being said it is becoming tougher and tougher for rising new directors to cut a true place in the history of film now days. Then along comes Quinten Tarantino. A director who has made the unconventional-conventional. Just as Kubrick did with 'A clockwork orange' and '2001: A space odyssey', Tarantino achieved this with his first two outings. However in Kubrick's case as an example, most of his films have been percieved as classics and rightfuly so. Since the first two Godfather films and possibly 'Apocalypse now', Coppola hasn't made anything that has managed to reach those lofty hieghts since. These films are perfect examples of pure directorial magic. Once a director makes a strong impact in hollywood with an exceptional film, the gloves are off and the true challenge begins. That is to say-""can this guy top his opus?"". Perhaps 'Pulp Fiction' may remain tarantino's opus, perhaps not. But until then we have the refreshing talents of a cutting edge director to debate and marvel over. That being said...I held my excited expectations for 'kill Bill vol.1' to a minimum as best I could hoping for a real masterpiece and a true winner of a film. I bought my ticket and kept my fingers and toes crossed. As the film opened it seemed that my expectations might just get met. The opening credit sequence was absolutely wonderful! And from there on there was allot more magic. But the bottum line is that it was for the most part not the sort of magic that makes a movie a legend. what I saw was refreshing, exciting, and beautifuly executed. But yet there just seemed to be something missing. I pondered this for a minute at at time even as I watched the film further. I noticed alot that wasn't there. Allot less humor, less interesting characters, and over all allot less of what made 'Pulp Fiction' a classic. I left the theatre both fulfilled and dissapointed at the same time. Once I dedicated myself to expect both less and more from Tarantino and excepted the film on it's own terms, I went to see it again and really loved it. If you look at it as a whole the entire movie is a homage to everything from sleaze cinema to martial arts b-films, yet it never wavers in originality. I was particularly impressed with the animation sequence, it caught me totally be surprise, and let's be honest, how often do we see films anymore that can achieve the element of surprise with any real success? I think Tarantino deserves at least a peanut butter cup for that .Looking at it in one way I might feel compelled to suggest that perhaps 'Kill Bill vol 1' deserves four stars, on the other hand the whole affair still seems less impressive than a true classic. In my opinion critics should see this movie more than once before rendering any judgement. I would have originally have felt compelled to give this movie 2 1/2 stars, but the way I see it now anything less than three of them little twinklers would be a harsh example of poor criticism.See the movie twice and then throw your stones if need be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Modern Swords and Revenge Story,"Many people who watch the film Kill Bill Vol. 1 will see it as nothing more than an action film with no artistic value. However, anyone who has ever taken a film class or who has a genuine appreciation of the artistry and thought process which goes into the making of a film will quickly recognize that Kill Bill Vol. 1 is more than a simple action film. From the very beginning the film hooks the viewers' attention. This is not accomplished with elaborate fight scenes, car chases, or explosions. Rather, a simple blank screen and a few sound effects get the viewers attention in a way seldom accomplished.After the film's opening, the story proceeds in a nonlinear structure (in medias res) and tells the tale of Black Mamba a.k.a. The Bride (Uma Thurman,) thought to have been killed in the opening scene, who goes about getting her revenge on those who sought to kill her. Black Mamba spends a significant portion of the film seeking a sword which will not fail her in her quest for revenge. Almost as if she were King Author seeking the Holy Grail, Black Mamba travels to Japan to obtain a master crafted sword.The theme of swords being an ""honest killer's tool"" is seen over and over as Black Mamba walks through airports, and gets on plains with hers, and no one seeming to mind. Although a sword may not be a practical weapon for an assassin, they do have a period neutral feel that coincides with many of the film's period neutral costumes. Through a series of flashbacks, information is gradually filled in providing the viewer with the story leading up to the untimely demise (or so we thought) of Black Mamba in the film's opening scene. One by one Black Mamba gets her revenge on the individuals who sought to kill her, while at the same time, seeking information as to the whereabouts of her former lover and attempted murderer, Bill.The film is a period piece set in the late 1970's, or early 1980's which allows the film's creator (Quentin Tarantino) to give the film a very unique look. Many of the vehicles in the film are vintage to that time period; however, most of the character's costumes have a rather period neutral appearance to them. The occasional placement of an item from that time period provides interesting accents to the film without distraction from the films story.Costumes and props aside, Kill Bill Vol.1 has many artistic traits that make it more it appears. Some viewers may not care for the film's cliff-hanger ending; however, the climatic last question posed by Bill at the film's end allows the film to end on both a high and low note. Even a person who may not be interested in action movies should view the film and try to appreciate it for its artistic value, if not for its sword-fights.John Sellers",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest and most consistent film directors around (don't forget eccentric). This film is no exception of the high quality expected of his works. It is easily one of his most accessible films and an exciting cinematic piece of art. The premise is simple: The Bride undertakes an epic journey of revenge, having to defeat four professional assassins before reaching her ultimate prey, that is, Bill. You have to understand, Bill had his heart broken by her, and thus he had no choice but to slaughter her fianc√©, her fianc√©'s family, and of course, her as well (conveniently done by putting a bullet through her head). However, she miraculously survived and thus the stage is set for an ultimate tale engorged with spiteful vengeance. Honestly, I seriously doubted that I would derive any pleasurable enjoyment from this. It didn't quite sound like my cup of tea. But if you put morals aside (kids, revenge is bad), Kill Bill is a highly engrossing action-packed flick that never ceases to entertain.Uma Thurman delivers a spot-on performance as the main character, angst-filled and extremely frustrated, but equipped with fierce determination. This lady means business and you know better than to get involved when she starts wielding a samurai sword, chopping limbs and heads off as if it were second nature ‚Äì no, it's probably more like first nature. In Vol. 1, she faces two of the four assassins; but it is the second assassin, O-Ren Ishii played by Lucy Liu, which the majority of the film involves ‚Äì an anime-style flashback sequence of her childhood is ingeniously crafted.The highlight of the entire film is a lengthy fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's henchmen in a Japanese-style night club, reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded's battle with multiple Agent Smiths. It is epic. Beautifully choreographed and shot, I was unable to draw my eyes away from one of the most spectacular fight sequences I've seen. Unfortunately, The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's showdown at the end was overshadowed by this sequence; extremely disappointing but considering the rest, forgivable.This is also easily one of the top three most violent, bloody and gory films I've seen. For those with weak stomachs, stay far away from this one. It is a film that glorifies the aestheticization of violence from start to finish; I wasn't able to appreciate the violent extremeness as much as other viewers or critics ‚Äì which I suspect is a good thing; I haven't been fully desensitised yet ‚Äì but I do understand the reason it is called stylish art. Despite being unnerving, at times it was very pretty to watch (ah, what has our generation come to, describing excessive violence as 'pretty' and 'stylish'?).The film pays multiple homages to different film genres and cultures, the most apparent in Vol. 1 being Japan with samurai swords and Japanese dialogue prevalent. Tarantino's films always contain the right music, the soundtrack never failing to invoke the particular emotion he wants to draw from the audience, usually nerve-wrecking suspense, thrill and shocking excitement. When the credits came rolling on, I was a bit thrown off at the abrupt ending, even feeling rather cheated; that's it? Then I remembered this is just Vol. 1. Needless to say, I was ready and eager for Vol. 2. Bring it on, Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Thank You,"What a rush! As a fan of Exploitation pictures for many years, I greatly enjoyed this homage to all things groovy. Part of the rush for me is seeing a filmmaker adapting and allowing work that his influenced him to take new form. From the opening Shaw Bros. logo, we know we are on the cinematic equivalent of 42nd Street and it's time to get our film freak on. Eastern Kung Fu flicks dominated this stretch (alongside the soft and hardcore sex flix, natch)and this is a wonderful period of cinematic excess from which to draw.For me, KB is about nobility of purpose. Both dark and white sides of an code of honour that binds all creatures. Plus having a candy-coated shell of excess and style to shelter this theme. The best B movies have this going for them. If you can educate and entertain at the same time, you have a rare opportunity.KB does both with equal gusto. You really need to be up on your 'grindhouse' to dig all of the things QT has going on in KB. As a fan and a filmmaker I was thrilled at seeing The RZA, Master Ping and the calibre of KNB involved with this production. You know these guys are fans, artists and constant. Stellar performances from all involved on-screen and behind the camera. Tech. credits are super-solid.As far as movies go, for me, KB is the kung-fu artploitation film of the decade. Nothing touches it. I can't wait for KB2 and hope that QT is happy with his final work. This fanboy is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Wow,what an overblown complete mess of a movie.","This is art ? Give me a break.If QT wanted to accomplish something remotely close to what I feel he was trying to do he should have viewed the old "" Man Without a Name "" trilogy.As it is,this movie is pretty damn horrible.The scenes jump around like an A.D.D. MTV Rap Video geared to fans of old "" chop socky movies "" with alot of gore.The main characters arent even likable.Uma Thurman as an ex-hitman ? Lordy,that's not even CLOSE enough to be CONSIDERED palatable.The three things I feel really killed this movie were as follows : 1 - Hitmen are not the most emotionally exorbitant people in the world.If someone did plan revenge on a fellow colleague the whole world wouldnt know about it until they were already stone cold dead.It's not believable that a professional killer would change tactics REGARDLESS of what happened to him/her.Not too logical or efficient. 2 - There is no way in hell anyone outside of Japanese heritage would EVER run the Yakuza.Period.ESPECIALLY a woman..unless there was an emergency,as when Shindo's ane-san ( his wife ) took over for him while he was in jail. This is as ridiculous as when Daredevil featured a Black man as the Kingpin of Crime.This isnt a racial statement people,it's just that the criminal element doesnt mix race or gender very well.It's kind of like a white guy running a Jamaican Drug cartel.Never happen on this planet....3- She sat in a guy's car ( the guy she killed ) for 13 hours yet the cops didnt come outside to look at the car after they found the two bodies ? Sure,sure,and I'm the King of England.Give me a break.How this bad of a movie could crack the top 100 blows the mind.Then again,considering the lack of widespread intelligence in the world it shouldnt surprise me.Some much for morality and good taste.The difference between Kung Pow and this movie ?

Good points are few but UMA isn't totally worthless and some of the dialogue is actually quite clever but those points don't make a movie especially when QT tries to cram everything into it even a lame manga segment.

"Another empty Weinstein marketing coup, a truly depressing movie","Why is everyone ecstatic about this B karate/gore movie? I have tried to watch it several times and I have never been able to watch more than 20 minutes of it each time. No dialogs, a cigarette thin plot, gratuitous B violence, pompous artsy fartsy camera angles completely meaningless... Well, they actually serve a purpose for the director who keeps reminding the audience: ""look guys where I put the camera, I'm a genius, see, admire me!"". As a matter of fact if it wasn't for the weird camera angles this would be a pretty plain bad film instead of a pompous bad film. Filming dialog from the top of a tree or from underneath the soles of the actors' shoes is nothing to get excited about. This is not what cinema is about. This is advertising making. This is a film for brainwashed TV addicts who confuse ad making and film making. A very depressing film experience, I refuse to endorse just because so many ignorants got thrilled by it, just because they have never seen anything worthy before. Another pathetic Miramax contribution to the history of cinema. The Weinstein Brothers are the kings of marketing. Thank God history won't remember the Weinstein Brothers.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
anime fan heaven,"Well I reviewed this title on my website some years ago, here I paste my original review because I think this movie deserves it: This movie is like watching a Live-Action Japanese animation. And no, I'm not just talking about the animated sequence by Production I.G (Ghost int eh Shell). I'm talking about the ENTIRE movie. I strongly recommend Kill Bill to everyone, both movies but mostly volume 1 and mostly to anime lovers. Besides the samurai feeling and the Japanese animation tribute, there are many reasons why an otaku may enjoy this:1) Character names: Curious little detail. Tarantino is taking some names right from a well known Japanese Video game company called SNK. First, when the movie is about to begin and the credits are rolling, we see one of the producers ""Goro Daemon"" (Goro Daemon is a character from the popular video game King of Fighters) Then at the movie we have ""Hattori Hanzo"" (Ninja from the ""Samurai Shodown"" video games)2) Uma Thurman's yellow outfit is obviously a tribute to Bruce Lee. Great way to honour a Kung-Fu legend if you ask me, very well done.3) Gogo Yubari: Teenage schoolgirls with powerful weapons that become fierceless warriors? Come on, THAT was invented by Japanese animators. Name any manga or anime you want, you'll have at least one of those girls. Tarantino you earned an A+ (btw, Tarantino contacted Chiaki Kuriyama for the role after watching her at battle royale, cult cinema film)4) Sword fights, positions, movements, Samurai honour. A visual delight for people that enjoy watching traditional samurai movies and animes like Rurouni Kenshin 5)The blood and ""violence"": If you like Gore (Perfect Blue, Genocyber) You'd like Kill Bill. Blood in the movie looks fake enough not to become disgusting, but at the same time real enough not to become ridiculous. Perfect balance.So as you can all see, I really liked this movie and think that no otaku should miss it. I love Japanese culture and I'm an Uma Thurman fan. Luckily, Tarantino is fan of both things as well so this movie just rocks.Not an anime fan?? don't care. Watch it anyways, this movie is so fantastic that it has a little bit for everyone. One of my favourite films, if not THE favourite one. Don't miss it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Just spectacular...,"Quentin Tarantino has made an amazing movie with Kill Bill, and for me, has surpassed the likes of his earlier masterpieces, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  I can't give this film high enough praise for it's wonderful homage to violence and the kung fu genre.  Each scene has its own personality, and every slash of the sword made my smile bigger.  It was almost like watching a live action anime movie, it was that incredible.  Uma Thurman is great, and I was never really a huge fan before this.  Jeez...movie experiences just don't get too much better.  There was enough style in this movie to feed a continent!  I can't wait for Kill Bill 2, because things are gonna go down that I do not want to miss!  I used to be skeptical to the lady hero, but after seeing this film, I'm a different man.

more fictitious than I expect,"this movie in certain sense, is cool. excellent fight scenes that the R-Rating grants him, the topic in general. the only thing that I find ridiculous it is that they are too exaggerated when The Bride cuts him the arm, head or other parts from the body to its opponents, they are so fictitious that they bother.In the version DVD, you can appreciate all the combat scenes better, especially that of Tokyo, a tip that I read in a magazine that the version of Kill Japanese Bill (Region 3) the this scene of Tokyo lasts more and he/she comes to color, while we have to see it in B/W.David Carradine after Kung-ugh it continued making and playing very good movies like these. Today (12 June 2005) it will be used for the first time in TV for Latin America for HBO who have not seen it, syntonize it (I am already making propaganda that such) and good, I add that Kill Bill 2 are better than the first one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino just gets better and better,"Quentin Tarantino has always claimed to love Japanese films and watching his prior works reflects this, only now has he completely taken the genre he loves and given it the Hollywood treatment and it really works. The Japanese cartoon sequence, in particular, showing the history of O-Ren was beautifully done and a lovely tribute to the culture that Tarantino owes the influence for the film. Throughout the films are various other acknowledgements and references to the Japanese film industry.Uma Thurman, whom I never really have liked much, completely won me over with her performance as The Bride. She was all too aware that she had been cast as the 'superhero' and relished in it and clearly had fun living up to all stereotypes.The fight choreography in this film was amazing, totally convincing and thrilling to watch. The scene in which The Bride takes out the entire Crazy 88 is breathtaking, the choreographer must have spent ages working that out and the final product is worth the price of admission in itself.Someone who caught my eye in this film was Chiaki Kuriyama; she was amazing as O-Ren's bodyguard GoGo Yubari. For someone who was handed a ball and chain and told to master it in just three months she looked completely at ease with it and used it with great confidence. I hope to see more of her in Hollywood.I have to mention the use of blood in this film too. The way it sprays out instead of trickling is pure Tarantino at his best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Action, Humor","What is there to say? This is obviously an homage to all b-movies, especially to the actor, Bruce Lee.  The yellow jumpsuit, the Cato outfits, the philosophical dialogue.  The humor was excellent but was not force-fed like every movie nowadays.  The action sequences are well choreographed and are actually fresh and new for once instead of bullet-time or just guns in general.  Compared to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this is right up there in my opinion. I respect everyone's opinions except for those that come from crass critics; they have probably been nose-deep in trash for so long that they forgot what a good movie is like. This movie is not going to make you scratch your head; its just great fun with humor if you can stomach spewing blood and the occasional decapitation. I recommend:.:Cowboy Bebop:.if you can watch anime, this is very close to the style and characters of Kill Bill. This isn't Dragon Ball Z or Pokemon anime though; if you watch the first 5 episodes of Cowboy Bebop, you'll swear Kill Bill is a prelude to Cowboy Bebop.

"It just wasn't good, clear and simple","I wrote a previous review on how Zatoichi the blind swordsman was way more superior then this film. I have to say I wish I wrote a better review since I was just trashing QT's work. Just to let everyone know, I like Tarantino's work and I love what he writes, but as I said in my other review for Zatoichi, There is a real thin line between Borrowing and complimenting a scene. Tarantino in the past has been accused of being too much of a plagiarizer. The plot of Reservoir dogs did borrow from City on fire and the black suits actually derived from John Woo's A Better Tomorrow 2. I can forgive that because Tarantino filmed them at a different pace and kind of rhythm were he took his time to give his characters detail and life. Kill Bill unfortunately did not carry any of that.One of my biggest problems was Uma Thurman; she couldn't act worth a damn in the film. She said she tried imitating Clint Eastwood as she tries to invoke her toughness for the Bride. Heres the thing, Clint Eastwood looks tough and is convincing as a tough guy. Uma is a lanky woman who looks like she's worried about breaking her nails rather than busting any heads. The dialog was repulsive, I suppose people will tell me that he was trying to make it like those cheesy action films with the catchy yet corny one liners. He does do that and it is even more cheesy. Back then the writers were not trying to make it funny, they were serious about the dialog and even though its corny, at the time it wasn't to them.My next big problem was O-ren Ishii, she just didn't convince me that she could rise to the ranks of head yakuza boss of the Japanese underworld. Her henchmen are also laughable and even unconvincing as Japanese as well. Have you noticed the Japanese actors performance are a little exaggerated and a bit too fakish? I think QT should've made O-ren into a man and he should've been played by Tadanobu Asano, an actor who can make a more convincing villain.The next complaint is the violence, note this: I like watching action films that have well done and well shot violent sequences so I don't have a problem with violence on film. The problem with the violence in kill bill is that it really looks fake and dull. The part were Lucy liu slices the head of that one Yakuza and you see the blood shoot out like a sprinkler was not jaw dropping. Please know that I'm aware of films like Lone wolf and cub and also Ichi the killer, but those films let the blood shoot out and paint the entire screen red!! QT was holding back on the violence and I was so angry at the black and white sequence which was really stupid and doesn't live up to the brutality of films like ""Battle Royale"", ""The Street Fighter"", and ""Riki-oh: The story of Ricky"". He held back and made the action very tame. This is a tame action film in comparison to action giants like John Woo or Tsui hark.QT also tried involving a Western element in the film, most notably adding music from ennio morricone, a man no stranger to Spaghetti Westerns. I like the music but was unnecessary for these type of scenes, even though I think they would have worked better in a John Woo film then kill Bill.All around the movie is a mess and as a movie fan I can tell you just exactly what films he was borrowing from:Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs Delinquent Boss Girl: Worthless to confess Fudoh The Game of death Lone Wolf and cub Ichi the Killer A Better Tomorrow 2 Rainy Dog ZatoichiI know that most people would say that he is paying homages to these films and is sort of advertising them to the western audiences. The problem is these homages don't live up to these films brutality of violence and the emotional depth these characters feel when committing acts of violence. Maybe I should stop slamming QT but I just can't help myself, the movie was just not good and is slapped together with a bunch of scenes of other movies that did the scene way better then this one did.why not just watch the original films to begin with then looking at a picture collage?If I have to recommend a good movie from QT just watch Inglourios Basterds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's best...,"I waited for this film for a very long time and the final product went above my highest expectations. This film is a masterpiece in every sense of that word. Its unique and people who say its a ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" rip-off are totally wrong. This film still has the 'Tarantino Feel' to it and its done by music as well as the dialogues, humour and the time shifting storyline. However, even though 'Kill Bill"" holds this Tarantino 'trademark' its a film totally different from the likes of 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs'. Tarantino, once again picked Uma Thurman, a move which proved to be so decisive. Her presence is felt by the audience and I think she is just brilliant. ""Kill Bill' wouldn't be as good without her. She must surely get an Oscar for that performance.The fighting sequence is unbelievable. The agent fight in 'Matrix Reloaded"" looks silly when compared to this, especially that ""Kill Bill"" one uses hardly any CGI's. When I left the cinema after seeing it my friend said to me that the film would be better if the main character was male. I think the fact that its a female contributed to the film and made it more unique. Besides, I dont think that there is anyone that could replace Uma Thurman, she was born for that role! Some people might not like it because its too violent but the this violence is intentionally presented in a comical way. MASTERPIECE! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I can't even write a decent review for this.,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't even write up much of a review for this,..putting effort into this would be about as likely as the effort put forth making this movie,...very little. I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but this movie was appallingly bad. I know it was supposed to be a BIT campy,but this was too much. Mediocre acting, bad script, middle of the road to bad sp. effects, and over all so completely unbelievably,.....bad. Def. in the top 10 worst modern movies I've ever had the displeasure to sit thru. I'll avoid the next parts like the plague. And to think each actor and actress in this movie (barring the nickle and dime part players)are much better than they showed in this work. And Tarantino is also much better than this failure would lead us to believe. Go figure.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino comes back with a BANG!,"this is gonna be a two person review by Clo and Moo. We're just sitting together so we might as well review like our favourite movie. Background info: Kill Bill follows The Bride, a former assassin who worked for a man named Bill. The film commences on her wedding day, when Bill and the rest of the Deadly Vipers squad ambush the ceremony and leave The Bride for dead. She returns from a coma to get revenge on every person who wronged her, especially Bill. Hence the name 'Kill Bill'.Moo: Kill Bill wasn't awful. It's a definite favourite on my end, even though there are some faults and flaws to the movie so it isn't really worth a 10.Clo: I'm a huge Tarantino fan, and let's just say I wasn't disappointed with this. This movie is definitely violent (not for little kids!) but it's awesome for the older set. Not quite as good as Pulp Fiction, but definitely on a par with Reservoir Dogs.Moo: Yeah..straight from the QT fan there. Hehe I've never seen anything else except for the Kill Bill movies from QT, but to me I really appreciated the fake violence. Some people might complain, but the violence (like spurting blood) really made it seem like an epic cartoon parody which is, of course, uber fun. Unreality rocks. But there are some parts of the storyline that take away from the film. There's no point saying what because I'd get blacklisted! :)Clo:That's all for now! I definitely recommend this film. However, if you are disgusted with violence or gore, this is NOT your thing.Moo: But it's a great thing for a Saturday night with friends. It's actually fun for all the dramaticness.

Kill Bill: A Stylish and Electrifying Ode to Revenge,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is a cinematic tour de force that blends homage, style, and raw emotion into a blood-soaked masterpiece. Split into two volumes, this epic tale of revenge follows The Bride, portrayed with fierce intensity by Uma Thurman, on her quest to seek vengeance against those who wronged her.From the very first frame, ""Kill Bill"" grabs the audience by the throat and never lets go. Tarantino's trademark storytelling prowess is on full display, weaving together a narrative that is as intricate as it is brutal. The film's non-linear structure keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, as they piece together The Bride's past and present in a thrilling and suspenseful journey.Uma Thurman delivers a career-defining performance as The Bride, a character who is both vulnerable and deadly, seeking redemption and closure amidst a sea of violence and betrayal. Her physicality and emotional depth bring a gravitas to the role that is truly captivating, making The Bride a formidable force to be reckoned with.The supporting cast is equally exceptional, with standout performances from Lucy Liu as the icy and formidable O-Ren Ishii, David Carradine as the enigmatic Bill, and a host of memorable characters who each bring their own unique flair to the story. The film's colorful cast of characters adds layers of complexity and intrigue to an already rich and vibrant world.Visually stunning and stylistically bold, ""Kill Bill"" is a feast for the eyes and ears. Tarantino's signature blend of homage, pastiche, and originality creates a cinematic experience that is as visually distinctive as it is emotionally resonant. The film's use of music, choreography, and cinematography all contribute to a sense of heightened reality that is both exhilarating and immersive.What truly sets ""Kill Bill"" apart is its unapologetic embrace of violence and revenge as themes that are central to the human experience. The film delves deep into the psyche of its characters, exploring the consequences of their actions and the price of vengeance in a world where morality is a gray area. It challenges the audience to confront their own beliefs about justice, redemption, and the nature of power.In conclusion, ""Kill Bill"" is a 9/10 cinematic triumph that showcases Quentin Tarantino at the height of his storytelling powers. With its unforgettable performances, stylish visuals, and emotional depth, this film is a testament to the power of cinema to provoke, entertain, and enlighten. ""Kill Bill"" is a bold and audacious work of art that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, a testament to the enduring legacy of a true cinematic visionary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Cool homage to Asian cinema with a classic soundtrack,"I watched this movie again for the first time in well over 10 years. The last time I seen it I was still a teenager and probably wouldn't have been able to appreciate it as much. This time around, I really enjoyed it and surprisingly remembered a lot of the scenes which to me says that these have become a classic. So much of this movie such as scenes and music are reused in modern cinema and in general internet memes.Although the ultra-violence may not be for everyone, it's hard to deny that a lot of the scenes are very cool, the main one coming to mind is Lucy Liu walking into the restaurant / club with her Crazy 88 gang. I believe that in many years to come, this movie will be regarded as a classic with its soundtrack and how well it blended Asian cinema and American cinema. The story and characters are fantastic as well as the martial arts inspired action sequences.I gave this an 8 because not only did I really enjoy the movie and the soundtrack, but I could see myself watching this movie countless times again in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"If you like hard and real action movies, then you should definitely watch this movie.","There are many revenge films, but plenty of them tend to focus only on the surface of the revenge theme and not go deeper. However, Quentin Tarantino's film ""Kill Bill"" is completely different from such films, there is a strong atmosphere of revenge. The director skillfully combined two elements of animation and video, resulting in a powerful visual effect and a multi-line narrative structure brought to perfection.""Kill Bill"" vividly shows the directorial style of Quentin Tarantino, namely cruelty. According to the script, the hired killer Beatrix Kiddo, aka 'Black Mamba', is shot by the head of their criminal gang Bill. The shot was in the head. Beatrix had very little chance of surviving. Before that, representatives of this clan had humiliated her in the chapel of '2 pines'. These are Vernita Green, Ellie Driver, Sophie, and O-Ren-Ishii. After some time, the Black Mamba miraculously ""resurrected"" decides to take revenge. After all, she believes that her child, whom she was carrying under her heart at that moment, was also killed. Bill's baby.Black Mamba decides to take revenge, following the principle: 'an eye for an eye'. Her mission: find everyone who humiliated her, maybe kill them. Find Bill as your most important task and kill him.The first stunning element of the film is its clear and ingenious stylization. Every frame imperceptibly quotes the classics of Asian cinema, the musical accompaniment is perfect for the video sequence. Robert Richardson's cinematography in the film is so brilliantly beautiful that the film gives considerable aesthetic pleasure even in scenes of violence.Another thing that struck me about the film was the acting. Uma Thurman, the muse of the great Tarantino, played her best role in the noughties in this picture. Black Mamba in her performance is both a beautiful and dangerous goddess of revenge.This film is not only about the heroine's revenge process, in fact it is a film about the killers' past. The effect of the black-and-white film, presented at the beginning, enhances the ""composure"" that the opening clip wants to express, creating a confrontation between light and darkness through the high contrast of black and white.Another way of expressing confrontation is the symmetrical composition of the heroine's revenge. In the process of confrontation between Vernita, the black killer, and Beatrix, was formed a conflict and the daughter of Vernita, who returned home on the school bus, was able to resolve this conflict for a short time. This moment actually increases the tension of the film, forcing it to develop in the direction of emotion and love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"0,5","Let's start from the actors. We have Uma Thurman (a great role for her to display her ""power""), we have the recently deceased David Carradine getting a chance to shine one more time. Than we have Michael Madsen, who only seems to really act, when Tarantino directs him (yes there is the small role in Thelma & Louise, but apart from that?). We have Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox. Great women, that Tarantino let's loose in this movie. Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie, but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being, what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present), we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she's doing. Still the promised long cut (Vol. 1 and 2 put together as one movie), is still absent and might never see the light of day. It's a shame, because quite a few things were promised. But then again, the ""Grindhouse"" experience hasn't hit home cinemas either ... we'll keep on waiting then ...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Heavy on style and low on substance.,Just can't really say how baffled i am at the praise piled onto this film which never really gets any higher than a tribute to spaghetti westerns and kung fu films. What little bit of plot that you do have is simple and just used as a tool to bring you to the next homage from QT. You can't really judge this film on the acting either since it is a tribute to films that really aren't known for acting and KB 1 surely doesn't break the mold. The blood shooting out like a fountain was funny the first time but becomes increasingly absurd after it was shown over and over. The action scenes aren't and are shot very well. The film certainly isn't lacking style but unfortunately substance is sorely lacking. If that is your taste great but if not Kill Bill isn't for you.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"""You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage...""","Few directors have established such an instantly recognizable style as Quentin Tarantino. Despite having only released a handful of works, any of them can be immediately marked as a Tarantino film by any of his trademark cinematic traits: the stylized dialogue, the edgy cinematic techniques and the macabre yet perversely entertaining violence. Having remained under the radar for a few years after having shaken the film industry by storm and spawned countless imitators in the early 1990s, in 2003, Tarantino was back with a bang with arguably his most visceral and gruesomely entertaining work to date - Kill Bill: Volume One.Using the simplest of story lines as a template for his latest bloodbath, Tarantino paints his story of an assassin gunned down at her wedding seeking revenge against the perpetrators with an operatic splendour, utilizing all of his usual trademarks with pitch-perfect intensity. With a stylized script providing some of the most quotable lines since Pulp Fiction and coy experimentation with narrative form, taking note and paying tribute to his usual multitude of nationalities and genres, from 1970s Japanese Samurai films (which the entire film is structured in the mould of), to convoluted classic french narrative, to continual innovations and experimentations in cinematic technique (with use of ""chapters"", freeze frames, eclectic cinematography and interludes to Japanese anime or black and white) Tarantino is at the top of his masterful game. The film's typically quirky musical score, making use of everything from classical samurai film themes to Nancy Sinatra to original works composed by independent artist The RZA proves an odd compilation that exquisitely captures the bizarre and endlessly captivating essence of the film.Similarly, no film would pulse with the essence of Tarantino without copious use of violence, which Kill Bill: Volume One delivers in spades. While the mayhem is overdone to an almost comical extent (with dismembered henchmen spouting torrents of blood oddly enough harking back to Monty Python) several moments evoke such brutal and visceral intensity that even the most jaded viewers are likely to cringe. However, Tarantino similarly displays his uncanny talent to draw dark humour out of the most unlikely situations, wonderfully counterbalancing the very real emotional tension with unlikely humour, such as a room full of maimed bodies moaning in a zombie-like dirge. In the midst of the mayhem, it is easy to forget how hilarious the film can be. However, the superb fight choreography (in particular the staggering half hour final showdown) is breathtaking and astonishing in its intricate bloody splendour, crafting some of the most elaborate and intensely engaging sword fight scenes in cinema history.Despite the jaw-dropping technical work and masterfully crafted script, Tarantino's film really comes to life through the incredible performances of his cunningly assembled cast. Giving a career best performance, Uma Thurman is nothing less than flat out mesmerizing as the initially nameless Bride. Diving into her performance with such raw intensity and extracting every last iota of emotion from the part, Thurman's powerhouse of a performance is the beating heart which keeps the film throbbing with life, carrying both the audience's sympathies and enthralled enthusiasm with her every step of the way. Similarly, Lucy Liu is enormously impressive as a smoothly psychotic assassin turned mob boss, and watching her calm veneer melt into a captivating pillar of exposed fury is one of the film's most terrifying moments. Daryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox each enthrall given their moments to shine as two of The Bride's former fellow assassins, as does Julie Dreyfus as Liu's oily second in command. Character actor Sonny Chiba is a delightful yet dignified presence as a mysterious retired swordsmith, and Chiaki Kuriyama resonates with power as likely the deadliest 'schoolgirl' ever beheld on celluloid. Seen only in a brief cameo setting up his role for the sequel, Michael Madsen nonetheless makes a strong impression as an introspective assassin, and David Carradine is spellbinding as the never seen Bill, his silky voice winding itself around his lines like the deadly viper his assassination squad is named after - one of the most effective villains never to expose their face.Easily Tarantino's strongest, most visceral and ceaselessly stylish work since Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill: Volume One's dialogue, truly stunning cinematic style and technical work and myriad of tremendous performances (especially the astonishing Thurman) cement it as one of the most effortlessly innovative and impeccably masterful films of the decade. The effect of Kill Bill is truly astonishing; even after multiple viewings, the initial reaction of gut-level shock and awe at Tarantino's tremendous daring and perverse genius never wanes. Stylish, sadistic, cathartic fun - not for the faint of heart, but for those capable of stomaching it, Kill Bill is near peerless.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Why?,"Ok well i went to see this movie the day after it came out. im sorry to say it was one of the worst movies since the master of disguise. im sorry but the only thing worse then computer generated fight scenes are unrealistic ones. the fight seen in which she comes for Lucy Lui and had to battle her ""entourage"" made me want to walk out. it was one of the worst fight scenes i had seen since the matrix reloaded. now the blood i also found incredibly stupid. when u stab sumone u dont bleed like that nor is it cool to make sumone appear to bleed that way. Now the fight seen with Vivica was very good up until the part where she shot out of the cereal box. Uma was so dead it wasnt even funny, then she magically pulls a knife out of nowhere and kills her right as her daughter walks in. But through all of this i could have lived, but the part of the movie that made me want to throw my extra large bucket of popcorn at the screen was the scene in the ""pussy wagon"" in which she insisted on ""moving her big toe."" now i dont care who you are u cannot go from a coma to a fully functional body in a day much less a few hours.

Tarantino delivers another devilishly good film experience and proves he can bring his own style to a revenge film that purposely cuts back on substance.,"Yes, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a definite exercise in style over substance, but this isn't just anybody's style, this is Tarantino's style and what a style to possess. If his preceding film, Jackie Brown in 1997-98, was all characters and attention to detail spanning over two hours then Kill Bill is him letting his hair down and giving us an out and out visual-fest of colour, effects and violence delivered in double quick time; well, double quick compared to Jackie Brown and its brilliant study. But Tarantino had proved his worth when it came to out and out substance in films. His attention to a love story and character development in Jackie Brown came after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, two of my favourite films told with such confidence and in such an entertaining way, the latter of which has since embedded itself into modern folklore, is stone wall proof that he can do it when he wants.It's not that Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is an example of Tarantino not wanting to do what he can do, but more so a relaxation of complicated and developed films with narratives about realistic people. Yes, you can deem Pulp Fiction complicated even though it has inspired countless other films because there are some people even now that, on a first viewing when not familiar with the genre and influences, cannot fathom how one character can be alive at the end even though he shouldn't be.On first view the film does come across as a flat out adventure, a one lined journey about one person in a routine revenge narrative driven film. But it's this familiar template that Tarantino's uses to place his own unique touches that he is so able to bring to a piece of text. If Pulp Fiction was so memorable, it was so for bringing life into an old genre full of stereotypes as noted by many. Here, Tarantino brings his own breath of fresh air or style to the well worn start revenge flick. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with the sort of introduction you might not expect from Tarantino, certainly not from the very opening. There is no long tracking shot of a static woman on a moving walkway or guys calmly sitting around a table discussing Madonna. Instead we get black and white, panting and a bloodied woman whose image is juxtaposed by the calm and methodical speech from a man named Bill (Caradine). A few lines of dialogue pass and the woman is shot in the head.What develops is a revenge film as told from this woman's point of view, The Bride (Thurman), a nameless (for now) antihero on a mission that will see her have to undergo a process as she plots her way to the ultimate goal of revenge. What's great about the revenge process from this position and similarly so in one of my favourite films entitled Payback, is that the antihero lead has just about nothing to loose and thus, they go about their mission in just about the most ruthless and unforgiving way possible. Their enemies think they're dead; they accept they've been to Hell and back and nothing else could be as bad as their prior tragedy and they go hell for leather in trying to attain the status of 'even'.The Bride visits Vernita Green (Fox) after treading through some child's toys on a lawn, mise-en-scene that leads the audience to realise it is a house that inhabits a child. Vernita opens the door and there is a flashback (a Tarantino trademark) before a fight erupts immediately placing the audience in another juxtaposed situation: this woman whose been shot in the head and has been through Hell versus one of her enemies who it now seems has a young child. There is a brief fight before Vernita's child's bus stops outside and, echoing the tactic in Reservoir Dogs during the ear scene, there is a break in proceedings further plunging the audience into a realm of either frustration or unfamiliarity. How many other films would have finished the fight and ignored the 'pit-stop' routine? Tarantino re-announces his style from here and continues throughout in a barrage of memorable scenes.But Kill Bill is really a furtherance in feminism. The entire assassination gang, bar Budd (Madsen), are female and the sexually active male nurse in The Bride's hospital wing gets his just deserts from said strong, independent female lead who takes no prisoners. A similar scene happens during a flashback scene involving the female Japanese character of Gogo (Kuriyama) who asks the question 'who is penetrating who now?' as she kills another potentially sexually active male in a similarly nasty manner.The film builds to a climax that certainly delivers but not after delivering flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks when introducing Lucy Lui's O-Ren Ishii. The character of Bill is kept out of shot al√° Marcellus Wallace and talks Elle Driver (Hannah) out of killing The Bride while she's still in a coma because it's not the 'honourable' thing to do; while clutching a Samurai sword which of course epitomises the ideal of honour amongst ancient Japanese warriors. Volume 1's final fight scene is all guts and gore but the images are juxtaposed with pinball noises and ten pin's clattering as the light and colouring changes brilliantly and dramatically, although my favourite touch is Sophie's (Dreyfus) ringtone which is 'Auld Lang Syne', a song that includes the lyric 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?'. The Bride's reply would probably be a resounding 'No'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Impressive Style and Substance,"The clearest indicators for how much I like a movie are these two things; how many times I can watch it in a short time period, without it losing its appeal, and the number of things in a movie that I think could be changed or removed in order to make it better. The first volume of Kill Bill does better in those aspects than any other movie I've ever seen.This is the best representation of what I feel are Tarantino's best qualities as a writer and director, with not a glimmer of the (admittedly minor) problems I can have with him. The soundtrack is stylish, cool, and fits every scene like a glove. The action shifts tone from brutally realistic, to gloriously over-the-top, while always perfectly complimenting the story being told. The cast is perfect. The characters are memorable. The story is simple, but effective, and the manner in which it is told only serves to enhance it.There's no other way to say it, I simply love the movie.

Most of the baddies in this are not actors, they are genuine kung fu fighters and kick boxers.

expected a bit more,"The movie wasn't what I expected it to be. It missed some essential elements, the dialogue and the subtle transition between the songs. A part of this is compensated by the cartoon and Japanese martial art, shown in a way which isn't very common for Hollywood productions. The excessive use of blood in the movie makes it very clear that what you are viewing isn't real. Previous movies of Tarrentino are more realistic thus having a bigger impact. But, the use of this much blood gives it an new edge. Watching this movie inspires me to view a Japanese martial art movie, since this must have been a big inspiration for Tarrentino.When reading the different comments I get the impression everybody likes the movie because `Tarrentino' made it. I wonder if everybody likes this movie this much if it were produced by somebody else.It's a good movie, and you should certainly go and view it.

My only semi-negative about the film is that some of the fight scenes seemed a little Matrix-ish at first, but then the ""lights out"" effects won my attention back for the 9 seconds it was away.

A good disappointment,"It is not easy to interpret my summary, and I actually have the same feeling after watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1.I had very big expectations to this new Tarantino movie, I had hoped it would be just as good as Pulp Fiction. It was maybe a bit much to expect, but you should not expect less from such a talented director.The actors chosen for this movie are chosen wisely, I really like Uma Thurman, she has ""it"" as Bobby Bowfinger calls it. It is hard to describe what it is, but it us a combination of personality and talent. The rest of the cast was also good, but Uma Thurman is especially a fantastic experience.The action is good too, but it is actually a problem. Tarantino seems to be obsessed with impressive fight scenes, so he forgets to get flow in the story. At the same time I must admit that I am not a fan of the fight scenes used in ""Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I prefer fight style ala Indiana Jones with fists, it is much more cool. It is maybe not as artistic, but it is how fight scenes should be.Another Tarantino obsession is blood, and I actually like the use of blood as in Pulp Fiction or the Verhoeven style, but the use of blood in this movie was more like the Monty Python style, and it does not work in the long run in this movie. I could laugh a few times because of the extreme use of blood, but it could not keep the comical element for all 111 minutes.As you can read from my review, I was not as pleased as I had hoped. The movie was without doubt beautifully made, but the plot was maybe a bit too thin and the story moved too slowly. Despite all this the movie deserves 7/10, but do not expect this to be a classic like Pulp Fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"I don't care who directed the movie, it still stunk.",I heard a lot of hype over the release of this movie.  The previews and commercials promised heavy kung-fu action in a charlies angels fashion. What I ended up with was a movie heavy on the vulgar language filled with short moments of violence for shock value only.  Other things that didn't sit too well were the cutting in an out of anime shorts.  Very annoying retro harmonica music and the fact that there will be more of these kill bill films coming.  I haven't seen such an over-hyped piece of garbage since Titanic.I'm sure this movie has its fan base but for hollywood to market it as a flashy chick martial arts flick is just wrong.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Please, Dear God, someone stop Tarantino before he wastes another two hours of my life!","Whoever told Tarantino that he was a movie director is the same person who told Ms. Cleo that she was a psychic. I'm firmly convinced that the man can't make a movie worth the film it's printed on.His latest outing is Kill Bill, an homage (cough cough) to old Kung Fu movies of the seventies, but this movie lacks the simplistic charm that old martial arts movies had, insofar that Kill Bill is a poor bastardization of seventies films.Now, while this film is 200 times better than the sewer slime known as Pulp Fiction, I feel that I must confess that I do like the action and the conflict in the film, however the script was not driven by the actors in the film, and character development was poor. There were many times that I felt that the violence was being gratuitous, and the lawn sprinkler effects of the gushing blood was very laughable, at best.Uma Thurman gave a very shallow performance in this movie as well, and maybe that helped her character a bit, but it didn't make the bride compelling. And i find it very hard to believe that Thurman could take out the entire Yakuza in a restaurant, when she couldn't take out Alicia Silverstone in Batman & Robin (which is also better than Pulp Fiction). Not to mention that she has very ugly feet (ugghhh!!).All in all, about 50/50, in my book. I will say that it may be worth a watch, and eventually, when the DVD is in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart, maybe even worth a purchase. If you like Tarantino films, you may like this film, otherwise approach with caution.5/10 stars",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Not just your ""Typical Hot Chick Killing Men"" Movie","Kill Bill, is an amazing movie. The acting and direction is perfect, and it couldn't have been any better if it weren't for Quentin and Uma. I can't imagine ANYONE else directing this, or ANYONE else playing The Bride they way both did, respectively. I know when any person first hears a movie where it's like ""okay, we've got a hot chick with weapons and she's gonna kill fifty-something people"" they think ""that sounds stupid, and predictable"" which sure, the ending may have been a little predictable, but when a movie is this good, that doesn't matter. They way Quentin puts in such tiny details yet every single one fits in with the plot somehow, and the way the fight scenes are choreographed, and how there's always a few funny lines of dialogue here and there such as the little classroom scene where The Bride's name is revealed, and how it has mixed elements of almost every different type of movie genre out there, and, ah, I don't know just everything about this movie is AMAZING, and should definitely be seen by anyone who loves these types of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Style over substance,"I've expected lot of blood everywhere and almost no story at all so hard that I was kinda surprised that it wasn't that bad about the blood or the story either. But never mind, this movie wasn't about the story, it was about style - style over substance. The creative way of displaying otherwise already boring scenes and situations kept me enjoying Kill Bill.Among other things they were: black and white scene (where 'blood' was obviously replaced with water), animated scene, retro music, and the fight with bola. Anyway, the strongest character for me was Chiaki Kuriyama as Go Go Yubari. Her eyes were so wicked and her other features so sharp, she was the only character that gave the skin crawl.And one more thing: the violence wasn't gratuitous, it was all exaggeration. Oh well, Kill Bill was fun. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

One big reason to see it--but thousands not to.,"From the outset, this is Tarantino's movie--although Uma Thurman almost wrests it away.Uma's a bride seeking revenge on a group of assassins who killed her entire wedding party at the altar. Pretty much, she just hunts them down and with sword fights and severed limbs, tries to kill them all. What's staggering is Thurman manages to inject a resigned frailty into what's essentially the role of a cold-blooded killer. Somehow, amid the fountains of blood, this is Oscar contender acting.It is extraordinarily violent, possibly one of the most violent Western movies of all times. The blood gushes and heads roll, and while in the earlier parts of the movie, Tarantino merely hints at the violence, he shows it all in living colour and black and white (and Japanese animation) toward the end. He's not making a point. He's saluting the just-as-violent Hong Kong and Japan movies many 'whities' have never seen.Kill Bill is brilliantly made. There are thousands of reasons not to see this movie, but only one to see it. It's very difficult to take in the sheer amount of lightning-quick Tarantino touches, such as Daryl Hannah's eye-patch. This needs to be seen more then three or four times. You may be tempted to either go home in disgust or watch it again right then. The direction is amazing--the music, mistakes and jumps in film, costumes and colours, the fight scenes, it's all made brilliantly, albeit without a trace subtlety. But Tarantino is hardly known for that.And if anyone wants to claim he stole wire-fight ideas from the Matrix.just remember, the Matrix stole it from Japan first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino goes tantric with masturbatory moviemaking,"Since this is only half a film, I can only form half an opinion on it. I liked some of what I saw - a lot - but it was sandwiched between bits that bored (the last Thurman/Liu scene), baffled (the 'you prepare sushi, I bring sake' shtick) and generally annoyed me. You've made your point, QT, so go easy on the cheesy Oriental cinema homages, would ya? Some of it simply made me cringe; the dialogue between Thurman and Vivica A Fox thuds like a severed head hitting the floor.Tarantino has clearly made Kill Bill to amuse himself, and doesn't really give a flying foot massage whether he entertains his audience. It's certainly brash, bloody and different but love it or hate it, he's too cool (or so he thinks) to care.I have a sneaking suspicion that Kill Bill was always intended to be released in two parts, with the 'last minute decision' to split a single movie being a savvy bit of marketing between himself and Miramax (who, as everyone knows, are particularly adept at that game).Vol. 2 will determine whether I've been party to maverick moviemaking at its most audacious or just a director having a wonderful time with someone else's money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"A dizzying collage of styles, textures and visual references","Whereas Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994) took elements from the French New Wave and American independent cinema of the 1970's to create bold, iconic, character driven films rife with clever dialog, uncompromising violence and subtle allusions to a myriad of varied, textured film references, Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2 (2003-2004) take the idea of referencing even further, giving us blatant and literal references that cross from one genre to the next with a complete disregard for whether or not the audience is familiar with the kind of work being quoted. This technique is pushed even further in the subsequent Death Proof (2007), which really does require an audience to be familiar with its subject in order to get the most out of the style, set-up and intent. Here, all pretensions to the cinema of the French New Wave are dropped, as well as the more adult-orientated flavour of the previous Jackie Brown (1997), which was perhaps more in keeping with the aging spirit of the blacksploitation sub-genre of films from which it drew a superficial influence.Instead, Kill Bill (2003) finds director Quentin Tarantino shifting his focus to Asian cinema and referencing sources as disparate as Kung-Fu (1972), Lone Wolf and Cub (1972), Lady Snowblood (1973), The Street Fighter (1974), Shogun Assassin (1980) and Ichi the Killer (2001), as well as taking direct influence from the Shaw Brothers studio productions of the 1960's and filmmakers like Kinji Fukasaku and Seijun Suzuki. Alongside these visual and thematic reference points we also have a continual reliance on juxtaposing ideas and iconography taken from spaghetti westerns, blacksploitation pictures, Chinese ""wuxia"" and kung fu movies, Japanese Manga and Anime, hip-hop, American exploitation and revenge cinema, and Fran√ßois Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black (1968). These influences are all combined, sometimes obviously and sometimes with more subtlety, but all used with flair, imagination and intelligence to create the right kind of cinematic environment for this purposely elaborate, over-the-top, comic-book-style tale of roaring rampage and revenge to play out against.The opening shot is fantastic; rife with cinematic allusions to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Seijun Suzuki's Tokyo Drifter (1965), with the use of black and white cinematography and the image of the iconic ""Bride"" laid out on her back, bloody and bruised, pleading for her life with an off-screen Bill who is about to put a bullet in her head. From here we cut to the title and the near-iconic use of Nancy Sinatra's version of the Sony Bono track 'Bang, Bang', which is every bit as bold, amusing, cool and ironic as the use of opening music in other Tarantino works. From here we cut back and forth in a non-linear progression to track the return and subsequent revenge of ""The Bride"" against the gang of devious former comrades who betrayed her.As the film is split into two halves (for commercial reasons, as opposed to artistic; but regardless, tying in with the literary use of voice-over, chapter-heading, an unreliable narrator, etc) there will always be the question of how to critique it. Do we view them as two separate films that should each deliver on the characteristics that we think cinema should pertain to, or do we view this as one long film; a continuation of a single character and theme over the course of two very different though ultimately linked feature films? If we take the former approach, then Volume 1 (2003) is the easiest film to appreciate on an immediate level, concerning itself more with scenes of balletic, visually rich and heavily choreographed action; relegating much of Tarantino's usual interplay of character and dialog to the background and allowing the visuals to completely envelope us. In this sense Tarantino is drawing on the B-cinema pop-art explosion of Suzuki, most notable in the sequence where ""The Bride"" takes on the Crazy-88's amidst a barrage ostentatious camera movements, lighting changes, black and white inter-cutting and bouncing Go-Go music from the 5, 6, 7, 8's.There are also elements of over the top martial arts choreography juxtaposed against scenes of more brutal, harder-hitting violence, obvious miniature work that almost points to the original Godzilla films, retro use of rear-screen projection, allusions to films as disparate as Twisted Nerve (1968), Hitchcock, Brian De Palma's elaborate use of split-screen, the production design from Gate of Flesh (1964) and Sex and Fury (1974), the casting of Chiaki Kuriyama (perhaps familiar to most audience from her appearances in Fukasaku's Battle Royale) and Bruce Lee's Game of Death (1978). Though these elements are impressive, particularly when coupled with the scenes of over-the-top violence (which nods to the exaggerated bloodshed of Anime and of films like the aforementioned Shogun Assassin and Ichi the Killer) and the technical virtuosity of Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson, the effect can seem hollow; especially when we cross-reference this to the much more reserved, dialog-driven Volume 2 (2004).With this in mind, it would seem more appropriate to view the films as one single film; taking into account both the bursts of colour and energy presented in Volume 1 and the slower, more character-driven approach of Volume 2 to really get the most out of the incredible journey that this larger than life character undertakes. It also allows us to better appreciate the extraordinary performance from Uma Thurman in the central role, who here gives one of the best performances of her career; instilling ""The Bride"" with a sense of honour and purpose that makes her violence and bloodshed all the more understandable. Kill Bill: Volume 1 doesn't quite scale the dizzying heights of Tarantino's first three films; lacking the intuitive style, unique dialog and intricate plotting - but it does represent a new phase of his career; one that pushes cinematic reference even further to create a visual tapestry of self-aware cinema that appeals to learned cineastes preoccupied with technique, as well as offering a bold story, memorable characters and a great sense of entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bit Gruesome at Points but Good on the Whole :),"This was my first Tarantino film and I went in expecting a lot and I've got to say, it lived up to my expectations. The action is so fluid and fun, the music great and there are moments of cinematography that are simply stunning, one of my problems with it though, which I wasn't expecting when I went in to it, was how gruesome some parts were. Most of the time the killing was fun and cartoonish with blood spurting out and silly noises being made but there are some moments where it's just brutal. As well as that I wanted more talking, quite a bit of this film is just wordless fighting, which is okay but I'd heard so much about Tarantino's witty dialogue and it was a shame that I wasn't able to see too much of it in this film, but apart from these minor gripes it's a great viewing, would highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Violence is an art. Welcome to Tarantino's gallery.,"Style over substance is the underlying theme of Kill Bill Vol. 1, the first segment of Quentin Tarantino's two-part kung-fu flick. The movie drops you straight into the action, allowing the plot to unwind in a non-linear format along the way.Uma Thurman brings her raw physical performance to the screen, breathing life into a character written for her. Her mysterious character has a checklist of people she plans to kill, driving the seemingly basic and obviously violent plot forward.The movie is extremely violent, but in a beautifully stylized way that has never before been achieved on-screen. The visual stimulation of the stunts and effects distracts the viewers, never allowing them to fully grasp the grisly nature of the senseless killings until after the spectacle has ended.Another great achievement in American cinema by its greatest fan and veteran, Quentin Tarantino. Hats off to Kill Bill Vol. 1.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Another Favorite from Tarantino,"This was the film that got me on the trail that I've been on for a few years now. And that's understanding how Tarantino comes up with such clever dialogue and crafting villains that we both despise and cheer for. I found myself sympathizing with O-Ren. Her story was a sad one. Even more tragic that she was dragged into the whole fiasco with the Bride. If it wasn't for that O-Ren Ishii would still be ruling over the Crazy 88's. Then again, that would totally change the story and interrupt the purpose of the film.Considering there are two Kill Bill films, I felt this one set the stage perfectly for the second. In this film, we really get to know The Bride and discover the atrocities committed against her. As an audience, we discover why she is on such a blood-thirsty rampage. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat cheering for the woman in the bright yellow track suit. Her exceptional skills with the blade are left unexplained--which should make you more curious. Do they reveal that in the second? What is her past with Bill?Back to Kill Bill Vol. 1... Watch as the warrior within grows and the attitude goes cold towards killing. The Bride is out for blood. And she'll be damned if anyone gets in the way of her revenge.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Kill em all.,"NOW THIS IS A MOVIE! Only Q.T. could've done something this great. The dialouge, the violence, the drama, the action, every aspect of this movie rocks. Kicking off with a harrowing introduction that is sure to haunt you in your sleep, Kill Bill vol. 1 pretty much makes you want to be on The Bride's side doing some killing. While this one doesn't fixate itself much on the story or the background history of what happened to The Bride, the movie doesn't really need to. Rather it straps you down for a roller coaster ride of pure action. The material arts is top notch, especially at the big show down at the end. The comedic parts are actually funny. The animated history of Oni-wan is dazzling. Sure they over-do it on the blood but so what? Half of the stuff they do in here can't be done in real life anyway, so just sit back, enjoy and turn your bullshit alarms off. This is the first installment of a movie that is going to dazzle you.

Entertaining but insubstantial,"First off, I generally enjoyed KB1. It's got some very entertaining fight sequences and strong visual style, and while the blood was excessive I found it more comical than gross, even though I normally have a low threshold for gore.But I'm left with the same feeling I get from any Tarantino film: so what? Tarentino could be described as a pop artist like Andy Warhol, who made his fame making replicas of Campbell soup labels and putting them in art galleries. Tarantino made a very stylish, slick, high budget homage/pastiche of shlocky action films. It is convincingly like those movies. But it doesn't bring anything new to the formula. Tarantino's films seem to exist entirely on the surface, lacking any subtext beyond, gee, weren't these movies really cool? Isn't lots of blood funny? Tarantino's consciousness seems to have gelled when he was about 17 and not gone anywhere since, and his style serves only itself. He has nothing to say about revenge, or violence, or the moral code of the warrior, he just throws it all up on screen because he thinks it's really neato.Which would be fine if he were making a cheap action picture, but Tarantino imbues his films with the sense that he's doing something really special when he's just recreating formative films from his childhood. And the feeling that the movie means to be bigger and better than its inspirations but really isn't makes the experience somehow hollow and unsatisfying, like a cake that is so airy you feel you haven't eaten.This so what feeling has kept me from enjoying previous Tarantino films. Tarantino's scripts would work best with more straightforward direction, which is why True Romance worked better than any of the scripts he has directed himself. Still, I did enjoy this movie overall, I did give it 7/10, and it is the first Tarantino-directed movie I have genuinely enjoyed.I just feel it's a shame that someone with obvious skill seems to have so little depth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's revenge for Pulp Fiction,"This movie is a stupid and boring sequence of  rubbish. It made me annoyed and angry at its director. It contains nothing more than a strange aesthetic presentation of violence. It has no story at all. It has no meaning at all.Tarantino probably has watched several ten thousand of movies in his life. I guess that in ""Kill Bill"" absolutely every single shot, every single picture is some kind of quotation from another movie, kung fu, spaghetti western, gangster stuff, Japanese trash, anime or whatever. All that stuff which is boring and intolerable.This movie is not intended for audiences, but just for himself. It's not ""personal"", it's an Tarantino-ego-movie. Nothing more.He could make this movie, realize his worst ego trip for the one and only reason that he has made enough money with Pulp Fiction. Otherwise this wouldn't have been possible.I can't tell how disappointed I am. If you are a great Tarantino fan, do not even think of watching this dreadful nonsense!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Pretty solid movie,"I'd give Kill Bill an 8.5/10, it's refreshing and fun to watch. Unlike a lot of these movies there's not really some deep meaning it's just a fun movie about assassins. Only major problems were Tarantino's foot fetish messing part of it up and it was overly gory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
can't these flies just leave me alone?????,"Although not as great as Tarantino's early work this movie has plenty of frenetic energy that makes his movies great. The first half of Kill Bill seems to be a meditation on the highly underrated Chop Socky films out of Hong Kong during the 60's, 70's and 80's. In fact the whole film serves as a tribute to eastern culture with a slight nod to the westerns and blaxploitation. Despite it's length the movie rarely slows down and manages to make one interesting scene after another. The amounts of spilled blood (along with the joke that the corpses of defeated foes don't simply disappear once defeated) make this movie stand on it's own as a true Kung Fu film. The appearance of Sonny Chiba will have extra weight for fans of Tarantino. What emerges isn't so much a movie with emotional depth as much as a popcorn movie that doesn't stoop to jerry bruckheimer clich√©s. As usual black comedy and in-jokes can be shifted through the carnage and most everything falls into place. my only complaint would come from the choice of music during the winter garden fight. I know it would probably be more clich√©d, but i would have preferred a dead soundtrack punctuated only by the water spigot to the jarring 70's roller derby music. Other than that I have few complaints.9 out of 10. not a romantic film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Uma Thurman plays the Blood thirsty Bride will get bloody satisfaction when she finally kills Bill!,"Uma Thurman is here telling the story of a Blood soaked Bride and how she wants revenge on one man who did this to her and his name is Bill (David Carrdine). The story follows Ms Thurman as the Bride and how she will stop at nothing to get revenge on him not caring who she kills on the way. Will she have the guts to take out the deadly assassin squad who had thought they killed her on her wedding day 4 years earlier but what they don't know is that she is still alive and the only thing she wants is their lives for what they did to her. Uma Thurman blew me away with her performance as the ""Blood Spalttered"" Bride and i was actually quite moved because i could understand her pain of 'losing' a child and that everyone you loved was dead. Uma has a big range of emotions and she can go from killing the crazy 88 to being upset about losing her daughter over some heartless assassins. i was also very surprised by Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii because i saw her in Charlies Angels and i wasn't that impressed because the acting wasn't that great anyway. I think that she is a very sexy Asian and she brings some spice to the role which makes her great.

"Good, but not as good as Pulp Fiction","Although it is somewhat different from the previous Tarrantino movies, it does have his specific signature.The action scenes are quite violent and are portrayed with the sense of humor and irony that one expects of Tarrantino. Blood sprays abundantly from chopped of limbs and heads, and the fountain-like sound that makes only adds to the sense of unrealism that makes this type of movie easier to cope with.The story is told in the typical asynchronous style, jumping back and forth in time. And there is, of course, the camera-shot from a trunk of a car.But rather than shooting their way all around, this time the hero and the villains go at each other with fists, feet, knives and swords. The martial arts scenes are very impressive, and despite the speed of these scenes, there are still some very funny shots. I particularly enjoyed the scene of a villain screaming while holding his chopped off foot in his hands.Innovative and funny were the Japanese-animation-style scenes, about the youth and career of O-Ren Ishii.All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie.

Even to fantasy there must be some limit,"Warning: really serious spoilers.Curiosity led me to tape this off TV, and watch it. I have no fault to find with the acting: Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu, in particular, are excellent, and it is for that, and the undeniably impressive action scenes, that I give a mark of 7. But ...I am not enough of a film buff to recognise all references, influences, etc., but for me the strongest influence is the comic book, and especially what I have seen from my son's collection of anime. This, of course, is fitting, since much of the action of Part 1 takes place in Japan. But it is most like the comic book in its focus on the central characters, who often seem to be moving in a world where the outside world barely exists and certainly does not interfere with their actions to any notable extent (no police pursuit of The Bride after the killing we see first, for instance; no attempts to find her when she's left the hospital). The central character, The Bride, is effectively a superhero; she survives what ought to be mortal wounds (even a shot in the head!); manages to dispose of two men and get herself into a wheelchair, and from that into a car, when just recovered from a bedridden coma lasting 4 years, apparently; fights and disposes of multiple opponents with only a samurai sword, displaying more than Xena-like agility and stamina and taking only minor damage until her climactic duel with Lucy Liu's character. How the child she was carrying is supposed to have survived is not at all clear(cut out of her after she was shot?); but we only learn this at the very end, in a pretty outrageous piece of manipulation. Maybe it is explained in Part 2(not seen yet).This presentation of a character without any explanation of her abilities is not confined to The Bride. Lucy Liu's character becomes an expert assassin - fine; but she then becomes the 'boss of bosses' of all the yakuza in Tokyo. We are not given any hint of how she achieves this amazing feat, simply that she has. By this time, she has acquired an entourage of extremely lethal henchmen (and an equally lethal schoolgirl bodyguard), but The Bride disposes of them all (none of them takes a shot at her, even with a bow - they only use swords and other weapons of similar vintage), while their boss waits to fight the final duel, again with a sword only. Why? There is a good deal of extremely gory slicing off of hands, feet, limbs etc., but all those affected survive - they don't bleed to death, as they surely would without prompt application of tourniquets - especially the lawyer whose arm is cut off at the shoulder. But she must survive, to have information that The Bride wants tortured out of her.Such total disregard for reality grates after a while. Comparisons with LOTR are inappropriate: in that characters cannot overcome great odds absolutely single-handed, they die (or appear to, in Gandalf's case), take wounds, feel fatigue etc. They still achieve their quest, very much against the odds (but they do have some magical help at crucial moments), but they seem much more plausibly human.Ultimately, this film is a series of spectacles, which one is meant to admire without questioning any details of their presentation. I cannot suspend disbelief to that extent; but I will watch Part 2 just to find out how the end happens (I know from reviews the barest outline of what happens in it).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Inexcusable Crap,"First off, let me say this:  I am a Quentin Tarantino fan.  My DVD collection includes everything he has written or directed.  It will not contain Kill Bill.I went into this film expecting to love it.  I came out revulsed and disgusted.  Where QT has always used violence and mayhem to make statements about people and culture, here he has made a film about violence for the sake of violence.  I have a pretty strong stomach, but the sight of a small child's mother being brutally murdered before her eyes was too much for me. Especially when the murderer is the character we are supposed to be rooting for.  The child's reaction was played for grins, not for pathos.  Shortly thereafter another child's parents are brutally murdered in such close proximity that the child is doused with their blood.

Tarantino's best so far...,"Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Sick and twisted genius, but a genius, nonetheless.Collect the best scenes from classical martial arts movies and other great stuff such as Samurai Fiction, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, Green Hornet, Enter the Dragon, Star Trek, Matrix, Matrix Reloaded, Lone Wolf and the Cub, Battle Royale (take an actor from Battle Royale to play a cute schoolgirl) and countless others. Add some modern twist and use the modern possibilities to make them up to date - and how they should have been done. Give them all respect they deserve. Then, read a pile of comics - manga, Marvel's Japan stuff - and borrow the graphic style from them. And parodize everything in an intelligent way.Make a story that is a mother of all vengeance stories. Don't take it too seriously - make it a parody as well.Then, get a bunch of lads together. Make them to talk about the movies that they loved when they were 15 - get them back to that moment. Use their ideas of how you could put their favourite fighting scenes in to your movie - and then ask them, how would they want to spice them up. Use every single idea.Add Quentin Tarantino to the soup as a main ingredient.Love every minute of it.Short description: Intelligent parody of martial arts movies.

A Blast!,"A quintessential Tarantino campy slash-fest, full of gore and farcical violence but an absolute joy to watch! I love campy slasher flicks. I grew up on the Dawn of the Dead movies and a lot of kung fu stuff. The brilliance of Tarantino is he takes the best parts of all those off-the-wall films and puts them into superbly entertaining films. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of those.You've got guns shot through boxes of kids cereal. You've got unbelievable swordplay. You've got graceful choreography. You've got more profanity than you can shake a stick at. This film has all that stuff, and I loved practically every minute of it. And what a departure for Uma Thurman!! 9 out of 10. It's not a great classic film, but it's more than good enough to get a place of honor on your DVD shelf.Barky",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Another Very Well Done Tarantino Film,"I had always heard great things about this movie, but for a long time I was hesitant. I was born in 1992, so I'm kind of back tracking threw film history so to speak. Seeing as ""Pulp Fiction"" had been so well done, I decided that this film should be just as exhilarating. And to my pleasure I must say what audiences get is a very different type of movie, let alone martial arts film. So many movies today lack any real style, this was just awesome to watch for that reason alone.This movie tells a revenge story that is obviously heavily influenced by 73's ""Lady Snowblood"", and to very good effect. Tarantino shows a clear deep respect for the film, especially threw Lucy Lui's character O-Ren Ishi as well as Uma Thurman's ""The Bride"". The characters here are much better drawn out and are played very well, each with their own interesting story line. The opening fight is amazing and manages to sum up all these different emotions into the first few minutes of the film. It's quite frankly impossible not to enjoy the rest. Uma Thurman plays a character known simply as The Bride, who will have to face down some of her former allies who apparently double-crossed her for leaving the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad). Among her foes are great actors including Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen, all leading up to the final confrontation with Bill, played by David Carrdine. And although you have to wait till Volume II to see that, this film sports some heavy-hitting action. It reminds you of those classic kung-fu and samurai movies done with a fresh twist that leaves you amazed really. The violence is cartoonly overdone, in the same light of many of those epic and very bloody classics. It's a factor I actually enjoy and the Crazy 88 battle is for sure one thing among many: crazy!! The music, some of which is provided by the RZA (!!), is original and I must say our director has an odd but well placed taste for this department. Along with the humor, Tarantino also does his usual out-of-sync time line gig, which is a tad distracting in this film upon first viewing, but you'll appreciate it more every time. The thing about this film is that it pays much deserved tribute to a category of films that are so under appreciated these days, to see it in American cinema done so artistically was just fresh, involving and unique. way to present",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Interesting, but dragged out unnecessarily","This movie appears to be a backhanded slap at kung fu movies dating back to the '70's. Certainly a movie with a title like ""Kill Bill"" is not meant to be taken seriously, but then the flick turns around and has large supplies of blood, gore, and mangled corpses.It's the old story of a woman scorned, but this woman happens to be a Rambo/Governator/Bruce Lee/Jackie Chan/etc type of invincible killing machine (she even dresses in one scene exactly like Bruce Lee did in one his movies). Uma Thurman is appropriately vicious, then emotional in her Jekyl/Hyde style role. She exudes blind hatred and destructive fury one moment, tearful sentimentality the next. Some of these characterizations are played too straight for The Bride, others are over the top. This clumsy lack of consistency disorients the viewer. Are you supposed to fear her? Sympathize with her? Laugh at her campy and overstated persona? There's a lot of one-liner banter between the Bride and her adversaries, and some are quite funny. Having two people who are in a life-and-death struggle mocking each other is an old clich√©, ripe for satire, but it's done way too much. It gets old after a while.As the title implies, she's trying to exact revenge on the twisted sicko Bill (David Carradine doing the evil psycho well), her former lover, who is a trained assassin like herself. What he had done to her is one of the many contrivances of the film, but it's easy to overlook these and give the film whatever suspension of disbelief it asks of you. The action is uncompromisingly violent. Antagonists are portrayed as mindless, cold hearted killers.Heads are chopped off. Innocents are blasted mercilessly. Body parts get cut off, sometimes pulled off, and mangled. This movie is not for everyone, especially if you dislike ""dark"" humor or relentless violence. Many fight scenes, although magnificently choreographed, drag on way too long, the reason this movie needed ""two volumes."" There are many scenes where the director stretches out two-minutes-worth of information into a 15-minute scene. The two volumes are usually shown back-to-back, so if you've got 4 hours plus commercial time with nothing better to do, this wild mayhem isn't a bad way to spend the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
My favorite movie of all time,I've been obsessed with this film ever since I first watched it back then in 2003 when I was little.

First Half is Good,"I consider myself an objective movie reviewer. Just because Tarantino directed this movie doesn't mean I'll try to like it. I have no loyalty whatsoever to any studio or director. It is human nature to look up to mythic characters like Tarantino and Tolkien. How else did Hitler come to power? This perhaps explains the fanaticism of Tarantino and LOTR fans. It also explains why Tarantino's films as well as the LOTR films have such inflated IMDB ratings.Kill Bill is a good movie. The music and visual elements are unique and idiosyncratic. Especially during the first half of the movie Tarantino builds up great suspense with the nurse walking to the Bride in hospital and almost killing her. The splitscreens, bright-cool colors, and anime scenes were stylish and entertaining.However, halfway through the movie Tarantino seemed to have gotten lazy. The fight scene in which the Bride goes up against hundreds of men with swords is excessively cut. A continuous shot like that found in most fight scene in The Matrix would have been preferable. This would have created a greater sense of cohesion. Instead the fight scene in Kill Bill is quite confusing.After watching Kill Bill: Volume 2, I'll be able to talk about the plot and characterization. In the first volume characterization is quite disappointing, but I can expect that in martial arts films. (The Matrix had poor characterization as well. Every character spoke like philosophy professors.)Like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Kill Bill's main protagonists are females, which is quite alright as it works well as a feminist message to viewers. Gender roles are often reinforced by sexist movies like Lord of the Rings.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Overrated.  Unbearably so.,"One of the most overrated films I've ever seen. I saw the theatrical release (pre black and white fight scene) and was amazed at the atrociousness of this movie. I think it's safe to say that had this movie not been branded with Tarantino's name, it would have been an incredible flop. I went expecting to see the standard Tarantino fare, but was instead treated to one of the most self-indulgent pieces of ""art"" ever. I'm so disappointed in the public here at IMDb. Usually the ratings on cinema are fairly accurate in their estimation of artistic merit. In this case however, mass hysteria seems to have overtaken better judgment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Can see why this was released in two parts,"First off let me say that I wasn't too sold on this movie from the previews. I was really hoping the that trailers was a huge bad hollywood joke from tarentino cause these scenes from the trailers look like a filme that is featured in a film about hollywood.  However, I still saw it cause it's tarentino...It's gots to be good.  But I feel, after seeing this film that poor Q.T. had seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon one too many times and thought ""I can do that with an anime twist to it"".And that brings me to the title of this less than glowing review.  SOme of the most popular Anime titles (Akira, Ghost in the Shell) are ultra violent. Blood is spewed like a geyser, limbs are cut off, and fights are higly choreographed. Kill Bill is like a Live Action Anime. And the gore is a plenty.  I have a feeling that QT was told by Miramax to tone it down a bit. HEnse the big fight scene with Uma and 80 Samuri's is in Black and white and why this film is in Two parts.  If it wasn't in two parts this film would have recieved an NC-17 and no theatre would show it. THis is a very violent picture. I got turned off by the violence and one of my favorite films is A Clockwork Orange. Quinten, from a fan, please try to make you next films violence toned down to a Pulp fiction level.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Best of Two Worlds,"Kill Bill: Volume 1 combines some the best action and classic Tarantino dialogue.  While the dialogue does not match up to any of Tarantino's previous movies, what it lacks for dialogue it makes up for with action.Kill Bill however, is not blessed with the great acting of all of Tarantino's previous movies.  Some of the lines are delivered kind of ackwardly, including Uma Thurman.Also, Kill Bill is a very very very violent movie.  It is rare that you will find 5 minutes straight without blood, and the amount of blood is at times comically exaggerated.Although this is not Quentin Tarantino's best, Kill Bill is unquestionably a movie that cannot be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

An great martial arts film,Kill Bill Volume 1 is a really good action film. Clearly Quentin Tarantino loves martial arts films particularly the ones from Bruce Lee. It has great action scenes and amazing choreography. The fight at the end between Umu Thurman and Lucy Liu's henchman is one of the best action scenes from the past decadeThe only problem I have is this film has the best action scenes and Kill Bill Volume 2 has all the talking. In my opinion it should be the other way round.Overall if you like martial arts or samurai films you should definitely check this film out.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
this is a really good gory film and that is the type of film i would watch anytime.,all of this film is great. There is nothing about volume 1 or volume 2 that i can pull down. The best part is when she fights that young teenager. It looks like shes down but she fights back. I also like it at the end where she fights the boss. She slices her head and its really good effects. I also like it where she is fighting all of those men and all the blood on the floor is really cool. It is just a really good film to enjoy and no one can really pull this down it is a true 10/10 and i know the second one is just as good but this one is excellent. I hope there can be more movies like that coming out in the future and more gory films which don't miss out any of the good bits which this film doesn't.

"An unbelievable achievement, a timeless personal favourite, and a great first part to cinema's finest revenge film.","The term 'style over substance' is often used in a derogatory manner, and I understand why. On paper, substance sounds better than style; films that are substantive stick with you and play out in your mind for days, weeks, or sometimes even years to come. On a basic level, and to use a food metaphor: the typical consensus might be that the substance of a film should be the cake, while the style should be the icing.With Kill Bill Vol. 1, I believe Tarantino wanted to take this concept of style over substance and tear it to shreds, making it an obsolete, dumb, lazy criticism. If you ask me, he was successful. He gets away with making a film that is largely about being stylish and entertaining as all hell for two main reasons. The first is that he makes this simply Vol. 1 in the overall story, with a greater focus on character and emotion placed within the equally fantastic Vol. 2. This is not to say that Vol. 2 lacks style, nor that Vol. 1 is devoid of substance; moreso that I believe they have two very different purposes, but by some miracle fit perfectly together in telling the same story, while also proving to be incredibly satisfying films for very different reasons. Of course if Vol. 2 was not a satisfying conclusion, or if it was similarly focused on style over substance, perhaps it would make Vol.1 a weaker film in the process. Thankfully, this is not the case. Any concerns a viewer may have with a lack of story across the 4 hours of Kill Bill as a whole will have their worries shattered by the incredible dialogue, emotional payoffs, and fantastic flashbacks of the second volume.The second way he gets away with a film so shamelessly fixated on being a stylish thrill ride is that the sense of style is just so good. It's beyond rare to get a film with this level of craft, with such a tight and obvious sense of control by the person behind the camera, let alone have it also be so exciting, entertaining, violent, and overwhelmingly beautiful. The use of music is unparalleled, even with just about all the music being composed for other films, or being pre-existing songs recorded way before the film was made. I think there's a real skill with picking music that works for and heightens certain scenes, and while soundtrack creators don't get nearly as much credit as composers do, I feel like films that use pre-existing music as well as Kill Bill Vol. 1 provide a good argument for why there should be a ""Best Non-Original Soundtrack"" Academy Award. To list all the songs that are used perfectly would double the length of this review, as it's basically every single song in the film. I get goosebumps at multiple points every single time I rewatch Kill Bill Vol. 1, and the music is one of the main reasons for that.Kill Bill Vol. 1 is also noticeable for having one of the most memorable action sequences in recent cinema history, towards the film's climax. It's also worth mentioning the amazing build-up, as well as the quiet, understated, and strangely moving one-on-one fight in the snow that happens right after it. And the way that after this, the film hooks you into absolutely needing to see the second part with one of my favourite cliff-hangers ever is undeniably brilliant.It's hard to say much else because most of Kill Bill Vol. 1's greatness has already been mentioned by thousands of reviewers before me, and also because words can't do a whole lot of justice to the look, style, pacing, action, and music that makes this film so excellent, and so endlessly rewatchable. Kill Bill as a whole is my favourite revenge film/story of all time, and I don't know how any future filmmaker would be able to work such magic with the simple premise of ""these people wronged me, so these people need to die."" Of course things become a little more complex when it comes to the less action-packed but densely written and far more suspenseful and emotionally intense Vol. 2, but you without a doubt need both to understand what Tarantino was going for here.It's hard to settle on a favourite Tarantino movie, but this one's up there, regardless of whether you count it as one film or count this one and Vol.2 as the same film. If you haven't seen either in the 15+ years since its release, what are you doing? Pure cinematic experiences don't get much better than Kill Bill Vol. 1, in my opinion. This is a film that might not be perfect, but feels perfect while you watch it; packed with so much detail, style, and things to appreciate and get swept up in. There aren't enough good things I can say about it, and hope that in time it continues to age well, and is eventually considered one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The bloodiest and best sword fight ever!,"Kill Bill Volume I has the best and most spectacular bloody sword fight scene ever. I have seen the film more than thirty times and it never gets old. Quentin Tarantino is a master of mixing spectacular action, violence, and acting into one single film. I am a fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. They are masterpieces as well. But the thing that draws me to Kill Bill is the story. Although the story is straight forward, the heroin succeeds in killing everyone in her path in her hunt for Bill. But what she does not do is hold back from anything. She is ready for anything and is prepared to do serious damage. The characters in Kill Bill Volume I are comical and brilliant. Quentin Tarantino does a great jog with creating flashy characters. Gogo is the most disturbing character while Hatori Hanzo is the most comical. But by far, The Bride is the most ruthless. I recommend the film to anyone I meet. It is a must see!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
101 ways to prepare gourmet excrement,"This movie relies almost exclusively on shock effect and stylized dismembering in order to affect a surreal indulgence in the absurd.

Only the ""ignorant masses"" cannot appreciate true trash.  I suppose that I couldn't possibly understand what's to like in an <excrement> sandwich either, but I feel like I lost 3 hours of my life on this one.  What a disappointment.

Excellent idea -- not for everyone's taste,"'Kill Bill' provides a variety of Kung Fu like sequences in a simple but clear plot, with strong influence from Chinese and Japanese films. Uma Thurman, in her yellow jumpsuit reminiscent of Bruce Lee, is absolutely fantastic in portraying the sweet motherly figure - with a tough tough edge! Don't mess with this girl!I really liked the way that the graphically violent scenes are almost reduced to a comical, hilarious joke - some of the scenes are serious, but some are downright funny. The brief switch to manga style sequences in the film is particularly effective at portraying the anger and lust for revenge felt by most protagonists in the film.The mellow background music and peaceful atmosphere surrounding the gory battle scenes - which are very unlike the over-mystified crap being shown in some recent movies - is quite reminiscent of the way 'Clockwork Orange' had used music to intensify the violence shown onscreen.The major thing I strongly did *not* like in this film was the fact that it was split into two parts. I believe that with some proper editing, the film could have been released as a long feature in one part. I believe that the abrupt cut in the middle of the story is quite frustrating to viewers and leaves you with the feeling that the whole business of film sequels is being carried a bit too far lately.

Virtuoso,"""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" finds its director Quentin Tarantino weaving his stylized action with such a mastery that anyone whose eyebrows aren't too high up couldn't help but be in awe. This is blood, gore, violence and sex uplifted to an artform. More than separate stylization, style its embedded in this picture to the point where it becomes inseparable from its plot. This is a director who is not afraid of using his power and making his spot. Tarantino movies are obvious on who is directing them, this more than any of them.The movie is filled with characters virtuously crafted with a freedom which dares to challenge the standard norms of storytelling and progression. Describing its locations and people would make one succumb to poetry not necessarily because of their beauty but rather because of their details. Consider the final confrontation which takes place in a Japanese garden. There is a traditional Japanese fountain from which water constantly flows and during the tense pause, our attention is drawn to it and its rhythmic sound materializes the pace.Consider the plot: after awakening from a four-year coma, a former assassin known only as The Bride (Uma Thurman) wreaks vengeance on the team of assassins who betrayed her. Despite being left for dead in a pool of blood, she survives. The first scene, pictured in black and white, has her laying on her back covered in an all too picturesque blood. The gruesomeness in some of these scenes is so beautifully crafted and written in such a sexy manner that I almost felt guilty for admiring it too much.The plot then doesn't bother too much about making too much sense. The Bride gets revenge. That's about it. On that purpose, she easily travels from a comatose American hospital to Japan for her first target: mob boss O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). The story of her upbringing is a tragic one. This is one reason why Tarantino decided to film it in anime. Witnessing the death of her parents at the mob to only then get her revenge and her first kill at 11. While you still feel the tragedy, the style prevents you from weeping and, instead, crafts an admiration in the viewer's mind towards her.This sneaky feminism--despite unraveling in front of our very eyes--goes almost unnoticed under the sprites of blood. But before accusing Tarantino of being all style no substance, he made sure to drag these ladies through hellish ordeals, and gave them a look and aura which emanates his trademark dangerous stance they pose. The most obvious is O-Ren's prot√©g√©, the 17-year old Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) who doesn't flinch for a second when she spilled the guts of a rich snob who wanted to have sex with her. ""It is me who is penetrating you"" she says as he dies. Her schoolgirl uniform combined with the array of wacky melee weapons she uses makes her an in-and-out anime character brought to life--with all the coolness that entails.No doubt, the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino is made by a director/writer who sees miles ahead in front of him. He is in full control of his universe yet this never feels compulsive because of what a wacky, emotionless and ridiculous universe it is. If he were to play the violin, this is not an operatic part, but rather an avant-garde piece of solo bravado from a rock-n-roll song.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Brilliant. Storytelling. Period.,"I loved this movie, as I do all other Quentin Tarantino films, simply because it is a simple story with one central theme, revenge. It doesn't get much simpler. Usually a movie with a bland central theme will not fair to well; however, they way in which the story is played out and presented is what makes it so great. In addition to just being a brilliant story, the way music is used throughout the movie gives a quirky yet not at all out of place feel. The first volume is most definitely the more gory of the 2. Whereas, Vol.2 gives more of the back story. Also, there is a wholly different feel to the second one which is most likely why the two movies were separated even though they were a single story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Just astounding,"The Bride (Uma Thurman) was beaten and shot multiple times and left for dead on her wedding day.  She survives but is in a coma.  Four years later she wakes up and sets out to kill everyone who tried to kill her.Quentin Tarantino is back in full throttle!  This movie just keeps going for 90 minutes and doesn't stop.  Film references fly all over the place (love the Brian DePalma homage with the split screens) and there's virtual non-stop action.  Thurman's fight with Vivica A. Fox is fast and violent. Even better is her trying to get to Lucy Liu and having to cut her way through (literally) a few hundred guys.  Limbs go flying, people are cut in half, tons of blood goes sprewing all over...it's VERY violent.  But it's really not that bad--it's so overdone it's impossible to take seriously...I was always well aware that I was watching a movie.The acting is great--Thurman is just perfect as The Bride.  You know precious little about her but I really felt for her and cared whenever she was hurt in battle.  Fox is great and Liu is controlled but very good.  Also it's great to HEAR David Carradine (you don't see him), see Daryl Hannah and Julie Dreyfuss is just great as Sofie.One complaint--Miramax cut Tarantino's film into two parts.

I didn't hear anybody complaining about ""Gone With the Wind"" running almost 4 hours or the two ""Lord of the Rings"" movies each running over 3.

This was definitely worth 6 years of waiting!,"Quentin Tarantino took his time to come with a follow-up for his 1997 Jackie Brown, but the patience of his fans is widely rewarded with this film! Kill Bill is, without any doubt, the coolest film I've seen in a long, long time. It's more than just a film; it's a truly refreshing experience and an almost complete encyclopedia for cinema buffs to admire. How can you tell a dreadful, d√©j√†-vu tale of revenge and still look innovating and original? Only QT knows the answer to this¬Ö He saw the change to extend a seemly repetitive plot (a woman awakes after a 4 year coma and avenges herself) with loads of tributes to `dead' film-genres, such as Martial Arts-movies, exploitation and Spaghetti-westerns. The results of this are absolutely amazing and Kill Bill is a film to watch over and over again, without EVER growing tired off. On the contrary¬Öit'll only get better with repeated viewings. The characters are typically Tarantino, which means delightfully eccentric and criminally insane. The main characters are the very ingenious `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', led by Bill who's given image to by David Carradine! He's a 70's Kung-Fu legend and Tarantino more or less did the same for him as he did for John Travolta and Pam Grier. Some of the side-characters are highly memorable as well. Gogo, for example! She's a 17-year-old schoolgirl who makes up in madness what she lacks in age. Kill Bill contains less memorable dialogues than previous QT films, but this is widely made up by an overload of terrifically over-the-top violence. The absolute highlights to this being a grotesque finale and a brilliant Manga-tribute.I simply can't give enough praise to this film. If you like cinema and all of its history, you'll love Kill Bill and that's all there is to it. Every tiny detailed aspect about this movie is worth mentioning. From Daryl Hannah's eye lap with a little red cross on it to the extravagant Pussy Mobiel.  And than I haven't even talked about the brilliant soundtrack!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A near perfect revenge flick with style and atmosphere,"Watching Volume 1 of ""Kill Bill"" again a few nights ago, I remain convinced that this is one of the finest revenge films that have graced the silver screen. From the very beginning, ""Kill Bill"" is gripping and atmospheric, amusing and riveting, violent and uncompromising. It's not Tarantino's best movie but it demonstrates the talent of this unique director.The cast are excellent, the direction is impeccable and the score is a dream. Thurman is simply fantastic in this movie and is very believable as The Bride as she cuts her way to her ultimate target.There are so many memorable moments in the film that it's difficult knowing where to begin but it's the action scenes that really stand out.9 out of 10.

My impression of this masterpiece,"I absolutely adore this movie. Tarantino's perception of the world is astonishing, I just love how he he can make everything look so incredible. Many fans would file Kill Bill under Guilty Pleasures thinking it's not that good of a movie, but like it anyway somehow. I, on the other hand, reckon this is one of the most underestimated movies of all time. It's just this amazingly executed satire of almost everything, after watching it you're not quite sure if the actors weren't just mocking you for two hours for watching it through or if you just filled an empty hole in your soul that's been aching for ages. I feel like this movie is just a big joke that turned out to be one of the most iconic Tarantino's works, his unique perspective never fails to amaze me, I doubt Quentin himself had thought this would be such a hit. It's just a shame that it's considered a Blokbuster when in fact it should've been nominated for an Oscar or something",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Disappointing,"Considering that it is a Tarantino, I had great hopes, but was left disappointed. Ok, it had some of his normal dialogue, but even there we are used to better. But the fight scenes? Why on earth did he have to make them so comical? It has taken all of the impact out of it, and it is not really funny. If you slaughter someone, do it properly (i.e. more realistically), and violently. You can take an homage too far. In my opinion, the comic was just about okay, although not exactly my favourite drawing style.After this, I will probably watch Vol. 2 just for completion, but don't have great hopes for it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Overrated, but...","The movie itself had good points. The cast of Uma Thurman was perfect, theaction scenes were very well done. I am really intrigued though as to why this movie is among the best 150 movies of all times?... I agree that this movie is original.. for the average movie-goer at least, the one that doesn't know anime movies are being made since 40 years ago (though itis not mainstream in our shores yet). In terms of style, character and story this movie develops like a traditional anime movie; there is an abuse of culture though, as everything in this movie seemed exagerate.  If you have ever watched anime movies you will realize that the best ones, do not use half the violence/cheap effects this movie used and insteadinvested more time in character development, drama and story. Who is Bill?Why he tried to kill the Black Mamba? What was the relationship between theBlack Mamba and the other members of the Viper Squad prior to the attemptedmurder?, were they friends?. There are many things left unsaid/unexplained that typical good anime movies would have covered in detail.Now to my original question why is this movie rated so high? even though there are at least a dozen of anime movies/OVAs that have it better in terms ofcharacter, story and execution than this one? is it because people is reallygetting bored of watching the same Hollywood'esque plots?

Just a fun and well written/directed movie!,This movie was just incredible. I have always been a fan of Quentin Tarantino and his movies. Everything that there is to say about this movie has already been said so I'll keep it simple and tell you what I loved about it. Growing up I loved anime and everything that came with it. So when the movie included the animated section I was hyped out of my mind. I also loved the finale just the music set to the extreme violence had me smiling throughout the entire sequence.

The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 1 - The beginning of his return: Kill Bill Vol. 1,"Not much of a story, but well executedYou know what the problem is with living in a small ass town in the southern part of the Netherlands? The problem is, that if you are unable to attend a screening of a film like Kill Bill, in it's first two weeks, no cinema within a 25 kilometer radius still has the film running on a big screen. Now that's what I call a problem! And how is one supposed to solve that? Watch Kill Bill on a small ass screen?? SOD THAT! Wait until it is released on video?? HELL NO!! So what does one do? One travels about 85 kilometers to the first big town, spends twelve bucks on the train-ticket, an additional 8,30 for the entrance fee in a multiplex far far away from home. In conclusion, one spends a hell of a lot of money and three hours on the train for about two hours of Tarantino on a big screen. When one has done all that, what do one do then you guess? Well, then One hopes that the film does not suck and let me tell you it doesn't.The beginning of Kill Bill is quite rough and that sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is constructed the same way as Pulp Fiction, regarding the fact that the story is not told in it's chronological form. Now I agree with the critics with the fact that Kill Bill does not have too much of a story, but one can see that there is still much to come in Volume II. Not only is The Bride's kept secret from the audience, but the really great and in also surprising ending hints at somewhat more story and more surprises in the second film.I must say that I am a fan of Tarantino's work as a director and I found it astonishing that even with this film he managed to surprise me, for Kill Bill is unlike any of his other films. It bears somewhat a resemblance with Jackie Brown, with which Q dived deeply into another genre of movie-making and that is exactly what he does with Kill Bill. Kill Bill is a martial arts, revenge film, with spaghetti western and anime influences that I must say he mixed astonishingly well, despite having a bit of a with the animated chapter in the film myself in the beginning.The music in the film is (once again) great and the characters, although not all are elaborate and some seem quite shallow are characterized in a believable and good way by the actors. Besides Uma Thurman, who portrays the Bride, I especially liked Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii. The character she portrayed suited her very well and she pulled off the mean and devilish little 'godfather' with style. If Lucy did a really good job, I must say that Uma RULED. I mean she just acted in great fashion and I think this film is her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Maybe some would say that it is even better acting-wise. I do not want to be the judge on that and the only thing I can say is that she is as great as The Bride as she was as Misses Mia Wallace. If you don't believe it, watch the film and especially the 'wake-up' scene. If you don't think that is great acting, you're probably still in the 'Stallone is the best actor ever' phase.The film itself, (yes you read and heard correctly everywhere) is quite brutal, with limbs flying around and blood gushing out of wounds as it does in manga films at times. But the fact is that in my opinion it could have been (and needed be) much more brutal. The thing I am referring to here is the Massacre at the House of Blue Leaves. I mean what the heck was Q thinking when he made the switch from colored film to black and white? Or does this relate to the fact that the American and European version is much less violent than the Asian version of the film? Is it all in color over there and did the film manage to get an R rating because the blood and killing were in black and white instead of being in color? Well I do not know, but I had some real difficulty with the film switching to black and white and I think I would have enjoyed the killing more if it had been in color. I guess I'll see what that was all about when this film comes out on DVD.The carnage and destruction in Kill Bill never gets boring or ridiculous (as it did in Matrix: Revolutions) and despite the fact that some things need getting used to, Kill Bill: Volume I is a film that makes 110 minutes seem pretty short indeed. I agree that there is not much of a story, but then again, the stories of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were not too elaborate either. The thing with Tarantino is, that his execution of a story is always top-notch (including this film). This film may not be as thrilling as Reservoir Dogs, as cool as Pulp Fiction, as complicated and mysterious as Jackie Brown, but I sure as hell enjoyed myself and certainly did not regret having spent so much time and money, since in the end I got something back as well. I for one can't wait until 2004, when The Bride will FINALLY Kill Bill.7,5 out of 10post scriptum: How did the Bride knew it had been four years?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"""God will be cut""","Over the last twenty years cinema, and culture in general, has had a thing for retro chic. In particular, we have developed an appreciation for the charm that lies in things that, even in their day, were considered cheap and shabby. Hence Quentin Tarantino can make a living through the renovation and glorification of the exploitation movie. And also hence he can find some pretty amazing things to make out of it. Having been bolstered by the successes of his first few movies, he was now able to indulge himself in this pure homage.Much can be made of the scintillating gore and graceful violence in Kill Bill, but Tarantino's direction is marked by both its simplicity and humanity. Unusually, given its subject matter, the visual style here has a lot less emphasis confrontation between two characters (as was the case in the continuous stand-offs of previous Tarantino movies) and more upon individuals and quiet detail, as when Uma Thurman inspects her hands after awakening from a coma or catches her reflection in a Hattori Hanzo blade. And this is all very much to the purpose of the story. Whereas there are no clear-cut heroes or villains in Pulp Fiction, in Kill Bill Thurman's is a character we are really supposed route for.Strong characters are brought to life by a strong cast. Thurman is able to portray the cool and collected killer, but on top of that she displays both a feminine softness and likable humanity, exemplified in brief moments like that cheeky twitch in her face as she talks about getting the other little piggies wiggling. The best supporting part is that of Sonny Chiba, humorously charming at first, then displaying a calm dignity. Quite impressive for someone who was for the best part of his career a Japanese Steven Seagal. David Carradine, a favourite actor of mine even before cameras had rolled on Kill Bill, is only seen here as a glimpse of gnarled hands, but he packs enough character into those digits to make his presence felt throughout the movie.Mention must be made of the music in this picture. Tarantino has always picked and chosen diverse pre-existing tunes for his soundtracks, but for Kill Bill the magpie is at his most manic and eclectic. Most of the selections don't make much cultural sense (for example ""The Lonely Shepherd"", which underscores the sword presentation on Okinawa, was performed by Romanian Gheorghe Zamfir) but each fits the mood of the moment, which is what's important. In terms of timing and choreography, he's moulded the scenes around the music and not the other way round, which is a legitimate way of doing things. He's good at it too, selecting images that complement both rhythm and tone. He should make a musical one day.But above all it is a sense of playfulness that make Kill Bill what it is. All the time Tarantino seems to be giving sly winks to the audience, and such self-reference is made acceptable by the exaggerated comic-book nature of it all. The line ""So you understand how serious I am, I'm going to say this in English"" makes no logical sense, but it does mean that Lucy Liu's coolest speech can be delivered without subtitles. Appropriate meanings abound, like the phone ringtone that plays ""Auld Lang Syne"" (old acquaintance, indeed!). Tarantino has utmost respect for those old exploitation movies, but he recognises their limitations when it came to logic and credibility, magnified here as he tries to cram in one B-movie trope after another. In light of this, he simply has fun with the format, and allows the audience to have fun with it too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Artistically done action movie.,"This is director Quentin Tarantino's action epic, an intriguing story about a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad called ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman), who discovers that she is pregnant with her lover Bill's (leader of the squad) child. The Bride decides to escape her life as a killer, and fled to Texas to marry a young man she met. Raved with jealously, Bill (David Carradine) and the squad guns down the Bride's groom-to-be and members of the wedding party. The Bride is left in a coma, and finds her baby gone after she awakens. To find justice, she seeks revenge on the five members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who destroyed her life.This is a movie that is based more on artistry rather than substance, as Chinese and Japanese martial arts are heavily emphasized. To exact revenge, the Bride attempts to learn the skills of martial arts, wielding swords and throwing knifes and punches, to carry on her mission. Instead of a flowing plot, this movie is divided into chapters, with each section delving into one of the Bride's mission or trainings and the background of assassin O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and/or her cohorts, which I thought were tastefully done.The filmmakers really capture the tension and sensitivity when making each chapter, making the audience aware of the danger of the assassins and the Bride's hunger for revenge. Each action scene is thrilling and the part where the Bride and O-Ren Ishii's top bodyguard Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) is my favorite - extreme, intense and suspenseful. Gogo's character is devastatingly beautiful but mercilessly evil.One of the most intense action movies I've seen, this film also has a large supply of bloody action with explicit gore, so, there is a huge warning label or disclaimer for people attempting to watch this.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Should have waited for the Complete DVD!,"Tonight I decided since being bored outta my mind, I would catch the newest Entry by Quentin Tarantino..... KILL BILL.So at approx 10:20pm I decided to leave the house and haul A$$ to the Loews Cineplex to catch the 10:45pm showing.After sitting thru some of the most boring trailers I have ever seen, It was Feature Presentation Time.I loved Quentin's Use of the Old FP backdrop's, but what followed was not worth my time or trouble. The first 15 mins of the film was utterly boring...... Quentin, What are you doing? you are better than this. Then the film begins to pick up pace..... Now the film actually does have it's moment's... Such as The Bride's arrival in Okinawa.... And some of the film's best moment's are played out between the Bride and the Sushi Bartender. Once those comical bits are thru we begin to slip back into the boringness of what is to be the 4th entry for Quentin.(I hope you notice I am not trying to get into detail about the film so I don't spoil it for those whom have not seen it.)Now the Fight scenes are pretty decent..... The Gore is outrageous and at times Extremely over the top...... Come On...... How much blood can you lose, and still be alive. Many Kudo's to KNB Fx..... You can See How much Tom Savini has influenced this company. anyway.Other than the fight scene's.... which are very good. The film's Pace and mood are destroyed by the Use of the obscure Music Quentin Dig's out of the Ole Vault's. The Trailer entices us with a very catchy rhythm...... and it is Featured in the film for about Two minute's....What a shame. That music Is why I wanted to attend Kill Bill in the first Place. Instead I am treated to Music that neither fit's the scene's or provides any help to the film's Story. Maybe I am missing something... Cuz Quentin is Usually very good at music Placement...... But this time...... WOW is it off.My other Peeve is the fact the music is soft.... then Blaring Loud... which in turn makes the film less enjoyable.Kill Bill Vol 1. Should have just been Kill the Volume .... or Kill the DJ..... My other peeve is the fact Miramax made Quentin Cut this film into 2 film's...... I believe had this played in it's entirety..... I think I would have enjoyed it more.Sorry but this is Quentin's Worst entry... So far! and I would not recommend this film to anyone, Especially a QT fan.So in February 2004.....

"A trivial movie, in more ways than one","Though visually enchanting, I fear I must join the army of those who complain that there is no movie here to speak of.  What we have instead is a series of quotes and references that leave you astonished at the breadth of Tarantino's body of trivia, but with no sense that a movie of its own has taken place.The visual brilliance doesn't make up for the many weaknesses of the movie. The characters are thinner than the anime and chop-socky movies he is saluting, the non-linearity of the plot eliminates any suspense about who will win what fight, and 5,6,7,8 drove me crazy.  Tarantino suggests a parallel between this and the Indiana Jones movies, but accepting that only weakens the movie:  there are no human relationships in this movie, unlike even ""Temple of Doom,""  the sense of fun is more pervasive in the Indy movies, and the music...  well I'd rather have seen an attempt to create one's own, rather than borrowing from everything in sight.Perhaps Volume 2 will make the thing hang together better, but Volume 1 is less organic than ""That's Entertainment.""

killbill billkill bill,"There's something not quite right with this film and its hard to put a finger on what it is. The dialogue is sometimes clunky and seems 'copy and pasted' like in the kitchen when the two girls are talking. Then there is the music towards the end of the film when she has the boot open, it's clunky, it seems amateurish and it's deliberate but it detracts greatly from the scene and the dialogue Uma speaks is no better. it's supposed to be tongue in cheek but after repeated viewings its annoying that it's not taken seriously.Aside from that the story is just non existent. It plays out like a series of set pieces, which is fine, which is in-fact great because many of them are spectacular, funny and very well done. What it loses is real depth, tension and a sense of progression such that when you watch this film again you'll be waiting for your favourite scenes to come up and be annoyed with some of the less stellar ones, like the totally ridiculous and boring hack and slash extravaganza with the 86 gang. having said all that it's well worth watching because a lot of works gone into it. It's original, it's different, it's entertaining and it has a quality to it that is rarely found in most films.

I think it's a damn good flick.,"Don't read this if you don't want the plot spoiled a little bit.Well, it's definitely Tarantino. And as it goes I also think it's a little too ""stylized"" in the words of my roommate. The bloody action scenes are a cross between old school kung fu films like ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"" and Monty Python. In essence, I think it was overdone in some places ... an attempt to make the film too campy. It was obvious the director (Tarantino) was striving to achieve the campiness of originals.Also, that whole thing about the coma-raping and Buck - unnecessary. Albeit, it does explain how she got out of the hospital and overcame atrophy, but that could have been done in dozens of other ways without such gratuitous sex-and-violence nonsense. And if I thought it was excessive (and I don't mind the intestine scenes in any of the kung fu films I've seen), then I can only imagine what other folks thought ... especially the Italians I was with in Firenze who don't mind all-out sex scenes, but edit the least bit of blood from everything.However, this didn't mar the cinematography or story. I came away knowing I had seen a movie, and, even if I never suspended disbelief enough to fully lose myself in The Bride's suffering or whatever, I did enjoy a great revenge story. Plus, it had all the classics: the one man (or woman) army against incredible odds, the sword-blade reflection shot, the ridiculous Asian weaponry (the chain-ball-sickle minus the sickle that Go Go Yubari had), and that shot of Uma from underneath the glass dance floor was cool, too.Yes, this movie was a great time and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks that they can stomach it.

"MIA: Quentin's sense of humor, pacing, dialogue...","Throughout this long, relentless contest of wills with his audience, Quentin still displays flashes of skill.But it feels like he's been out of the game so long he isn't even going to try to compete with the edgy movies of the last few years, and retreats headlong into the 70s ethos he knows so well instead.As a Hong-Kong splatter flick, it's too long and emotional, with a few good scenes stranded in otherwise lackluster writing and directorial choices, coming up well short of the genre's best.  As a witty Tarantino neo-noir, it's *too* gory to be chilling or effective, too straightforward to be really clever or engaging, too monotonous to impress an audience with Matrixes and Ring-quests fresh in their minds.Simply put, 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' (and even 'Jackie Brown') *resembled* classic noirish gangster movies, but were actually *much better* than the source movies that inspired them.Sadly, Quentin may now be far gone enough to want to pay such loving tribute to the 70sploitation era that he will completely hide his talent to create a *true* b-movie, one that hits every note so (im)perfectly it's just as forgettable, meaningless, and poorly assembled, as the movies to which he's paying homage.I'll reserve final judgment until Vol. 2 comes out, but until then, I'd only recommend this one to indiscriminate fans of action movies and bad, really bad, 70s fare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The big fight - which is basically a ballet with severed limbs. Impressive. The occasional little quirk here and there.But overall the dialogue was bad to terrible (I don't care if it's intentional), there was almost NO story to speak of, what there was was utterly predictable, and the pace of the movie frequently dragged.Watching this was like watching someone else play a video game.

OTT or Tongue in Cheek?,"I could write so very many pages on Kill Bill and still not cover everything that is buzzing around my tiny mind. This is a film that is thought provoking, but not in the way you would expect.I sat for hours wondering what Tarantino was on when he made this, he randomly cuts from one style of filming to another without any kind of warning. But this is not a bad thing, because somehow it all works. Everything he does with the style of the film is pulled off with ease (switching from full colour to black & white, back to colour, then to blue with silhouettes and even at one point, to animation)Tarantino is one of very few men who would dare to try something like his, and probably the only man who could pull it off as well as he did without audiences laughing in his face.Kill Bill also has a great 70s feel to it from everything to the soundtrack to the yellow title cards and subtitles, which, although slightly cheesy at times, still makes it a fun film to watch.There is one thing, however, that I can't decide. There was lots and lots and lots (etc) of blood shed in this movie, which is fine: people are going to bleed if you hack their limbs off, but is it really going to shoot out over 30 metres at a rate of a pint a second? This little gripe still didn't take anything away from the fact that this is a fantastic movie, but I just cannot make my mind up whether QT was being OTT or doing it Tongue in Cheek.Either way, I'm sure Tarantino knew what he was doing: entertaining audiences. And that is exactly what he did.9.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Honestly,Is this a Quentin Tarantino film?","When i first saw this movie i was taken aback from all the action, a thing that made it interesting.The plot was quite good, A mother taking revenge for the death of her child and driving all the way to kill the persons who are responsible for her death. I said wtf when i saw Uma therman fighting with a woman in the first chapter and the little girl walking in the house seeing those 2 women in blood and those 2 saying that the dog had made all this mess.... the most stupid thing i have ever heard and it is unexcusable, cos since the movie contains small dialogues they should have given detail to them... of course kill bill 1 was a lot better than the second but it deserved the 7/10 for all the exaggeration it was made to it.All in all, i hope that quentin Tarantino tries to make more serious films in the future and ditch all these i don't even know how to call them...( everyone should watch pulp fiction and compare it to kill bill...)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

I've never seen a movie like this before.,"Before watching this the preview for the film made me doubt that it would be any good.  Uma Thurman wearing a Bruce Lee suit as a hero? I just couldn't imagine Uma Thurman being an action star I suppose.  Well after watching it I've never quite seen a movie like this.  The cinematography alone was worth the price of admission.  This movie has very bright colors and excellent camera angles.  Every scene in the movie has been burnt into my memory. Some more than others, but I know I won't forget this movie any time in the future. The fight scenes were great, I've never seen a movie so ridiculously bloody (that weren't animes).  I was laughing every time I saw a limb cut off followed by a fire hose amount of blood squirting everywhere.  It was like watching a live action anime.  Some of the scenes were just so great like the scene where Lucy Lui has the bosses gathered around the table and she cuts the insolent one's head off.  I liked all the scenes with Sonny Chiba they were great.  And of course the ending battle was outstanding.  I'm glad the rope jumping was kept to a minimal, it always bothered me in other movies.

My Second Review of Kill Bill Volume 1,"My Rating: **** out of ****.As I said in my first review of Kill Bill Volume 1, I would write a second review after I saw Kill Bill Volume 2. When I reviewed it I said that I really enjoyed it, yet I had a few complaints about how Tarantino wanted to rip me off and that this was an incomplete film. I said that Volume 2 would have to fill in the holes for me to change my rating. Well Volume 2 filled in the holes and it did brilliantly. However, after seeing Volume 2 in the theater, I had the urge to buy Volume 1 on DVD. So I did and I finally watched it tonight. I must say after seeing Volume 2, it strengthens Volume 1 in an astonishing way.Nevertheless, I would still like to see the films edited into a whole. Volume 1 is an exhilarating masterpiece on its own and Volume 2 brilliantly fills in the backstory, while adding an emotional resonance to the story. But together they might make a masterpiece to challenge Tarantino's top two films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. There is an advantage to cutting Kill Bill into two films, which has to do with the different tones of the films. However, I think Kill Bill could really shine as one film. We shall see when Tarantino decides to release the DVD.Some people complain that Kill Bill doesn't have the great dialogue that was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and to some extent, Jackie Brown. Well it is true that this is not the brilliant, snappy dialogue that Tarantino penned in his other films but the dialogue here works. It's not the dialogue I delight in hearing in Dogs and Pulp but it fits here. I do not feel it is a flaw like some other reviewers have thought, I think it's an asset.On the DVD, it is said that Tarantino and Uma Thurman came up with the idea for Kill Bill on the set of Pulp Fiction. Well you can definitely see that here. Volume 1 is their movie (maybe another reason for the split), more people get involved in Volume 2 (David Carradine, Daryl Hannah for example) but this is Tarantino's and Thurman's movie here. You clearly see that in the movie.Uma Thurman dominates the screen like never before. She carries as much screen presence as any action star and shes got more than enough acting talent required for the role. Other actors in the film, such as Lucy Liu, Sonny Chiba, have supporting roles. From an acting standpoint, this is Thurman's movie and she makes that perfectly clear. Her performance in Volume 2 was the more accomplished one but she is terrific here. Thurman developed the Bride into more of a person in Volume 2; here she is more of an icon. However, that being said, I thought Thurman added some humanity to the role in Volume 1. She is a woman bent on revenge, but I did sense the Bride was a real person.The rest of the cast offers their support. Lucy Liu is effective as O-Ren. Sonny Chiba should be given credit, he makes Hattori Hanzo into a memorable character for not much screentime. Vivica Fox does a good job in her limited screentime. Daryl Hannah makes a brief appearance and makes an impression. Michael Madsen and David Carradine show up in Volume 2.This is also clearly Tarantino's film. Volume 1 is packed with style. Tarantino's stylistic techniques here are all creative and don't seem excessive. The slo-mo scene of O-Ren and her crew walking toward us is memorable. The split screen technique is used perfectly in one scene (a homage to Brian De Palma). The most unique technique Tarantino uses is an anime sequence to tell the backstory of O-Ren. The sequence is incredibly violent and beautiful in a deadly way. From a stylistic point of view, Volume 1 maybe Tarantino's most memorable film (although Volume 2 is certainly a contender).However, it's the action scenes that prove that as a director Tarantino is in peak form. The smaller battle between The Bride and Vernita is handled well. But the showdown at the The House of Leaves is a tour de force. It's just an exhilarating fight scene that bests any fight scene I have seen in years. In fact, the only fight sequence I have seen recently that comes close was the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver in Volume 2.The fight sequence between The Bride and O-Ren really deserves mention. It was a beautifully photographed and expertly handled scene. It was the most beautiful moment in any Tarantino film. I read a review of Tarantino's Jackie Brown that said Tarantino was not a great visuals director, well I bet they would change their mind after watching that scene. I also credit cinematographer Robert Richardson for making that scene look as great as it did (How he did not receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography, I will never know).In the end, Kill Bill Volume 1 is just an exhilarating film that is technically brilliant in every area. It does not have much depth (more of that comes in Volume 2), but it's the kind of film that does not need to be incredibly deep. It's the director's work that is masterful here and the leading actress deserves a tremendous amount of credit too. With Kill Bill Volume 1, ""Q and U"" have given us a masterpiece and it is sure to be come a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A fun romp in a pool of blood.,"Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a fun movie, if you don't mind blood and the occasional slow stretch. It's difficult to call it full of gore, because the blood is so over the top it is not scary or disguisting but just funny. Trying to call Kill Bill Vol. 1 a real action movie would be like trying to call Army of Darkness a real horror movie.I went to see this with a friend, and we laughed through most of the movie. So did most of the others, except for a few people who went pale and ran out the door.It suffers from some issues with pacing, and a backstory sequence done in an anime style is either brilliant or obnoxious, depending on what you think of anime. It probably could have done better with a bit of tightening.At present it is massively overrated in IMDB. If you got here by noticing it in the top 100, pass on it and look for another choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Misconception,"It appears that many people do not have a full grasp of the types of films that Quentin Tarantino is involved in. If some one went to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and expected a classic martial arts film, or a serious drama, or action coated eye candy then they would not have been greeted with what they expected. Tarantino is famous for his dark humor. Sometimes it is a little too dark and too subtle. That is why the people that like him LOVE him and the people that do not like his work generally do not understand him. His humor is often so subtle, a good majority of his audience does not pick it up. I myself do not understand many things that go on in his movies or why they happened however I often find myself chuckling to myself regardless. Perhaps this is part of Tarantino's appeal in his ability to leave people in the dark about so many things and let his audience draw their own conclusions. In the case of Kill Bill there is the matter of the cheap blood, the long anime scenes, the beep over Uma's name, etc. We do not understand why these things happen but many must admit they were strangely entertained by ever odd occurrence. It is fun for things to be left for the audience to ponder and let their own imaginations run wild. That is why we all love Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Jackie Brown.GO QUENTIN TARANTINO!!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A modern piece of art.,"Since the first second, this movie will capture you and won't let you go until the equally shocking end. There are not five minutes without a charge of extraordinary elements that shows you the genius mind of the Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino.This tribute to the old Asian martial arts movies is without a doubt a modern piece of art. It has a very exquisite photography, one frame describes one thousand things. The Soundtrack like in every Tarantino's film has an important role and fits perfectly. And the performance of Uma Thurman is brilliant.If you don't like violence or fighting movies you won't be that thrilled, but this isn't any random fighting movie. This film includes an anime sequence which shows in a better way the emotions, feelings and even the souls of the characters, just by looking at their faces. It has a black and white fight scene worthy of an epic movie and a big amount of blood that for some people is not necessary but it is there to create the visual impact that the director wants.Watching this movie is an experience for every cinema addict and it will makes you think about how revenge can become an obsession and if it is justified.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A True Bloody Piece Of Work,"Quentin Tarantino conceives Kill Bill as an homage to grindhouse cinema, including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns. It's an ultraviolent exercise in pure visceral action and spectacle with a succession of increasingly incredible and insane setpieces culminating in some of the greatest fight scenes in film history. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta.It stars Uma Thurman as The Bride or Black Mamba (that's her best role out of her carrer), Lucy Liu as her opponent, O-Ren Ishii (again also her best role yet), Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo and David Carradine as Bill. The story may be simple but it's really interesting and touching at some point. The direction, the cinematography, the dialogue, the music, the performances, the fight sequences... they are all perfect! I'm glad Tarantino made a movie like this, an homage to asian cinema and spaghetti westerns, and not again a gangster movie. I can proudly say that this is my favorite movie of all time! And of course, as I expected, even better than the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino at his most badass,"""Those of you lucky enough to have your lives, take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.""Ellen Ripely will always be my favorite film heroine, but Beatrix Kiddo is a very close second.Pretty much all of Tarantino's films could be considered escapist cinema. But for my money, Kill Bill feels like his most escapist film, in other words, I think it just might be his moviest movie. It's certainly his most stylized and visually ambitious film.Tarantino takes arguably the oldest storytelling device of all time, vengeance, and concocted a martial arts revenge thriller with added elements of a spaghetti western that results in a two-part epic that is filled with kung fu, sword fights, gore, pulpy characters, anime, one of the greatest soundtracks of all time, and a conclusion that just might be Tarantino at his most heartfelt.Vol 1. Is the action-heavy side of the Kill Bill duology and it's executed to perfection, thanks in large part to Yuen Woo Ping's masterful fight choreography (he also choreographed The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).This is Tarantino's love letter to the action genre, specifically the martial arts action genre. The film even opens up with the classic Shaw Brothers production title that has been often seen by many a kung fu enthusiast, myself included. Gordon Liu, who is arguably the most renowned actor of the Shaw Brothers' golden age of Kung Fu films, plays two parts in the Kill Bill series. In Vol. 1 he is the leader of the Crazy 88, Johnny Mo, and in Vol. 2 he is Master Pai Mei which once again if you're a kung fu film fanatic, this is a character that you should be very familiar with.The great Sonny Chiba (best known for The Street Fighter) plays legendary sword maker Hattori Hanzo, which is also a character that Chiba played on the Ninja TV series Shadow Warriors. I mean the amount of Easter eggs and homages to kung fu/martial arts cinema featured in Kill Bill is pretty staggering.But even if you're not familiar with all of the obscure references, Kill Bill still manages to be an absurdly entertaining and expertly made blood-soaked tale about a yellow haired-warrior looking to claim her vengeance on the group of assassins who took her life away. Kill Bill is about as badass as a film can get.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Bad Ass, Kick Ass, Female Empowerment","Fun, fanatic and even at-times freaky - Kill Bill defies the boundaries of film as Quentin Tarantino comes up trumps once again.A pregnant assassin, code-named The Bride, goes into a coma for four years after her ex-boss Bill brutally attacks her. When she wakes up, she sets out to seek revenge on him and his associates.Not that anybody would question Uma Thurman's acting range, but her versatility is epitomised in her portrayal of the 'kick-ass' Bride, a name that somewhat juxtaposes her personality - the cold-hearted killer embarks on her quest with real intent, and we as viewers are enthralled on this journey, enticed by her every move and what's most fulfilling, is the laughs cleverly embedded by Tarantino and Robert Richardson (screenplay) both of whom adapted the script from the 1973 Japanese film: Lady Snowblood.The film possesses an organic feel of thrill throughout which compliments its narrow structure in that the picture is centred on its core plot focus. Keeping its fast-paced forward movement, Kill Bill is a unique production of cinematography which is the main reason to why its success grossed over $180 million in the Box Office - not bad for 2003.A landmark of film culture; presenting a faultless premise in a special manner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I thought it was better...,"Tarantino is back after some years with this new movie called ""Kill Bill"". I hoped this movie would be a nice fresh wind and come up with something new, but it isn't.

She is doing a great job. I fall in sleep the first half hour. I can compare this movie with an average Jackie Chan kung fu movie. I hope mr. Tarantino is putting him self together to the next movie.

Brilliant. Thrilling. Comedic. Intelligent.,"Before I watched this movie, I was intrigued by the title itself. Kill Bill. It was a one of a kind title design, simple but enough to catch attention. The action scenes were fantastic and I must say that the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green was excellent. The fight was perfectly choreographed and was realistic. The showdown at the House of Blue Leaves was a perfect climax. The casting was also perfect. All the actors in this movie did a great job in portraying their respective characters. They brought life to their characters by showing off emotions of guilt and maleficence, Vernita Green and O-ren Ishii in particular. Daryl Hannah did an excellent portrayal of Elle Driver as the guiltless and wicked assassin who has no feeling of remorse. Most of all, Quentin Tarantino proved that he is a master of his genre. He was successful in blending several film genres into one exceptional movie. The only flaw I saw in this movie is the legal implication of The Bride's actions, for example: She killed Buck and escaped from the hospital and was able to stay in Buck's truck for 13 hours without being searched (at that point the police must have traced her in the truck, unless the police in the community were not cautious enough). However that flaw was overshadowed by the movie's excellent story and intelligent conversations. The story is simple yet assertive and provocative. This is a movie that I must have watched a hundred times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Amazingly boring piece of crap,"Oh my! Tarantino really lost it this time. RESERVOIR DOGS was his only really good film in my book, PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN were enjoyable but rather derivative. Let's face it! If you know your b-movie history there is hardly anything original or challenging in an Tarantino movie. KILL BILL is even more annoying, as it is really boring and tame compared with the movies it rips of. Give me the original 70s Sonny Chiba films, anything by Chang Cheh or Lui Chia-Liang any day. Hell, even the Flying Guillotine. The SAMURAI FICTION sequence replacing the red background with simply a blue one was the most annoying one for me. I never believes Uma Thurman to be capable of the things she does in the movie. I won't bore you with all the plot holes this movie has. Unbelievably sloppy in any way. And the music (f*cking panflute music of Zamphir, get me the hell out of here!). This, my friends, is no labor of love, this is not even a good puzzle of hommages to other (more capable) filmmakers.

Very nice,"Alright. I just got back from seeing the latest Tarantino offering, Kill Bill. From the very first frame of the film, I knew I was in for a treat. The opening production credits sent me back in time, to when my mom and dad would take me to see kung fu B-movies. Dusty, dirty, film footage, accompanied by a scratchy, wonkey soundtrack (a la Godzilla) Then the first 10 minutes of the movie had me wondering if I would be walking out, because it is going to be too graphic. But it was nothing like Reservoir Dogs, where I almost did do so. This movie was stylish, sexy, funny and sad all at the same time. The fight scenes were remarkable. Especially one that takes place between Uma and a sexy little Japanese Schoolgirl. Though there were a lot of limbs and heads lopped off, Tarantino made it gory, but ridiculously funny at the same time. This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen this year. Obviously not for everyone (a few people walked out), this film is best not taken too seriously.

Kill Bill: Vol.1 (2003) - One of Tarantino's Finest Films!,"Considered as one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies, ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" is the first volume in a series of two movies, starring Uma Thurman as the Bride, a woman seeking revenge on a past lover, portrayed by David Carradine, for losing her pregnant baby, while ending up in a coma. The entire 111-minute motion picture is filled with well-choreographed martial arts sequences. They perfectly help tell the story in such a visionary fashion, and let's all be honest with ourselves, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is exciting as hell. After her excellent supporting performance in Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", Uma Thurman brings yet another excellent portrayal as a woman seeking revenge to those who ruined her life. Besides Thurman and Carridane, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and Julie Dreyfus provide excellent supporting performances to add more enjoyment to this motion picture. Filled with creative anime sequences, graphic killing scenes, and scenes filled with blood, ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" is probably a lot of fun, that you forget where that 111-minute run time went. The first volume of Kill Bill is more seen as a tribute to the classic martial arts movies of the modern era, such as Hong Kong martial arts films, spaghetti westerns, and revenge flicks.

Violence without Reason,"I didn't enjoy this movie. First let me say that I watched it on video because it didn't seem like the type of film I would enjoy paying 15 bucks for (gotta love those New York City theaters). When I finally rented it, it took me three days to get through. Each day I would sit determinedly and try to appreciate Tarantino's work. Each day I would continue to try because I had friends, whose opinions I respected, who told me that it was ""even better than pulp fiction"" (and I loved pulp fiction). And each day I would find myself switching off the set, in some sort of knee-jerk reaction stemming from my own disgust. I'm not going to accuse Tarantino of plagiarism; I could care less (the greatest Artists throughout history have always borrowed). I'm not going to criticize the film for it's pace or filming (that was something I couldn't even gauge as I was distracted by my more guttural misgivings). I'm not even going to criticize it for it's rather shallow dialogue (people tell me that that is a style). All I want to know is why the excessive violence? Why do we revel in death (and not just in death but in horrible gory death involving geysers of blood and gore). I've always wondered why a film can be rated PG-13 and have scenes of rather graphic violence, but if there is even any reference to the sex act (the use of the word f*ck [I can't even use it here]) the film is rated R. Violence is a destructive act Sex is a creative one, why do we (Americans especially) find the former more offensive?But of course, I've become sidetracked by my own sensibilities. Let me now make it abundantly clear that I have no problem with violence when it is used by a filmmaker (even in excess) to express a point. I loved Pulp fiction because the senseless violence was juxtaposed to the rather overly logical musings of it's characters, the fact that a deep discussion regarding divine intervention and miracles is immediately followed by, (without any segue way) ""I just shot Marvin in the face!"" I loved Apocalypse Now because the rather gruesome moments illustrated the sheer madness one encounters in an armed conflict: ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning..."" But unless someone can tell me what point Tarantino was trying to make with the excessive violence of Kill Bill (and don't give me simple revenge, for that excessively meaningful rational I could just watch pro-wrestling) I, personally, refuse to classify this film (as so many have) as art. I would simply call it gratuitous, bloodlust-based entertainment no nobler than a public execution. And if you're into public execution than I apologize, but I doubt you and I will ever have a productive discussion of Aesthetic value.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Through out Tarantino's super- charged first volume of the film, she basically goes around seeking revenge on those who betrayed her. The supporting cast features Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, and Sonny Chiba. Each cast member does fine in their respective roles, especially Thurman who manages to make the role seem realistic, and she also did well in her more emotional scene(s). The cinematography by Veteran director of photography Robert Richardson is beautiful to look at. The fight scenes are totally convincing, and the change to black and white flashback and at one point, an anime scene completely fits the film. Quentin Tarantino's screen- play is mostly filled with brutal fights and Japanese speaking, which is a bit surprising. Usually Tarantino's dialogue is the key element to his films, but it seems there will be a lot more to come in the February release of Volume 2. The direction by Tarantino is as the title of this review mentions: energetic and creative. It's definitely a throw- back to Kung Fu films, but Tarantino adds his own style here and there, making the film a blast to watch. The violence is often comical, especially since blood comes out of limbs like sprinklers. All in all, Kill Bill: Volume 1 is a must see. Solid performances, great direction, spectacular cinematography and more make this one very enjoyable movie experience. 9.75/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Delicious and colorful tension with that sporty retro spirit.,"With a blink of an eye, or removal of one, Kill Bill delivers a masterfully and deliciously edited story of a bride fixated on revenge. Paced for a new generation, Kill Bill doesn't simply pay homage via the film genre cooking recipe, it packages each scene as if it's a ""greatest hits"" compilation. Don't flinch due to the sword induced refugee limbs as the storytelling is enhanced by the blood fireworks on display due to the rampage of The Bride. Uma Thurman wins as the ultimate heroine in chic glory. It's her story that Quintan orchestrates as diligently as we've come to expect. The sound track deserves merit, carrying long scenes, and has become a usual character in each Tarantino experience with that sporty retro spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A movie that defines a genre!,"I write this review, 2 minutes after watching the movie for the first time and without having watched the sequel. In three words, I was thrilled!!To be honest, having seen most of Tarantino's work, I was expecting a great film but since I had never been the most fanatic admirer of Tarantino (I am more into Lynch kind of movies), my expectations were kind of average.The close-ups of the director that are full of expresiveness and built-up emotion, the relatively random songs right in the middle of the tense fights, the contrast of colour throughout the whole film make this movie uinque, really unique.As my friends told me, I am sure that this film hides a long list of references that my level of film critic do not allow to understand and judge. I am also sure that after watching the next film and read all these critics, I will engage in a long round of tracing the inspirations of Kill Bill in classic movies of another era. However, I can say one thing right now:Kill Bill is a masterpiece and Tarantino is rightly standing in the hall of fame of the greatest directors of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Excellent Action Film,"An intelligent style, graphic fighting scenes and an entertaining story make this film a must see. The story mix modern society with ancient martial arts in a fast pace full of adrenaline race to find Bill. The sword fights is an important part of the movie as we see in the past director Tarantino uses sword and Karate/Kun-Fu reference almost in every film he have (In Pulp Fiction's store scene Bruce Willies can pick any weapon but instead choses a sword).This is a movie with a unique screen write and a story that goes back and forward so we can get the picture when necessary in a way that we understand her reasons to hate Bill so much that will not stop until killing him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Exciting, captivating and enthralling! Gosh I just love this film.","Kill Bill is a film that has aged like fine wine. This is probably the best Tarantino movie for me after Pulp fiction. Uma Thurman is so damn good in this. Her voice is fascinating and the dialogues, both in Japanese in English coming out of her mouth were so soothing to my ears. She acts with her eyes for the most part. Her expressions are a treat to the eyes. That's enough of simping on her, now let's talk some about the movie lolTarantino is regarded highly by every self respecting cinephile, there's no doubt in that. He picks up some of the most interesting things, shots, scenes from other works and compiles them into one hell of a film.In Kill bill he pays an ode to Bruce Lee's old action movies such as Enter the dragon by directing the action sequences inspired from those movies. And he does it flawlessly. Some of the coolest action scenes you will ever see. Also I love how Tarantino decided to incorporate some Japanese Anime style animation to show some back story keeping in line with the rising popularity of anime around the time this film was released. It was something weebs like me would appreciate very much and it only makes the film more special for us. This film is filled with gorgeous visuals and the dialogues and acting are so great which in all make for an extremely exciting movie watching experience.Definitely top Tarantino film after Pulp fiction for me!Captivating. 10/10 film for me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Can't see why non-cinephiles love it this much.,"I am a Cinephile and I do think ""Kill Bill vol 1"" is a fine movie.  Like ""The Dreamers"" however, I can't see why become such rabid fans when most of them clearly don't get the references.There is nothing wrong with not being an obsessed movie nerd like myself, in fact it's probably a healthier choice in most respects, but some movies are made for people who have seen a number of films past the 3,000 mark and this seems like one of them.  But like ""the dreamers"" with it's overwhelming sexuality, it's got edginess on it's side: tons, and tons and tonsandtonsandtons of violence.Every shot, character, line, theme and musical cue seems stolen from another movie.  sometimes you can pinpoint the exact one, sometimes you can't, but it tends to keep you smiling and planning to tear into imdb when it's over. It's over-the-top (not an ""epic"" by any means as some have described it) and more importantly, doesn't take itself seriously, which would have been a tragic mistake.  And certainly it is fun to watch... again especially if you think it's funny the way fragments of other movies are being subtly pieced together for comic value.but plenty of people casually call this their favorite movie, but i submit that by combining a bunch of fragments of movies for the sake of doing so one cannot produce a whole greater than the sum of its parts.a WORTHY 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Oh revenge . . . sweet, bloody revenge.","Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the first half of a two-part epic revenge film that leaves you excited too see the 2nd volume after watching it. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"". Well, one can truly see where that quote is coming from after watching a film like this one. We all know violence is a big factor in Quentin Tarantino movies. But after witnessing the amount of blood and gore Kill Bill has, Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs or Django Unchained don't seem so violent. Sure, the brutal action plays a major part in this film however; it's not just that. It's the gripping characters, the memorable quotes, Lucy Liu & Uma Thurman's performances, and of course, the storyline that makes Kill Bill Vol. 1 definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
doesn't live up to expectations... (!some minor spoilers!),"...and my expectations weren't that high to start with. Kill Bill vol. 1 has its fine moments, though never really memorable. The fight scenes are quite gory and over the top, but not truly shocking nor are they genuinely funny in their wackiness. The characters are rather flat and most of the times recite dull lines in boring dialogue. I don't know what to make of this film, because the ambitions are unclear. If it was to show the audience what a great actress Uma Thurman is, then the least they could to was to give some more depth to her character. Now she's just a cold, vengeful killer in yellow leather with a katana blade. I remained completely neutral towards The Bride throughout the whole film. Did Tarantino want to show how well he could write a screenplay on his own? He falls short. The story never comes alive, not even with the little - rather predictable - twist at the very end of vol. 1. I definitely will go and see vol. 2, but only to watch the end of the story with my own eyes instead of having other people tell me. The fate of the Bride and Bill doesn't affect me one bit, and that's something I regret.Parts that are very OK though: the sunglasses on the dashboard, the anime part and the bickering between Hattori Hanzo and his assistant.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A great movie but not for everyone,I watched this movie last year I love it but however it is not everyone for those who what to watch it I will warn you it gets a bit gruesome at times but it's a great I love it a lot it was a great story but as I said not for everyone.I watched both Volume 1 & 2 and guess what I'm 14 (turning 15) and I watched some teachers were shocked that I watched.My favorite volume of this movie was second half it was less gruesome but one scene I couldn't look at.My favorite character is The Bride.Kill Bill is a great movie but not for everyone.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Holy cow, all of that katana action.","While this movie does come across as a bit cartoonish (literally in some parts), that's actually turned into a positive thing in the film and Tarantino is always great with how he just makes a movie fit his style and adds his own unique signature to a production. The entire scene in the Japanese night club and all of the action that takes place there is fine filmmaking and makes the movie for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Very Entertaining and Signature Tarantino,"Kill Bill 1 is a classic revenge thriller that showcases Tarantino's love for stylish violence and cinematic homage. The film is a non-stop ride of action and bloodshed that follows the Bride played by Thurman, a former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, as she seeks revenge against her former teammates who betrayed her on her wedding day.The film's most notable strength is its stylish and captivating visuals. Tarantino's attention to detail in each shot is evident, with vibrant color schemes, unique camera angles, and creative transitions. The fight scenes are choreographed to perfection, with Uma Thurman delivering an outstanding performance as The Bride. The soundtrack is also a highlight of the film, featuring classic tracks from artists such as Nancy Sinatra and RZA.While the film's entertainment value is high, it may not be for everyone, due to the graphic and extreme violence, which may be off-putting to some. Additionally, the film's pacing felt a bit disjointed at times, with abrupt shifts in tone and narrative that were a bit confusing.Despite these flaws however, Kill Bill 1 remains a classic revenge thriller that is sure to satisfy fans of Tarantino's work. The film's creative visuals, exceptional fight scenes, and memorable soundtrack make it an entertaining and thrilling ride from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Incredible modern Kung-Fu Classic from Quentin Tarantino,"Everything about this film is great. The action and sound design is top notch, aswell as the casting which puts female empowerment to the forefront with it's choice of actors from Uma Thurman to Lucy Liu. The story is entertaining with and incredible animated sequence aswell. Overall it's just an incredible revenge story where Tarantino continues to improve his form of filmmaking with masterfully directed action and visual storytelling.Even more than 15 years after it's release it still shines as one of Quentin's best, being the first part of an incredible double feature. Everything from the casting, dialogue, sound, music and visuals is all stellar. It's just an excellent modern Kung-Fu classic. Se it if you haven't seen it already",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Amazing. But what do you expect from Tarantino?,"Quentin Tarantino does what he does best in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, his fourth film. The movie sees The Bride (Uma Thurman) who decides to escape her life as a killer. She fled to Texas, met a young man, and on the day of their wedding was gunned down. Four years later she wakes from a coma and discovers her baby is gone. She decides to get revenge on the people who were responsible for her death.It's pretty mind blowing and gruesome stuff, but that's what Tarantino is known for. The blood is so gratuitous but that's what makes it brilliant. As with Tarantino's other films, he mixes dark humour with peril and mixes it amazingly well. None of it is pointless and none of it takes anything away from the story. It just flows seamlessly.Uma Thurman is superb in the role of 'The Bride'; the vicious woman seeking revenge on Bill. You can really feel her rage and determination as she ticks off the people on her 'death list'. Lucy Liu also does a fine job of portraying O-Ren Ishii; one of the five people who played a part in almost ending her life.The lengthy sword fight scene will keep you wanting more and the cliffhanger will ensure you will want to watch Kill Bill: Vol 2. Brilliant.http://ukmore.tk/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The Moose Hole - Review of Kill Bill (Volume I),"`Revenge is a dish best served cold.'Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and the first one since 1997's Jackie Brown takes the theme of revenge like Hamlet on steroids. It has not been an easy road for this generation's `It' director. Tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for Reservoir Dogs that he later directed. It was his directorial effort in 1994's Pulp Fiction that catapulted Tarantino, as well as the independent film company Miramax, into the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately his next film, Jackie Brown, which, by the way, was not written by him, was not widely accepted and then Quentin Tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years. In that time period he took time off to act in some films but, for the most part, the idea for Kill Bill had been bouncing around in his skull. Now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing, gut splattering glory reuniting Pulp Fiction star, Uma Thurman, with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70's karate films that many us grew up with.The story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc√©, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins. They better watch out because here comes the bride! The story for Kill Bill (Volume I) is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot. In a wonderful bit of technique, Tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge. He then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter. This gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour feature.A relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film. Uma Thurman, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's breakout film, Pulp Fiction, once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance. Thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as The Bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues. She presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point. Lucy Liu has another kick-ass character performance as O-Ren Ishi, the leader of a group of Japanese assassins. The only problem with this role is that it makes Liu feel type-casted into this sort of character. Not that she bad at it, she's extremely effective in her performance, but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment. Vivica A. Fox doesn't really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves, which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film. This is only a small portion of the full cast, the rest of which will appear in Kill Bill (Volume II) coming February 20th.Overall, Kill Bill (Volume I) is a wonderful kick-off point for Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction, despite only being half of the entire feature. Though that being said, there are a couple of things to pick at including the well-choreographed action sequences. It wasn't exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats. Granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain? The campy style of violence that occurs in Kill Bill (Volume I) may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end, it doesn't seem so unnatural, which says something our culture's customization to violence and bloodshed in films. The pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spin-chilling conclusion for the time being. But other then those small squabbles, Quentin Tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled. It is said in the film, revenge is like a forest. Men (and women) can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going, so caution must be taken when start off on this path. The famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning; let's hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promises.My Rating: **** ¬Ω out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Too silly for Tarantino,"So I finally saw ""Kill Bill"", Tarantino's fourth movie. UUUUUUuuuuuuuuu. To be honest, I'm kind of glad I didn't get the chance to see it in the cinema, it was kind of a bummer watching it over at my friend's house. The first half or so is, apart from the dry script, more or less great, brilliant cinematography, great music and there's a true Tarantino-ish feel to it. But the big fight in the end is overly silly and spoils the atmosphere filled with anticipation. Really cheesy blood effects that were perhaps intentionally cheesy get tiresome after the first dozen cut off limbs or so, and the whole movie just seems to loose its edge and witt. I definitely want to see the second volume, just this time anticipation will be left at home. A really nice nostalgic and cinematographic effort by the foot fetish director. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Somewhat disappointing,"Granted, it is hard to follow as auspicious a beginning as this movie has, opening as it does with a Klingon proverb, but I generally expected more from Tarantino. His trade mark quirky characters, dialogue and scenes are almost absent from this movie, and all we are left with is an above average turbo Hong Kong flick. Don't get me wrong, I dig a super violent no-brainer as much as the next guy, but there are a lot of guys out there who can do that with this kind of budget, and after a six-year hiatus from Tarantino, this is a disappointment. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Hardly a film,"Frequently boring, extremely disjointed, and way too self-congratulatory. My biggest personal pet peeve was that it was very noncinematic in its heavy use of  voiceover narration, on-screen titles, and speechifying by characters. I like film to convey points of plot and character and mood and attitude through imagery and action... that's what the medium excels at, no? To have these points conveyed through narration and bad dialogue is inexcusable to me. As for the vaunted action sequences... yes, they are well done, but I found myself wanting to go home and watch all of a Leone western, or a early-70's Japanese pop-Samurai film, or ""Battle Royale,"" or one of my favorite HK action flicks, rather than Tarantino's far-too-short pastiches of same. I so desperately want this film to bomb at the box office. If this travesty spawns imitators, I'm packing it in and bidding farewell to multiplex cinema. On a positive note, Uma was enjoyable in the lead and Lucy Liu made a fine villainess. It was great to see Sonny Chiba on the big screen, also.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Best,"This is the best Martial arts movie I've ever seen. You have to look at part one and two as a whole. Its not the best movie ever made so it does have some flaws. But for me the plot, action, cinematography this is the best that I have seen. Tarantino when he made this established himself as my favorite Director/writer in the biz. I hope there is a part 3 one day, only one can hope. Only flaw I can really point to in the film is the fake CGI floating in the air in one of the fight scene that mimic Crouching tiger hidden dragon. But as I understand it this film was also suppose to be a tribute to all the early martial arts movies and although I don't like that part its only in one part really and is bearable and doesn't wreck the fight scene. If I could give the film a 9.5 I would but I can't so a 10 is good enough I guess.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"Wow, that's overrated","I know.  Every time we get a Tarantino film we get those who love it and those who don't.  Those who praise it as a hallmark of cinematic stylistics, and those who think it's a pretentious piece of poop.  Well, guess what, up until this film, I wasn't part of the latter group. But Mr. Tarantino went and screwed himself up.  Written as a homage to the samurai films of the 60's, Kill Bill lacked substance, which was not the case in Pulp Fiction or Resevoir Dogs.  This movie was totally lacking plot, and Tarantino thought he could make up for it by shoving in a feminist edge and story line, couple it with, admittedly, excellent direction (the shot set-ups and colourization were awesome) and he expects to get praise.  Well he did.  Tarantino went out there, continuing on his trend of rethinking the film genres.  First it was gangster films (Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), and then it was blaxploitation.  Why does he resurrect these dead film genres and skewer their traditions?  To get attention.  Once all the commentary has been said, he can go in and make it seem like he's brilliant.  The guy's a great director, but he's a lousy writer.  This film took a terrible, wafer-thin plot, mixed it with a storyline that most critics would be afraid to disapprove of, and threw in some great mise-en-scene.  And for this, he's one of the greats?  No, sorry.  The greats made their own classics.   They didn't pick on genres already gone by in a pointless fashion. But, he'll continue to do this, and people will continue to praise it... or not.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

First of all, what I want to say is that Kill Bill: Volume 2 needs to be watched in order for the movie to be understood and achieve its purpose. Because the film is actually one film, but because it was too long, it was divided into two parts, and it is already recorded as Quentin Tarantino's fourth film. The division of the film into episodes reinforced its watchability. As the authorities say, you'll be full of action with the incredibly beautiful sword scenes. The animation, which came as a surprise to me in the movie, connected me to the movie incredibly. When it comes to acting, Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and others are just as everyone should play. All I have to say to the music is a unique piece of art. Music that is familiar to all of us is in this movie, just watch for the music.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Not bad, but lacks a twist","Tarantino has always been an eclectic filmmaker, lacing his pictures with overdoses of quotes from and references to the kind of stuff he used to watch when young, as well as during his job in a video rental. Each of his previous movies, however, was something more than just an amalgamate of classic style elements. Every one of the movies he was involved with up till now, the ones he directed himself as well as those he only scripted, had something more... to set them appart... Tarantino's movies were sophisticated, delicately balanced yet in your-face-exploding-powerfull coctails, and every good coctail has a *twist*. So did Tarantino's flicks until this one : it was the twist that made them totally original, ""Totally Tarantino (TM)"" so to speak. It's hard to describe what the Tarantino twist is about : it has to do with a combination of many elements - plot, dialogue, the way he directs his actors, portrayal of events.An that is what ""Kill Bill"" lacks. Don't be misunderstanding me : I totally appreciate the amount of work Tarantino put in this one - which is to say : obviously A LOT. The fotography is quite perfect, in its dynamic as well as its static qualities. Sometimes the camera moves frenetically, sometimes it stays still and shows the full beauty of the battle choreography. Every time, it is well thought out : every move of the camera, every part of the scenery, every color, every piece of clothing worn by the actors - it all adds up to a painstakingly crafted visual masterpiece . The music, as allways, is the perfect accompanyment to each piece of imagery presented. Tarantino's direction is tight, effective and spotless. And still : there is something lacking. None of Tarantino's basic plotlines ever were anything new or original. Yet he did manage to present them as such. None of the Tarantino dialogues ever were high literature. Yet they lingered on in the collective cinematic  memory. None of the Tarantino's actors, except for Harvey Keitel, were really anything great (don't start me on Travolta, Jackson or Madsen please). Yet, Tarantino got way more out of them than they ever were worth. And that is what's lacking in KB : the dialogue seems bland, the plotting linear and featureless, the acting very well directed but without any real ""spunk"". ""Jackie Brown"" was already suffering from this effect, but it's only gotten worse with this next installment. Maybe Volume II will have more to say. Maybe he should have left it a single movie. I do think KB was better than JB, simply because I love the burlesque that drives this movie. But still : it lacks the twist.I can't stop thinking Tarantino should also have directed all of those movie scripts that were eventually outsourced to people who simply couldn't create Tarantino's vision : ""Natural Born Killers"", ""True Romance"" and even ""From dusk till dawn"" would all have made better true Tarantino products than ""Kill Bill"". Final conclusion : go watch it for it's technical brilliance and the fun in finding and naming the movie and TV quotes, and hope that we get more *true* Tarantino goodness in chapter 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Glad I could fast forward,"Had not seen any comments about this movie, except that it was violent. Saw it on the small screen.First impressions:Lovely music to start it off. Shocking violence. The setting out of the movie into chapter headings, with narration - that's cool.Then... Some surprisingly amusing pauses inserted into violent scenes. Little girl comes home from school... very funny. Visual gags. Sunglasses. Hand luggage on a plane. Sniggering now.These humorous touches, and the cartoony nature of some scenes, help the viewer to take a different view of the violence somehow. Very clever.Still... watching at home, I could fast forward through some of the fighting scenes. Not because the violence is too violent & bloody but because it goes on so long it gets boring. Maybe this is clever too. Maybe I'm supposed to become bored by the violence and maybe this says something about me. Or maybe it's simply boring.The black and white sequence probably helped in averting the tedium, in fact; helped avoid ""too-much-red"" fatigue perhaps.And then, I was disappointed that the story had no ending. Or that the film ended before the story ended. But (duh) it's Volume 1.But I disagree with some commentators who said it was emotion free. There is some desperate emotion portrayed very powerfully by the lead part. And moments of respect and even tenderness between combatants.Conclusion: surprisingly enjoyable even for someone who doesn't like violence. Funny, cool, entertaining fight scenes, which become tedious after a while, NOT emotion free, has a clear storyline... which doesn't conclude. What? It's finished??

Outrageous bloody entertainment.,"Uma Thurman kicks butt and sprays blood all over the screen in yet another gem from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. Here, Tarantino pays homage to 1970s grindhouses, old vintage Chinese martial arts and Japanese samurai movies, as well as throwing in a little mix of Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns. Mix all together, and you have one of the most outrageously entertaining movies of the decade that keeps you watching from the shocking opening shot the cliffhanger ending. Even if you aren't a fan of Japanese anime or Chinese martial arts films, don't watch it for that. Watch it for the great acting by Thurman, Lucy Liu, Vivica A Fox, and Darryl Hannah, the breathtaking choreography during the crazy fight sequences, and the mind-blowing story that Tarantino has put together to entertain and shock us.

Entertainer,"A nice adaptation by one of the finest directors. What you will find in this movie is an amazing screenplay that I feel is the USP of the movie. If told in a linear way it would not have created the same impact. A bride who goes for revenge from her assassins, and what a revenge she takes. You may find certain flaws here and there but this is not about finding mistakes it is just about enjoying the cinema and the sharing the same pulse as the protagonist.I loved the anime part.It was the best part of the movie for me. I really liked the way the anime was used. It's like using the technology in the best possible manner. The action sequences are nicely directed and the lead actor Uma Thurman does wonderful piece as if it was meant for her.

One of Tarantino's best work,"I mean, Tarantino did a perfect job here, the movie is pure entertainment, blood guns and sword everywhere, yet it appears so serious as a film, you might think it's just a blockbuster violent movie to make people have fun, but instead it's so gorgeous, the music are perfect, the writing is awesome, and what should I say about cinematography and camera work, Tarantino gave us some incredible shoot that you would not expect. The final combat has some of the best photography ever, when I first saw it I stopped the movie to enjoy the colors on the screen. As always, Tarantino uses dialogs as hisain way to tell the story, and he does it in an incredible way, also some lines a really funny. Best pace ever, one of my favorite movies, I swear, watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's postmodernist afterword,"I watched this film for the second time after a long period of time, and like then, I didn't really like the film compared to other important works of Quentin Tarantino, and I don't really understand why it is so much loved by many people, because there is nothing special here that would be so exciting to watch. Yes, there are some interesting scenes and camerawork that are fun to watch, but the film itself doesn't really grab you in a general way. The content is simple and understandable to most viewers, the visuals are fine, and none of that makes the film anything unique to me. Especially if it turns out to be boring in general content and form by its simplicity without exciting moments.But let's get to the good stuff first. As I mentioned just above, there are various interesting camerawork scenes here, and it's generally good to watch. Often interesting choices of musical score, but sometimes not. Lucy Liu is very much to my liking in the cast here. Uma Thurman is also good, and the motivation of the main character is clear. There are interesting different techniques that Tarantino uses, but I wouldn't say I like them that much. The action scenes are not bad, though you can see that they are staged. In general, the film is well-made, although a couple of scenes look 'cheap'.On the negative side, it's a pretty boring film. Some moments are dragged out to make the suspense, but it only bored me. The film is purposely made unrealistic, with various illogicalities still occurring, which is not the worst evil. The insertion of an animated episode is an interesting decision, but it is again dragged out, and I wouldn't say overly interesting. Despite the fact that the film contains a countless sea of references, it doesn't make a difference to me personally, as they don't improve the film itself.I'll be one of those people who didn't like the film. I've found similar reviews from other people who will more accurately articulate the negative aspects of this film, giving it a 6 out of 10. However, the film made a definite contribution to the cinematography and is done well, even though I don't quite like it, for which I will give it a 7 out of 10 with a big stretch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"After ""Kill Bill"", the blonde jokes changed....forever! (And this is the review from both Vol. 1 and 2)","After the not so successful ""Jackie Brown,"" Quentin Tarantino became a unknown and forgotten legend with only 3 films on his career. 6 Years later Tarantino confirmed his great return to filmmaking with ""Kill Bill"" Vol. 1-2. Many did not believe: thought he had lost his originality; his style would never fix in this new generation, but boy, we were wrong.""Kill Bill"", both part 1 and 2 show the great talent of Tarantino and shows why he is a true legend in cinema. Not only keeps its great and very intelligent originality but also makes a great tribute to the old Kung Fu and martial arts movies alongside with the old classic Western style, all in both Vols. that function as a single movie.The story begins, with another unforgettable character of Tarantino, ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman). A beautiful blond woman appearing punched and shot in the head at her wedding (that's why she is called the Bride, she was unmarked so the police dubbed in that way).Apparently she survived, and after a 4 years coma she wake up and find out that she had lost her baby (she was also pregnant). She swear it revenge against those responsible ... their former coworkers and her lover Bill (David Carradine). ""The Bride"" was an assassin who worked for her lover, soon after she found out that was pregnant she run away from the killing business. After a few years their own former colleagues along with Bill went after her to put an end for this betrayal, but they only woke up a sleeping giant.In the 1st part of the story, we see ""The Bride"" going after the first two targets on her list: O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) the queen of all the Japanese mafia; and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) a 'simple' housewife. In this first part Tarantino shows his great talent in making a bloody violence and also pays tribute to the old kung fu and martial arts movies, all together delivering a bloody battle between ""The Bride"" and ""The Crazy 88s"" (the private army of teen's samurai working for O-Ren) with a direction that is simply superb.In part 2 we continue with the great quest of vengeance of ""The Bride"" after the other names on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen) the lazy good-hearted own Bill's brother; and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) the cruel new lover of Bill; and also, the man itself, finally in person...Bill. Part 2 differs a bit from Part 1. While the 1st is seemed a crazy and beautiful martial-arts film, the 2nd part is also crazy but now is a true modern Western with angry blondes killing themselves. Not only in action scenes (which are few here) that Tarantino excels directing, but also delivers a fantastic and original writing giving dialogs full of Tarantino smartness and a fun black humor.Not only that Tarantino is highlighted with a brilliant screenplay and his stylish direction but also the entire cast that fits perfectly into Tarantino style. All simply excellent: Michael superb; David Carradine fantastic as ever; Uma Thurman.... PERFECT, badass, suffering, hilarious, unforgettable.""Kill Bill"" was the big return of Tarantino to show that he came to stay. With a story very well written and directed together with unforgettable characters, with Tarantino style more enhanced conquering fans of this generation and won even more in the future but not forgetting this unforgettable classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Pretty strong meat there from Sam Peckinpah...,"First of all, how did this film ever make an R rating? If your not old enough to drink, you shouldn't be allowed to see this film. That said, this modern Western is a great visual treat. It has style and then some. The only problem is that the violence has little or no impact after a while. This film begins to resemble an Monty Python blood bath sketch. After a while you don't care who or what is being slaughtered. Its still one of the best films I've seen in 2003.

Over-the-top cartoon-ey action that left me bored as hell.,"This film consisted of nothing but extremely drawn out fight scenes with incredibly fake blood spraying everywhere all the time and ""whooshing"" sound effects that are straight out of cartoon network. Was bored as hell during the fight scenes, and kept waiting for those scenes to end and they seemingly never did. The film had an incredible lack of story. I could sum up the entire film's story in one phrase. So much lack of realism, it's an action movie written and directed like a kid's cartoon, with the same amount of depth as a kid's cartoon, yet it's an adult's movie. I don't understand all the positive reviews at all, I literally fell asleep the first two times i tried to watch and had to watch it a third time to get through the whole dreadful thing.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Either you like it or you don't. I don't like it.,"OK, I know Quentin Tarantino makes deliberately extreme movies. I know he wants his works to be trash, very hard. I know he wants to be miles and miles away from classic Hollywood products. But I don't understand why so many people consider him a genius.Maybe I'm one of the few persons (!) who doesn't like his style, nevertheless I think his movies (and this one above all) are terrifying. I don't consider funny seeing flying heads and blood everywhere, every scene is extremely violent and disgusting. Many people say that the harder Tarantino pushes each detail, the more comical he is. For me most of the audience don't understand he delivers caricatures! The problem is that he gets instead the opposite effect, like a praise and an excitement for violence, really gratuitous. In this film the story -very weak- is overwhelmed by flashiness.It's a difficult topic (on one side I don't want to sound like a moralist, on the other one I want to tell my opinion). Films like ""Taxi driver"" or ""Clockwork orange"" are very violent too, but they are strong tales with strong stories. I don't say violence in these movies is more acceptable, but it's functional to the plot.Furthermore, why telling Tarantino is a master? He always quotes Bruce Lee, he quotes (or copy) ideas from John Woo and Sergio Leone, he recreates sets and situations already seen in B movies. He goes on paying tributes... Why doesn't he himself invent something?",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Total Tarantino!,"Definitely among my favorite of Tarantino's work, but not first place. Kill Bill was an amazing movie, and overall, I love the writing and action.

Almost 20 years later and it's still my favorite film of all time!,"In my opinion, this movie is the aspect of perfection for an action revenge thriller. The storyline, plot, ACTION, and characters all done to perfection.I first watched this film when I was around 10 or 11(yeah yeah I know I was way to young) so I did not quite understand it or catch things I should have, yet it became my favorite movie simply because of the fight scenes. Skip ahead to my late teens, and on a rewatch ot solidified it's self as my alltine favorite film because I could truly understand, and FEEL this movie for its raw vengeful artistry.
Now at 25 years old it still stands its ground as my all-time FAVORITE film, on top of that it introduced me to Quinton Tarantino and his sheer genius. Although I still don't think he has made a better film than this one. I can literally quote every line from this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bloody Masterpiece,"One of my all time favourites, Kill Bill is heart stopping mind-blowing greatness, every time I watch this movie I literally cheer and shout at the screen as the Bride slices and dices her enemies in bloody pieces. Uma Thurman is simply amazing, her intensity and motivation keeps the movie moving at a relentless pace, her line delivery is bad-ass as she faces up to her opponents, teasing them and threatening them, by the time she stops talking you are just waiting for her to perform some insane fight move.Thurman plays the Bride, who is gunned down at her own wedding by the highly trained ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"". She is assumed dead but fortunately The Bride awakes from a coma and sets out for brutal revenge, and revenge has never looked so good. The fight scenes are the best ever, all expertly staged with equal jaw dropping violence in each one. Tarantino executes the violence through silence, just before an attack there is virtually no sound, just an atmosphere and a wall of tension, then all hell breaks loose.The first fight between Vernita Green and The Bride is tough as nails, as they throw each other around the room into cabinets and onto tables. Even the animated scene showing O- Ren Ishii's childhood is splattered with blood and it's glorious. Then there's the unforgettable finale that sees O-Ren-Ishii send in her best bodyguards and the Crazy 88 to take The Bride down. This scene is one that's worth rewinding just to be blown away every time. Blood spews out from limbs like a fountain, heads roll across the floor, arms are torn to shreds and you feel every bone crunch and character pain yourself because it's such an effective scene. Before this scene is the stand off with Gogo Yubari who has a thing for violence, using a swing blade she knocks Uma Thurman about, but she can't be knocked down, she is not to be messed with, and you'll believe me when you see this finale as it is incredible beyond words. Stunt double Zoe Bell deserves an honourable mention for her incredible work!Would I watch this again? I'd be stupid not to, this is a super slick movie that will leave you breathless, and it stands for me as Tarantino's greatest, one that will be hard to pass, if he makes a third film I will be delighted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"File Under ""Things That Quentin Tarantino Knows How To Do""","There should be a list of things Quentin Tarantino knows how to do, and a list of things he clearly does not. Perhaps if he examined this list, he wouldn't make any mistakes in the future. The one thing Tarantino should definitely not be doing is getting involved with any horror films. ""Hostel"", while not awful, was talked up way too much. And his endorsement for ""Wolf Creek""? I have no idea what he was on to make him think it was a stellar flick.But the list of things he can do well is much longer and we see most of those things in ""Kill Bill"". This is the story of a retired assassin who is attacked on her wedding day, and the entire wedding party is killed. When she wakes up from her coma, she decides to take revenge on the man who did this to her: Bill. Yes, she will kill Bill. Or at least die trying.Things Tarantino does very well: 1. Puts scenes in the wrong order. In ""Kill Bill"", they don't even show her killing her enemies in the correct order. He mastered this in ""Pulp Fiction"" after testing it in ""Reservoir Dogs"", but ""Kill Bill"" really drives home how effective a film can be if you put things in a more climatic order.2. Incidental dialog. Some people, like Richard Linklater or Kevin Smith, can make an entire film of incidental dialog, thus making the dialog essential and not really incidental. Tarantino only puts a pinch here or there, to flavor the film with off-hand cultural references. Remember the Royale with Cheese from ""Pulp Fiction""? You'll find more of that here.3. Senseless violence. If you liked the killings in the other films, you'll love this. The killing is gorier, the body count higher. And the influence of old kung fu films is a nice touch. Personally, I'm a big fan of the blood geysers.4. Music selection. Music played a central role in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (K-Billy's Sounds of the 70s). Again, the music is crucial, giving the film an old-timey feel (with ""Green Hornet"" music, among others). This is very well done, mixing the classic (sword fighting) with the modern (guns).5. Putting people in suits. I can't explain why, but the suits worn in Tarantino films are the best.6. Understanding your traditions. This film references so many more old kung fu films tan I will ever see. Tarantino knows his stuff and sprinkles references all over that most people will never understand. A prominent character, Hattori Hanzo, is actually a real character from other sources and even some of the dialog is a throw-back. This homage is touching and well done.What I'm saying is that if you liked Tarantino before, I suspect you'll be a big fan of this movie. It's dirtier, gorier and more violent. Some scenes are much more crude than in his other films. But Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman are a winning combination, not to mention the flawless Michael Madsen and a well-casted David Carradine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino at his most Tarantinoesque,"Title: Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003)Director: Quentin TarantinoCast: Uma Thurman, David Caradine, Lucy Lu, Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Sonny ChibaReview:For those of you who have been waiting for Quentin Tarantino to make his big come back after Pulp Fiction look no further because its here! Kill Bill is Tarantino at his most tarantinoesque. Incredible dialog, mundane situations and lots of blood abound. Strap your kimonos on tight because your in for a martial arts flick like no other! The main story concerns Uma Thurma who on her wedding day, and for reasons yet to be explained (on Vol. 2) was shot, beat up and left for dead by her fellow gang members. Not only that but this all happens to her on her wedding day and she is pregnant! She ends up in a coma¬Öbut four years later when she finally wakes up, all she can think of is REVENGE! In a big freaking way.What follows is violence and carnage like you haven't seen on any other film. Even by Tarantino standards Kill Bill is very, very damn bloody. Any one cringe at the ear slicing scenes on Reservoir Dogs? Well get ready for some eye-gouging on this one! Remember that scene in Gigli (for those of you unfortunate souls who saw it) where J LO explains that technique for ripping off someones eye with your index finger? Well your gonna see it here it. There's lots of decapitations, chopping off peoples legs, arms or any other appendage for that matter, the grand finale is a blood fest that's worth being recorded in movie history.Tarantino uses a lot of techniques on this film, that make it more beautiful to the eye. Yup, aside from the fact that this movies themes are downright dirty and violent (hey its Tarantino!) the film looks gorgeous almost in direct contrast to what the movie is about. This is a movie about revenge, killing, ultra-violence and chopping heads off¬Öyet it looks sooo beautiful you cant take your eyes off of it. I will go down and say that this is tarantinos best looking film. The movie goes from using Japanese animated sequences to using black and white sequences and then some. There's some very imaginative use of colors in this film.Have you ever seen one of those Japanimation films that deal with Samurais and ninjas, kind of like ""Ninja Scroll""? Where one persons limb is chopped off and a stream of blood starts to pour out like a water fountain? Well your gonna see exactly that here..only thing this is not animation. Which brings me to my next point¬Öthis film is like a very violent samurai/ninja anime come to life! Its obvious Tarantino is in love with the 70s, that was evident even on Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill is no different. Here Tarantino has made one of those ultra-violent karate movies, where the good guy battles a hundred other bad guys and wins. Also Taratinos love for all things Bruce Lee is there, from Uma Thurmas yellow suit with black stripes (like the one Lee wears on Game of Death) to some of Lucy Lus henchmen looking like Kato (from Lees character on the short lived The Green Hornet TV show), its obvious Quentin worships Bruce Lee and his films.Then we've got Uma Thurman as 'the bride', all I can say is...she kicks major booty in this role. Sorry but there's no other way of putting it. She is revenge personified! She will go through any obstacles to get what she wants! Even if it means going to Okinawa to get just the right sword and training to get her revenge. She does a great job as The Bride. Lucy Liu is one mean mother as the head of the Yakuza. She is merciless and cold and has one really good and shocking scene in the movie to prove it.Pour in the usual Tarantino dialog with its flare and pop cultural references and you got yourselves one heck of an interesting film that shouldn't be passed up by no one out there. If your tired of the same-o same-o films with tired plots and dialog, do yourself a favor and see this, because its as fresh and innovative as films get. And for horror fans¬Öyou'll love all the blood and guts, trust me the rivers of blood flow on this one! So go check it out!Rating: 5 out 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
An extremely gripping film as well as the stunts and everything else.,"When I first started to see the film, I thought it would just be an action film with a lot of blood and that's all. And that was what I wanted to see, but the film offered a lot more than this. It is truly one of the master pieces of Tarantino. The consensus on rotten tomatoes is great which says ‚Äì""It is a highly stylized revenge but what a style."" Seriously I have never seen killing and storytelling all combines with action and such a great style. This style is definitely specific to only Tarantino and none can repeat this. The soundtracks need to be mentioned specifically. They stole the show most of the times. Uma Thurman acted very nicely at all the times. The story all the times took so interesting turns that anyone can be glued.""A must watch right now, if you are action sucker and a must watch for anyone else also.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantinos ingenious brilliance + Thurmans acting = MASTERPIECE!!,"Quentin Tarantino has since his debut as a movie writer been an object of discussion - you either love him or hate him. For me though, the answer is simple. Tarantino is brilliant. In Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 he takes both his own movie-making and the genre of violent action to a new level. It is quite understandable that some( or even a lot of) people are disgusted by his bloody scenes.In Kill Bill the plot is once again intelligent with Uma Thurman as a revengeful professional killing-machine, who desperately urges for a payback at her former boss Bill and his people.The movie goes in real Tarantino-style, with present time mixed with flashbacks, eventually ending up in a fabulous finish.Thurman was a great actress in Pulp Fiction, but it's a pleasure to watch her in Kill Bill. It's impressive to see how she handles swords, for example. Tarantino tends to use the same actors in different movies, Thurman is one and Michael Madsen another. Madsen is perfect as the kind of nasty ""badass"" that frequently occur in Tarantinofilms. David Carradine, a for me quite unknown actor, is also worth mentioning for his strong performance as Bill.Kill Bill vol 1 & 2 are great movies, not really as amazing as Pulp Fiction, but it comes up to Reservoir Dogs-standard, and that is a very good grade! A highly recommendable movie to people who aren't that sensitive. Even if much of it is censored (in a brilliant way again by Tarantino, the Anime-stuff gives me goosebumps :)), a lot of blood is wasted.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Amazing-ness,"I saw this on a whim about a year ago when my best friend randomly came over with the DVD and said ""YOU MUST WATCH THIS!"" So, we sat down and did, and I have never been more satisfied.A wonderful take on black and white, anime, the Japanese culture, and sweet, sweet revenge, Kill Bill is an amazing film that is purely unforgettable. I admit to not being familiar with Tarantino's work, but this definitely opened my eyes to genius and pure insanity. Everything about this film leaves twists and turns, plot points and plot holes, and of course, amazing blood and guts effects that are so well-done, it's almost beautiful.The acting was superb; no one could've pulled it off but Uma Thurman. Lucy Liu, always a favorite, pleased me once more as O-Ren, and I was introduced to a new favorite, Chiaki Kuriyama, as the memorable homicidal school-girl Go-Go Yubari.A wonderful film that you will NOT regret seeing. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Ladies and gentlemen...It's Quentin Tarantino,"You wouldn't believe the excitement I had as this movie started. You wouldn't also believe why the excitement was: I was going to watch a movie by Quentin Tarantino. I love movies and there must be someone great behind a film when it is promoted as ""the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino"". Already a legend with three films, Tarantino is known for his way of writing (I got to see ""Pulp Fiction"") and above all, his original, if not unique, directional style.I had the chance to see all of this in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", and more. I don't know why I hadn't bothered to look up for a Tarantino film before; it didn't call my attention. Well, ""Pulp Fiction"" called my attention indeed, as did ""Reservoir Dogs"", but not this movie. Anyway, the thing is that I saw Uma Thurman in black and white, covered in blood, saying some phrases as being massaged by a tissue with the name ""Bill"" in it.Then there's color, and I realize there's a lot of visual style in the piece. Credits roll, giving us every name except the one from the writer and director (you know who that is), who will appear after the whole ride, so you get is 'his' film. Just to pump things up, we get chapters in black screen (""Chapter one: 2""), and by chapter a blonde woman has killed a black woman. Names are not so precise; when a little girl asks the blonde woman her name, she says it, but we can't hear it because it is muted by a sound effect. The fact is, the movie is not about characters entirely, so it makes no point for us to know the name. However, the blonde (that's of course, Quentin's favorite, Uma Thurman) was known as ""Black Mamba""; but later, when in another chapter we see she could have died at her wedding we accept her as ""The Bride"". Going back, the black woman is Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and is now dead. She's now a crossed number 2 in a list The Bride has, but¬ÖThe camera shows a number 1; O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)¬ÖWhat happened to her? And we go to the past.The script provides a narration by the main character, which will encounter many people and tell us their stories. Tarantino takes the job of letting us know not only The Bride, but everyone involved in what she's doing, of course, in her own words. What is that she's doing you're wondering? She's avenging the people that literally ""took away her life"". There's nothing else you need to know about it. This script doesn't probably contain the refined dialog Tarantino is known for, but he's not going to use that dialog in a film like this; he'll take another elements. Always making references about real life with his unreal characters, Quentin lets you know that he's having fun at the same time he's being serious. He gives freedom to his actors, and that's how they triumph. His beloved Uma is on the perfect note for her character, as is she was made to play it; and I'm just talking about her, because if I name actors, I'll name characters, and I don't want to spoil the interesting story.In the end, you could consider the movie merely an action film; and even when it is that, it is beautiful. I'm not fan of action, but this has got everything it needs, with personality of course. Tarantino is crazy about violence, letting the blood out of heads, arms and legs. With a lot of intelligence, in a scene where there's a lot of killing, he passes the image to black and white, I think probably because he knows he'll show a lot of blood, and tries to make the journey less painful for us. Until The Bride blinks¬ÖEverything is colored again. And we enjoy the fights, the environment, the locations, the performances (they used real Japanese actors for the shooting in the country of Japan), the details of a director that doesn't rush time, because he wants the viewer to see how real it can all actually be, in his fantasy; his fable. When he puts ""4 months later"", it's because that time doesn't fit in the final cut; but I think he'll shoot the entire four months if he could.Don't even talk about vengeance, and The Bride's rage, when Vernita Green apologizes while she's about getting killed, and proposes something like ""getting even"" if she could. ""Don't tell me about getting even"", The Bride declares. ""To get even I wouldn't have to kill you alone; I would also have to kill your daughter, wait for your husband to come back from work and kill him too"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Objectively, what's so excellent?","Well, i have to say, there are a lot of people happy to call this one of the best movies ever made and that's unbelievable. To give a b-movie satire 10/10 is crazy and you've probably been seduced by the allure of the hip.True, Tarantino is hip. He's more hip than any other filmmaker ever and his movies are so easy to love, but Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not an excellent movie. Perhaps if it is combined with it's upcoming sequel and many needlessly lengthy fight scenes are cut down to create a full movie with a decent amount of storyline, then it can be ranked at the height of b-movie satires, but that's not a 10/10.I loved the introduction, the knife fight in the house and its dramatic climax was great and very well done. With humour, drama and action working excellently together, i figured i was in for a very unique and excellent movie. But, unfortunately for me, the drama died and the humour was reduced to laughing at the ludicrous amounts of blood lost and huge number of limbs amputated. This was funny, but pretty low brow.The bleeping of The Bride's real name was great and showed courage and originality, the cheesy b-movie character names also worked very well, but the vast quantities of fight scenes were overwhelming and unnecessary. There's a great storyline under there about a woman who was wronged and needs revenge, but it is eclipsed often for 15-20 minutes at a time as our heroine goes to battle evil, or to get a samurai sword of unequalled quality.I hated the anime part, that's just me (i always hate it) but in fairness it was done pretty well and fitted into the patchwork feel of the movie.So, in summary, there were many good points to this movie, but its overall quality as a whole movie was most certainly not excellent. Unless you *love* a movie purely for the fact that it isn't afraid to do what's normally taboo.Honestly, this was better than a lot of movies that come out of Hollywood so i'm giving it 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
the fourth dogpile from Q. Tarantino,"It's really scary that this film is actually in the top 100 on imdb. It leads be to believe that most posters here are 15 year-old adolescent boys. I'll readily admit that I have never liked Tarantino. He is the ultimate plagiarist who takes credit for ""innovations"" that directors like Kurosawa, Godard, Peckinpah, and Leone were doing forty years earlier. I'm not a cinematic prude by a long shot but what is with all the deification of cruddy pop culture in his movies? I fail to see the cleverness in referencing a Trix commercial. While I don't begrudge others the right to like this movie, I must admit I get a little annoyed at hearing the word genius applied to a film that is as frivolous as this one. I thought Tarantino was suppose to be some kind of poster boy for the independent film movement but this film is as one dimensional as any flick starring Steven Segal. People really need to question themselves about the kinds of films they watch. Is Kill Bill really necessary? Like a Big Mac and Fries, I'm sure it feels good going down but in the long run it leaves you empty inside. At 40 years of age Tarantino has never bothered to grow up. He's nothing but an overgrown fanboy making some of the most expensive fan fiction of all time. If you were to list all the ""references"" to other films found in this cinematic junkpile it would probably equal the actual length of the script itself. This movie was not created, it was compiled. The script was probably written with a Xerox machine. This is nothing new, Spielberg and Lucas have indulged in this kind of filmmaking for years and the Coen brothers are guilty of it too- movies about other movies. They are the great regurgitators offering nothing new to the world of cinema except their knowledge of B-movie cliches. Wake up people. Demand more, from the movies you see. In the meantime, how about reserving the top 100 for films that truly deserve to be there like Renoir's Rules of the Game or Cassavetes' Woman Under the Influence.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
This movie is about me,"I'm a regular middle aged dark haired woman, with normal habits, no instinct to see, or enjoy blood scenes. I'm everything Uma Thurman is not, and everything her character don't need to be. I don't exist in the ""realities"" these movies present. I don't particularly love Tarantino's everything, and yet, for several years, I consider both Kill Bill-s absolute masterpieces. And yet, this film is about me. It is a story, a dramatic one, artistically put it, exhibiting inner selves and imminent domestic fights, to an absurd level. The level of Irony. And the main reason I'm so excited with these two movies is the fine and subtle irony of violence itself, a violence explaining and contradicting itself. It's like a theory of violence, how to use it in imagines and words, how to exploit it, how to exaggerate it so that one, OF COURSE, will not believe it, how to change it into an answer to... love?, how to transform each part of this chaos of fine ""art"" of killing into a sweet, normal, average family scene and so on. I'm sorry, there is only one movie, one Kill Bill, this double thing is just another trick. We have only one story, with one part, told differently and distinguish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Two words: Quentin Tarantino,"Again Quentin Tarantino takes on a wild ride where the twists and turns of the movie we believe we can anticipate, but Oh No. True to Tarantino's form the movie twists showing different time frames in the movie for different periods of the the movie. Just like Pulp Fiction, Tarantino causes you to have to watch his movie at least two times to really grasp the flow of the movie. All the while using smart characters and deceptive plot lines. This is a true action movie but unlike most of the traditional Japanese and Chinese movies that showed unrealistic, over-exaggerated moves and weapon play, Tarantino mixes non stop action of say a Die Hard movie with the oriental elegance of a movie on the scale of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Tarantino not only showcases extraordinary sword play and weapon skills but also the tradition and history of the craft of sword making and the passion in which the craftsman make their trade. Again, Tarantino takes his movie to many levels. An absolutely wonderful movie with very few flaws. A Must See. As a fellow Tennessean, it makes me proud to see a person such as Tarantino, who was born in Knoxville, TN., take away the Redneck-Hick stereotype associated with us. Some of us may be Rednecks, but even rednecks are skillful and smart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A Roaring Rampage of Destruction,"An elite assassin (Uma Thurman), after waking from a 4-year coma, takes bloody vengeance on those who wronged her. Said assassin had given up her wild ways before being brutalized by former comrades (with friends like these, you don't need enemies, ha-ha-ha). Quentin Tarantino creates a violent tale which might just as well be a fable taking place a hundred or even a thousand years ago, the actual events perhaps slanted or exaggerated by the passage of time. In a sense, this could be a series of incidents taking place now, being told by storytellers in the year 2100, yes? Isn't this what Tarantino is doing - creating new legends for us to talk about and ponder? The characters in these tales do not behave so much like contemporary citizens as they do mythical heroes and villains; they're more like archetypes than real people. They seem more like ideas of how classic figures in a modern setting would act. How about the daughter of the first villain we see our heroine kill? Would she really just stand there expressionless, upon seeing her mother dead on the floor? In the Tarantino universe, she's just a future heroine or villain, destined to exact more vengeance in a never-ending cycle of bloodletting.The key to making this particular film work is for the audience to buy into the capability of the main character, a female, in dishing out such an impressive revenge. This is not as simple as it seems, even in today's modern film world, if going by box office returns (I'm thinking of ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" from 1996 with Geena Davis, which should have been a surefire hit; then move ahead to ""Elektra"" this year). It's not that women can't be as mean as men in this regard. They just haven't been able to tap into that sensibility on screen so that audiences can go along for the ride. Tarantino doesn't appear to have a problem conveying that sensibility with his female actors. It may also help that The Bride character here is acting on her maternal instincts, rather than having them work against her, as in other movies. There's nothing quite so primal as fighting for your child, whether for vengeance or protection.I could go on about the various cinematic tricks Tarantino employs here, such as sudden black & white footage and anime, but the one that really impressed me was his use of music. He plugs in previously known musical bits into his own visualizations and you come away with a new appreciation for the tunes. Though the general thinking is that volumes one and two were originally intended as one film, another masterstroke is having the Bill character faceless and mysterious throughout this first volume. It teases the audience with what's coming in the 2nd volume, especially with that revelation in the last few seconds.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

But I do like that it skips over the usually boring -punching people in the face while they just get back up again - useless manner. Instead the movie gets right to the point and kills all offenders. The plot is very simple, no twists and turns, pretty much Kill, kill, kill is the theme as revenge strikes hard.

Not what I had hoped for,"Having enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Jackie Brown"", I had great hopes for ""Kill Bill: Vol 1"". I was impressed with production design, score and cinematography in general, but couldn¬¥t get myself to enjoy the completely over-the-top blood-effects, even though I knew they were supposed to be that way as a reference to certain cheap martial-arts movies. I should say that I haven¬¥t seen any of those, so maybe that¬¥s why I couldn¬¥t enjoy ""Kill Bill"" as much as people who did. The shifting in time, which was a master-stroke in ""Pulp Fiction"", seemed forced to me in ""Kill Bill"" and I found most of the dialog either boring or silly. No complains about the really simple revenge-story, but the second half of the movie was nearly all fighting, which became somewhat tiresome for me. I liked the cast and was especially looking forward to seeing David Carradine as Bill - he seems like the perfect choice to me, even though I hear he wasn¬¥t Tarantino¬¥s first choice - so I was disappointed to see so little of him in ""Vol. 1"".

"This film is a frenetic, plotless and overly long mess","In return for dragging along my best friend to Matrix Revolutions on Monday, I went with him to see Kill Bill yesterday.I'll admit, I wasn't keen on going; I had expectations of bad filmmaking and low-rent garbage on the menu, since Tarantino was at the helm of this particular project.But the film I saw was even worse than I had anticipated. Kill Bill is typical Tarantino TRASH, and pretty much without any merit as a piece of cinema.For starters, it has NO plot. The story is so lame that I find it difficult to believe that it would satisfy ANYONE whose age counts to double figures. Concurrently, I shall skip discussing the 'story', for obvious reasons.The acting - WHAT acting? What acting are we talking about? The only role given any kind of decent screentime was the part brutally played by Thurman. I don't know, perhaps I'm being a bit harsh - Thurman being a Hollywood star rather than an REAL actress, perhaps it's a little unfair to expect some kind of meritable acting from her? Yes? No? Whatever - either way she delivers a lazy and one-dimensional performance throughout.Of course, her conspicuous lack of real talent isn't the only reason her part seemed like a cardboard cutout. There's the fact that she plays a stick-thin character - it has NO depth, no backstory, nothing to help you form any kind of attachment with her. She's basically a zombie prototype who delivers her dreadful lines straight from the lousy script with mundane predictability.And to think that she has the MOST developed character in the film! Everyone else - well, they were nothing more than extras wheeled in from the Hollywood crowd who've yet to hit the big time. There really is no point in discussing their contributions, because, chances are the slipshod props and the poorly designed scenery furniture add more to the film than them. And not just because they have the substantial advantage of not having to reiterate the childish script.Again, perhaps I'm being too harsh? I mean, what can one seriously expect from a script that reads like it was written by an over-ambitious seven year-old? As ever, Tarantino gives us a screenplay that lacks ANY real depth or talent, but instead gets by on cheap gags and contemporary slang, all dressed up in the guise of ""Cool"". Much like the similarly fatally flawed Pulp Fiction script, the lines themselves are moronic and without meaning in the extreme, but people en masse try to force themselves to like them because ""they're cool.""I'm sorry to say, but just having a ""cool"" script doesn't mean it's a GOOD script. It is certainly poorly-written and fails to generate any real kind of emotion: no humour, no comedy, no meaning in the slight. It fails to educate, it fails to move. It is just BAD. That means that ANY actor would struggle to deliver a performance that is even half watchable. And the fact that there is NO plot, and only ONE character with more than 15 minutes of screen time only compounds to what we knew all along; to the inevitable conclusion that as before, a Tarantino flick is merely a tyre-worn vehicle for over-the-top and pointless gore and low-rent, throw-away lines.As for the 'action' in the film, the fights are dubious at best, and sadly the choreographer (who is also responsible for the lauded martial arts in the Matrix trilogy and the mighty Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) has obviously grown exceedingly LAZY in his old age. Time he collected his pension, methinks. Much like the hack (sorry, director) of this regrettable excuse for a film.Too long has the overrated HACK that is Quentin Tarantino survived off the ill-gained reputation as a real director and someone who knows how to put together a decent film. It's time he  - and his mindless army of fans - woke up to the fact that he knows less about filmmaking than that other HACK responsible for the Star Wars flicks.In conclusion, what do we have with the first Volume of Kill Bill? A film without a plot, a one pony (sorry, character) led narrative, NO credible performances, a predictably diabolic script, lazy cinematography (thought the snowy garden scene at the end wasn't too bad), a typically out-of-place score, some lame sequence of animation midway, over-long and boring fight sequences (in fact the last 40 minutes comprised totally of one long fight, apart from the laughably conspicuous CG plane) and a film with no conclusion or denouement. There really is NOTHING going for this film, certainly nothing cinematically. But people pretend to like it because it's a Tarantino flick, and because it's ""Cool.""Please, get a grip. This film is a frenetic, plotless and overly long mess - a real train wreck of modern day cinema which makes Kangaroo Jack look a masterpiece.Tarantino is still a HACK, never a proper director, and he's a total idiot to boot. If I were to rate this on this site, I'd give it a 1/10, which again begs the option to rate films (like this) a naught out of ten - a score of one is far too generous for a pile of trash like this. Avoid at all costs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Best Tarantino Movie..Violently entertaining,"I was never a Big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I believe he was overratted. His earlier movies Pulp Fiction, Reservior Dogs and Jackie Brown were Decent, not Great. I know a lot of people will disagree, but There are far better Movies by Scorsese and De Palma.

Kill Bill is a tale of revenge, packed with Lots and lots of Violence and blood splaterring entertainment with humour. Uma Thurman delivers a Superb performance, her Best film of her career. Volume One is more based on Two Villains. The main being Lucy Lui, who is the new leader of the Japs. Lucy gives a deadly and Amazing performance. There is a side villain, a School girl dressed Sexy Japanese girl, who also gave a deadly, fun performance. The fight between her and Uma is terrific. The highlight of this movie has to be the Amazing but unrealistic fight scene with Uma taking on the crazy 88. that is a gang of 88 samurai fighters. Unrealistic, but very very Enjoyable.

"Kill Bill - a major disappointment.  All style, no substance.","Kill Bill did not live up to its promise. Interestingly, preceding the movie I saw previews for Lord of the Ring: The King Returns and Matrix Revolutions. Both films rely heavily on film technique, martial arts/fighting, and violence. The difference between Kill Bill, and LOTR and Matrix, is that Kill Bill has no substance and invokes no emotional resonance with me. LOTR and Matrix in contrast, tell a compelling story on multi-levels.Unfortunately Kill Bill is all flash, all technique, all form (borrowed and copied), and no story that resonates with the audience. I felt nothing on walking out of the movie. I never got involved with any character. I sat back and watched the movie noting and appreciating its technique, music, and staged fights. More importantly, I felt sad that Tarentino's considerable talents are wasted on copying and inflating the martial arts form instead of using that form to tell a compelling story.

Kill Bill Vol. 1: An Exploitation Film or An Exploitation of Exploitation Films,"Tarantino wants his audience to be so in love with technique of the film without getting the audience to react to it.

In Reservoir Dogs, when Mr. Blonde sliced the cop's ear off to pop tunes, we were affected by it. Tarantino wasn't just saying, ""Look at me! Look what I can do!"" He was actually showing us what he could do. This film hints at something better than it is without showing us this ""something"". Also: it is a cartoon. Tarantino's previous films looked at the characters with an ironically detached style making it amusing. Crime movies would always show us thugs getting their heads blown off without any imagination. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino was curious: he wondered ""How do the gangsters get rid of the corpses? Do they hire someone? What if their wife comes home and finds the corpse?"" With these thoughts, Tarantino struck upon brilliance, cheerfully playing with gangster cliches. Now Tarantino is trapped in these cliches, delivering characters and scenarios of the same artistic quality of the filmmakers he was originally parodorizing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

The violence and tabooness of killing a pregnant mother-to-be on her wedding day only makes you feel sympathy for the main character, and further enrages your emotions when she seeks revenge.Story and cinematography are top notch, yet non homogeneous. Fight scenes are amazing and should make the Wachowski Brothers blush compared with their shrek-animation fight scenes. However, with the absence of music in some fight scenes made them feel awkward, but yet in a sense, very much more real. The anime sequence seemed out of place, and slow, yet at the same time gave Kill Bill a more comic book like feel (if that's what QT wanted then he accomplished it... if not, this sequence is better left out).

Brilliant? Nope.,"Kill Bill: Volume 1 is an entertaining look at what Tarantino gleaned from his years of indulging in high-octane, low-brow entertainment. As we all know by now, this movie has elements of anime, chop-socky, chambara, kung-fu, and the spaghetti Western. I had hoped that Tarantino, the most revered of all pop-culture nuts, would be able to combine these elements with the dialogue of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.Such a combo would have been brilliant. But the dialogue is not there, and the cool characters of Tarantino's usual writing are strangely absent. In lieu of the likes of the legendary Mr. Blonde and Vincent Vega, we have ""The Bride"" Beatrix Kiddo, Vernita Green, and O-Ren Ishii. These characters have meat, but leave much to be desired. The second installment satisfies more in this department.What's more, much of the material has been pilfered (big surprise here) from other films. Paying homage is not a crime.

The movie is missing something in that space...maybe it's too slowly paced, or takes too much time explaining a plot that is so simple it could be explained in 5 seconds.But starting with the anime sequence, Kill Bill was unflappable.  So much of this film is a homage to other films, and yet it manages to be one of the most original films I've seen in years.  The images and music in some scenes, such as the final swordfight in the snow, are simply beautiful. Exquisite, even.  And even the minor characters, such as the sushi chef and the Texas sheriff, are interesting people you want to know more about.It IS violent and bloody.  Most of the blood is so over-the-top, it's just a geyser of red and not very disturbing.  But some of it IS disturbing, and although I've seen much more gory movies like Dead Alive/Braindead and Day of the Dead, I actually wish Kill Bill had toned it down a touch.  It's so bloody that many people have focused only on that aspect of the film, which is a shame.Kill Bill has moments that are among the best ever filmed, but I don't think the film as a whole is as good as Pulp Fiction.

Uma Thurman is great in the starting role, with Michael Madden as the faceless protagonist provides a great presence as our main villain. Lucy Liu is also silent, but deadly in her role here and all in all the performances are very good. The fight scenes really shine with great choreography and the over the top gore is great. This is a stylish and lovely looking film, that shines as a piece of art and is one of Tarintino's best. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A movie by Quentin Tarentino?  Who cares?,"I guess I don't really care one way or another who created this movie and what I should expect from him.  Compared to other movies I've seen this year, Kill Bill had a very interesting way of telling the story and I really enjoyed the use of anime and black and white.  I thought it brought something to the movie that, without it, would have made it just an ordinary gore fest.I do question whether this movie really needed to be cut into two.  The fight with O-Ren's army could have been just as interesting if it had been cut by 75%.  At any rate, Uma pulled of the fighting beautifully.  And though there were a few cheesy moments with the sword, there were so many things I enjoyed (Wiggle your big toe, the Bride's comment to the little girl in the kitchen, the restaurant in Okinowa...)I'll go see Volume II without hesitation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The part of the film I have chosen is chapter 5:,"The part of the film I have chosen is chapter 5: Show down at the House of Blue Leaves. After the Bride (Uma Thurman) wearing a yellow motorcycle jump suit has tracked down O-Ren (Lucy liu) after killing dozens of the crazy 88, the two have a spectacular sword fight in a snowy garden. After crossing swords numerous times, O-Ren is scalped by the bride with her Hanzo sword.I would say the method of montage used in this scene was metric, as the shot keeps being cut no matter what is happening within the image. By doing this it elicits the most basal and emotional of reactions from the audience. It does also have rhythmic montage in it as well though as when they are fighting the cutting is based on time using the visual composition of the shot. The pace of the scene is really fast going as each shot is not normally more then a seconds this makes it feel like a more of a fight like you are there as in when you are in a real live fight it all happens so fast so this is what I think they were trying to active here.My opinion of the use of montage and the overall affect and styles is that it works really well from the start of building up the tension to the fast flowing action of the fight that gets your blood moving. I think if it did not of have as many shots in it the effect they were trying to portray would not have worked.I would describe the links from one shot to another focusing on composition, viewpoint, colouring and narrative as a job well done, it s nicely flowing and it keeps you there. You always know what is going on but at the same time it keeps it interesting, and unpredictable.I have selected this particular montage scenes as I think it is the best one of its kind, and more importantly it keeps this up al the way throw out the film so you never loss interest and it keeps you wanting more so you are upset that it has ended as it keeps you griped so well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
good but overrated,"First off I liked this movie. Visually intresting, good if unoriginal story, and fun. I rented it a couple days before Vol. 2 came out and I enjoyed it enough to see V2 on opening night. Here's my problem. If anyone but Quentin Tarantino made this film the critics would've killed it, but because it was done by him it was innovative, inspired, and original. The violence was cartoonish and fun which made the amount of fake blood spilled on screen easy to take. The story was a standard revenge flick filled with interesting over the top (Tarantino)scenes. I just find it funny that there seems to be a double standard for the critics, and Tarantino's treasure is another directors trash. Once again if you like revenge flicks styled after 70's kung fu and revenge movies you'll love it. I do recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Not as good as lovers say, and better than haters say","Quentin Tarantino is to cinema as The Who is to music.  While you can call their works art, the truth is both are entertainers who concentrate on creating things that they like to see/hear.  Quentin Tarantino is really nothing more complex than the world's biggest Quentin Tarantino fan.  That is not a negative - I too am a big Tarantino fan.One thing I found interesting is there is a children motif in ""Kill Bill"". Uma's character starts the film pregnant, Lucy Lui's character endures unspeakable horrors in her youth, Go-Go is only 17 and already a world-class killer, and Viveca A. Fox's child is left alive to perhaps avenge her mother someday.Perhaps the greatest twist is that Kill Bill will at least be nominated for many technical Oscars even though the film and sound editing are at times deliberately bad.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Have you seen the Baby cart movies?(lone wolf and cub)The dialouge in these huge Samurai gore fests is far superior to What Quentin tried to do with this. KILL BILL comes off a little confused to me. Is it an Homage? is it a spoof? does it take it self seriously? It's all of the above. I usually rate a movie by the emotions it gets out of me. Did I smile, did I laugh, did I say Wow, Did I cry, The only time I said anything to myself in KILL BILL was ""wow look at all that blood-spraying"" blood-spraying I might add that had to be in be in black and white so the MPAA wouldnt slap an NC-17 on the film. Clips from this fight scene are in color in the trailers weren't they or am I just crazy. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of Quentins work and I enjoyed this film (kinda) But Sooo many people are calling it genius and his best film to date.

A Great Film,"Kill Bill Vol.1 is Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman's best work ever.  It's a classic revenge tale, in which Thurman's character seeks revenge on the crew of assassins who tried to kill her. Thurman's character simply known as the Bride was a former member of the crew who attempted to kill her.  After the Bride is attacked she goes into a comma for a few years, she wakes up and only has only one thing on her mind¬ÖREVENGE!!!  Kill Bill is the perfect combination of action, comedy and Japanese anime.  Uma Thurman is excellent as the bride.  Lucy Liu is great as the half Chinese half American, O- Ren Ishii.  Quentin Tarantino does it again.  The entire film was good from beginning to end.  I can't wait for volume 2 to come out later on this year.  Vivica A. Fox is awesome and lethal as Vernita Green.

Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the year's best films,"Quite honestly, after Reservoir Dogs and and Pulp Fiction, when I saw Jackie Brown, I figured Tarantino had peaked. I was wrong. When I heard he was making a martial arts film, I was worried he'd overuse wirefighting in extended and boring sequences a la Matrix Reloaded. Again, I was wrong. Next, I heard it would be two parts and figured that this was a clever marketing scheme and the movie would be left as a cliffhanger/feature length teaser a la Back to the Future 2. Again, I was wrong. This movie is complete in and of itself. Instead, we get a uniquely americanized take on Asian cinema and the samurai films complete with some fun dialogue and the Charlie's Angels on crack-esque Super Viper Deadly Assassination Squad. The directing is great, the story's taut, though flashback-riddled, and the acting's even better with Uma living up to the types of roles Sonny Chiba and Toshiro Mifune originated. Quentin even manages to get the bright red color and spraying quality of samurai blood correct. I do have one quibble though. Unfortunately there is a problem with this sort of blood. In the House of Blue Leaves the dramatic impact is lessened since violence appears toned down and minimized by the use of Black and White. I am uncertain as to whether this was capitulation to censors or the original intent, but blood and guts, specifically bright blood, as in samurai films, looks MUCH better in color. Many people have commented on the violence in this movie. I disagree with most of what's been said. I've seen dozens of american action films more violent than this. The fashion the violence takes is a little different than most action movies though since a sword, rather than a gun is used. Some of the violence in samurai style movies typically involves dismemberment and blood squirting from the slain or maimed like a firehose. The ""Baby cart at the River Styx"" series aka ""Shogun Assassin"" in its dubbed american incarnation has a higher body count (as well as more limbs and arms flying) in its first 5 minutes than does this entire movie. Entertaining as all hell, though not quite as violent as many would have you believe. Should delight the average movie-goer and hardcore film buff alike.

The Best Chick Flick Ever!,"Fine, you can see this flick because it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. You can see it because of the hype that typically follows his name. You can see it because of your appreciation for Swords and Martial Arts, but some of you will see it for the revenge theme that it is. I know that everyone on this planet gets screwed at some point in their lives, but the hero for this story is a nameless woman, who sets out to ""Kill Bill"", the one who almost killed her. How many women have thought of avenging a wrong-doing in the name of dignity and self-respect? For those of you who have a strong stomache, for those of you who get a twinkle in their eye at the thought of combat, this'll turn you on.

"blood, lots of blood?  see if you like that sort of thing.","Not my favorite of Quentin's work.  The choice of Uma Thurman as the lead, was good.  She was excellent in Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino likes to reuse his actors and actress's, one of the more compelling reasons to see his films. With names like Uma Thurman and Steve Buscemi what reason could there be for NOT seeing a film.  (However, Buscemi does not appear in this particular film.)Quentin plays his favorite cards in this film, mainly violence and a strange fascination for anime and Japanese style martial arts.  Though I normally enjoy the violence in Tarantino's films, as it is usually paired with snappy dialogue and a witty plot, this film lacks the latter two qualities.  Mrs. Thurman plays her character to her full potential, the problem there is is the utter lack of substance, a vengeful bride and some neat stunts is all she is alloted.  The gross and seemingly unneccesary violence is the downfall of this film.  It is a blood bath, plain and simple.  Different from Tarentino's other films he sees no need to justify or augment the violence in this film.That being said, I enjoyed the movie.  I am rarely disturbed by violence in movies, especially not the unrealistic kung fu scenes in these types of movies where people can come back from seemingly near-death experiences and continue to fight each other with all manner of stunts and manuevers.  In that sense the violence is almost playful in this film.  It is fight scene after fight scene, modeled directly after kung fu movies that Tarantino loves so well.  The special effects are up to par and the fights are well played. But all in all, this is a bloodbath of a film.  Uma vs. the world.If you enjoy violence for violence's sake, then this is the film for you. If you do not, pass and perhaps skip the Tarantino altogether.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Best fun at the cinema in ages.,"After all the computer generated-ness of the last little while (Matrix Reloaded, ahem), it's refreshing to see someone who can triumph using plain old fashioned film-making sense.Tarantino creates great characters effortlessly, with as little as a few pairs of sunglasses on a dashboard, and this, put with great choreography, witty dialogue and a frankly baffling array of shooting styles, has resulted in one of the most fun couple of hours at the cinema that I've had in a good while.The movie, though only the first part, isn't hindered by it's existence as only half a story, and could easily stand alone with just a little tinkering of the story.Though very violent at parts, in keeping with the samurai movie tradition, it's never meant to be taken too seriously, and thus isn't likely to offend anyone but the most squeamish (but then again, with a title like Kill Bill, one would have to question the logic in them choosing this film in the first place.)Simply brilliant!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Wham, Bam, Thank You Mam!","I love the way Quentin Tarantino knows how to open a movie. I was anticipating a patented face-slapper of an opening sequence and boy did I get it. The movie starts with a quote, `Revenge is a dish best served cold' - a Klingon proverb, taken straight from the movie `Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.' Now, from this point, before the movie had actually begun, I was ecstatic with anticipation. To quote from Star Trek as if it where history was just way too cool for thought. And the following scene, a singular shot of a bloodied Uma Thurman as 'The Bride' shown in Black and White, managesto sum up the tone of `Kill Bill' right from the get go.And bang, you're in. The film wastes no time heating up the screen and getting right into the thick of things. Violently tolerant Tarantino commands your attention with every last shot. It's a return to his infamous form whilst also creating something original and challenging. His approach to this film is unlike any of his previous efforts. It's a little less concerned with itself and is vamped up to ballistic mode. This time around he has spent a lot of vigour tweaking the visuals and bending the style to his own unique fashion. Elements that were not so important in his other films have come to be vital in the telling of `Kill Bill.' The colour, tones, choreography, design and the explicit attention to detail all convey a very precise pitch of expression. For a change this film is without much of the usual attention to dialogue Tarantino gives, he instead focuses that energy carefully on movement and body language. The dialogue this time supports the film and doesn't carry it.Director Quentin Tarantino is a film buff at heart and finds pleasure in identifying that in a personal way channeling it through his films. Flying at ya from every avenue possible in the medium (visuals, audio, etc.) are references, homage's and clich√©s in every shape and form. It's one thing to visually reference something or indicate it through dialogue; it's another to feel it. And music does just that. Together with RZA, Tarantino once again shows you the power of music in motion pictures. The music changes, sometimes dramatically, but never feels wrong. Like the very story itself the song and score selection takes obvious inspiration from cult genres such as Spaghetti Westerns and classic Kung Fu pictures. And like the movie the styles change and weave in and out in perfect rhythm that, on its own manages to inspire.The fourth film by Quentin Tarantino is grandeur filmmaking from the master. His directing style is incomparable and proves that he is indeed the commander of his own domain. I'm in awe of the way he has made this film and believe now, more strongly than ever, that he is a rare maverick in the world of cinema. This film is wonderful martial arts mayhem in an organized and timely manner. How can I say this, there's plenty of kung fu but it's not a kung fu movie. It's something unto it's own. `Kill Bill: Volume 1' is respectful of the many genres and cultural styles found here, and has evolved these old influences into a new breed of film. The biggest annoyance though is that even with the knowledge that `Kill Bill: Volume 2' is to come early next year the ending was still too abrupt. It just stops without warning or closure. It's as though Tarantino literally snipped the movie in two. Oh well. The action is a warm change from the CGI (computer generated image) revolution `The Matrix' brought with it, I think because it's all so very traditional. `Kill Bill' is a smart, witty over the top action spectacle that will knock you flat. It's extra violent though so be warned if you can't stand the sight of blood. This isn't `Pulp Fiction' - phase 2, it's `Kill Bill' a whole new chapter in the book of Tarantino, one worth reading over and over and over again.

"Thank you, Mr. Tarantino","Amongst the seven films Quentin Tarantino has directed to date, Kill Bill vol. 1 has got to be the most pretentious of the lot. A revenge tale cut into two feature films due to its overlong running time, part one brings us the color and style, whilst part 2, that was released to theaters half an year later, is a much lesser film (in my opinion) that contains more plot and substance, but lacks the fresh and surprisingly stylish cool breath the first installment had to offer.Talking about style, Kill Bill vol. 1 is all over the place. Tarantino quotes Klingon catch phrases, gives out an outstanding homage to 1970's Kung Fu features, mixes it up with anime and an outrageous non-linear story as an intriguing plot device ¬ñ and covers it all up with one of the best soundtracks ever heard to date. ""Do you find me sadistic?"", Bill asks our protagonist, a catatonic bride, beaten to a deadly pulp on the day of her wedding. What Tarantino really wants to know is do we think he's a sadistic fellow himself, teasing us with all these genres, jumping from one end of the plot to another, and probably hailing to himself all the while ""I've done it! I'm a genius!""So yes, Mr. Tarantino, you are a genius. Taking a semi ""been there-done that"" story of a vengeful Bride out on a murderous rampage to avenge her near death experience after spending four years in a coma, and turning it into solid gold, is not an easy task to live up to. There were some Tarantino films where I really couldn't understand where he was going with the story. In this case, the plot is very clear even with all the continuity issues and each of the actors shine in their respective roles. Tarantino created a whole new world of organized crime on screen, carefully crafting the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad from colorful characters, with fine actresses like Lucy Liu and Darryl Hanna giving out gorgeous performances. But all these superlatives can't be enough to describe the extravagant nature of Uma Thurman's portrayal of the aching, humane, vengeful Bride.Watch out for the training scenes with Sony Chiba's Hattori Hanzo, the Bride's final battle against the Crazy 88 (I've never scene so many limbs chopped off in such an artistic manner; even the horrific sprays of blood seems choreographed right down to the very last one), and the dramatic opening scene, which shows us the Bride taking the bullet that put her into the coma, seconds after confessing to Bill who's the father of her unborn child. Once the credits started to roll and Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" started playing in the background, I was hooked.Thank you, Mr. Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

2 Hours of pure bloody joy Samurai Carnage!!!!!!,"DANIEL MANIA! COMMENTWow! This had to be one the greatest movies I have ever seen! The cast was excellent and the choreography was spectacular! Also the anime cartoon-like antics of the characters was pure gold! The only fault I found in this film is that the sequence leading to the final fight could have done without the black and white. I say go blood red all the way. But anyway the music was awesome with its shades of ""The good, the bad, and the ugly."" This movie was also very stylized around Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection"" and ""Game of Death"" along with a hint of ""Enter the Dragon."" Over all, its movies like this that stretch way beyond a one to ten rating so instead I give this masterpiece a gold star out of 10.

Creation of a cult,"I could easily put that one among the other cult movies.. Because I saw ""real"" action in it..

This movie is worse than vomit !!!!!,"I guess what I hate most about this movie is it's silly attempt at passing for a movie to be taken seriously. I found many of the scenes to be visually repulsive but that wasn't what bothered me most. What bothered me most was the underlying message of those scenes. When someone was cut to pieces with a sword the focus was on how cool it looks when someone is cut to pieces ( as opposed to movies like Braveheart where the focus was on Scotlands struggle for independence). I felt genuinely offended by this. It is also clear that either Tarantino has absolutely no knowledge of human anatomy or the clumsily splattered bodies in the movie was some sort of deranged form of artistic expression. If the latter is true than Mr. Tarantino has no knowledge of how to create serious artistic movies. Or how to create any form of art deserving of respect. As it was in no way beautiful and served no purpose in telling the story and was generally very repulsive. It is Mr. Tarantinos vein attempt at passing himself of as a serious artist witch bothers me most. Also very offensive and disgusting was the music chosen to accompany the splatter scenes, beautiful classical music. This is an attempt to glorify the splatter scenes. Something witch should never be done in serious artwork. Disgusting bloody scenes are supposed to underline some story plot but not be gloried in themselves. That is the mark of bad art. If you want to see a serious movie that is artistically made see Kaldalj√≥s ( Cold light) or Englar Alheimsins (Angels of the Universe). I am shocked at how high this movie is rated on this page as it is pure crap! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT SEE THIS GARBAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Observations,"Will save you all from yet another summary of the movie.I was pleasantly surprised how much japanese involvement in this film from on and off the screen.It is apparent that Quentin loves Japanese culture and Bruce Lee. Uma as Billy Lo, Bruce Lee's character in Game of Death where she wears a similar yellow jumpsuit and takes on the japanese underworld.  Not per se a remake of Game of Death, but borrowing, since this Vol.1 does not reveal the whole story, we have a non-linear partial story of ""Black Mamba"", with much of Quentin's campy characters, dialogue and cinematic vision and cool retro soundtrack.Uma is surprisingly quite convincing as a ""caucasian girl playing with samurai sword"" rough quote from Lucy Liu's character in the final fight.The action choreographer Woo-ping Yuen(Crouching Tiger, Matrix,etc) has done a stunning job of making Uma look super good in all the swordplay and despite the gruesome carnage, were spectacular to watch and behold. Though I don't totally agree that the audience is to expect all these amputations as unbelievable or cartoon violence, I cannot completely desensitize myself from these horrific images. And if you don't find some of it horrific, I am glad I am not in your high school or go to your post office!Oddly, most of the story was really about O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu) with much of it in animi and the eventually showdown. Go Go Yubari is a great distraction!Chapter 3: The Man from Okinawa was the best vignette!!Conspiracy Theory: Could this movie have the subversive undertone that Black Mamba(aka Bruce Lee) gets revenge on Bill(David Carradine)....for stealing his role in the 70's Kung Fu series that Bruce actually wrote the concept for, but the movie execs could never see a real asian actor play? If in Vol 2, there is a tight face shot of Uma with a clenched face and the sound of Bill's neck breaking, I will tend to agree.Rating: Film Fan 9/10 Movie Critic:7.5/10 Action/Gore Fan: 10/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Style,"Kill Bill is a masterpiece. Stylistic brilliance at it's absolute best. That is what Kill Bill is all about - style. If you can appreciate its' attention to style then you will love it. If you can't, then you will most probably see it as a shallow, excessively violent slash-fest. Tarantino has fashioned every small part of this film to work together in the same artistic direction, and the result is phenomenal. It was tied up nicely too, so to not feel like an abrupt cleavage of another film. It is definitely a worthwhile feature in its' own right.Kill Bill has my highest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
I can't wait to see Kill Bill volume 2.,"I didn't want to see this movie at first. I thought it was going to be stupid. My husband had to talk me in to watching it. I don't regret it.This movie is now my favorite, and what's better is that there are three more volumes. This movie was made for people who are open to wild fantasy mixed with cold hard action. Kill Bill is the Natural Born Killers of the new millennium x's 2. (Acually x's 4) You have to see this movie, even if you are forced to. You won't regret it!

UMA..you go girl!! You rock!! Superb performance!,"I cannot wait to see this movie again, or until Kill Bill Volume 2 comes out. This is the best that Tarantino has done. It was a little far fetched and unrealistic (Not a cop in sight anywhere through all the bloody mayhem) and the martial art scenes are a little too mich like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" but it was cool. I thought the japanese scene was drawn out a little too much, something tells me they could have edited this film better and put both parts into 1 long movie but didn't.It was awesome with a killer ending. Uma (the bride) kicks some ass on all those who tried to kill her on her wedding day. She only gets through a couple names on her list, the rest being saved for Part 2.

Superb,"To me, when a movie audience either hates or loves a movie, that's a good indication that the movie probably is a masterpiece.In Kill Bill you probably don't have a middle section, either you will love it or hate it.Back in the 70s, after the legendary Bruce Lee's death, there was a boom on Chinese kung-fu films, fast action, full of violence and Bruce Lee's wannabes, they were the main juice on oriental movie theaters.Kill Bill captures this time.. and then.... so much more. Its a ""70's Chinese kung fu movie"", a ""Kurosawa classic"", a ""spaghetti western"" re-visited, a ""Manga cartoon""... all that wrapped up in a fast-paced action movie, very well directed with superb soundtrack and magnificent fighting sequences.I must say that this is the best movie Quentin made since the classic ""Pulp Fiction"". Some people won't understand it, others won't stand it, but many will love it, cause its one of those movies made with such good taste and so many subtle details, that will soon become a classic.The cast was carefully selected, only ""Uma Thurman"" could play ""Black Mamba"" in such a way. She's fragile and deadly, innocent and ruthless at the same time. Uma always had that flexibility in all of her movies, and Kill Bill is no exception.Sonny Chiba as ""Hatori Hanzo"" is perfect, the dialogue between him and Uma is one of the most memorial moments in movie history. He's the perfect samurai, a humble barman and yet the best blacksmith in Okinawa.Beautiful Lucy Liu delivers one of her best performances (the Japanese garden scene is one to be remembered forever, Darryl Hannah makes a unique and great comeback (and looks hot in nurse uniform), Michael Madsen usual is icy and subtle as a rattlesnake and ""Kung-Fu TV classic"" series David Carradine is perfect as the cool, mature and deadly ""Bill"".To review Kill Bill part 1 and 2 separately is a mistake, both are only 1 movie and should be watched one after the other (same goes for Lord of the Rings trilogy, in my opinion).Just as Kubrik and Polanski, Tarantino is the master of one thing, ATMOSPHERE.... you really get sucked into his creations, forgetting real life for a moment and live a unique experience.Thumb's up to one of the best directors of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Bill,"Quentin keep surprises me. I've noticed that all his movies got the kick-a*s soundtracks in them. And i thought the one in Kill Bill were quite catchy as well.I've heard rumors that this movie was supposed to be awfully violent. Hehe no failure there. But i think violent belongs better in movies than on the streets.Most of Quentin's movies has a very unique style. In some way Tarantino manages to make you feel that you're watching and old classic. Like Pulp Fiction (well about now it is and old classic). It takes place in a sort of 50's town and it looks like the movie was made in the early 70's. Unfortunately i didn't feel the same for this movie, well in some scenes but not very strong if you compare to other movies.Anyway i think this movie was entertaining and i'm not referring to all the violence, it actually was an ""ok"" movie Since you only can vote with straight numbers on IMDb i will give it an 8.

Kill Quentin; why KB1 stinks,"I'm a Tarantino fan. KB1 stinks. Empty dialogue, weak characters, weak plot, tedious fight scenes are the reasons. The yellow suit the Bride wears was ugly. The seemingly endless shot of her toes was boring. The fight scenes were bloody but without any ingenuity, just being faster than the opponent. Many many other Asian martial arts films are much more clever and fun even though they are subtitled such the Blind Swordsman series. The out of sequence flashback approach was confusing and unnecessary. The chapter title and narration slowed up the movie as well. This movie was not a satire, not a homage, not camp, and broke no new ground. Several repulsive ideas in the film including slaughtering a mother in front of her child, sex with a comatose woman, and (GoGo)stabbing a man for no particular reason.

Best at what it does,"The most important fact to keep in mind about this movie is that it is exactly what it is and makes no pretense to be anything else.  If you are looking for deep philosophy or drama, you are looking for a different movie. Kill Bill Vol.1 aims to be an action filled story of vengeance and mayhem. The actors (or in most cases actresses) are wonderful in their performances. Yes, some of the dialog seems awkward, but it is not written as realistic dialog, it is written for this movie, which is not realistic either. These characters talk as the stereotypes they portray - the honorable vengeful hero, the female blacksploitation action hero, and the lord of the Japanese Underworld.  Tarantino deserves props for this highly stylized piece. Not to mention, it is nice to see some American Actresses really stepping up to the plate in an action film, for once without the previous notions of them needing to be sexy or alluring.  All three of the fighting women in this piece hold their own and get down and dirty.  Finally, there is only one thing to do, sit back and hope that he can deliver on the sequel.  9/10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's best!,"Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown) brings us one of the greatest martial-arts movies to date. I have seen this film a countless times and it still holds it's greatness on each viewing. This is definitely Tarantino's best film and is a pure masterpiece. Kill Bill: Volume. 1 is a gritty martial-arts action movie, filled with amazing fight scenes and true pieces of art.Uma Thurman stars as the furious, revenge-seeking, blood thirsty Bride, shot down by her former boss and lover Bill (David Carradine) 4 years ago on the day of her wedding (rehearsel). Tormented with anger, she hunts down each of the assassins that took part in the massacre that put her in a coma for 4 years, she engages in brutal and bloody fights to the death to avenge her tragic loss 4 years earlier.Uma Thurman is brilliant, playing the role superbly and definitely bringing her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Lucy Lui also gives a surprisingly good performance, very different from the roles she has played before. Her portrayal of O-Ren Ishii, the evil and sadistic boss of the Tokyo underworld is perfect. She acted every scene like she was the character, showing she can do much better than her previous work.The film is accompanied by one of the greatest soundtracks ever used on screen (composed by the talented Robert Rodriguez) and each piece fits perfectly with every scene. The direction is also one of the best aspects of the film. Quentin Tarantino knows how to perfect each scene and is a true genius at what he does. As this is something a little different from the usual work Tarantino is used to I think he did exceptionally well in creating one of the best films of it's genre. The writing too is flawless, with hints of Tarantino's quirky and comedic dialogue there is nothing that can go wrong.This film is absolutely brilliant, with amazing and surprising ending. Kill Bill is a film you can watch over and over again, still being entertained on each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

"It's Tarantino, And It's Good!","KILL BILL!!! Just saw it and was I ever pleased. Tarantino's hiatus has left all his fans yearning for another blistering flick from the cinematic genius. He returns with KILL BILL: Vol. 1. He returns with style.The performances are all over the top, but this kind of tongue-in-cheek moviemaking calls for that kind of behavior. Uma Thurman is sensational, as well as Lucy Liu. Vivica A. Fox doesn't have much time to develop, so her performance can't be lauded too much. Daryl Hannah is promising, with more to come. Michael Madsen is almost non-existent. However, as with Daryl Hannah, he has more to come. David Carradine has yet to show his face but comes off riveting as the title character.The scenes move quickly and the flow of the movie is uneven. The movie really shines for its style and little bells and whistles. There is a great amount of detail, and the nods to martial arts culture such as the music, the formats used (there's even Anime), the costumes and the characters themselves are very enjoyable.In the opinion of this viewer, Tarantino, who is known for his great dialogue, has abandoned cleverness and gone more for emotion and in-your-face action. This film isn't very talkative and when characters are talking, it isn't engaging dialogue. You don't have fun with it. The dialogue is always building up to something and you almost always know what it is. The film is very straightforward. The flashbacks are a kick, giving further insight into the characters.This isn't totally important to talk about, but it still is a major part of the film. Violence. I mean some serious violence. This is one the bloodiest films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. Some of the deaths are appalling, and for that Tarantino needs to be praised. When you go over the top with a film, you have to go all out. One of the characters has an accident, ala the movie Hannibal, that has to be seen to believe. Innumerable limbs and oceans of blood are lost. It's great. This isn't a movie to take terribly seriously, you 're just supposed to have fun with it the way Tarantino probably did making it.Last but not least, twists. This film starts with a twist, cut off by a bang. I think most who saw the movie knew what Uma Thurman was about to say before she got that bullet in her head, which obviously didn't kill her, but only made her more angry. The bullet was courtesy of Bill, as mentioned in the trailers so I'm not giving anything away. He has a nice twist of his own, which serves as the last line to Vol. 1, leaving it in a cliffhanger.Where Vol. 2 will go, it's hard to say. If it is anything like Vol. 1, which I imagine it will be, then most are in for a real treat. KILL BILL is a great movie experience, with Tarantino at the wheel. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino Can Only Make One Film,"Quentin Tarantino is the most over rated movie director ever. He basically makes the same film over and over again with a different title.

Whatever it is suppose to be it fails at every level.Uma Thurman is awful and doesn't fit the part at all. Lucy Liu is the only stand out actress but I wish she hadn't made this silly movie as she is much better than that.Mr Tarantino really needs to grow up and the movie going public needs to stop falling for his silly movies.Or if you must watch his movies, just watch one because they are all the same anyway.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
ALL HYPE...,"This movie is ALL HYPE.  It is so concerned with being ""cool"" that it fails to contain anything resembling great cinema.  The violence, music and editing only function as a continuous distraction.  This is QT merely getting off on himself, -his private little joke.  The first two minutes, and the trailer are the only pieces of this film that have any ""feel"". The rest of the movie fails.  Even QT's trademark flashback technique serves little use.  I walked away from this film not caring about any of the characters.  (If this is the future of cinema we are in sad shape.)  QT is hitting us on the head throughout this film, trying too hard, and failing to provide strong characters, a strong, interesting story or a consistent ""feel""... If this was a TV movie by another director it would be panned. And I REALLY wanted to like this film...",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Kill Miramax--A Movie Like This Would be Best Served Whole,"Here's my major problem with QT's long awaited ""Kill Bill.""  While the film is always interesting from a movie buff's perspective (a QT film always is even when you end up hating it in the end), it doesn't get really interesting until the last thirty minutes (which are wildly entertaining) when Uma (stunningly beautiful and vicious as the revenge fueled blood lusting Black Mamba/The Bride) and the action move to Tokyo.  So in my mind, even if all of Volume II (to be released in February of 2004) is as entertaining as the last thirty minutes of Volume I, why in the world didn't the hire an intelligent editor who could've easily chopped out some drawn out exposition (does a B-level revenge fantasy really need an hour and twenty minutes of exposition?) and delivered us an all out go-for-broke extravaganza of over-the-top violence and action in one two and a half to three hour volume?  The only answer I can come up with is that Miramax is greedy and QT is full of himself.  He thinks every cool idea (and he has some really cool ones here from the retro opening credits to the battle to the death in a Japanese garden snow-globe at the end) that pops in his head needs to be filmed, and every spec of film he captures needs to be in the movie.All these things aside, ""Kill Bill"" is pretty fun if you like gruesome cartoonish violence, a simple plot line (revenge is a dish best served cold), compelling visuals (I didn't care for the anime sequence, but found my jaw drop at the stunningly beautiful cinematography and set design in the Tokyo sequences), non-linear story-telling, and an ultra hip soundtrack. This really just is a fetish film for fans of kung-fu flicks, death wish fantasies, and spaghetti westerns, and there ain't nothing wrong with that as long as you realize that's what this is.  The casual movie-goer will probably be dumbfounded, as the film is virtually void of the trademark QT dialogue which is what I think made the over-rated ""Pulp Fiction"" so oddly endearing to mainstream audiences.  I ultimately plan to see Volume II when it comes out, because I finally would like to see Uma Thurman Kill Bill. Until then, our bloodlust will have to be satisfied by this mixed-bag of cinematic tricks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
What's not to like,"In terms of moral and social comment Kill Bill is about as unedifying as a movie gets. but, and let me make this quite clear, who the hell walks into a QT movie expecting to learn? not me. i went to marvel, at the coolness, the artistry and yes, the fake blood. tons of it rain down as The Bride carves a trail of vengeance back to the shadowy Bill.QT follows the physics of a revenge movie perfectly, given ample opportunity to gain the upper hand by stealth The Bride literally goes out on a limb to inform bill that she is coming for him. Bill for his part really should have finished her off by now so he will only have himself to blame come the finish. but these samurai are not permitted an easy kill, first they must dance, and the dance is where this film is pure unadulterated Tarantino. Light, music and dazzling camera combine to pull you into the action as O'Rens Crazy 88 kato clones confidently step forward one by one to be slain. I got the impression that O'Ren wouldn't have sent them in if the had any chance of killing The Bride. and the O'Ren revenge itself is a tableau in snow to contrast perfectly with the inevitable blood spill.While watching The Bride will herself to wiggle her toes she reminded me of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction. didn't Mia once do a pilot for ""Fox Force Five"", maybe someone watched the pilot and offered her a starring roll in a revenge flick. The familiarity of the characters new and old, their connection to the QT universe is a Tarantino trade mark.Somebody, some time ago said something like we should stop trying to find a meaning or purpose to art but to enjoy it for what it is. Kill Bill is the best bit of art i have seen all year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A movie worth watching,"I feel Quentin is very relaxed. He talks about revenge like a wandering dance. The first person main line plus narration is really good, it can be super succinct to talk about complex multi line.

A Gush of Blood to the Head,"I've never done heroin, but I imagine that first hit, the one that gets you hooked, feels a bit like how I felt watching the massacre at the end of Kill Bill Vol 1.I was skeptical. As a big QT fan I felt six years was too long to wait, and I really didn't believe the anticipation and the hype would be rewarded with a great movie. I was expecting merely a good movie, and for QT good isn't good enough. Luckily he knows this, and instead he delivered what is, if not his best film, certainly his most energetic, exciting, stylised and downright fun film.There's been a lot of dissing of QT's motives with this movie. The hyper-stylised look of the film has been criticised as too fan-boy centric. This is a good point, but it's certainly no more so than Robert Rodriguez's Desperado, or the Coen's Blood Simple, and I don't remember anyone accusing those of being fanboy movies.Whatever your take on the movie, you surely have to admire the man's technical ability and sheer audacity. The tea house battle that ends the movie is a masterpiece, a real example of 'the ballet of violence' that John Woo fans have always loved.I did get the feeling from the crowd I saw it with that many were not sure what they were watching. Crouching Tiger... this most definitely was not. Pulp Fiction is was not. Hell, even Dusk til Dawn it was not. This was unlike anything QT has ever done and for that alone he should be applauded. On the release of Jackie Brown many critics had decided that he had run his course and he couldn't do anything else. Well Kill Bill is the samurai sword up the arse to those who believed that.Anyone who loves cinema should see this movie. I won't say that everyone will love it, but it has everything that Hollywood has forgotten how to do: a good story, adrenaline pumping action, and a sense of awe. Remember how you felt when you first saw Star Wars, the Imperial Destroyer roaring over your head? Or when Indiana Jones was being chased by a giant boulder? That kind of excitement is captured here as hordes of Kato-masked villains fall at Uma's sword, or the sight of legendary Sonny Chiba bestowing on her the sword that could cut God!Thankfully, the pop culture references that were his trademark have been toned down. Unfortunately, they've been replaced with an almost Airplane-style desire to reference other movies and TV shows. It's nice when it works (Ironside music, quotes from Eaten Alive (""I'm Buck, and here to f***""), even the girl from Battle Royale wearing the same costume as she did in that movie), but there is the potential danger for it all to become a little self-parodying, something Kill Bill most definately is not.See it and regain your faith in cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Quentin Tarantino's visual craftsmanship transcends perfection.,"If you have not already, GO SEE `Kill Bill Vol. 1'!!! I have only written about a movie once before and that was to rant on the insulting lack of effort Lucas put into Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. A `film' when compared to its Star Wars predecessors, I judged to be a sophomoric video game on crack only worth seeing for the stellar computer effects. Kill Bill is the opposite, Tarantino put his heart and soul into this film and it shows.Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the most enjoyable and visually stunning action film I have ever seen. Quentin Tarantino's visual craftsmanship transcends perfection. From the first seconds of the opening scene to the credits it's a 111 minute hold-your-breath, armrest-clenching, roller coaster ride. Tarantino takes all that is great from the Japanese classics (Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Lone Wolf and Cub, etc.) and the violent beauty of Sergio Leone's films, adds his own bold style and visual genius and creates THE perfect action film. It's a violent, poignant, funny, film with great acting (always a bonus in an action film) that is worth seeing multiple times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Missing a lot,"Kill Bill has turned out to be a rather incomplete piece of art, because a lot is weak and a lot is missing. Here is what I mean: First of all sophisticated choreography and editing do not hide that Uma Thurman cannot fight. The training sequence - unmissable element for any decent martial arts revenge movie-is poor. The way the Bride finishes off her first victims in the hospital is rather uninspired. Her ex-squad sister looks kinky but quite out of shape and has not a single good line. The Bride uses the best sword ever made and O-Ren-Ishii praises its quality in her final breath - so why don't we see it being manufactured? There could have been many ways of making it a memorable sequence. The Yakuza Dinner scene does not pull any strings. The Go Go Yubari character is great, but the introduction of her violent madness is boring. She kills a poor idiot in a bar - is that the craziest thing she did? There is no fine dialogue. Then this whole movie is slow and rather short, while some scenes are still too long - why cut it in two? There are also scenes I did not understand, like the motorbike ride, extensive exposure of the list with Bill's hand and the sheriff's senseless conclusions on the wedding slaughter scenery. Bill himself was too stupid to kill the Bride but then finds it below standard to kill her in the hospital ? The mountain of preparation time that Tarantino has taken, cannot be found back in the movie. It looks like the script has been glued together in weeks. In the end, there are many open identity questions involving husbands, parents, daughters, Bill and the Bride. This Who is Who-idea can only work if you really burn to know the solution, a feeling that I frankly miss. So, despite Sonny Chiba, a beautiful animation sequence and the gorgeous snow falling in the garden showdown, this movie is like the band at the restaurant: Looking better than it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Over the top! But fun to watch!,"Quentin Tarantino's action/drama Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is an edge-of- your-seat movie about love, revenge, and retribution. Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) plays the role of a bride who was wronged by her former ""friends"" and ""co-workers"" by being gunned down in the middle of her wedding in the middle of El Paso, Texas. Beatrix, known by her former team members as Black Mamba, wakes up out of her 4 year coma, realizes her child is gone, and sets out on a bloody path of killing and revenge.The movie begins with a confusing battle between two people that seemingly know each other, all while being interrupted by Vernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox.) daughter. The back story of the movie picks up after this scene to bring the audience up to speed. This also reveals the ultimate prize intended at the end of this rampage, Bill (David Carradine), but not much in the way of details as to what happened, and why it happened.This style of production is common throughout the film, Tarantino would show a scene or two ahead of time, and the next ""chapter"" would be the back story on what led up that specific event. Tarantino made special efforts in his production to leave story lines and plots easy to decipher, and easy to follow, but leaving out specific details to leave the viewer in suspense and wonder. This brings answers to many questions in the particular scene, but would often raise more questions.Tarantino also ensured the lighting throughout the film was clean, clear, and even. In the fight scenes the lighting was not dimmed or shaded to hide flaws in the fighting, or bring mystery to scene, but was ensure to be bright and vibrant with distinct colors to being the audience's attention to the action carried out in each scene. In the final fight scene with O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), the scene was dark, but well-lit at the same time. The scene was an outdoor terrace in Japan, with a thick blanket of snow covering the ground. The elements in this scene were minimalistic, but it brought a ""clean"" feeling to the entire sequence. The overhead lighting outside was distinctly low, but also enough to bring light from the snow, and accentuate the actors and their positions. The high contrast removed distractions from the storyline.The storyline had its own uniqueness, but the classic story of coming back from the (almost) dead to seek vengeance is a common theme. This reminds me of the recently released movie, The Revenant, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Tarantino did not develop a completely new storyline or theme, but his production and direction to this movie definitely made it distinct, and very fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"What's wrong with ""Kill Bill""","I actually enjoyed many aspects of the film, but it fails for the following reasons:*******WARNING*****SPOILERS******-While I think Lucy Liu is a pretty good actress (I loved her on ""Ally McBeal"") I think she is totally miscast in this role. At no time did I believe she was an assassin, and I never felt she was a threat to Uma Thurman's character. This role cried out for someone like Michelle Yeoh, an actress with a history of martial arts roles. Vivica Fox and Daryl Hannah both conveyed the necessary physicality and menace, but Lucy looked small and weak in the final battle vs ""The Bride""-The cartoonish squirting blood and unrealistic mayhem in the Crazy 88 fight. I know, it was meant to be cartoonish and unrealistic, but there has to be a certain amount of believability for an audience to buy into a movie, and this scene, with Uma mowing down henchman after henchman, just blew all credibility for the film.-Filming out of chronological order. I know it has become a Tarantino trademark, and it works brilliantly in ""Reservior Dog"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", but here it's just confusing. Why not just present the saga of ""The Bride"" as it happened? The plot has enough drama without playing with the time line, which brings me to my fourth point . . .-Style over substance. Tarantino is one of those directors who feels the need to constantly remind the audience, ""Hey, look over here, I'm directing this movie!"" There's enough camera movement and fast edits in this film to give you motion sickness. It's like a 2 hour music video. A well told story with some cinematic style is one thing - In ""Kill Bill"" the style over-whelms the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Tarantino combines everything he loves and he knows his audience is secretely craving. All the nerdy stuff that is now becoming mainstream, that we were all ashamed to watch before, Tarantino is giving it a little push in the spotlights.And we love him for that.

Instant Classic,Quentin has done it again and with no hesitation he pays tribute to the most interesting film genre of all time. Kill Bill has got to be the most well put together homage to classic samurai movies of our time. The great thing about this movie is that unlike the imported Zatoichi movies this movie has no lame voice over actors and is far from wacky with the character mannerisms. What makes this movie so enjoyable is that Quentin although staying as true as he can to the pop culture was able to Americanize it in his own way. I'm a big fan of martial arts films and also of the wu-tang clan so then again for me this movie was heaven. With Rza on the tracks and the experience of Sonny Chiba(the reason for the 70's martial arts film boom) this film is great success. Not for everyone though. Adults cannot enjoy a movie where its impossible to count the limbs severed however the story can inspire any age!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino does it again!,"Absolutely 100% pure grown action. Never have I seen a movie that lives so good up to its expectations, which it had a lot of, being the new Tarantino film and all. But yet again, Tarantino achieves to write a movie on same standard as Pulp, Jackie and Dogs. This film delivers 100% action, all the way through, along with Tarantino's independent touch. Tarantino has always had the gift to give the last little tweak to a movie, which makes it absolutely brilliant. What really marks this movie is also the perfect choice of underlying music, which makes those battle scenes, and the whole movie epic. No question that this film, just like the other Tarantino films will be seen over and over again, and there will be no doubt that vol. 2 of this film will be just as dazzling and seductive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Why doesn't anyone have spears, guns, Uzis ?","What I liked about Kill Bill Vol. 1 was that it was really modern movie that paid homage to many of the great TV and movies of the past 4 decades. The color was fantastic and beautiful, and actors and their characters played out superbly. Yeah, I have to give it to Tarantino. No one can make a movie like this (good or bad) other than him. I'd say that good far out weighed the bad in this case, and I hope he'd make more movies like this one that defy Hollywood stereotypes. He's not narrow in the way many American film makers are in that they can only play up a drama in a cook book sort of a fashion. His taste in cinematography is also very different from other Hollywood directors. I would hazard to guess that if a student made a movie like this in art schools, they would be berated very badly. If I like Tarantino, it's for these reasons. The stuffs that's good and fun that are getting forgotten these days is abundant in his movie making taste.Now for the ridiculous antics. First of all, you can never use a Japanese sword the way Uma Thurman did. Samurai's sword is made of steel core and iron blade. For this reason, the blade part chips very badly when it hits a hard object like human bones (this is the reason why the samurai always carries a shorter ""spare"" with the main katana). No way you can kill 100 people without devastating the sword way Uma did. Made by Hattori Hanzo or not. Secondly, Japanese Yakuzas carry guns these days. No one carries a samurai sword. So this is the purely fiction part of the movie. Uma would have been gunned down in five seconds in a real situation. Thirdly, there's no tea house like the House of Blue Leaves in Japan. The architecture simply isn't Japanese. It's clear that the set was in China.That's my take on this movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a great movie, and I wish more movies made were fun to watch as this one was.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino hits one out of the ball park!,"I first saw this movie in the dentist's chair of all places. That's right, my dentist allows you to watch a visor with a film playing while he does his drilling and cleaning. I thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 was appropriate in the dentist's chair. This is a non-stop action flick to the nth power.I decided to purchase the DVD and give it a second look. I was not disappointed. I was never bored, never looking at my watch. Uma Thurman plays the ultimate femme fatale. I liked the yellow jump suit effect. It reminded me of the jump suit that Bruce Lee wore in his last unfinished film called, ""Game of Death."" I was a big fan of Bruce Lee movies and I like the way Tarantino pays his respects to Bruce Lee and the Kung Fu genre as well.Everything about this movie is captivating. The way the scenes are set up and the music really contributes to the heightened tension in the scenes. The choreography is spectacular. Uma really must have had to condition herself for those fight scenes. You can tell it is her in most of the fight scenes doing her own stunts. Don't you hate it when you see a double in a fight scene? You don't have to worry about that in Kill Bill. This is the real deal folks.I also like the Japanese characters in the film too. It brings such an authentic feel to a picture when you here the villains speaking in their own native tongue. I don't mind subtitles in those scenes. It gives a nice touch to the scenes. You really think these fights are taking place in Japan. And who was Lucy Liu's body guard? Her character's name was called Go Go. She is wearing this naughty school girl outfit. She's hot! This film will definitely go down as a classic. Tarantino's signature style shines through once again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Perfect,"While I would'nt really want to go and try flaws in this movie, any attempt to do so would be really difficult besides the complaints that Tarantino ripped off somebody else. The formula has been perfect, to separate the story from the movie completely and set it aside for the sequel. But even after having done so, and having delivered non-stop bloody action, this movie really does not seem so commercial. Even when it comes to scenes with no action at all, the dialog is excellent and the sequences are gripping. Even if one imagines that Tarantino payed too much ""homage"" to others by using their ideas, the movie as an overall effort, comes out as highly original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Not Violent Enough,"I finally went to see Kill Bill yesterday at my local googolplex, I had high hopes due to all of the press it had been getting, being called the most gory, bloody, and violent film ever made, well Just off the top of my head the original Nightmare on Elm Street beats it for blood and gore hands down.There is a lot of blood in Kill Bill, to be sure, so much that they converted a few minutes of the film to black and white to reduce the impact. But blood is not gore, there are only like 4 or 5 gory moments in the film, the rest of it is all blood.Like my title said it wasn't violent enough, but maybe I need to qualify that statement, it wasn't brutal enough.  Hell, violence could be just people yelling if it's filmed properly.  Brutality is another thing all together, violence in a film keeps people watching, brutality makes them wince and turn away.So as far as violence goes, Reservoir Dogs was a more violent film, when you look at all the yelling Harvey Keitel does, than Kill Bill.All in all this film rates above Jackie Brown, but way way below Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

A beautiful blend of Asian art and cinematography,"Most trailers for ``Kill Bill'' were careful not to reveal how deep the movie itself really is, and for good reason.  Director Quentin Tarentino was more than likely intending for the film's major target audience to be fans he has won over in the past (``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Reservoir Dogs'') and to let the success of the film speak for itself.  Being familiar with Tarentino's niche for clever usages of timeframes and scene changes, I walked into the theatre knowing what to expect.  Not only was I wrong, but I was glad that my assumptions were false.The story begins explaining how a woman (Uma Thurman) who goes by the alias ""Black Mamba,"" was murdered by a quartet of assassins on her wedding day. She mysteriously survives a gunshot wound to the temple, and her strong taste for revenge to be dealt amongst the culprits outlines the plot that will ultimately become the Kill Bill series.  From the very start, the film is soaked in Asian cinematography subculture, including plenty of martial arts conflicts, Japanese voiceovers, and surprisingly, a 20-minute long segment of the film that is presented entirely in anime format (Japanese animation.)For those familiar with the Asian style of common horror flicks, blood is poured by the truckload; severed limbs are in great supply; and the themes of honor and respect seem to be valued above all else.  It is this stylistic backdrop that makes ``Kill Bill'' as refreshingly unique as it is.  One can't help but form a comparison with the ``Matrix'' trilogy, specifically for the two film's heavy use of martial arts.  In my opinion, ``Kill Bill'' triumphs on all fronts.Fans of Tarentino films will doubtfully be disappointed.  ``Kill Bill'' is an excellent example of prime storytelling, with just the right amount of character development to seed in with the entertainment value that most people will pay the matinee for.  Since the first volume of the series doesn't resolve a final conflict, it will eagerly have you awaiting the next episode.  Overall, one of the most intelligently creative films I've seen in quite some time.  9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
The sum of the parts...,"...will hopefully be.. Err.. Hang on. How does that go?As a standalone film, this doesn't work for me. It's fairly entertaining, but goes nowhere. A revenge film, with huge amounts of death-dealing, but the whole tapestry is left unfinished and we've only seen a few threads. Hopefully when the second volume comes out, it will come together.Much as I can't stand Tarantino as a person (not that I've met him, I just imagine from the interviews I've seen that he's one of the most annoying people on the planet) I think he's a pretty good craftsman in this industry. He's certainly thrown a few good scenes in here. But there are a few things that are jarring, like the anime and the black and white.Another reviewer mentioned the sherrif's sunglasses as an example of Tarantino's depth. Every character is thought out in great detail. The way I see that is that Tarantino finds it impossible to be subtle. If it were a throwaway moment, fine, but it's right in our faces, and then for good measure the deputy is the sherrif's son. Why isn't he out looking for the Bandit?The cast was great and the soundtrack excellent, but I'll give this a 7 until I see the whole thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Can't get much better than this,"This is a masterful film. Superbly acted, wonderfully directed and expertly rolled together in an all action romp with a sword. From the opening scene I knew I was going to love this film. Uma Thurman gives a totally believable performance as the bride so mercilessly tortured by Bill and his D.I.V.A.SThe basic premise is that the Bride on her wedding day was brutally attacked by the gang she left when she wanted to get married and have a baby. Because the attack was so violent the bride remains in a coma for 4 years. When she wakes up, she discovers her baby gone and goes on a brutal killing spree against the people responsible for the attack. In this film, Vernita Green a respectable housewife now and O-Ren Ishii, head of the Japanese mafia. The Venita Green fight is short and violent, but none the less satisfying. It introduces us to the situation and leads happily on to the main part of the film, which actually takes place before the brides attack on Vernita Green. It is the tracking down of O-Ren Ishii. Her backstory is cleverly told through Japanese style animation.The whole style of the direction of the latter half of the film is wonderful. The homages to various styles of kung-fu films from the 60's and 70's is a fascinating take on the story and brings a refreshing view to what could have become a very stale and boring story of revenge. the reason why it works so well is that it is taken to a whole new level of clever moments that thrill the audience and kept me captivated for best part of 2 hours. With a film this good, time goes out the window. Yes it is insanely violent in places, but hey this is Tarantino and to have held him back to a PG certificate wouldn't have done the film justice.

Kill Bill's review,"As far as I'm concerned, Kill Bill vol. 1 from Quentin Tarantino is the most accomplished movie that he has ever produced. All the ingredients which make the winning recipe of a Quentin Tarantino's film are in the movie : the passion of revenge as theme, non linear progress, bloody scenes, crude and long discussions and choices of music completely quirky but also wonderfully appropriate to the key actions.The simplicity of the scenario pushed Tarantino to focus on the characters. That is why the casting is very demanding. In Kill Bill, we can notice lots of actors with whom the American producer has worked before. Uma Thurman is one of the most present in his filmography and without her the movie would'not probably have known the same success. Another power of the movie is its references to a lot of kinds of cinema : from exploitation film to ¬´ western spaghetti ¬ª and include Japanese cinema. From a more technical point of view, I am really impressed by the farming of certain scenes sometimes completely unexpected and totally in accordance with the piped soundtrack. For example, the fighting scene against O-Ren on the song ¬´ Don't let me be misunderstood ¬ª should be considered as a cinematic work of art. For my last point, I would insist on the advantages of non linear progress. You can indeed insert strange stories which surprise the spectators and force him to recreate the story which he had imagined beforehand.My opinion is that Kill Bill vol.1 will remain one of the most appreciate action movie of all time thanks to all the elements I have mentioned higher.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Kill Bill: a ""meta-movie""","Watching ""Kill Bill vol.1"" last night I couldn't help but paying attention to the many styles, genres, and movies that it refers to and pays tribute to. While I'm not sure yet if it's my favorite Tarantino, I did have a lot of fun watching it. As a movie buff, the constant referencing to other movies and genres just added to the fun, turning it into a ""meta-movie', a movie about movies.Despite the obvious references to the karate movies of the 1970s, the Takashi Miike and Fukasaku hints, there were a lot of tributes to Sergio Leone and the ""spaghetti westerns"" of the 1970s. At times, even the music reminded me of the iconic compositions that Ennio Morricone made for Leone's films (I was expecting Clint Eastwood to show up with the poncho!).Also, I noticed the stylistic similarities of ""Kill Bill"" with ""Natural Born Killers"" (which Tarantino also co-wrote). Like the Oliver Stone film, ""Kill Bill"" uses different film textures, colors (B&W, color), bullets flying in slow motion into people's heads, animated sequences, etc. I couldn't help to be reminded of that movie at times.Overall, I think the jury is still out regarding how this movie rates compared to other Tarantino works. I still regard ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" higher in the scale, but ""Kill Bill pt. 1"" was very, very good. Before I saw it, I was way over-hyped by some reviews (particularly the exaggerated review by the guys at the Village Voice, that called it ""the best American movie in the last 30 years""...), so maybe I'm just adjusting my own opinion after so much hype.Nevertheless, it was great fun, an incredible exercise in filmmaking and editing, and the type of dialogues that only Tarantino can get away with. It's definitely one of the best times I had at the movies in a long, long time.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Endless action sequences that flirt with utter boredom,"There were so many action sequences in Kill Bill that I was nearly comatose at the end. In and of itself, this movie is not much better than movies made from video games. I despaired when the army of 88 took stage, and I was really ready for Volume One to be over. I am going to see Volume Two and hope for the best. It really has its work cut out. Kill Bill, Volume One, is a stylish flop.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarintino is brilliant! an immediate classic,"After surviving an assassination attempt Uma Thurman decides to seek revenge. And what revenge it is killing anybody and anything that stands in the way of this ""killing Machine"". From the moment she wakes up from her coma we see a controlled evil streak. Immediately the killing streak begins, even if at the start she is only half of her capable self. I recommend this film to anybody who has a tendency to like violence. It is also a must see for all the Tarantino fans out there who just cant wait for his next film. This film is full of blood guts and jaw opening twists. So go out and rent this as soon as you can. NOW!!!!!!! This film will be talked about for years to come. An immediate classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Good but overrated,"This film has many times been regarded as one of the best action movies ever made and one of Tarantinos best. I highly disagree with this. The dialogue is not as strong as in The Hateful Eight, Django Unchained, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, or Pulp Fiction. I feel like this film is more style over substance. Before you go ahead and dislike this review let me be clear. I don't hate this film, I enjoyed watching it. The action is great and Uma Thurman is amazing in the film. Tarantino's dialogue is still sharp and so is his direction. Besides that, the other characters are pretty weak. Yes, I am referring to Cottonmouth and whoever the chick she murders in front of the kid was. I know that this film is not a standalone story and that I have to watch Kill Bil Volume 2 to get a full opinion but as it stands now I am disappointed. The action, Uma Thurman, and Tarantino dialogue and direction are good enough for me to give this film a positive grade but it is probably my least favorite Tarantino movie from what I've seen. After I see Volume 2 I doubt that I will be rewatching this film in the future when I have other Tarantino films to go back to and that I enjoy more. So, because of all the things I said previously I will give this film a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
kill bill = charlies angels + 20000 l blood,"Fist: this movie is boooooring! It demonstrates the complete lack of new ideas in tarantino's mind, which he tries to compensate in vain by having martial arts wizards doing 85% film's work. The rest is a story as constructed as wearisome, told in musicclip style without the least credibility or authenticity.This is why the alleged cruelty doesn't matter. It just isn't touching at all watching comic-like characters without the least depth chopping each other into peaces.Unfortunately ""kill bill"" is another example of movies lacking just about everything but still made successful by tremendous promotion efforts, a media hype and the directors reputation, which he in fact deserved in the past but not any more.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino matches Leone,"Well, he's halfway there, anyway. Only the release of Volume 2 will show whether-what am I talking about, of course Volume 2 will be amazing. Anybody who doesn't think so should have their head examined.Kill Bill is quite simply the greatest action movie of this or maybe any other generation. It elevates trash to art, and then elevates art to trash, turning over everything we thought we knew about film, action, kung fu, exploitation, and Quentin Tarantino. Actually, it confirms what we already knew about Quentin Tarantino, but who would have thought that such a movie was possible?For the one person who doesn't already know the story, Bill and his cronies take out Uma Thurman's wedding party, she survives, and she's out for revenge. But really, that's besides the point. Revenge is the vehicle for Tarantino to throw more stylistic flourishes and homages on the screen than any other movie since Tarantino's last movie. It may take several years before serious film scholars can finally lock down just how many references occur in this film, although film is so deeply built into Tarantino's subconscious that we may never know how much this movie owes to everything from the Spaghetti Westerns to the films of Sonny Chiba and Bruce Lee.The action sequences are the best ever filmed. Period. Never have technical expertise and pure artistry intersected so beautifully as in these sequences. After a summer in which audiences were bombarded to no end with mindless car chases and banal shootouts, Kill Bill offers massive, stunningly choreographed fight sequences that never miss a beat. Tarantino manages to keep the pure exhilaration of his film at fever pitch until the false ending, intended to raise expectations for Volume 2 but succeeding only at reminding me of the epic that could have been. But if half of the greatest action movie ever made isn't enough to get you to slap down seven bucks, then you must really hate movies.My subject heading was in reference to an article I actually read on this website, in which Tarantino said that he would not be satisfied with his career until he created a scene that matched the raw power of the final showdown in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. I don't know if he quite matched it in Volume 1, although in several moments which I will allow you to find he came awfully close. If he doesn't match it in Volume 2, no scratch that, if he doesn't blow the final scene of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly out of the water in Volume 2, I may just be disappointed. But Tarantino is not one to disappoint.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

excellent,"I loved this movie. It was everything I expected and more. It feels like a live action anime and I love anime. Others say it's like a Shaw Brothers film; I haven't seen any Shaw Brothers film before but I want to now. A couple things I didn't like was how a lot of people in the audience would laugh during some seems. People are getting chopped and diced and you laugh? Weird. Yeah it's a movie but still. I also felt it was disrespectful toward Tarantino but like he really cares if someone he doesn't know laughs at his film. The film wasn't aimed at these people I guess, or this wasn't their kind of movie. I also felt a bit slighted that it's broken into 2 movies. I'm not rich and movies cost a lot. I'll stay 3+ hours for 1 movie, I stayed for lotr. I stayed for double features, you don't see those anymore.

Visually pleasing if nothing else,"Both Kill Bill volumes are either highly praised, or viciously put down. Some hated the ""violence"" that is typical of Tarantino, and some thought they were uncharacteristic of his style.Personally I enjoyed them, though the first is much more watchable. I don't quite understand the problem so many have with the violence; Kill Bill was such an obvious spoof/tribute to various film genres, and all of the blood was over the top on purpose. I thought Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction contained much more realistic violence. Kill Bill was meant to be fantasy in a way, and almost every element of the film shows this.No, Volume 1 didn't contain a lot of ""Tarantino dialogue"", but so what? It would get old if he did the same thing every time, and while his other films show his writing ability (among other things), Kill Bill gave him a chance to focus more closely on action and visuals. Regardless of the bloody scenes, this movie is truly a joy to watch, even if you had it on mute. The colors and filming techniques create series of beautiful imagery (which carries into Vol.2). If for nothing else, it is worth watching just for this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Grindhouse meets arthouse.,"The reviews for this movie are mixed, as one would assume they would be. Some critics have pointed out that the story is empty, that the characters exist as plot points that help move along the next ferocious, bloody action sequence. On the one hand, they are right; the story takes a back seat to the action and the film is based on a simple theme, revenge. Tarantino has no need to develop characters to deeply but when he does, he does so stylistically and with bravura (witness O-Ren Ishii's anime back story). A common complaint is that this film is not like Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, or Pulp Fiction and it is clear that Tarantino does not intend it to be like them. On the other hand, this film deftly welds together yakuza crime films, Leone, Kurosawa (see Sanjuro), Scorsese, Peckinpah, Hong Kong crime dramas, kung fu flicks, and samurai honor stories in such a seamless, visually breathtaking pastiche that griping about story and character development seems to me to be roughly akin to having a wonderful fusion meal in a seedy little joint and proceeding to complain about the decor.As a child of these genres, having seen everything the late 70's and early 80's had in terms of the B movie, I found Tarantino's bricolage to be amazing. For those who grew up on a staple of exploitation films and kung fu, this film is required reading as an attempt to throw it all together and succeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
It really was Hattori Hanzo,"I've never really liked a Tarantino film upon first watching, and haven't often even given them a second chance. But I'm starting to realize his films are of the grower type. When I saw Kill Bill Vol.1 for the first time (which was very late, only in recent years) I thought that yes, it has artistic quality...but I was also partly bored and annoyed because I didn't ""get"" the style. But for some reason when I watched it again a bit later it was pretty good and I don't even remember what was supposed to be so irritating earlier. I guess I'm starting to get into the Tarantino mood after all. His sense of humor is a bit odd, so it may take time to get used to.I don't feel like describing every detail of the film because everything is probably already been said a thousand times after the film was released with big hype. It's a tribute to (and parody of) old kung fu movies, but also has other elements in the Tarantino fashion of borrowing stuff from here and there. Spotting references to b-movies and pop culture is part of the fun in this movie.The story consists of different segments that use different styles. It's well put together and has a nice balance of action and slower scenes. The directing is creative and there are a lot of visually beautiful scenes and great music. And the acting is good too. Uma Thurman isn't my favorite face in movies (for some unknown reason I generally dislike her a bit) but I must say she acts excellent here and brings her character to life so that I start to like her. Other highlights in this first volume are the legendary Sonny Chiba as the impressive swordmaker character and a small appearance of Michael Parks who always gives me the creeps.All in all, it's a pretty consistent film. If you're like me and didn't really get into it on the first time around, maybe consider giving it another chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Visual Stunning,"True die hard Tarantino fans might be a bit shocked by this film, you hear so much talk of ""Will this movie hurt his career"" or things like that. The answer is an overwhelming ""No!"", but it should be noted, don't go in expecting Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Resevior Dogs or any of his writing. This movie is an homage to Samurai movies, and as such, it's not so dialogue heavy or witty as you might expect.  The movie is, however, very visually stunning, which is great for Tarantino, because he's stepping out of his box, as if to say ""I'm not going to make the same film over and over"" and it works.  This movie rocked!  It was without a doubt the most violent movie I've ever seen, and so to Tarantino, I say ""Thankyou.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
A clever person's stupid movie,"The trademarks of Quentin Tarantino's movies are well known: smart dialogue; self-awareness of popular culture (from the banal to the arcane); cinematographic innovation; ultra-violence; and a pervading air of cool. After the runaway success of his first two movies, his third film 'Jackie Brown' traded some excess of these qualities for a bit of conventional characterisation: I liked the result, although hardcore fans were disappointed. But for his fourth film, Tarantino has moved in the opposite direction. 'Kill Bill', a homage to Asian martial-arts films, sees Tarantino at his most stylised, and is as stupid as its name. The wafer thin-plot sees a female assassin out to kill those who wronged her; and little happens except for an improbable sequence of slayings. The sad thing is that there are many little touches that delight in this movie, Tarantino has not lost his mastery of the art of film-making (at least, not in the detail); but devoid of any rational context, it adds up only to showing off with blood. While Uma Thurman, in the lead role, is wooden, failing to convey either human emotion or cartoon menace. What's really unforgivable, however, is that instead of dazzling us with a quick punch, Tarantino made a film so long that, in spite of its essential vacuity, it had to be split into two movies to make it a commercial proposition. And I'm really not sure I'll be bothering with volume two.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"an embarrassing, artless waste of time.","It's definitely true that you can create original, beautiful, and clever combinations and call them art. Filmmakers, above any other artform, seem most comfortable with this sort of cultural cross-pollenation and re-contextualizing. Certainly, with previous films Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown (in an order of sequential creation and declining originality that cannot be called a coincidence) QT, as a film's filmmaker, assembled his work from the works of others in a combination of hipness and homage that appeased both cinema fans and your average filmgoer. However, the slope turned out to be way slippier than anyone would have guessed. His latest work fails as a cohesive mixed bag- it fails fans of the director and if anything, belittles them. It's among the worst films I've ever seen.It's true that I'm not a fan of the Kung Fu/Samurai/Whatever genre, but I don't have any particular aversion to blood and gore. Or for that matter, maligned characters. This is a very polarizing film- trash culture masquerading as important american Art- therefore it's only natural the film's supporters seek to discredit negative reviews of the film by implying that they don't understand the films' inspirations or they they have little propensity for blood, therefore, aren't qualified to accurately judge the film. No, it's not the gore- of which, I'll add, I've seen way more horrific examples of in many better films. As for ignorance of Kung Fu cinema, negative on that too, having a taste for other things doesn't make me unqualified to judge a film when it really needed to stretch out and use the parameters of a genre to create something original, not merely rape its cliches. Quentin's main contemporary Jim Jarmusch has always had to shoulder a kind of responsibility that comes with having your original ideas tactlessly lifted and turned into international blockbusters. I was shrugging and mumbling about 'Ghost Dog' from the second I left the Kill Bill theatre. Jim Jarmusch accomplished alot with that movie- he took slices (pun intended) at the Martial Arts genre and rewrote it to accomodate an outsider interacting in the traditional Kung Fu/Samurai manner with other outsiders, while keeping the concepts of duty and honor very intact. Above all, the characters were interesting and likeable, and felt like real people. Kill Bill is more of a counterfeit (from the 70s standard issue Shaw-Scope and 'Feature Presentation' intros on) than anything approaching great cinema, or even passable filmmaking.I didn't even feel like I was watching great cinematography, but it certainly didn't get in the way. The final fight scene, anti-climactic as it was, looked very nice in the softly falling snow. But as anyone who ever took a 35mm camera to the beach knows, it's impossible to mess up certain shots in certain settings. Furthermore, in another recent film, far less disappointing, Sofia Coppola knew that her movie in/about Japan would practically write itself. The dialogue from completely unconvincing A-List actors was awful, and even though most reviews (I'm talking major media) have referenced this, they usually push it aside to exclaim that well, it didn't really matter, this was all about the action. False. If that was truly the case, there'd be no dialogue. Hell, it got away without having a plot. The soundtrack was certainly below Tarantino's par- the old trick where you play a brutally appropriated, yet far from appropriate rock track (Nobody But Me.. originally by the Isley Bros, here in the Human Beinz version, the lamest lift off the Nuggets box set since Rushmore) contrasting with intense physical violence was clever once, 10 years ago in Reservoir Dogs (Stuck in the Middle With You). The gall of Quentin to use even other soundtracks (Truck Turner by Isaac Hayes, and then a definite forgery of Goblin's Suspiria score) is embarassing.No doubt fans of the Matrix (the films share the same martial arts choreographer) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the film and tv series share the same moronic, plotless fightin' babes concept) will be overjoyed- here's an approachable- well-known actors and a wide release, yet contrivedly marginal (seemingly ultra-violent, hipster director, RZA/mixtape-feeling soundtrack) film that will stimulate your dumbest internal desire for watching people fight, yet make you feel like you're taking in 'good'/'high'/'learned' art/culture.  It's even hard to believe that hard-core Kung Fu and Anime fans aren't calling Foul at this hopelessly Anglo-Saxon imitation. It's just a shame that people with any taste whatsoever aren't so easily fooled.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"

Faster Pussywagon Kill Bill!,"It's been a while since Quentin Tarantino last directed a movie. And Kill Bill Volume 1 is a worthy effort.Many of the Tarantino trademarks remain - non-linear chapters, visceral violence and cool music. But where this film differs from his previous films is that the dialogue has been reduced and the stylized, operatic violence has taken it's place in centre stage.As before, Tarantino, seems to specialise in taking trashy, exploitation cinema influences and mixing them into a spectacular whole. With this film he has done it again by using 70s martial arts movies, in particular, as his primary source of inspiration. The result is mesmerizing at times. There is even a Japanese Anime segment, which fits in despite the fact that it should never work!This is another addition to a great catalogue of work by one of the best modern filmmakers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Bloody homage to classic 70's kung-fu with a Tarantino twist!!,"First things first. If you loved those old 60s and 70s Kung-fu flick you will in all likelihood love this movie. If you hate those type of movies, you may hate this movie.With that out of the way, Tarantino beautifully takes memorable scenes from classic movies and gives it a Tarantino twist. Scene and music homages range from the old black and white samurai movies from the 50s, the aforementioned kung-fu movies of the 70s, Bruce Lee movies/tv show, classic western 70s action movies, the Night of the Living Dead, Sergio Spaghetti westerns, modern Japanese anime and culture, HK action operos, and on and on! Knowledgeable viewers will love picking out the little tidbits of classic movie icons (both visual and sound) in this gem! Only Tarantino can do this and make you smile (unlike other directors, in which viewers scoff at their lame rip-offs). I loved the scenes when Uma does something cool in which a corny 70s sounding ""bionic"" sound fx plays--absolutely fantastic!!!For the detractors of this movie, see my above statement. One thing viewers have to realize is that since this movie is a homage mainly to the Shaw Brothers and other Grindhouse flicks of the 70s (did you notice the intro of the movie?) that it's going to be heavy on action and short on Tarantino's usual dynamic dialogue (which I missed except for the excellent scene with Chiba-sama). This movie doesn't take itself seriously and expects the audience to do the same! There is a reason for the corny 70s music and sound fx. It is to put the reader in the mindset that what will be seen will be over-the-top and dare I say--""goofy"" for your average western viewer (for lack of a better word). When I first saw glimpses of the trailer (I didn't know it was a Tarantino flick) I knew it was going to be a action-heavy movie short on narrative. Obviously, seeing Uma wielding a samurai sword wearing a Bruce Lee ""Game of Death"" style jumpsuit surrounded by masked Kato men told me that this movie was going to be a comic book style flick. And in that, it did not disappoint at all. A great action flick from the man himself!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Not the best version of this movie, Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is.",This is in itself probably my least favorite Tarantino movie. In my opinion Kill Bill is one movie and I don't think the stand alone version is so great. This movie have a scene that is partly in black and white and it have parts that is from the part 2 which disturb me because I love to see part one and part 2 after each other.But I have find the Kill Bill version that is perfect for me: Kill Bill the whole bloody affair.Even if you want to see Kill Bill as separate films I recommend you to check this out because it have an expended anime montage and an in my opinion better version in color of the fight against the crazy 88. I recommend (( fmovies.com (were you don't even have to download it or signing in)) for you who can't find it on blue ray or DVD /Don't want to buy it.Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is highly rated but get way to less votes to arrive to the top 250 list.

Here comes the disappointment from Tarantino,"Kill Bill Vol. 1Quentin Tarantino's 4th film, Kill Bill, is a story of revenge that is quite stylistic in terms of fighting scenes but lacks a story that stirs up the emotions of revenge in the audience. It starts with a Klingon proverb from the movie, Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan: `The revenge is a dish best served cold' The movie doesn't waste time heating things up. First, we get a glimpse of Umma Thurman's character severely beaten face, a sound of shotgun (which supposedly should have blown her head off) and we skip to the part where Umma's character starts to take revenge from the people who did her wrong. As we go along, we are introduced to the characters of Deadly Viper Assassination Squad through flashbacks.This kind of backward storytelling, where we start from the end and gradually move back in time through flashbacks may work for other themes. Sadly, it doesn't work for a movie about revenge. By the time,  we get to know what has gone wrong between characters, the revenge part has already taken place and the movie is over. When we are watching Umma's character killing her enemies, we do not feel anything. I admit that every scene is very stylish, especially the fighting scenes. However, without establishing any familiarity towards the characters, the scenes are simply unable to create any emotion. This, I found to be the biggest problem with Kill Bill Vol 1. One might say that the real revenge will take place between Urma's character (Black Mamba) and Bill later, in the Volume 2, and by the time we get to see that happen we will have been acquinted with every little detail about the events that led to it. Even if this is true, the Kill Bill Volume 1 would remain to be a movie where an unknown character is taking revenge from her unknown assailants from the past. The fact still remains: we do not know enough about either Urma or her assailants to feel the slightest emotion for either one of them.Quentin Tarantino was apparently influenced by the old time Chinese Kung-Fu movies and wanted to make a movie where he pays his due respect to those old classics that led him to directing movies in the first place. He does add his own style and humor to what is already a well-established, a distinctive genre of film-making. Nevertheless, a movie where you know so little about the characters is doomed for failure. If you are interested in seeing a very-well shot martial arts movie (Kung-Fu combats and sword-fight scenes) embellished with super neat camera angles, choreography, music and editing, then Kill Bill might be just your movie. If you are expecting more than that, then it will probably disappoint you. If you want to watch a good revenge movie, I would simply recommend First Blood/Rambo. You will find yourself take side with Rambo against the evil small town cop. And when Rambo kicks ass, you will cheer for him as hero and take pleasure in the pain of his enemy, something you will not experience in Kill Bill Vol 1.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Good film - but the dialogue is crap.,"I'm sorry, as good as this film is; the dialogue is so below par I am shocked that it was penned by the same man who wrote the snappy patter, and grand soliloquies of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.I can only assume that he's either doing it on purpose, in an effort to emulate the lousy subtitles of his favorite Asian action films; Or that much of the dialogue is stolen from various sources; OR that he has lost his gift for it altogether.Come to think of it, all three reasons could be valid to a degree.Still, the bottom line is this: The trick he was trying to pull off didn't work.Amazing dialogue would have catapulted this film to greatness.

"Overly Violent, Overly Simplified Martial Arts Takeoff","12 October 2003 (revised January 25, 2019). This sometimes innovative, sometimes, daring, sometimes amazing martial arts-revenge thriller comes off as a stylistic choreography of fighting complexity. Uma Thurman, though, seems to escape death more by accident than by skill or talent. The retro-violence is so much over the top that it becomes a reflection of the comic-book and graphic novel version Japanese samurai movies. The flashbacks and animations, the emotional and cute comedic scenes are great. How does Uma Thurman survive her first encounter and how does she accidentally find a weapon in the second encounter and then how does she really fend for herself in a somewhat less than brilliant sword fight in the third. Overall, this was an amazing movie with great blending of some excellent flourishes for old movies with a consistently prominent soundtrack to heighten the whole independent cult film feel, but it misses the perfection mark by a few notches.

Quentin Tarantino's tribute to Hong Kong cinema is a martial arts masterpiece,"Many complain, often rightly, that most movies today are nothing but gratuitous violence and language. And Kill Bill is by far the most violent film I have ever seen. But there is nothing gratuitous about even a single moment. This is blood, gore, and casual ultra-violence used not only to shock and titillate, but to create a work of art.Never has bloodshed been so spell-bindingly beautiful. As Pulp Fiction was Tarantino's love letter to American popular culture and low budget movies, so Kill Bill is his love letter to the blood drenched cinema of Hong Kong And of course, what better way to pay homage to the shockingly violent martial arts movies and gangster flicks of the Far East than with the ultimate revenge fantasy. And there could sure be no one more deserving of revenge then the Bride, who was betrayed and left for dead by her mentor and fellow assassins on her wedding day. So after four years of recovery, nothing can stop her tracking down the people who did this to her and wreaking vengeance upon them.By my count, at least half of this movie consisted of fight scenes. And they are some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on film. The speed and skill of the combatants far surpasses anything I have seen. The movements of the Bride and her enemies are like a lethal dance, with each attack, parry, and evasion flowing beautifully and seamlessly into the next with exquisite precision. At times, the fighters circle slowly, gauging each other, testing their defenses, outwardly calm but with every muscle tensed for the coming strike. At others points, they put everything into the attack, launching series of blows too rapid for the eye to follow, or engage in sensuous twists and back flips that carry them just beyond the reach of their opponents blade. To see them fight is to fall in love with them and their art, and to be almost ashamed at having done so.Nor does the movie ever flinch from showing the sheer brutality of combat. I can't remember a movie with more blood than this one. Blood soaks the clothing of the Bride and her former colleagues as they fight, drips from each cut they inflict on each other. It coats the walls and sprays a crimson mist as limbs are hacked off and bullets find their mark. And when needed, fantastic geysers spurt forth, showering everyone in the vicinity. At times there is so much blood that the only way the film can duck and NC17 rating is to switch to black and white, which only gives it an air of noir. And every drop is shed for a purpose; whether to add grit and realism, or an over the top feeling of unreality, or even a dose of humor.And humor is something that Tarantino does very well. He is a master of creating situations and visuals so shocking, so filthy, and so completely unexpected that you can't help but laugh, then wonder if you're right in the head. His choices of music are highly unconventional and often comic as well. For instance, most directors would not use Japanese renditions of American pop classics during the build up to climactic showdown. But here sharp counterpoint between what's playing and what's on screen creates a slightly wacky undercurrent that fits very well with the film's tone.As usual, Tarantino has packed Kill Bill with references and homages to earlier movies, most of which I missed, being neither a film historian nor a martial arts junkie. The film is naturally split into chapters, which are arranged for maximum impact rather than in chronological order, although not nearly to the extent of Pulp Fiction. There are also vast yet intentional changes of pace, with the action heavy segments being interspaced with periods of recovery and preparation. And in a highly original move, the entire third chapter is an anime.Kill Bill has very little in the way of depth or subtlety. It is not highbrow by any stretch of the imagination, and no-one in their right mind would show this to anyone under seventeen. But it is thrilling, visually stunning, and simply awesome. This is truly a masterpiece written in blood. Pulp Fiction may still be Tarantino's best movie, but this has to be my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Best movie ever,"This movie kind of spoils all other movies for me, probably until Volume 2. There is just no way of improving on this. Other movies can be fun, but this one is cinema's finest hour(and a half).10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Tarantino's Best So Far,"I Loved this movie! Excellent fight scenes, very cool dialogue (""I can tell you with no ego that this is my finest blade. If, on your journey, you should encounter God... God will be cut."" - great stuff), and Uma Thurman looking sexier than hell.9 out of 10 (would get 10 except that it's really only half a movie).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"intense, exciting, moving, operatic","Postmodern is a daft concept used by pseudo intellectuals when describing dull films by other pseudo intellectuals. Kill Bill is not post modern. Its few filmic jokes are there because they work not because they reference something. Its obvious hyper reality is coupled with some intensely emotional moments, that work because of the brilliance of the actress Tarantino has employed to star in this violent opera, and because of whichever brilliant anime artist he got to direct the superb animated sequence of the film. It is clear that, irrespective of Kill Bill's Hong Kong / Anime / Karate Film subject and action, this film owes it's greatest debt to Sergio Leone. And it is high praise indeed when I say that this film not only captures the stylish extremes and beauties of Once Upon a Time in the West, it may even surpass them. As with previous films Tarantino subverts linearity; this is once again in order to fabricate a Hollywood narrative NOT to be arty or postmodern or pseudo intellectual. It's done cos we dumb audiences like an emotional beginning, middle and end. So reviewers for God's sake take note; Tarantino chapters his film cos it's cool not cos its arty; he moves backwards and forwards in time cos it's cool and he needs to not cos it's arty; he references other films cos it's cool and it works not cos it's arty. This film works; it's cool and it's an intense, exciting, moving, operatic, finely crafted masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"Brilliant, a lesson for modern day dark film makers!! Its a real treat to watch!","Uma thurman is amazing, a talented actress who played the role very convincingly. I absolutely loved the film and action is super!!One of my fav movies!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
"ok overall, but disappointing for Tarantino","Let me start by saying this film was entertaining to watch.  I must say I felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment compared with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  First off, he greets the viewer with the announcement in the opening credits that this is fourth movie.  Well Whoopty-Frickin' Doo! Lets just have a parade for Quentin.  We are all so very proud of you.  The writing was disappointing in that I found it bland.  This isn't Speed- a movie like this must use the script to capture and hold the viewer.  At times got the sense it was trying to hard, much as in the second Matrix movie when every line has laced with fancy syntax.  Second: some of the special effects were distracting.  Everytime someone loses a limb (which happens many times), a virtual ""Old Faithful"" geyser of blood spouts forth. Funny the first time, but old by the tenth.  Third: Plot holier than the Pope.  Maybe they plan on finishing this in Kill Bill Vol 2: The Search for More Money (Credit to Mel Brooks).  You never really find out how Uma gets to be on her quest- other than the last fifteen minutes prior to her assassination attempt.  They spend too much time developing relatively unimportant segments of the story such as how Lucy Liu got to be who she is.In spite of my criticisms, there are many moments that grip the viewer, and plenty of bizarre comedy to keep one interested.  The fight scenes are adeqate and he does some neat stuff with weapons.    I just hope that Mr. Tarantino can redeem himself Vol. 2.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
Absolutely gorgeous. One of the most beautifully stylized films I've ever seen,"Don't put off until next week what you should see today. Violence be damned, this film ( not movie) is killing made beautiful. Quentin's love for all things cinematic shines through every frame, and there is no doubt in my mind that Part2 will be even better. The origin of O-Ren-Ishii alone is worth the price of admission.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime"
