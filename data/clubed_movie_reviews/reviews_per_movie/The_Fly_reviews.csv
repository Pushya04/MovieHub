This and the Thing are the best horror remakes ever made!!!,"During the 1980s, horror was rising, with Friday the 13th started the decade with a bang, with sequels, parodies, and ripoffs in its path. Halloween would have a sequel and many more, and Freddy Krueger started a long running franchise by Wes Craven. What the critics really loved was the remakes of horror movies lured to younger audiences who never saw the originals. John Carpenter's The Thing, while it underperformed at the box office, became a favorite on home video and a cult classic. In 1986, director David Cronenberg, who made heads explode in Scanners and made video horror with Videodrome and changed political horror in the film version of The Dead Zone, would take great risks remaking a 1950s b movie classic, The Fly, by casting Jeff Goldblum as the main character and Geena Davis as his love. Coming out the same year as Aliens and produced by Mel Brooks, The Fly became Cron's highest grossing movie ever and spawned a sequel which didn't do well but became a cult classic in its own right and there are talks of another remake, this time with CGI and a bigger budget. Catch it while its on tv and you'll like the practical effects of the movie as well as the memorable music by Howard Shore. Be afraid, be very afraid...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still Fascinating & Very Disturbing,"It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever! I watch it about every 5-7 years. It's utterly fascinating, but it is so uncomfortable to watch at times I always wonder, as I am viewing it, why I put myself through this each time! The original movie, with Vincent Price, is ""dullsville"" compared to this re-make.Things can get really disgusting as Jeff Goldblum ('Seth Brundle"") slowly turns into a huge fly. The transformation is very gross in certain spots, and certainly gut-wrenching to witness. You can just feel his girlfriend's anguish and horror as she witnesses Goldblums' incredible physical and mental change. Geena Davis gives a convincing performance in that roles as ""Veronica Quiafe.""The story is not just a dumb horror-creature movie, but an intelligent science fiction tale with both leading actors excellent. I don't Davis ever looked prettier, too. John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, ""Stathis Borans."" Those three characters dominate the film. I can't even remember anyone else in here.The ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock. In fact, by the nd, this movie will have you emotionally worn out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
next-level stuff going on here,"I saw this movie for the first time a few days ago, and I took away two thoughts.  1. This is just about the most depressing film ever made.  2. This is not really a horror picture, or a sci-fi picture.  Those elements are present, but the story itself is really an existentialist drama.  The most fascinating moments, to me, involve Brundle's metamorphosis, and his total disability to figure out who he is, to make any sense of his continually changing identity.  It really makes you think while you're being grossed out.  You don't get a lot of that anymore.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the original and one of the best horror films ever made,"David Cronenberg redefined what we think of as creepy with this brilliant film. The makeup special effects and grossouts are top notch, but what is most surprising about The Fly is that it turns out to be a very well acted and emotional love story. It greatly surpasses the original '58 version.The film focuses on the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis at the top and once it takes its turn towards horror it really pays off. It's not just scary, it's a tragedy too. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal. He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar for this, it's easily his best performance.I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror, and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does one thing well,"Most science fiction films are big on ideas and special effects, but weak on coherence and character development; most horror films are just the same, except without the ideas. But David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' takes one simple idea, develops it properly, and eschews (its genuinely terrifying) special effects until its truly horrific climax. And by paying some attention to the personalities of its protagonists, it actually makes you care about them (Jeff Goldblum is excellent in the lead role), and adds a level of serious reflection on the very nature of human mortality to the raw shock. The mix amounts to a gruesomely good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Successful transition of Cronenberg's brand of 'body horror' to the mainstream...,"Why is it this film that will always be his REAL 'breakout', and not any of the others before or since? The truth is, beneath all the biological yucks and makeup (there is plenty of both) lies a strong emotional core. Goldblum is enthusiastically likable as scientist Seth Brundle, and Geena Davis is just how Geena Davis seems to be in real life... sweet. It is how the events change both characters EMOTIONALLY, not physically, that inspires the true horror.The blending of both the above elements makes this remake appeal simultaneously to the 'gross out' crowd, and those in the mood for a more cerebral horror experience. A concept of B-movie stature, electrified by the skills of A-list talent.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scientific fears,"Have a lot of admiration and appreciation for David Cronenberg. His films are technically very well made and while his films are very disturbing a good deal of his films also have either a dark or subtle wit, poignant emotion or even both. He is for me one of the most interesting and unlike any other out there directors, despite being known for body horror and originating it his films are much more than that.Like what was said for 'Dead Ringers', one of my favourites of his, all this couldn't be more apparent in 'The Fly' and actually even more so. Despite really liking the 1958 version of 'The Fly', count me in, having seen this film since watching that, as somebody who considers this remake superior by quite some way and by far one of the remakes ever made. This is a rarity when it comes to remakes, with a lot of which deservedly held in low regard and considered as pointless. Yet 'The Fly' feels much more than a remake, one would not know it was one really. It is also a fabulous film on its own merits, a landmark of its genre and one of Cronenberg's best, still is his most acclaimed critically, for sure from personal opinion. Some may not be able to get past the gore, of which there is aplenty and it does churn the stomach, but it was not a problem for me now and do feel one is missing out if not able to get past.'The Fly' still looks great. Cronenberg's films are seldom less than well made, he always is a very technically accomplished director and 'The Fly' is one of his best looking. Very accomplished and showing a mastery of visuals and effects, with some truly atmospheric, remarkably elegant and clever photography (if not as complex as that for 'Dead Ringers' for example). The special/make-up effects are not just pretty darn impressive, they made me go wow, a technical achievement back then and they hold up extemely well now. Why else would 'The Fly' hold the distinction of being the only Cronenberg to win an Oscar, which was for the makeup (richly deserved, though certainly would have had no problem with 'Legend' winning as the makeup was also amazing in that film)?Cronenberg regular Howard Shore, the director's ""composer of choice"" even, provides one of his best scores, which is like its own character and like a character of its own in the film. It is very haunting without being obvious, but what is especially memorable about the score is how it makes something beautiful out of the visual intensity going on, without ever being at odds, and how it goes for the emotional core of the story as well. The orchestration is also some of his biggest and most complex, brought to vivid life by the London Philharmonic, a prime example of this is the opening which has always left a big emotional impact on me.Some of Cronenberg's best directing can be seen in 'The Fly'. The atmosphere is unnerving in unmistakable Cronenberg style with nail-biting tension to boot. There is a lot of gore and it churns the stomach, but to me the film wasn't too over-reliant on it and didn't use it gratuitously. Even more impressively, as well as being a visual master, he achieves a balance of horror mixed with tense thrills, humour and emotion. The script has delicious dark wit, provokes thought and truly heartfelt and never cloying emotion, not many films achieve this balance so well and Cronenberg was one of the masters at this. The storytelling is some of the most disturbing of any Cronenberg film and of any film, but 'The Fly' is also the film of his that connected with me emotionally the most. The tragedy of the story is truly poignant stuff, and it is genuine, not forced or manipulative.Not many films of this genre have had me really caring for the characters, and again in a way that was genuine. 'The Fly' did this and is an example to all film, the characters here have depth and well-defined and distinct personalities and character traits and not once did they bore or irritate me. The acting is terrific, as good as Geena Davis is, and she is extremely good, Jeff Goldblum is pretty extraordinary in a very unsettling and sensitive portrayal that disturbed and moved me. Goldblum is always worth watching but he in my mind has never been better than here, one of the best performances in a Cronenberg film.Altogether, fabulous and one of Cronenberg's best as well as a genre landmark. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The terrifying ""Brudlefly-project""!","Truly great – but very nasty – update of the classic 1958 sci-fi film with both Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis in the roles of their lives. Technically, this is a remake, but with a genius like David Cronenberg in the director's chair, it's obvious that this isn't anything like the uninspired and irritating remakes that are being released nowadays (""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). Cronenberg's interpretation of this ultimate terror-tale differs greatly from the original. In fact, the only resemblance is the basic premise of a fusion between an obsessive scientist and an ordinary housefly. Goldblum is terrifically cast as the brilliant, but slightly confused mastermind Seth Brudle, whose lifework are ""telepods""; funny looking machines capable of transmitting matter through space. Journalist Davis, with whom he has a romantic adventure, closely observes the progress of his work but when he teapot's himself through space, the catastrophe happens. Mentally as well as physically, Brudle undergoes a horrible transformation into a fly and it cannot be stopped. ""The Fly"" is a very devastating film. Powerful enough, but not exactly pleasant to look at. Like only the greatest directors can pull this off, Cronenberg overwhelms the audience with a sublime mixture drama, misery and repulsiveness. You feel as helpless as the characters themselves and you painfully wait for the unhappy ending to come! The screenplay is filled with genuine metaphors and the romance between Goldblum and Davis is beautifully illustrated. The special effects, mainly created by Chris Walas (who went on directing the 1989-sequel) are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very terrible film to see,"David Cronenberg's version of ""The Fly"" has little in common with Kurt Neumann's 1958 film of the same title, one of the cheaply made 'creature-features' of the 1950s Instead, it reveals many of the director's obsessionsJeff Goldblum is Seth Brundle, a Mad Scientist who is working on 'teleporting', a means of transporting objects through space Geena Davis is Veronica Quaife, a magazine writer who becomes interested in his work, and in him They start an affair, but Seth believes Veronica is still seeing her former lover In a rage he tries to transport himself, and his genes become caught up with a fly that gets into the machine Slowly Seth takes on the features of an insectAs in other Cronenberg's films, sexuality is seen as a dangerous force that leads to disaster Seth cannot get his amazing machine to transport living creatures until he has experienced the delights of sex with Veronica, but then almost immediately his jealousy leads more like a fly he develops a raging libido; the more physically repulsive he is, the more he wants sexLike many successful films of the 1980s, ""The Fly"" is a hybrid, fusing elements of both horror and science fiction Considering that the plot is from the latter genre, the elements of fear and disgust with the human body are traditional to horror Both genres, as this film will illustrate, benefited greatly from the increasing sophistication of contemporary special effects technique, and the make-up abilities The success of the film led to sequel in 1989, in which the son of Seth and Veronica begins to display familiar symptoms",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror movies ever made,The Fly is more than a horror movie it's a statement of the eighties. I remeber seeing this film for the first time when I was five years old and telling my friends about the gore scenes but as I got older and viewed the film again I realzied how much of a tragic love story the film was. Jeff Goldblum gave an Oscar worthy performanc of ill fated scinenits Seth Brundle and Genna Davis gave an equally good performance as his love interest. The special effects were very good for the eighties and the film does have some scary moments. If you've never seen the film you should.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A grossest new adaptation from the classic film  , being sharply directed by David Cronenberg","New version from the 1958 classic with Jeff Goldblum as the obstinate scientific who is doggedly trying to make the experimenting in his own body for transportation with a genetic transporter machine .

Then he begins to evolve into a human fly . Meanwhile , he falls in love with a beautiful journalist played by Geena Davis who is investigating the strange events by orders of her chief , John Getz , and ex-lover .This frightening picture displays tension , suspense , shocks and lots of blood and gore .

The movie is rated ¨R¨ for the crude images , as many scenes are excessively disgusting and gross but it is solely apt for old people , no little boys , neither squeamish , as abound guts , slime and gore .

Exceptional Horror,"Just last week, in one of my Screen Analysis tutorials, our tutor good-naturedly decided that if we were going to be film students we needed to be exposed to disturbing things. What he showed us was an excerpt from an expressionist French film made in the late 20's, the name escapes me. Before we had reached the climactic scene, every one in the class had already guessed it, as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade, and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes. At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor, jokingly but in something of a shaky voice, ""Why are you doing this?""This question, I think, could well be the definitive mark of really effective horror, and it was certainly in the back of my mind nearly all of last night as I was watching David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" for the first time. True horror films, by their nature, should strive to get their audience to ask this question, because it means that they are transcending the illusion of moving pictures and becoming a film  suspending disbelief and getting under your skin. Effectiveness aside, however, I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing, and not your own. With both these thoughts in mind, I suspect that ""The Fly"" could well be the second best horror film of all time (behind Kubrick's ""The Shining"", which, I admit, got to first place by completely different criteria. Such is life, I'm afraid).Remade from a 1958 concept starring Vincent Price (and later popularized by ""The Simpsons""), the film follows a pretty archetypical horror premise: science gone (of course) horribly wrong. In this case, Jeff Goldblum (in his tour-de-force performance) plays Seth Brundle, an independent scientific visionary who has been slowly designing a device that will ""change the world as we know it""  a Teleporter. When he shows his invention to romantic interest Veronica (Geena Davis), it is not quite ready to handle living tissue (demonstrated on screen in the first instance of quite confronting gore), but as the two grow a relationship and fall in love, the wrinkles in the technology are ironed out and so Brundle takes one small step for man and tests the machine on himself. Unfortunately, in the process of teleportation, his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly, and although not immediately transformed, as in the original, the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before  and for damned good reasons.Cronenberg, of course, never shortchanges his audience with graphic gore, and even viewed with the critical eye of Generation Y, the film's mid-eighties effects are still quite sickening, none more so than Goldblum's slow physical transformation. What makes this whole affair really outstanding, however, is his psychological transformation: the truly disturbing thing is how front and centre the humanity of these characters and their world is kept. Davis and Goldblum are the heroes in this regard  their chemistry is palpable, and her affection for him struggling against her disgust at what he is becoming, coupled with his own struggle to keep the fly in check, create the kind of riveting discomfort usually only commanded by train-wrecks.I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel ""Requiem for a Dream""  although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror  and in both examples the source is basically Love. In this sense, the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do, because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting, lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be, and then Horror is unjustly, and irrevocably, forced upon them. This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that ""(he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it. But now the dream is over and the insect is awake"". And in true Cronenberg style, this prophecy becomes quite literal in the third act (think Vincent D'Onofrio in ""Men in Black"").Now, in a film that had spent more time on sinister close ups of flies and haunting music cues and not on the bare and essential humanity of the doomed lovers, at this point I probably would have asked ""Why are you doing this to me?"" and that could have been the end of it  dismissed as senseless disturbing cinema and forgotten. As Cronenberg, Goldblum and Davis have done it, what I asked was ""Why are you doing this to them?"" And that's the kind of film that you don't ever forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror masterpiece my favorite one David Cronenberg best movie,"My all time favorite horror film and everyone who watch it and like it knew it is a true David Cronenberg masterpiece and of course his best film! It is a stylish science-fiction horror film based on George Langelaan's 1957 short story of the same name.The film tells of an eccentric scientist who, after one of his experiments goes wrong, slowly turns into a fly-hybrid creature. My all time favorite creature horror film I have this movie in my video Blu-ray collection and I love 80's horror films to death.Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on a project which is a teleportation device that can teleport molecular structures until one day he experiments on himself with it accidentally lending a Fly into the machine with him being fused. He seems normal after that but days later he is changing and even his sexy journalist girlfriend (Geena Davis) even starts to notice his weird changes he grows through each day like if he's decaying and that he will soon become a monster.Powerful and horrifying remake of the 1958 Vincient Price Science Fiction horror classic! Canadian Sci-fi/horror/thriller mastermind David Croenberg sets up another masterpiece much like ""Eastern Promises"", ""Videodrome"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""Scanners"", ""The Brood"" or even ""A History of Violence"" for proving he's a genius on all levels.This one nearly tops the original in some ways using state of the art special effects and gore from Chris Walas (""Gremlins"" and ""Scanners"") which are quite disgusting to this day like the stomach churning dough nut scene.The performances are just flawless and the film also has emotional which makes this a great Sci-fi horror movie with pure though and disturbing images, this one isn't for weak stomaches but it is a brilliant movie that goes into our deepest fears and mind.

A Deceptively Disgusting Love Story...,"Director David Cronenberg takes a different approach with THE FLY than in his other horror films. On its surface, it's a story about an experiment gone horribly awry, resulting in a hideous hybrid / mutation. In reality, it's a tragic love story about a woman named Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) and her quirky, scientist boyfriend, Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum).Indeed, the experiment does go wrong, and notoriously sickening horror ensues. Through the course of the movie, Brundle undergoes an astonishingly repulsive transformation. The special effects and makeup in this movie are phenomenal! However, this is not just about a man in a frightening rubber costume.This is a movie with surprising emotional depth. Veronica's love for Brundle is tested beyond all measure, right up to the frenzied finale. Ms. Davis is absolutely believable in her devastated role, as is Mr. Goldblum in his series of deteriorating states. These are star-crossed lovers, caught up in something that could very well destroy them both. It's about what happens when someone we adore is stricken with something debilitating / disfiguring and dangerous. Veronica stays with Brundle far beyond the point of sanity. Only her deep feelings for him could allow such devotion.One of Cronenberg's most intriguing and insightful efforts...",,Anonymous,Horror

A masterpiece aided by special effects,"I think that this is a grossly underrated film - a noteworthy landmark in modern horror. I would expect nothing less than excellent from my favourite director Cronenberg, and this doesn't disappoint. Goldblum's performance is particularly good as the nervy scientist Brundle, but I think the main reason for the film's achievement is its structure - very subtle, very well made. Most of the action takes place in the last third of the picture, but there is a great suspense building up to that point. And the special effects are jaw-dropping - Brundle's hideous transformation is reminiscent of Lynch's 'The Elephant Man'. This film has a reputation for being unnecessarily gory, which is actually not at all true. It is a very intelligent picture, about love and other issues as much as horror, and a must-see for anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amusing but repulsive,"Jef Goldblum is listed as the lead in this film but although his character remains for nearly the entire duration of the film,after awhile you can hardly consider it him.
There's no question as to whether the film deserved the Oscar for Best Makeup as it was probably the greatest achievement in the field since The Thing. This film was heavily criticized upon it release for its level of gore. While perhaps a not up to today's standards,Brundlefly is still one of the most repulsive 'things' portrayed in the film. Which also leads to a few questions about the plot such as:which person would live that long something so hideous and who would have so much restraint about finally putting it out of its misery ? That is just one way the film differs from the original. In fact, it's really not a matter of how it differs but what is similar-beacuse the film shares very little with the 1958 original.While maybe not for the faint of heart(although the gore is comical at points) The Fly is still a compelling and fairly entertaining picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In some ways better than the original, but with emotional holes","The Fly (1986)I just saw the original 1958 ""The Fly"" and as creaky as it was in some ways, it was a thrilling idea and had some great roles. Two days later I'm zooming ahead three decades, and boy, what a difference a day makes. It's better and it's worse. But rather than compare them, we turn to the 1986 version, directed by semi-auteur big budget director, David Cronenberg.The story again dominates, but it has taken amazing leaps in concept. If you like the transporter idea, that's only the beginning. The longer the movie runs, the more bizarre and campier it gets. In fact, if you can skip the first half hour (and you could, actually) you'll have more fun. In the second half of the plot, the lead boy genius scientist (now more like 30) played by Jeff Goldblum, disintegrates. This is good for a lot of reasons, one of them is to get beyond Jeff Goldblum the actor, who seems to alway show his awareness of the camera and ruin what might be better acting, and better characters. So when he is no longer quite himself, we are mesmerized by the horrors of the plot. Of course, you have to get past the grotesqueness of it all--it is really gross--but that's part of the ongoing shock.Geena Davis? Completely convincing and solid as a reporter and eventual second fiddle to Goldblum. And the third actor with any part at all, John Getz, the reporter's editor, is forgivably awful, and meant to be unsavory. The relationship (sexual and otherwise) between these three is unconvincing at best, and the notion that the reporter would even slightly trust this editor is untenable. That much we need to believe in, just as much as we can imagine the other love affair, which is both believable and loaded with implications later.But the idea, the idea! Simplified and impossible, it's still a perfect movie scenario, and it's a riot, and terrifying. When it defies logic, swallow and give it a chance. Not a quite great movie, but great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brussels, Belgium","It was nice reading the reviews for this film as so many people picked up the real elements of this movie and not just about the horror.This movie, as most great movies, is a subtle love story, where someone realises they are a burden and maybe even a danger to them, and so make the ultimate sacrifice.Cronenberg is probably my favourite director as he is able to take unusual film idea and turn it into something intense and believable.  As he has evolved he has improved his writing and as a results the stories have become more hidden and more intelligent.I think the Fly, Deadzone and Videodrome are his best work.  His more recent films, Crash and the Naked Lunch have impressed me with his ambition and ability to try something new, but have failed as entertainment.I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does, even with very obscure subjects, but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again.Highly recommend  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jeff's Kiss,"Idly browsing the Disney Plus 'Star' Channel and we came across ""The Fly""and decided to give it a watch. Though time hasn't been kind to some aspects of the film, the visual effects are still breathtaking.Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) a scientist of the verge of a breakthrough begins a relationship with Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) a journalist looking for the next big science story. Seth's innovation is in matter transportation and on a drunken emotional night he decides to become the first human to go through the machine. Unfortunately, a house fly is trapped in the booth with him and the machine, unable to tell one DNA strand from another, fuses them together on a molecular level. As the fly aspects begin to win out, Seth's immediate physical improvements give way to mental and bodily decline before Seth comes up with a desperate plan to save himself.As I said, in some ways, the film's 80's aesthetic really does date it somewhat. This does feature in the clothing styles obviously (Geena Davis' shoes and socks combinations are a particularly galling example) but also in some of the tonal choices. The lack of an epilogue scene, for example, where we might have discovered what happens to Veronica's baby, feels usual to a modern audience but also with the entire character of Stathis Borans (surely one of the oddest name choices for a character ever). Borans is played by John Getz and is Veronica's ex and who has a creepy, borderline obsessive preoccupation with her. He ultimately becomes the hero of the story but he's tough to root for, or feel sorry for, given his earlier actions.Chances are though, you're here for the effects which are never less than solid and often truly spectacular. Mostly practical, they range from effective stuff, like the breaking of the arm during the arm wrestling scene, through clever combinations of wire work and set building to give the impression of Brundle climbing the ways - to the most impressive, the head bursting reveal of the creatures final form.I really enjoyed this viewing and it's inspired me to try and revisit some more of Cronenburgs body horror classics.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
well-acted but repellent and unremittingly depressing,"This is an example of a decent movie that is nearly impossible to enjoy. Paradoxically the special effects are much, much too good at what they do, sucking the entertainment value out of the experience.Actually, labeling this a decent movie is probably being generous. Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum (until he's buried beneath pounds of make-up) give performances that are both credible and interesting, and I've always liked Howard Shore's operatic score, but those are the highlights. The pseudo-metaphorical science is ludicrous, and far too much time and effort is spent trying to convince the audience that it's not. I respect that there was some restraint shown on Cronenberg's part as far as that goes, but when gene splicing science is the premise of your movie, there's got to be something credible in the explanation of what goes on.Where there is not the same restraint is in the panoply of special effects detailing Brundle's transformation from man to Brundlefly. Is there a reason for those meticulously crafted (and justifiably famous/infamous) scenes where we learn how Brundlefly eats, or what body parts have become obsolete and have fallen off, other than just to shock and titillate? It strikes me that a more streamlined and less repugnant alternative would have been a Phantom of the Opera-esquire reveal of Brundlefly closer to the end of both his transformation and the storyline, with a building sense of foreboding, a la the original '50s Fly.This is not the same kind of bad film that ""The Fly II"" is - this film does most, if not all, things better than its sequel. What sinks this picture (and leaves #2 untouched) is the ambition with which it was made. ""The Fly"" falls too far short of its own expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great remake  horror with a typically Cronenbergian twist,"Scientist Seth Brundle has created a matter transporter to create a sort of teleporting system.  During tests he finds it turns his monkeys inside out and kills them, until he gets it to work.  He immediately tests it on himself and everything appears to work well.  However he soon finds himself going through a series of changes, much to the concern of his girlfriend Ronnie, that see him becoming fitter and stronger.  However it isn't long the changes become more concerning and it is clear that he is changing beyond his control and beyond recognition.Cronenberg is famous for his body horror and here is no exception.  The remake of The Fly loses a lot of his usual social comment etc but still leaves him open to do a great horror that has some intelligent touches.  The story is very much a horror  but Cronenberg has got rid of the concept of swapping a fly head for a human head and replaced it with the horror coming from within.  This allows him to feel more comfortable with his subject matter rather than it being silly.  The transformation gets more intense towards the end as his whole body begins to become a fly but the early parts allow tension to be built up.When the gore comes it is typical Cronenberg.  It isn't gore for comedy's sake it is quite shocking and very gory.  The real gore is kept for 2 or 3 key moments and is all the more shocking for the restrained nature of it's use up till then.  The end itself shows that it isn't just an out and out horror and that it does have a heart and a head to match it's strong stomach.Goldblum is good.  Unfortunately he has come to be type cast as the excitable, Jewish scientist with a distinct speaking manner (try Jurassic Park 1 & 2, Cats and Dogs etc).  However here it doesn't annoy too much. Davis is also very good and was going into a good run of hits (unlike now!) at the time.  She plays the horror of her situation very well.Overall The Fly is a very good remake.  It is a horror film that is actually chilling as well as gory  Cronenberg's fascination with body horror and the nature of ourselves is toned down but is still enough in evidence to add something.",,Anonymous,Horror
Gets better every time.,"The first time I came across it, I wasn't hugely impressed. I was young, hoping for a mindless creature-feature outing and it was my first taste of David Cronenberg. That being many moons ago. But upon each viewing since then, it has really grown on me. To the point of little details I missed, making it feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. It's simple, but really engages on an emotional level.This saw director David Cronenberg (the master of body horror) take the concept from the 1958 version of 'The Fly' (which starred one of horror icons Vincent Price) to put his own unique spin on the science-fiction/horror material. His perception was far from conventional, but still a real success. It was an ambitious, admirable and intelligent display.The straightforward love story beautifully compliments the demented and tragic events awaiting and only Cronenberg could think up something like this. The mental and physical transformation of Jeff Goldblum's scientist character Seth Bundle caused by a scientific project gone awry is expertly projected. Goldblum's confidently twitchy performance is outstanding even behind all that gross make-up FX. The growing affection towards Veronica (a stably strong Geena Davis) the journalist covering his groundbreaking work draws you in even more. There's plenty of convincing character developments that when the slow, but effective groundwork opens up. It's gut-wrenchingly tough and startling with its lyrical dramas and infused visual shocks.John Getz is good in support as Veronica's jealously smug boss/ex-boyfriend. The special effects are impressive and suitably grotesque with many sequences that remain unforgettable and stand-up to this day. Mark Irwin's photography is sharply executed within what's mostly centered on grungy, confined sets. He gives it a real intimate style, which helps keeps the focused on the two leads and the looming ordeals.Cronenberg's remake is pure visionary work that successfully splices a real sensitive side with plain unpleasantness.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Be afraid. Be very afraid...,"David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" has always been one of my favorite sci-fi horror movies ever since watching it as a young teenager. Why? Well, there are multiple reasons for this.Let's start out with the story. It has a very interesting and disturbing story that deals with different topics without losing focus on the core of the movie. It is a story that deals with scientific issues of teleportation, but it does so in a very believable manner. But it is also the story of an aloof scientist who invents something unique and his downfall into despair and hunger for knowledge and power.""The Fly"" also has good effects, taking into consideration that it is from 1986. Granted that compared with today's technology and possibilities, then it is outdated. But I do believe that the special effects team working on ""The Fly"" managed to create something that actually still holds its ground even today. The whole transformation from Seth Brundle to Brundlefly is just exceptional, and I mean that both in terms of the special effects and make-up applied to Jeff Goldblum, but also in the way that the character started to behave and the skills he acquired from the transformation.Then there are some outstanding performances to be witnessed in the movie. First and foremost, it is of course Jeff Goldblum who steals the screen with his enigmatic performance as Seth Brundle. I believe this was also the very first movie I saw him in. His mannerisms, behavior and that twitchy side to him is just right on the nail for this particular role.There is just something timeless about the story presented in ""The Fly"" and it is a movie that you can watch over and over. I don't know how many times exactly I have watched it by now, but it is around ten or so.""The Fly"" is definitely a well-worthy addition the to horror genre, and it is an outstanding movie that you should already be familiar with. If you by some strange reason haven't seen ""The Fly"" already, I can strongly recommend that you take the time to do so.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cronenberg's darker reimagining of the 1958 original is a worthy remake, but I personally still preferred the original","Whether you like this film or not, I think that Cronenberg deserves some acknowledgement for putting his own stamp on this remake. This isn't a rehash of the original. In fact many elements are different and ultimately how much you appreciate this film will depend on 2 things; 1) Whether you've seen the original film and 2) If you preferred the minor alterations that Cronenberg made to the original film. The problem for me is that many of the changes that Cronenberg made to this film weakened it as a whole in my opinion for the following reasons;In the original film, our scientist was a family man who had a loving wife and child. He was a likable guy, as was his wife and even the kid had a certain charm about him. The other thing that I really liked about the original is the way it was played out as a mystery film - it kept you hooked in and was engaging and interesting throughout its running time. When watching the original you were constantly left in a state of wonder.Then we come to Cronenberg's remake.....The big problem that I had with this film is that the whole film had a sleazy mean-spirited feel about it. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) was a sleazy guy who just didn't seem to care about anyone but himself - his misogynistic attitude towards women coupled with his psychotic behaviour didn't help either. It really made me indifferent to his character. I suppose part of his erratic behaviour could have been attributed to his accident, but to be honest I took a disliking to his character pretty much from the start. The relationship between Seth and journalist Veronica wasn't explored particularly well - in fact all I saw her as was a f*** buddy. The chemistry between the two wasn't great and to me the whole film felt heartless and cold.Another issue I had with this film is that Cronenberg seemed more interested in shocking and scaring his audience than in making us care for his characters or to be involved in his story. I also felt at times that Cronenberg went too far - did we really need to see a baboon get fried from the inside out? It's interesting that the film has the tagline 'Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid' but was it really that scary? You may get one or two cheap jump scares from the excessive gore on show, but this isn't what I'd categorise as scary - I much prefer psychological horror.One thing I did like about this remake is that it does make more of an attempt to explore the psychological aspect of Seth's condition, there are also one or two nice scenes between Seth and Veronica. As I mentioned above, Cronenberg deserves credit for making this film his own and I'll admit that it is reasonably good and I'll also admit that I was never bored when watching this film.Ultimately, this is all about taste; gore hounds will love this film and will lap up Cronenberg darker and much more disturbing remake. As for me, I enjoyed this film, but the suspense & mystery of the original will always make it a much more satisfying film in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ointment Machine...,"Seth Brundle has created a contraption, a transporter, transit, transfer interaction, in a pod you place something, it disappears and then doth spring, into another pod, completing the transaction. Alas enthusiasm can lead to bad decisions, as poor old Seth decides to go with his own frisson, makes the leap from A to B, his blinkered vision didn't see, the intruder that has joined in his revision. Now he's taking giant steps in evolution, acquiring habits that effect his constitution, morphing into a strange beast, he finds he doesn't need his teeth, although he's growing body parts and strange protrusions.Still a wonderful piece of filmmaking with two outstanding central performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost unwatchable in some of the detail,"I'm not particularly keen on Jeff Goldblum, I find him rather awkward and slightly embarrassing, although, as it happens, that works for him here. Geena Davis, here before she really hit the big time and seems somewhat uncertain, although again, this seems to be an advantage here. Everything is extremely well paced and logical as we move quickly towards the true horror that this story is. Almost unwatchable in some of the detail, this is much closer to Cronenberg's usual body fusing and fashioning obsessions than would have at first appeared. I am confident that this succeeds in just the way the director envisaged, presumably with limited budget, in restricted filming area, its just that it succeeds so well it really is rather difficult at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A product of its time.,"Compared to the original I have to go with the original on this one. In had more cohesion in terms of its story and acting as opposed to the better effects in this one. The movie just kind of starts in an odd way with no backstory, just a weird exchange of dialogue between two people who are just thrown at us. Its not so much a remake as it is its own retelling of the story. For me personally I did not enjoy it as much as the original. The effects however are fantastic, and any fan of eighties filmography or sci-fi in general will enjoy this one. But if you're looking for more in terms of acting and plot, you'll find that this one comes off as lackluster. The main reason to watch this film is for the last act and the special effects, although parts of it do not make much sense. It comes off as being somewhat rushed yet still entertaining. Since the effects are practical in this one they come off as more raw and enjoyable. Bottom line is, if you grew up seeing this movie first you might be blinded by nostalgia. Check the original again and see what you missed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average B rated movie from the 80s.,"I haven't seen the original, but this movie is interesting in a way.It's all about a scientist who invented a matter teleporter. Able to teleport matter from one place to another.The only problem is that it doesn't teleport living matter the way it should. After many tests, and failures, the invention finally succeeded, the scientist then tested it on himself, but didn't know that a fly accompanied with him on the way.And soon he'll start to mutate into a half man and half fly creature.This movie isn't too bad, just doesn't rank as a great Sci-Fi film. I don't mind seeing it again, just it's not a keeper for me. If the flow of the story and ending was improved then I'd consider it a classic.The good side is it has good special effects for it's time. I suggest renting it first for your own opinion on it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Horror Movie for Adults,"The Fly (1986)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Reporter Veronica Quaife (Genna Davis) goes back to the lab of scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) who claims to be working on something that will change human kind. Back at his lab she discovers that he's working on a transportation device so she begins to record his progress but when he tries it on himself the results are disastrous.It's funny how movies can strike you differently at different times of your life. I was only six when this came out and I first viewed it at some point on VHS when I was around ten or so and I really didn't care for it. Yes, I loved the gore but overall I just thought the film was boring. I tried it again as a teenager and felt the same. However, viewing it as an adult for the first time in well over a decade, I couldn't help but really see deep into its tragic story and come away with a completely different opinion.David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 classic takes its simple idea and turns it into a true tragedy mixed with romance, outlandish special effects and some graphic content that will certainly shake weaker viewers. Through in a pretty intelligent script and three great performances and you're left with a science-fiction film that manages to work on all levels. The most surprising thing is how smart the picture actually is when you look at what other types of films were out at this time.The screenplay manages to treat the science material with respect and it never dumbs down the material. The romance between the two lead characters work extremely well and especially when the scientist begins to go through his transformation. You really do care for both characters so you want to see him save while at the same time you can connect with the reporter's heartache of seeing him turn into the title character. Vincent Price, an actor in the 1958 film, said he enjoyed this version of the movie but felt Goldblum turned into a mutant more than a fly. That's perhaps true to a point but there's no question that these are some of the best special effects of the decade. The make- up work on Goldblum's body at the start is simply stunning and very much believable. Once his body starts to fall apart the effects just keep getting better and better. They're certainly stomach-turning at times but the work is exceptional.Finally, there are the performances by Goldblum and Davis. Both are extremely good but there's no question that Goldblum deserves so much credit for being able to pull off the various temper moods of the character. He certainly makes you believe that he's this genius scientist and once he begins to fall apart, well, you can believe that as well.THE FLY is certainly one of the better horror films of the decade. It's smart, scary, sad and best of all is that it's made for adults.",,Anonymous,Horror

great grotesque transformation,Oddball scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) meets Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) at a party. He tells her that he's working on something that will change the world. It's teleportation and it works. However it's only for inanimate objects. He is surprised to find out that she's a reporter and wants to keep it a secret. Her Particle magazine boss and possessive former boyfriend Stathis Borans (John Getz) doesn't believe her. Seth offers her exclusive access as long as she hold off for awhile. Seth gains insight while with Veronica and fixes the problem. Then he tries to teleport himself but a fly contaminates the telepod.David Cronenberg has created something special from a campy 50s B-movie. The creations are creepy and Cronenberg uses it to its most disturbing effect. Then there is Jeff Goldblum. His jitteriness is the perfect mannerism to being a fly. His disintegration is one of the greatest horror transformations of all times. Geena Davis is more than just a beauty. She shows enough bravery in her character that she is perfectly believable in her later scenes. It is a great horror movie.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a driven, relentless horror show with heart...","Long before the business of remaking old scare films became an industry unto itself, David Cronenberg (then-author of ""The Brood"" and ""Scanners,"" among other low-budget shockers) took a 1950s B movie and (literally) transformed it into a relevant and compelling horror film. Now, I'll admit that I have never been a big fan of ""The Fly,"" and always viewed it as one of Cronenberg's more underwhelming efforts--an FX spectacular starring then-lovers Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis--but upon recent inspection, was taken aback by its terror, romance, and tragedy. While most of his films are marked by a cold, detached tone, Cronenberg finds a classical despair within the characters of Seth Brundle (Goldblum), a fidgety scientist who invents a teleportation device, and Veronica (Davis), a reporter for a scientific journal who follows his progress. In a fit of jealousy one evening, Brundle--who has only recently met with success in teleporting a living ape--steps into the pod-like contraption, unaware that a housefly is trapped inside with him; afterward, he exhibits an abnormally stunning physical range, and undergoes a transformation that is truly horrific (Cronenberg, with the assistance of makeup artist Chris Walas, spares us no small detail). ""The Fly,"" like ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" shows us a monster who is reduced to a grotesque (and in the case of Brundle, inhuman) appearance, while still endowed with the bare instincts of love, morality, and fear; under increasingly heavy makeup, Goldblum retains his trademark sardonic wit, but it connects with a plaintive sorrow that is truly affecting. The chemistry he and Davis share is something truly rare in the horror genre, which gives ""The Fly"" its transcendent tone; Cronenberg offers a story with humanity, jelled with a metaphor of human decay, and brilliant special effects that assist in bringing this fantastic tale to life. Well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Metamorphosis...,"In Franz Kafka's classic THE METAMORPHOSIS, Gregor Samsa wakes one morning to find that he's turned into a man-sized insect. I've always thought that THE METAMORPHOSIS would make a great episode of a horror anthology (in something like TWILIGHT ZONE- THE MOVIE, OR as an episode of a teleseries). One of the more interesting aspects of adapting the story would be to SHOW Samsa's metamorphosis. (I tried something similar conceptually when I submitted a script entitled VAMPYRE to George Romero's TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE series: in an effort to go ""undercover"" and infiltrate a group of vampires terrorizing a city, I had the main character allow himself to be bitten by a vampire. The scenes immediately following depicted his transformation from a man to a vampire. I was told that the episode would be ""too expensive"" to do.) THE FLY (the remake, helmed by horror meister David Cronenberg) is the next best thing. Jeff Goldblum's absent-minded, muttering acting schtick is pitch-perfect for the character of Seth Brundle and we BUY him as the scientist. Geena Davis does well as the love interest (though I was never really a fan, she does a GREAT job here and is 100% believable in an underrated performance), but it's Goldblum's gradual metamorphosis into Brundlefly that makes THE FLY worth seeing. By far the best of the Cronenbug films. (Boxing fans, take note: durable Canadian heavyweight champion George Chuvalo plays an arm-wrestling barroom brawler.)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I've plenty of good buzz for this film.,"With The Fly, we have a film about experimentation; about updating; about taking science and experiments to a whole new level  a film about modernity and the transforming of the old into the new. But the manner of which these ideas and experiments are transpired relies quite heavily on an item of nature: a fly. The Fly by David Cronenberg is a film about the fusion and transport of different matter  ironic then how the film itself is a fusion of genres and is indeed a remake or 'updating' of an old film from the latter years of Hollywood's Classical era. Its themes and ideas of experimentation and one man's greed, in a way, to succeed over everyone else is an interesting point for study.The Fly does not hang around, opening at a large gala in which science recluse Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is out and about amongst many other people which is a rarity for the film and is perhaps a rarity for the character even before these events transpire. Seth is working on something big but he isn't ready to go public just yet as some of the more technical issues (such as seeing if it actually works) are not tried and tested, but they will be in all their cinematic glory.I think Cronenberg realises that the film is less so a piece of entertainment and more so a study of a decent into madness and depression through loneliness even though its individual is an actual fly for that period. But the film falls into the genres of horror and science-fiction; two genres that you would commonly associate with entertainment or escapism as film in these genres usually enter the realm of the uncanny or the fantastical. Not in The Fly and never does Cronenberg really come across as someone who wants to make a film about a guy who becomes a giant bug and cause damage, indeed his mindset and attitude is to stay at home and welcome the odd visit from female reporter who he met at the opening gala, Veronica Quaife (Davis).Then again just because the film does not go out and out to give you thrills and kicks, that's not to say it isn't entertaining anyway. The Fly is a fascinating little film but it never veers too far over into the pretentious or even further into the 'shock' realm. Yes, it's nasty and its special effects are pretty gruesome and the overall character mindset of Brundle once he becomes devoured by this fly's attributes and appearance are somewhat shocking but it is not a deliberate attempt to raise eyebrows in the sense The Evil Dead might've done with its high content of violence or Caligula with its high content of nudity.As a director shooting a piece, The Fly has several hallmarks of just genuinely good direction. The film can rack up the suspense; draw us into looking away from the screen even though there is nothing really there to be afraid of and yet every time Veronica pays a visit to Seth, we want her to make contact; talk for a short while and then leave whilst getting as far away as possible and that's because the film creates such an unnerving atmosphere as Seth descends more and more into his transformation. There is also the scene in which the transformation(s) are finally revealed, whatever they may be of, and the smoke that creeps out of the transporter ala mist over graveyards in horror films of old, thus delaying our seeing the results of the transformation and the tension is racked up.But Cronenberg isn't afraid of including the odd scene nearer the beginning to do with animal cruelty and nor is he afraid to have his lead character tear off his own flesh and pop his own fingernails. But these scenes exist not purely to gross the audience out but are included to inform the viewer of Seth's continuous decline into physical change. The smart thing here being that while Seth comes across as slightly eccentric and perhaps a bit of a loner in the opening scenes, his transformation from 'normal' to 'abnormal' is not necessarily a psychological one as a result of isolation and more so a physical one as a result of his own quest for personal glory to do with his work. It doesn't help that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time, either.But The Fly retains an atmosphere of horror throughout, aided by some nasty dream sequences in which Cronenberg himself gets to deliver a lava. The progression of Goldblum's physical change is the highlight here with any love interest or love triangle utilised to form the basis of the third act but there is no real problem with that here. The Fly will entertain and somewhat shock without ever truly feeling like that's what it set out to do in a guilty and unconstructive way initially. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy but it is one that takes down a sci-fi and horror infested route which isn't often the case in those respective genres.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you stay I will hurt you.,"Seth Brundle is a brilliant but eccentric scientist, working for the Bartok company he has invented something that will change mankind for ever. Upon meeting journalist Veronica Quaife at a party he takes her back to his home to show her his invention, Telepods that can transport objects thru space from one place to another. Tho reluctant to not tell this amazing story straight away, Veronica agrees to let Seth finish his work to finally achieve the ultimate success of sending a human being thru the Telepod system. Things are further complicated when Seth and Veronica start to fall in love, after Veronica is forced to go and see her ex boyfriend, Seth, drunk and jealous, decides to go thru the Telepods, unbeknown to him a fly also went thru with him and the computer, confused to find two matters in the system, spliced the gene codes together, the result is the terrifying birth of Brundlefly.Remaking an old and much loved horror classic was something that director David Cronenberg tackled with relish, sensing the opportunity to update it with 80s set paranoia's, he managed to not only splice many meanings in his picture, but also to create one of the best horror films of the modern age. Where do you start as regards The Fly's heart? In essence it's a tragic love story, a modern disease riddled Beauty and The Beast, but Cronenberg is not just content with that, he manages to play on mans fears of disease {an 80s AIDS metaphor is hard to get away from}, death and of course change in general.Cronenberg pictures have generally suffered for poor casting and tiny budgets, but here he gets full license to unleash the devilment and astuteness at work in his mind. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis put in excellent work as our two main protagonists, both putting in career best work in the process, a chemistry pretty much unrivalled in the horror genre post the Motion Picture Production Code demise in 1967. What is a major plus in The Fly's favour is that there is no camp veneer to the story unfolding, Brundle's metamorphosis is slow and adroitly paced, we follow each step as Brundle's body and state of mind changes, and of course we have to witness Veronica clinging on to the love she has for Seth, even as he monstrously evolves into Brundlefly.Drink deep, or taste not the plasma springSome sequences are truly vile, I remember vividly people leaving the cinema during one particularly gross moment, the horror elements in the piece do not disappoint the genre faithful. But really it's the intelligence and crafty nous that lifts The Fly high above many of its contemporaries. Many of Cronenberg's early supporters frown at The Fly for its big budget awareness and mainstream success. Stupid really because it's one of his most accomplished and professional pictures, dripping with goo and seeping with cranial splendour, right up to the final shattering climax that is as unforgettable as it is emotionally wrought.A candidate for greatest remake ever? Definitely. And come the end credits as your stomach starts to settle and the ache in your heart begins to wane, comes the realisation that Seth Brundle, without the intrusion of a common house fly, really could have changed the World as we know it! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So gross, yet so cool","Revered as one of David Cronenberg's best science fiction films, The Fly is about eccentric scientist Seth Brundle who is attempting to create successful teleportation technology. After lots of perfection to his aptly named telepods, Brundle decides to teleport himself from one pod to the other. During the process a fly gets into the telepod with him and his DNA is fused with it. He slowly begins to transform into a horrible human/fly hybrid which he names Brundlefly. The transformation is horrific and grotesque, but the movie is overall pretty cool.There isn't a whole lot going on with this film and there are only three main characters. The story is straightforward but still interesting to watch unfold. There are some side stories that seem kind of useless but they're never overbearing. Goldblum's transformation, physical and mental, is really neat to watch and the movie is definitely entertaining from start to finish. The majority of the sci fi films coming from the 70's and 80's were fairly simplistic but spawned a lot of science fiction themes for the future. The Fly definitely started out an interest in the grotesque human transformations we've seen in a lot of movies dealing with genetic manipulation, so in that respect The Fly is unforgettable. And it's not to say that there isn't enough going on in The Fly, because anymore and it would have been bloated and a lot of the focus of the film, which is solely on Brundle's transformation and how it is affecting the limited cast around him, would have been scattered. As far as storyline goes there isn't much I can complain about.However, from a character standpoint I did have a couple issues with The Fly. Like I said before, the movie only has three characters. The rest of the cast, which is literally seven other people, are characters with no names or one or two speaking lines. Goldblum, Davis, and Getz aren't bad by any means, but I didn't feel like any of them had the force necessary to drive the film. They all seemed too weak and it made me feel like the film was lacking a dominant character. The film looks and feels very Hollywood, but it lacks the A-list stars to flesh out that feeling. The three leads I felt like belonged in supporting roles, when they were all three important leads. But after some getting use to, they carried the film to the end well enough.Of course the film wouldn't have kept my interest nearly as well if not for the great makeup job done on Jeff Goldblum as he turned into the gruesome Brundlefly. His transformation is a disgustingly awesome feat in sci-fi creature design. It's probably the aspect of the film with the highest quality, which is fitting for a movie that is all about that particular aspect, even in its title. A warning to anyone with a weak stomach though, Brundlefly is one of the most grotesque and disgusting things I have ever seen in a movie. He is so horribly deformed and disgusting that I get a little queasy thinking about the final horrific scenes of the film. Everything this creature does is eyeopening disgusting and if I didn't find these kinds of grotesque effects awesome I would have probably hated this movie for being ridiculously gross and vomit inducing. But amidst all my twitching and wincing at how gross this film was, I really enjoyed it for taking such a disgusting risk.The Fly is a lot of fun overall. It's got some kinks, but I can forgive them for the last thirty minutes of the film which are disgusting and yet jaw droppingly awesome. This movie is a worthwhile watch, especially if you're into some classic sci-fi.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Remake is, if nothing else, a technical marvel...","Director David Cronenberg's remake of the so-so Vincent Price fright-flick from 1958 is a technical marvel, though the characters are ultimately frittered away in favor of shocks. Nerdy, dateless scientist Jeff Goldblum (excellent) brings home a pretty journalist from a scientific convention and shows her his teleportation pods...this could be the start of something big! He has managed to break down the molecular structure of inanimate objects and transfer them from one pod to another. Unfortunately, he's having trouble transferring live matter (a monkey quickly goes splat in the film's most horrific sequence). We never learn how Goldblum manages to figure out the problem and fix it, but soon he's climbing into the machine himself--along with a stowaway fly. Cronenberg, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Edward Pogue from George Langelaan's magazine story, seems an ideal fit for this squeamish material, and yet the film never quite takes off (it's too simple-minded--and too easily wrapped up--to be worthwhile to anything but indiscriminating fans of the horror genre). Goldblum's transformation is well done, and Cronenberg admirably takes his time building the foundation which will lead us to the showdown, but that's all the film is: a build-up. There's no rush of exhilaration in the denouement because the picture is all technique--it's mechanical--while the love story between Goldblum and Geena Davis is half-hearted (as if Cronenberg didn't believe in it) . A huge financial success, it led to a sequel in 1989 with a new cast and director. Chris Walas & Stephan Dupuis deservedly won Academy Awards for their makeup. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Practical,"""Practical"" is the term movie makers use to denote effects done in real life instead of added in by CGI or animation or some such device.A practical movie is a sort of handmade movie, a sort of sushi of film. Today, hardly any movie that depends on extra-reality is practical. That's good in a way; we get ever increasing imaginative experiences, at least in the better stuff. But as the technology grows, there is a growing appreciation I think of the masters who did stuff with actors and cameras.Its a sort of embodiment, a reality, a commitment that you can feel. It matters to me more that Jeff Goldblum put on all that goo and plastic than Bill Nighy had Davy Jones' tentacles superimposed on his face while he was on vacation. There's a direct connection that comes from this, one that prompts us to allow more in what we accept as real. This is real, and bless Geena Davis for being our surrogate observer, camera and all. Its her horror that is essential to this, and the very real horror of imagining her child. And knowing that the two were lovers in real life.The story is about embodiment, as it happens. Cronenberg in his intelligent period, where ghastly shapes were derived from organic forms. Contrast this with the insect-derived monster in ""Aliens"" of the same year. That insect is unlike Ridley Scott's. Its all angles and plates and jutting sharp things. This is modeled, organic, moist.Oh, the story. Transformation again, a method of folding a character into another. A standby, but bodily change is novel. This version of the story is massively different than the last one. In that case, it was a matter of an alien consciousness creeping into a human and eclipsing it. Here it is a matter of human consciousness surviving the horror of transformation.

The Fly starts off in a science convention centre where brilliant scientists gather. Journalist Veronica is tasked with creating a scoop about the most interesting story she can find. She meets scientist Seth Brundle and asks about the project he's been working on. Seth takes her to his appartment and reveals he has been working on a teleportation device. The device is still a prototype and has difficulty with transporting meat or living beings.After some refinement Seth decides to try the machine out himself. While intoxicated, he decides to hop in the machine in order to see if the refined machine can transport humans. However, a fly manages to get into the teleporter alongside Seth. Seeing as the machine was unrefined, it gene spliced Seth's DNA with that of a fly. Seth ends up turning into a gross human/fly hybrid being. How that resolves, you have to see for yourself.One thing i admire about this film is it's pacing. I'm used to horror films being 2.5 hours long and the fact that this film is only 1.5 ours is realy refreshing. It cuts out all the longwinded and boring parts and makes you feel involved every step of the way.The make up and practical effects are extremely well done. It looks absolutely disgusting and i love it. The hairs, the swollen faces, the spit, the gore, everything looked great even by today's standards. I can't even begin to describe how glad i am that they didn't use CGI.The acting is great, there wasn't a single moment or line that felt out of place or unnatural and i was throughly entertained all the way through. It wasn't very scary but it was entertaining and disturbing and i loved it. A definate reccomendation for any fan of horror films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
After A Slow Start This Becomes A Very Good Remake,"I wasn't especially taken with this after the first half hour or so. There seemed to be a vaguely comic element involved that wasn't fitting - revolving mostly around the character of scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum.) For those first few minutes the character wasn't working for me. And then, somehow, it came together. Goldblum turned out to be very good and very convincing in the lead role as the scientist who accidentally ""teleports"" himself along with a housefly, and finds their genes ""spliced"" - after which he begins to slowly mutate into a human- fly hybrid.This, of course, is based on the 1958 movie of the same name - a movie that I wasn't especially blown away by so I went into this wondering why a remake was called for. But this is one of those rare remakes that are substantially better than the original. I particularly liked the hybrid idea. In the original movie we got a rather silly concept of a human with a fly's head and a fly with a human's head. Splicing them together as one creature was a good move, and created an increasing ""creepiness"" as Brundle gradually transforms. Genna Davis was pretty good as Veronica, the reporter who wants Brundle's story and then falls in love with him, but it really was Goldblum who made this work.David Cronenberg directed. I've not been an especially big fan of Cronenberg's style over the years - and at times this is very much an Cronenberg-style movie - but I would say that of the Cronenberg movies I've seen, this may well be the strongest. It's a good, suspenseful and at times truly creepy movie. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Legendary with reason,"I've not yet read the short story on which both are based, but the majority of people seem to find this a better film than the 1958 version with Vincent Price in the role of the ""interloper"". I really like Cronenberg as a filmmaker (most of the time) and I certainly see how his version of the story was more challenging from a technical standpoint, but I don't necessarily agree that it's a better film all the same. The original had a quiet, sad psychological feel and told its story in an extremely economical way. It's what I'd call a very ""tight"" film and I really enjoyed Price as a nicer fellow and friend trying to figure out, along with the scientist's wife, what the hell was going on. Still, Cronenberg's adaptation is very good and I enjoyed the different emphasis; the way he took notions from the original tale and really made it his own, with the usual Cronenberg emphasis on very bad things happening to the human body.This movie is much more a study of Seth Brundle's character, too. We spend over half the film getting to know him and what he is up to, before his unfortunate accident with a pest and a teleportation machine. He's ably played by jeff Goldblum, whose physicality is very impressive in this demanding role, though I found the actor a little prone to mumbling his dialogue at times. Still, he is supposed to be a socially awkward fellow, so I guess it fits well.The relationship with Gina Davis's reporter character is very effective, and I liked her strong character from teh outset. Unfortunately she does somewhat degenerate and fall to pieces as the story progresses, but I can't really blame her. In contrast to Vincent Price's ""nice guy"" portrayal in the 1958 film, the ""interloper"", or I should say, the third part of the triangle, Veronica's newspaper editor, is a loathsome and despicable person who seems to finally do the right things despite himself. My girlfriend and I spent most of the film wishing he would get killed, and I'm sure Cronenberg made him so sleazy and nasty on purpose. It was frustrating and heartbreaking that Veronica kept returning to him and letting him back into her life, but again, I can't really blame her. In a way, too, it illustrates that even in the ""enlightened"" time this movie was made, a woman's value in work and life was often extremely underappreciated and a lot of very bad sexual politics sometimes took place. This still happens today, but I'm not sure a guy like Stathis would be able to get away with acting like this toward his female colleagues on any major newspaper, even if he were the editor.Anyway, you can see right off why Veronica and Seth value each others' company. He treats her well and is kind and passionate toward her, while she gives him a sympathetic ear and not only has a passion for his body but also the work he is doing, which sets her afire with dreams of fame and glory. Admittedly it's not nice to see her going back to Stathis and basically insisting that she's using Seth, but in Seth's company we see a rather different side to her. Her horror and revolusion by the end of the movie is really sad to see. Unfortunately it also leads to the one moment in this movie that I thought was ridiculous: the aborted um, abortion scene, with the rather transformed Seth bursting through the window and abducting Veronica. Now who in hell has a window like that in an operating room anyway? I'm not squeamish as such, but the entire abortion scene seemed a bit superfluous and maybe just an excuse for Cronenberg to play out some of his gynecological horror fetish, which of course reached its apex in Deadringers (released a couple of years later). I think the dream sequence was sufficient and horrible enough as it was, and anyway, you could argue that the ""aborted abortion"" scene became the excuse to release this movie's non-Cronenberg-directed bad copycat sequel.Make no mistake though, this film is considered an 80s classic for a reason. I may not rate it as highly as some and I certainly don't think it's as good as some of Cronberg's other, weirder films, but it's still better than some of what he's done lately (the ""mature"" A History of Violence being possibly his worst film to date) and it's still quite an experience. The horror of the situation really creeps up on you and the first half of the movie includes a lot of sweet scenes that almost lull the viewer into a false sense of security. There's a nice little tribute to the 1958 film near the end and the whole thing becomes gross and revolting in that 70s/80s Cronenberg way you'll either love or hate depending on your personality. I dig it quite a bit; it's one of his very personal touches you can almost always count upon. My only other criticism is that I find the music to be a little dull and too bombastic/mainstream Hollywood, although there were some nice ""sad"" motifs. I think a sparser, perhaps more electronic-infused score would have suited this thing well. But it's ok! Good film and a must for 80s body horror fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Sci-fi film of all time,"I normally don't go in for these type of movies, but Goldblum's work here is exquisite. I mean, yes, he is bug-eyed to begin with, but his transformation into the fly (in all manners) is incredible. Cronenburg is obviously a master of the sci fi horror blend, but his skills are never more on point than here. Plus, the spoecial effects in this film, especially for the EIGHTIES are mind-blowing.

"""Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring!  See what I'm saying?""","Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is working on creating a machine that can teleport objects from one place to another. He shares his work with reporter Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) and the two quickly enter into a relationship, both romantic and professional. Veronica intends to write about Seth's invention once it's complete. One night Seth tests the teleporter out on himself, with seemingly fine results at first. But, as things start happening to his body, Seth discovers a fly was also in the teleporter when he tested it out which has resulted in him slowly turning into a human/fly hybrid.I'm not the biggest David Cronenberg fan but I do enjoy many of his films, none more so than this excellent remake of the 1950s classic The Fly. It's not as charming or colorful as the original due to the different eras in which they were made. It's certainly a whole lot grosser (understatement of the century). But it's also smart, creative, and fun in its way. It's one of the best sci-fi or horror movies of the '80s. Jeff Goldblum gives a wonderfully energetic performance. I've read some other reviewers refer to this movie as depressing. I suppose from a story perspective you might argue that but I can't see how anyone could be depressed with Goldblum's liveliness. Even as he begins morphing into ""Brundlefly,"" he's still full of energy and a commanding presence that keeps you glued to the screen. Too many times actors inhibited by makeup or prosthetics seem to give up, letting the effects do all the work while they just read lines. But not Goldblum here. Gotta respect that. Other than Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, this is my favorite role of Goldblum's. Geena Davis does an admirable job with a less inspired part. She is attractive and has a great chemistry with Goldblum (the two married the following year). The romance in the film is a little rushed but that's fairly common with movies where the romance is only a secondary plot point. Geena does manage to pull off the ""Be afraid. Be very afraid."" line with a straight face, which is more than many could do.Chris Walas' makeup effects deservedly won an Oscar. As I said before, the movie is gross in places. More gross than perhaps it needs to be. But the effects are exceptional throughout. Whatever gross thing Cronenberg wanted, the effects team knocked it out of the park. Howard Shore's wonderful score also deserves some praise. And, of course, Cronenberg's superb direction. It's an intense and intelligent take on the old 'mad scientist' films that used to define a large part of horror and science fiction. In the later part of the twentieth century, you didn't see a lot of those movies. Certainly not as many thirty or forty years before. This is one of the best remakes of a classic film I've ever seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Be afraid. Be very afraid.,"The Fly (1986) is the remake to the 1958 original of the same name directed by the great David Cronenberg and it is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.Positives for The Fly (1986):
For me, this movie is the embodiment of the term body horror and it is absolutely glorious. The practical and makeup effects from Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis are some of the most disgusting creature effects I've ever seen in a movie and it's easily to see why these guys won the Oscar for Best Makeup. There are moments where I wanted to physically vomit because it is so gross and yet I still wanted to see these effects. Jeff Goldblum gives possibly his best performance as Seth Brundle and he should've been nominated for Best Actor and I can also say the same for Geena Davis as Veronica Quaife. As the movie progresses, you see Jeff Goldblum slowly start to lose his mind and humanity with every passing minute and it's just so tragic to see that happen to someone who just wanted to do something to help others. Aside from just being a fantastic horror movie, this is also a fantastic romance movie because you can tell that Goldblum and Davis do care about each other and are willing to do anything to help each other. And finally, the ending to this movie is one of the saddest and most tragic endings I've seen in a movie and it had me at the verge of tears.Overall, The Fly (1986) is a phenomenal display of what practical and makeup effects can do for a movie. This is my favorite David Cronenberg movie as well as one of my favorite horror movies in the history of cinema and I highly recommend that everyone watch this movie as soon as possible because this is one of those movies that everyone needs to experience at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Weak and cheap,"The Fly starts off pretty slowly, the time to set the base of the plot: obviously, something is going to happen with this machine but the twist doesn't seem to show up.Once the movie reaches its pivotal point, the script struggles and doesn't exploit correctly the plot which, on paper, is interesting though. There is not much going on, the stakes are lacking and the story unfolds too linearly to captivate the viewer's attention. The movie even takes, in its last part, a frankly ridiculous and dispensable creepy turn.In fact, The Fly resembles more a B movie or a bad TV movie, and this feeling is emphasized by the very cheap and blanc cinematography, the insipid dialogues and the far-from-transcendent performances of the cast.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I'd like to be the first insect politician.""","A perfect Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, an eccentric young scientist working on teleportation experiments. Eventually, he is able to successfully teleport himself - but, without his knowledge, a housefly gets trapped inside the telepod with him, and Seths' confused computer decides to fuse the two life forms into one.Now, Seths' would-be girlfriend, journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis, the real-life Mrs. Goldblum at the time) has to watch in despair and horror as Seth slowly transforms into a humanoid fly creature, all of Seths' humanity and reason slowly disappearing along with his human form.David Cronenbergs' remake of the fondly remembered sci-fi / horror flick from the 1950s does take full advantage of the advances in special makeup effects, and the effects *are* amazing; Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis would ultimately win the Oscar for best makeup, as they make Seth pass through various stages of mutation.But there's FAR more to this excellent chiller than just gore, monster mayhem, and gross-outs. Intended by co-writer Cronenberg to be a metaphor for the ageing process, it has us witness a touching, budding romance go completely awry as one of the two people comes down with the ravages of a ""disease"" of sorts. Goldblum and Davis are so wonderful in the two main roles; as a result, it's impossible to distance oneself from the horrors on screen, and take great pity on this couple. But, rounding out the main acting trio is John Getz, as Veronicas' editor / ex-boyfriend; he's great as a character who has his smarmy, jerky side, but is not completely unsympathetic; one can see that he genuinely loves Veronica still. In supporting roles, there are Joy Boushel (""Humongous"") as a sexy barfly, Canadian boxing legend George Chuvalo as the guy who makes a bad mistake in attempting to arm-wrestle with Seth, and ""Videodrome"" villain Leslie Carlson as Dr. Cheevers. Cronenberg himself has a cameo as a gynecologist.Enhanced by a typically grandiose, scary music score by Howard Shore, and solid contributions by such standard Cronenberg collaborators as production designer Carol Spier and cinematographer Mark Irwin, ""The Fly"" is an intelligent reinterpretation of the George Langelaan story, containing some vintage Cronenberg dialogue that Goldblum delivers with gusto.Watching this is a powerful and ultimately sad experience; in fact, I would say it's more powerful than the 1958 film (although that version does have its pluses). It's highly recommended for any fan of ""body horror"", which of course Cronenberg excelled at for many years.By the way.... I *enjoyed* how disgusting this was, to be honest. I laughed with appreciation at each new gross bit of business. However, I do understand that this approach *isn't* for everybody.Followed by a sequel three years later.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The inside man,"It had been a long haul bringing external horror back home, since the 60's at least. But relatively close together in the 80's came two films, both remakes of older films, that made it easier to see how the outside menace, horror that beckoned from beyond, was transferred back inside and was ruled that it was no longer conclusively alien with our point-of-view. In fact, it was our point-of-view in the world of these films that was made to be alien. The human being was invaded by or, as here, melded with the monster.The Thing was relatively clean-cut, like most of Carpenter's stuff. But Cronenberg goes further; he knows what propels the grisly transformations that we experience on the visible level, and is more interested in exploring the act of the transformation itself.I am not talking about SFX here, which is pretty good to this day. Both these films I personally feel are vastly hampered by this desire to make overly visible, to please the curious eye. We are no longer teased out with shadows and outlines, but get to see every ungodly detail. It's a painful process we undergo, the birth of new life. But gooey and prosthetic nonetheless, and distracting from the actual transformation that is happening inside.But with Cronenberg the warts really work in his favor; the gooey and prosthetic help vividly describe a prosthetic worldview. It's a very specific, original cinematic world, fertile with ecstasies of the flesh. The fashions, the technology, especially the technology so crucial in his films, always make me feel like they describe an 80's future that waits just around the corner.So, sex as what makes the flesh crazy - and being crazy, curious, excited about the flesh as an essential prerequisite of being human. Love as what transports between worlds, the movement itself a transformation. But love tainted by even the tiniest flying speck of doubt, even unbeknownst to the conscious mind, produces a monster of a human being on the other end.Cronenberg would return to this in Videodrome, there more eloquently: on one hand the burning desire to transcend the body, the old flesh that keeps the spirit caged, on the other hand the impossibility of that transcendence as long as the mind remains impure.So this is why the attempted transformation is always ugly in Cronenberg, revolting, and why it's always left incomplete; the tainted mind - with ignorance, desire, ego, fear - transforms in its image. In the most unexpected way the monster is our in-sight of the mind. This alone makes Cronenberg a stop we can't miss in our cinematic sojourns.Brundlefly is not the new flesh then, is not new life. He is the mind-corrupted old flesh regurgitating itself. New life, the old world renewed, is only possible through the pregnant woman, this is the way forward. However corrupted Brundle may be by the end, and this is the part of the film where Cron riffs in and out of the classic Beauty and the Beast story, inside of him remains the man he was. The ending is painful, emotional, perhaps too earnest. The hubris is paid back, but we feel sorry because we know Prometheus meant well.Emotionally heavy, this is the part I don't care much for, but otherwise intellectually light Cronenberg. On the upside, compact, agile stuff about a man yearning to transport himself where life has purpose again, us getting to see from behind a camera, the woman's, the transformation of that man into what he thinks would make him loved. Of course we loved him just the way he was.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Despite some uncomfortable viewing, there is a great deal to enjoy for connoisseurs who prefer their horror-steak done rare.","David Cronenberg's most commercially successful movie, had its screenplay co-written by Charles Edward Pogue, who came with established writing credits for 1983's made-for-tv, Hound of the Baskervilles. Set in a dusty dis-used industrial warehouse complex, it might equally have been at home in the ruins of some suburban gothic mansion. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong current of gothic-tone to this movie, with its alienated but genius scientist, nurturing a lonely obsession to the point of madness and beyond. Jeffrey Goldblum's presence and left-field humour is a perfect fit for the manic scientist, and the plot maintains reasonable credibility throughout, despite what may have been David Cronenberg's leanings to take things closer to the bone and beyond. A fairly straightforward plot slyly sets the table for a more complete devastation, as the fuller impact of transpiring events unfold. This 'turning' is key to the movie's impact because we are quietly and inexorably drawn into a nightmare of horrors which is exactly what David Cronenberg may have intended. Though a somewhat neglected diamond-in-the-rough, this movie may have been quietly influential. Observe the parallels between Jeff Goldblum's transformed scientist, and Heath Ledger's (Dark Knight) Joker; both struggling grotesquely with their disappearing humanity through what remains of their twisted human forms. Despite some uncomfortable viewing, there is a great deal to enjoy for connoisseurs who prefer their horror-steak done rare.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Get into it,"Not just into the machine that is of course, but delve into the story. There is not much introduction, we get thrown into it right from the start. Not that much explanation at first, but Goldblums character and Geena Davis character meet and everything kind of happens quite fast from that point on. You could call the characters gullible giving away not just data but almost everything and having these machines in an appartment. There are a lot of things you could I guess critisize.But that would undermine your fun and entertainment you could have with this. Though fun and entertainment only works if you are not too squeamish. Because the effects (have aged very well) are quite gross to say the least. Cronenberg knows his stuff when it comes to crazy bodyforming or whatever you want to call it.

Fly Me To The Moon,"I've only seen bits and pieces of this as a kid so decided to give it a full watch now and I must say outside of the more gross aspects of the film like showing how a fly eats, this was pretty good. Jeff Goldblum is a great choice for the quirky, eccentric scientist type and I can tell why they later picked him for his role in Jurassic Park after seeing how he fared in The Fly here. He was unsure yet enigmatic at first. Then, once he underwent his transformation he became headstrong and a bit on the daft side leading up to the finale which saw him as a bit more refined and humbled by what happened to him as he slowly begins to embrace his destiny while at the same time trying one last measure to regain his once lost humanity. Across from him is the always welcome Geena Davis as his love interest. She does a great job showcasing the more humane side of the picture, trying to make sense of what happened while showing compassion with a little bit of restraint towards Goldblum's character at the same time as the metamorphosis transpires. The Fly is an interesting film that explores a couple of different scientific theologies in both the means of creating a successful teleportation device and the accidental creation of a gene splicing machine at the same time and tries to stick the landing more so with the more intriguing of the two in the gene splicing. The makeup artist too I must give credit too for creating such amazing practical effects in the costume department that puts today's CGI to much shame. I also wonder if the makeup artist from The Substance film got their inspiration from The Fly's body horror motif because to me the style of makeup is somewhat similar in comparison albeit about completely different things. Cronenberg was definitely a Picasso of his time when it came to body horror makeup imagery. Overall, Thr Fly is a solid supernatural horror flick and a cult classic that stands the test of time in delivering an interesting experience in just over 90 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Sure Isn't Your Grandfather's Fly,"David Cronenberg makes a somewhat faithful, yet completely stirring remake of the ultimate insect movie - The Fly. I really enjoyed this movie because of its suspenseful storytelling, ability to make you care about the characters, wonderful if not over-the-top special effects, and Cronenberg's obvious touches dealing with nature and man's interference with it. Jeff Goldblum does a very workmanlike job playing a scientist trying to work out the bugs(OK, an obvious pun) with his work in teleportation - very much like the protagonist in the original Fly. Apart from the work and the mix up with the fly when sending himself, there are very few comparisons between this film and the original. I like both versions as entities unto themselves and do not think that any grand comparison between the two is necessary or even warranted because of the completely different natures of the plot. Goldblum, having won the affections of Amazon beauty intensified in Geena Davis, sends himself when inebriated. He soon starts to exhibit characteristics that ultimately make him discover he has fly DNA mixed with his own. He starts to have fibrous hairs grow from his back, an insatiable appetite for sweets, and soon can climb walls. Davis watches by as her lover slowly decays. At the heart of all this terrible affair dealing with Goldblum transforming into a human fly is a love story between Goldblum and Davis. It is touchingly done considering its backdrop and Cronenberg behind the camera. Don't expect the fly to look anything like the classic fly of the fifties - this one is completely different. David Cronenberg once again shows us why he is one of the best in the genre. He wrote this creative script and directs with style that is undeniably David Cronenberg. Certainly this is one of the greatest horror remakes of all time and one of the best horror films of that otherwise barren decade - the 1980s.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Little Slice of Heaven for Dessert,"Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) has figured out how to transport objects from one place to another... by teleportation. But when he tries to transport himself, a horrible accident occurs: a fly gets stuck in the pod with him. What will the outcome be and can Seth reverse it before it is too late?Let me say I love David Cronenberg and I love Jeff Goldblum. I also love the original ""Fly"" with Vincent Price (although the similarities are only with the most basic plot). And let me also say, I had the greatest day of my life before I came home and put this movie on for viewing. So, all in all, I was feeling in a pretty fine mood. (And sober.)Cronenberg delivers with his three notable themes: insects (duh), ""the flesh"" (Goldblum delivers a nice rant about the flesh) and horrifying special effects. Like ""The Brood"" or ""Rabid"" or even ""A History of Violence"", we see some interesting deformities. A baboon who meets an awful fate stands out in my mind. We also have the music of Howard Shore, always attached to Cronenberg's hip.The special effects are noteworthy (also for the interesting ""fly walking"" and the ""vomit drop""), but let's not discount the acting. Almost through the entire film, we are treated to Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum and basically no one else. I am still not sure why Davis married Goldblum, but their chemistry in this is excellent. They work well as a romantic couple. Davis is the steady anchor to Goldblum's flux of a character (heck, he's literally going through a Kafkaesque metamorphosis).If you like a ranting Goldblum, this is your film. He won't watch you poop, but he will ramble in ways Ian Malcolm (""Jurassic Park"") never could. In one scene in a diner, you really have to pay attention because he's like the Micro Machines guy, but explaining exoskeletal biology and not so much miniaturized automobiles. This was my favorite scene.If you're a fan of Goldblum or Cronenberg, you're going to love this. But if you're not, this might be the film that converts you. Whereas ""A History of Violence"" is very mainstream and ""Videodrome"" is just weird, this has a happy balance: weird, but not so strange that you have to be a film student or a wackjob to really appreciate it.

"Accomplished music video hacks, foreign movie directors with one success under their belt, and Michael Bay—please take note: THIS is how to do a horror remake!","The Fog, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Omen: just a few of the classic horror titles that have recently suffered the indignity of an extremely inferior remake by greedy studios keen to make an easy buck. With box office receipts the only consideration, the makers of these lazy cash-cows make no attempt at improving upon the originals, aware that indiscriminate teens will flock to see their films, regardless of quality.Back in the 80s, however, things were a little different: easy money came in the form of sequels, which were churned out in rapid succession, but remakes were rare and a surprising amount of care went into their production. Chuck Russell's 1988 version of The Blob was a hugely entertaining romp from a director who clearly loved the genre; John Carpenter's The Thing oozed with atmosphere and pushed make-up FX to a new level; but it was David Cronenberg's re-imagining of The Fly which really proved that a skilled director blessed with a unique vision could turn a remake into a masterpiece.Cronenberg keeps the basic plot from the Vincent Price classic—a scientist experimenting with teleportation becomes horribly disfigured after his body is accidentally merged with that of a housefly—but discards the silly notion of a man sporting a massive fly head and arm. Instead, the director once again indulges his obsession with 'the flesh', and has his protagonist suffer a much more gradual fate: in the days following his seemingly successful experiment, genius Seth Brundle (a wonderfully eccentric Jeff Goldblum) gradually transforms into a monstrous creature as his body struggles to fuse his own DNA with that of the fly.In addition to losing his looks, bits of his body, his ability to digest, and eventually his mind, Brundle also has to cope with the possibility of losing girlfriend Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who is pregnant with his child. When madness finally takes control of Seth, and his transformation into 'Brundlefly' is almost complete, the scientist abducts Veronica as she attempts to abort her pregnancy, takes her home to his lab, and pushes her into one of his teleportation pods, his intention being to merge himself with Veronica and their unborn child, thus creating the ultimate family.A superb central performance from Goldblum, whose quirky, individualistic acting style is perfect for such an unusual role, is perfectly complemented by the equally unique Davis, and solid support is given from John Getz as Veronica's loathsome ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans. The film also benefits immensely from stunning creature and gore effects courtesy of make-up artist Chris Walas (who created the memorable creatures from Gremlins); these ensure that The Fly is as nauseating as it is heart-breakingly tragic. Amongst the revolting sights on offer are a very painful looking broken arm inflicted by Seth during a show of strength in a bar, a quivering inside-out baboon (one of Seth's earlier mistakes), and the Brundlefly vomiting corrosive liquid onto Stathis' hand and foot.If I was going to nitpick, I might argue that baboons seem like an unnecessarily dangerous test animal for Brundle to work with (but then again, maybe they had a special on baboons at the pet store) and the scientist's uncanny ability to program a computer to recognise the poetry of flesh (as he puts it) comes a little too easy, but these are minor niggles and do very little to spoil the film as a whole.With Hollywood currently showing no sign of slowing down the remake production line, perhaps those responsible should take a look at The Fly to remind themselves how the job should be done properly.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In ""The Fly"" veteran Canadian director David Cronenberg depicted why all sciences are not good sciences.","The great Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus stated that change is the only constant in life. One must watch ""The Fly"" bearing this fundamental quote in mind as a lot has changed in our world especially in the way horror films are continuing to influence public opinion in last few years. The reason why ""The Fly"" continues to hold sway is that it was one of the initial films to suggest that all sciences are not good and some sciences can even have bad effects on human societies. What makes ""The Fly"" revolutionary as well as groundbreaking is its inclusion of ideas and innovations on which people are working in 21st century. As examples, one can mention the sensitive issues of abortion and human cloning. It is interesting to watch how Canadian director David Cronenberg arrives at a balanced approach to drama as well as horror. He gets good support from actress Geena Davis who appears quite convincing as a confident yet fragile woman torn between two men. In 1986, when this film was released, nobody was willing to trust the idea of human teleportation as most people were much too scared to even imagine the concept of sitting in a box to come out of another box. Hence, in 2014, nobody would doubt that watching 'The Fly' nearly three decades after its initial release would turn out to be an extremely strange experience for loyal David Cronenberg admirers as well as for viewers who possess little knowledge about his visionary films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Fly - The Day Man Lost His Wings,"In The Fly, Cronenberg throws you straight into the depths of mutation without a filter. This isn't light sci-fi like Star Trek; this is serious stuff. A brilliant biologist, Seth Brundle, decides to use himself as the test subject for his teleportation experiment. And then everything goes haywire, because a fly sneaks into his pod and fuses with him. It's a volatile cocktail for a descent into madness!Jeff Goldblum, that guy we know for playing quirky professors, transforms into something downright terrifying. You're not ready for his performance: he embodies a man who shifts from an ordinary guy to an insect-like organic machine. The transformation, executed with meticulous precision, makes you experience each step of his metamorphosis with horrifying realism.The Oscar for Best Makeup didn't land here by accident. This is pure genius. The makeup and special effects work is so detailed that you can practically feel the physical transformation happening before your eyes. The mutation process isn't just a few bumps and rashes; it's a progression through grotesque stages, from decaying flesh to an increasingly fused insectoid form. Seen The Thing? The Fly takes the visual nightmare even further.Geena Davis steps into the role of Brundle's girlfriend, and her performance is truly impressive. She doesn't just act; she lives the role. You feel everything: the despair, the panic, the unconditional love. She becomes the human anchor in this degenerate world. Honestly, without her, The Fly would lose a lot of its emotional intensity.David Cronenberg isn't just a director; he's a surgeon of horror. In a cameo, he plays a gynecologist... the scene is unforgettable, leaving you with a well-crafted sense of unease. His signature clinical and meticulous style is what brings so much charm to this horror sci-fi masterpiece. The camera is placed exactly where it needs to be, heightening the sickening tension with surgical precision.The Fly is an experience that sticks with you. Once you've seen it, it's impossible to forget. This film marks you, haunts you, disgusts you, but draws you in. With Jeff Goldblum's insane transformation, the nightmarish visual atmosphere, and the emotional depth, The Fly is essential viewing for horror and sci-fi fans. Absolute masterpiece or visual torment? You decide!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Terrific Goldblum and effects, bad script","Creepy film from David Cronenberg, who has made a specialty of creepy films (Dead Ringers, Scanners, Existenz).  Jeff Goldblum stars as Seth Brundle, a scientist who is mastering teleportation, but who accidentally crosses his genetic code with a housefly's, creating a terrifying hybrid.   Geena Davis plays a reporter who is slowly falling for Goldblum, her subject.This is Goldblum's best performance of his career.  An actor who often seems laid-back, Goldblum here is anything but.  His intensity shows as a man who undergoes a terrifying transformation into a disgusting creature.  His anger and frustration cross with his scientific visions, and he thus creates a very sympathetic character.  Additionally, the makeup artists created truly amazing effects and deserve every ounce of the Oscar that they won.That being said, it is unfortunate that the script is obvious and by-the-numbers.  You can see the resolution coming a mile away.  It feels like most of the energy in this film went into the effects and technology, instead of the script.Vote: 6",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Laughable,"Continuing my journey back in time to 1980s classic movies 1986's The Fly gets a turn. For some reason I missed this back in the day but I remember the reaction it created, how horrified audiences were with people fainting and having to rush out of the cinema in panic. So this was my first viewing and to be honest I found it laughable. The acting is particularly bad. Jeff Goldblum plays Jeff Goldblum playing a mad scientist, Geena Davis can't act, it's as simple as that. As the opening credits played I thought ""what ever happened to Geena Davis?"" and her ""performance"" in The Fly explains all. John Getz plays a different character in every scene he is in. His performance swings wildly from magazine editor to annoying ex boyfriend to complete psycho to concerned friend to gun toting action hero. In any event he plays each character very poorly. And that basically is the cast, apart from a few peripheral characters we are left with just the three and they all stink.OK, so the actors should be charged with fraud but the story is good, right? Nope, the story stinks too. Even though it's a science fiction horror mash up there has to be a sense of plausibility which The Fly lacks at each and every turn. There isn't a single plot point in the entire movie that makes any sense whatsoever. Example the very first scene is some sort of science galla where Geena Davis is a science journalist there to interview prominent scientists. But instead she is waylaid by Jeff Goldblum playing Jeff Goldblum playing a mad scientist being extra creepy and mad who tells Geena he has an invention which will change the world and also a coffee machine. Next thing we know Geena has Jeff Goldblum playing Jeff Goldblum in her car enroute to his lab. WTF!? On what planet is that plausible?So the acting is criminal and the story stinks but who cares because this is a David Cronenberg movie so the body horror effect will be amazing, right? Hmm, kinda. Remember this is 1986, no mobile phones, no internet, no CGI, CDs were the hot new product and having a coffee maker was very fancy pants indeed. So all the effects are practical created with make up, prosthetics and animetronics which is very cool. However there's an emphasis on goo rather than gore, disgust instead of horror. If you're a bit nesh The Fly might make you a bit queezey but not scared. So although the make up and creature effects are good ( for 1986 ) they miss the mark because they're aiming for the wrong reaction.So all in all a bit disappointing and not Cronenberg's best movie by a long shot. Worth a watch if you're keen on body horror and a fan of feeling slightly nauseous.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most beautiful and disturbing films I have ever seen,"I have seen this film quite a few times and still cry at the ending. David Cronenberg is a genius and my favourite director, a master of the genre. This film shows male hysteria, some black comedy (some brief scenes, one of them involving a baboon) and true love. Of course, the ending is heartbreaking and I think it can effect on people in real life. It is disturbing, but if you're like me then you'll see beyond that and see the beauty and sorrow of this film. I know that Crash is marvellous to audiences, but in my opinion, how this film shocked viewers in ways and made them think as well; it is undoubtedly David Cronenberg's masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

inventive but often crass re-make,"There's no reason to remake a 30-year-old (minor) horror film unless improvements can be added, but David Cronenberg's grisly update is an imaginative rethinking of the 1958 sci-fi scenario. In the original, a scientist experimenting with teleportation unwittingly swaps heads with a housefly; this time around, when the absent-minded professor (Jeff Goldblum) accidentally mixes molecules with an insect, the alteration is at a genetic level, leading to a gradual physical metamorphosis better suited to the horror film format. Tiny hairs begin sprouting on his back; next he begins to exhibit unusual strength; then he experiences a sudden craving for sugar; and finallywell, suffice to say that viewers with sensitive stomachs are hereby forewarned. Cronenberg earns points for emphasizing the tragedy of Goldblums's predicament, but the nauseating shock effects are strictly for kids. With a little more subtlety the film might have emerged as a classic of its kind.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most interesting stories in film history,"The Fly definitely has to have one of the most interesting story in film history about a scientist who teleported himself in his invention without knowing that there is a fly with him. The best thing about the movie is that he didn't turn into a fly straight away after he left the machine; he was slowly throughout the whole film which really created the suspense & the tensive mood.It is a remake and a hi-tech update of the 1958 classic and is David Cronenberg's biggest hit to date, granting Jeff Goldblum his finest role as the teleported monster hybrid and granting an Oscar for its gruesomely icky special effects. Generally flies are the most useless & annoying animals especially when they sit on your food but for once they did become useful for the idea of this terrific film. I've not seen the original Fly because I'm not keen in really old films and I don't think it will turn out to be as good as this one.It's rumoured that there is going to be another remake in 2008, I don't mind remakes as long as they turn out to be good but most of them are rubbish. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street, The Terminator & Predator, the list is endless. Overall The Fly is a masterpiece with a classic story that has been tackled in a lot of cartoons including Dexter's Laboratory & Johnny Bravo. It is really underrated because mostly people gave it an 8 instead of 10 out of 10 and it should be on the IMDb top 250.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Woo! A Horror movie that you will be dying to see!,"The Fly was a horror movie that could stun. It's not just horror, it's romance and drama. And all in one great movie, the elements of horror, romance and drama tie together to form a spectacular performance. The movie score was terrifying and perfectly suits this gem like a puzzle piece. The Costume and Makeup Department must have had one good time transforming Jeff Goldblum into a Fly monster.Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), a brilliant and determined scientist, is a person that hopes to change the world. So he creates these machines called telepods, an invention that can teleport one thing to the next, one telepod to another. But he starts to see something is wrong when he tests it on a baboon. The baboon is turned inside out when the teleportation is complete. Thanks to his girlfriend, Veronica (Geena Davis) Seth fixes this problem, as in the next test, another baboon comes out of the machine alive. Seth decides to try this machine out using himself. He gets into the machine, but a common housefly gets in with him. The telepods merge Seth and the fly. Seth gets out apparently normal, but slowly, one gene by another, he is transforming into a human/fly hybrid, Brundlefly...The acting is perfect. Tons of memorable lines. Barely any goofs. The gory effects real. Don't be afraid to watch this movie. No. ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Most Imaginative Remake Ever,"David Cronenberg really outdid himself with this movie.The story twist from the original was creative. For those of you that aren't as 'tenured' as me (OK, I'm old!😎); the original had a direct, all at once, switch of body parts. I hope it's not a spoiler to point out that in the new (1986) version, the change is at the genetic level.Hence, the metamorphosis is the movie.Although graphic at times; it's initially a Sci-Fi pic, but after things go wrong, it's truly horror.I bought this movie on Laser Disc in the early 90's I was so impressed with it. (And I'm not particularly a fan of horror.)
At a party at our house back then, I put the disc in my Luxman LD player for my wife's sister Kay. No exaggeration, she was not just glued, but transfixed to the movie's conclusion. We own it on Blu Ray now.Goldblum does a great job. Bonus! You get to learn things about your average housefly you never knew; and after the movie's over, wish you hadn't. Also, you can clearly see the budding chemistry between Jeff Goldblum & Geena Davis.Lastly, 30 years ago, this concept was far fetched. But with today's gene splicing being a reality (and much more); the movie's premise is probably somewhere between Science Fiction and Science Fact.All in all; very well done, and full of frightening suspense, albeit graphic at times.I highly recommend.Bob R.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disturbingly Brilliant,"'The Fly' is a film focusing on scientist, Seth Brundle (Goldblum) who is setting out to make an invention to change the word: Teleportation. When Brundle test human teleportation on himself, he unknowingly does so with a fly in the teleportation pod.This movie is intense and disturbing, but also has heart to it. I'd like to start off first by saying Jeff Goldblum laid down a great and very memorable performance, possibly the best of his career. His performance from before his teleportation, transitioning to after the teleportation process is great. Geena Davis did quite well in this movie too. Nothing special, but still a good performance. Overall the performances by all the actor's were great, but Goldblum's performance was the greatest and very memorable.'The Fly' won the Academy Award in 1986 for Best Makeup and deservingly so. The makeup in 'The Fly' is absolutely on point and is by far some of the best makeup ever used in a film. Along with makeup, the effects in this movie were fantastic. Disturbingly realistic and again, some of the best effects I have personally seen in a film. Makeup and effects will more than likely stick with the viewers as it is brilliant and disturbing.With performances and makeup being the clear standouts in the movie, the score should not be overshadowed. It was nothing too special, but it was good enough to bring emphasis to events occurring on screen.This all being said, 'The Fly' is a great film. Definitely a classic that all film buffs must see, with a memorable performance from Jeff Goldblum, as well as very memorable makeup and effects that will stick with the viewer as some of the best.

A horror that is also romantic and touching,"The Fly is one of the superior horror remakes. It blends horror, sci-fi, romance and drama and produces a terrific film backed up by solid performances and direction. This is probably one of the more underrated Cronenberg movies.

Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are great, the score is chilling and Cronenberg's direction is perfect.A brilliant but odd scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) creates two telepods. After a few test subjects he tests himself, unfortunately, a fly was there with him. Everything seems fine at first, until the side-effects that matter really start to show and his life goes spiralling down the drain.The Fly isn't really straight out horror. For you gorehounds out there, don't watch expecting heaps, there isn't. But when it comes, it is disgusting and it looks great. The acting, especially Davis and Goldblum, is fantastic.

"David Cronenberg was born on March 15th, 1943","Jeff Goldblum was always that actor, who always gave a relaxed, calm performance, regardless of his mood or emotional situation. Most of his characters have been smart guys, who, one way or another, run into moments of distress or chaos. Even when things are bad, that hip guy still tends to come out. That doesn't mean that all his characters are just, Jeff doing Jeff. They all have their personalities, it's his delivery that makes them great. He's the reason why he's a likeable persona, even if his character is a crazy jerk, like the Grandmaster in Thor Ragnarok (2017).In the Fly (1986), a remake of the 1958, Vincent Price classic, Goldblum has to deal with an array of benchmarks to get his character to where it needs to be. Also, being as it is the mid-1980s, the creature effects were still done completely with makeup effects, mechanical automatons and even puppetry. Leading up to the release of this film, many different, successful, creative, creature effects were seen in many films in the early 80s. We were not yet at computer effects for these kind of creatures, but when these films were released in the 80s, it was the accepted form of technical effect and it worked for the audience of the day. Today, when you look at these films, you might chuckle a tiny bit, but when you think about all the time spent making those mechanical creatures and severed insect limbs, you tend to respect the effort a little bit more and concentrate on the rest of the film.Director, David Cronenberg, creates, what could be the weirdest love story ever. A beauty and the monster concept, that involves the, science-out-of-control, sub-genre, with the nicest mad scientist ever. What makes this film work is the pain of loss you feel, experienced by what Goldblum's character (Seth Brundle), has to go through, because of a million-to-one accident. You feel totally bad for him and his horrible situation. His total bad luck is only a biproduct of him getting drunk when this ""accident"" happened. As his transformation begins, the nice-guy persona starts to disappear, until the Brundle-Fly begins to emerge.On the other side of the coin is the love story. His reporter, girlfriend, Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), becomes entwined in this nightmare, when he first shows her a demonstration of his teleportation pods. At first, she wants to use all of this as an article in Particle Magazine, but things turn to a horrific point and she realizes she shouldn't expose this. The story gets out and creates a whole set of other issues. A stark contrast to Goldblum's Brundle is Veronica's ex-boyfriend, Stathis Borans (John Getz). His performance is pretty interesting, as it resembles Brundle's path in reverse, almost. The guy is a total jerk, but because of his devotion to Veronica, does present eventual redemption. Even Geena Davis goes through an evolution with her character, as she evolves from selfish, reporter to devoted woman in love. It's the evolution of these characters, coupled with all the science fiction eye-candy that makes this one fun.7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Do you take coffee with your sugar?""","This may be considered a remake of the 1958 movie of the same name but in reality the characters are different and the story arc is quite different, both leading up to the ""experiment gone bad"" and its aftermath. I enjoyed each one for the ideas and their places in cinematic history.Jeff Goldblum is Scientist Seth Brundle. He has been working pretty much in secret on a project that he says ""will change the world.""

Flies have feelings too :(,"This film is messed up; severely messed up. Watching a man slowly deteriorate and transform into a fly -as unique as that may be- is vile. Despite that there is no denying this is a classic. Having never seen the original i can't deliberate on which is better, but i would take a guess that the 1958 version doesn't compete in terms of the gore and gut churning scenes.As the transformation becomes really noticeable i think it would be fair to argue that Jeff Goldblum may have been a fly in his previous life. His performance is scarily convincing. Unquestionably a brilliant showing. Who else could have played this role? No-one; Goldblum does slightly look like a fly to begin with, so he was perfect. Geena Davis on the other hand was very lackluster; i mean if i witnessed a man eat like a fly, I would have evacuated the premises as quickly as humanly possible. I jest, but she showed no emotion when witnessing such things and it seemed very unnaturalI know it's classed as a horror, but i would label it more sci-fi; i didn't find it scary; it was just a bit gory is all.

"Even though the movie is from 1986, you'll not really notice it.","The problem with horror movies is that they get dated very quickly. The version of 'The Fly' that I saw was shot in 1986, so already 18 years old... I've seen more recent movies in which the special effects were no longer any good, but this movie is different.Thanks to Jeff Goldblum's excellent performance and 'looks', this remake is still very convincing. Because the director didn't focus on the special effects in the first place, but on the characters' emotions and the psychological aspects, you never get the feeling that this movie was shot in 1986, so already pretty old ... for a horror movie.Jeff Goldblum is a brilliant scientist who has invented a teleporter. He uses it on himself but a fly comes with him on the ride. His genes are mixed up with those of the fly and he slowly turns into a crossing of a fly and a man.

It then becomes more and more ludicrous and all logic is tossed aside, even if one accepts the basic premise of the story.

Intelligent and excellent remake of a cult classic,"At the time The Fly was made, there was a fashion for remaking 50's sci-fi horror flicks with upgraded special effects and the more adult content that the times allowed. The original Vincent Price movie was from 1958 and is something of a cult classic. It has some camp value certainly but mostly it worked because it had an interesting premise that was executed well. David Cronenberg's remake retained the basic idea but updated it with more complex ideas and, of course, ground-breaking special effects. In a sense, The Fly was the last pure horror film that Cronenberg ever made, despite some of his subsequent movies certainly having elements of the genre. As such it represents the final entry in a truly brilliant series of sci-fi horror feature films that began with Shivers in 1975. It's probably fair to say that The Fly is his most mature work of that sequence, in the sense of his screenplay being strong, with the production values and actors being good enough to carry it off consistently well. But that's not to say it's his best work from the period, I have even more of a fondness for his rougher earlier films and would arguably consider Videodrome to be his master-work. But this is all relative really, as The Fly remains a fantastic work and one of the very best horror or sci-fi films from the 80's.The story focuses for the most part on a research scientist called Seth Brundle and science magazine reporter. He is a reclusive intellectual who has developed telepods which can transport matter through space, while she wishes to report on it. They form a relationship which complicates matters resulting in Brundle deciding to go through his teleportation device himself one night. Unfortunately for him he unknowingly is sharing the telepod with an ordinary harmless house flyIn these days of ten-a-penny remakes and reboots, it is especially refreshing to look back on a new version of an old film that updated it in ways that made it seem necessary that it was remade. Cronenberg had shown in his previous horror films that he was a director full of original thought, so it's not really surprising that he took the ingredients from the original movie and remodelled them into one of his unique body-horror flicks. The old movie was essentially a creature feature with a difference, in that the monster was not a marauding menace but a tragic being. In this way it recalled Frankenstein, with its sympathetic monster but with the added angle that the scientist responsible becomes the monster/victim himself. Cronenberg retains this idea but has the scientist fuse with the fly at a molecular, genetic level; meaning that a new creature entirely, emerges. In this way Brundle's metamorphosis into the Brundlefly is more gradual beginning with small things such as excessive sugar intake, moving on to extreme strength and resulting in physical transformation. The effects work here is exemplary and Oscar winning; in fact, the man responsible Chris Walas was given director duties for the very decent sequel, The Fly II.What really separates this film with Cronenberg's earlier ones is that it's emotionally resonant with sympathetic characters. Its plot boils down to an unorthodox love story of sorts. The way in which it has such a strong and realistic emotional undercurrent without sacrificing any of the gruesome and imaginative sci-fi horror aspects is what makes it so successful and relatively unusual in the genre. It's helped rather a lot by the acting contributions of Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis who both put in strong performances; Goldblum in particular has never been better than here. Ultimately, The Fly remains a definitive example of how to intelligently remake a beloved old movie – keep it the same, while making it different – it's a lot harder than it seems!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Must watch,"""The Fly"" is one of the most iconic sci-fi horror movies ever made. Directed by David Cronenberg, the film has become a cult classic due to its iconic scenes, peak Jeff Goldblum performance, and spectacular special effects.The plot of the movie revolves around a brilliant, yet eccentric scientist named Seth Brundle played by Jeff Goldblum. Brundle creates a teleportation device that he uses to transport matter from one place to another. However, when he decides to test the device on himself, he becomes fused with a fly, ultimately leading to his slow and painful transformation.What makes ""The Fly"" so enjoyable is its combination of masterful acting, stellar direction, and groundbreaking special effects. Jeff Goldblum's performance as Seth Brundle is a tour-de-force, perfectly balancing humor, pathos, and horror. His transformation into the grotesque hybrid creature is unforgettable, and it remains one of the most impressive feats of practical effects in movie history.The film also features several iconic scenes that have become ingrained in popular culture, from Goldblum's quirky delivery of the line ""Be afraid, be very afraid"" to the chillingly visceral final sequence.The combination of Cronenberg's direction, Goldblum's performance, and the incredible special effects make ""The Fly"" a true cinematic experience. The movie is a must-see for fans of science fiction, horror, or just great filmmaking in general.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gross! But it inspired a classic pun!,"I saw this movie once. Never again. David Cronenberg seems to be going out of his way in this movie to gross out the audience. The problem is, he mistakes revulsion for genuine horror and suspense.This movie has one redeeming value. It inspired what has to be the All-Time Classic Worst Pun in the History of the World. It came from Bob Hope: ""Hey, did you see this new movie, ""The Fly?"" Jeff Goldblum plays a mad scientist who accidentally turns himself into a giant fly. My favorite scene in the movie is when the scientist and his wife are sitting in a restaurant. The scientist drinks a bowl of soup, and his wife turns to the waiter and says, 'Waiter, there's a soup in my fly!'""",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tragic, operatic, brilliant","I've probably watched Cronenberg's 'The Fly' at least ten times over the years, and what struck me most this time is that it has absolutely no wasted motion. With a runtime of around 90 min (without opening and closing credits) it's tightly paced and perfectly structured with a focus much tighter than that of an actual fly.Most importantly, 'The Fly' features superb performances from its three principles; Jeff Goldblum in particular. I'm sure the five Oscar nominated actors that year deserved their selections, but I doubt any were as critical to the success of their films as Jeff Goldblum is here.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thinking Man's Horror,"David Cronenberg has always managed to direct stylish, off-beat films that bear his unmistakable touch.  This film is an example of the director at his finest moment.  More than anything else, this is a love story...a story of human compassion in the face of transfiguring degeneration.  Jeff Goldblum excels as Seth Brundle, a man with good intentions that go bad through no fault of his own.  Equally as powerful is Geena Davis as Veronica, his love. One of the main themes of ""THE FLY"" is how love transcends the boundaries of the physical.  Even as Seth's body deteriorates and metamorphasizes into a monstrousity, Veronica never leaves his side.  She remains the one constant in his life as it crumbles about him.  She never lets his appearance deter her from keeping her love the only solace Seth knows. Even as Seth fights to keep in control of his mind as the mind of the fly (the instinct as opposed to the reason) continues to take over, Veronica remains at his side.Another theme, as mentioned above, is not only the physical deterioration of the body...but the mental breakdown as well.  Seth battles constantly to keep the irrational, instinct-driven mind of the fly at bay as to keep his own logic and human reasoning in control (to keep Veronica safe more than anything else).Cronenberg has always managed to invent films that have a ""body and mind"" theme.  Efforts such as ""THE BROOD"" and ""VIDEODROME"" relate to this theme more clearly.  Despite the visceral special effects, this film remains a seminal classic.  It gains and never loses a human touch that drives the horror elements home with gut-wrenching success.  A must-see for Cronenberg fans and a nice, surprising shock for evryone else.  You do not need to be a horror buff to appreciate this classy, but sick, film!",,Anonymous,Horror
Still solid,"I would love to read the childrens book, ""Brundle Fly"". I can already see the horrified expressions on the kids faces. As for the movie, there were a number of times when I myself had a horrified look on my face. The body horror stuff is legit great, to this day. Watching Jeff pull his nails off is one of the most grossed out I've been. Goldblum too is great. He gets both more greasy and manic as the movie goes along. It's pretty well structured in that respect. Its a pretty slow ramp up as Brundle Fly becomes more and more fly like. However, both the story and characters are a bit thin. You've nerdy, isolated doctor who falls in love with spunky reporter. Nothing crazy there. Then after Jeff teleports with the fly it really is scene after scene of Jeff getting worse little by little. Which would be fine if the characters where better, but they are equally repetitive. It's still a pretty good movie overall though. Howard shores music is amazing, the effects look awesome, the performances are generally good, and the story is pretty unique even if it's a bit thin. (The only effect that doesn't look great is the full body costume at the end. Telefly on the other hand is awesome)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Next up is he himself; but a fly manages to get in with him and their genes are spliced together. CUE teeth-falling-out, extreme fitness and disgraceful manners.

Cronenburg Magnifique,"A film from one of my favourite directors, David Cronenberg. A director that never fails to deliver on the gore and human malformations front.However The Fly from 1986 (yes thirty seven years ago!) isn't all about great prosthetics and make-up effects it also explores human emotions, relationships and science (although the computer looks naff!). The film is actually a remake of a 1958 horror B-movie starring Vincent Price. The small cast is led by Jeff Goldblum. Someone I had only seen in Death Wish and Jurassic Park. However he delivers a good performance as a scientist whose experiments on matter transportation goes wrong. He experiments on himself and turns into a human/fly hybrid. As the film progresses he gradually turns more insect. Complete with the escalation in special effects. I might have to track the 1958 version down as many commentators say this remake is of the rare breed that better the original? I've seen several Cronenberg films and this ranks high up amongst them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Be afraid...be very afraid!""","David Cronenberg's ""The Fly""(1986) - is a remake of the 1950s movie of the same title in which a scientist is turned into a half- man, half-fly due to a fatal defect in the matter transmitter. In his remake, Cronenberg piles the eye popping, jaw-dropping, and stomach-churning effects on the top of each other as the body of the unfortunate, mad but brilliant scientist (Jeff Goldblum in the role of his life I've never seen him better) is hideously distorted and he is losing his humanity turning into the insect of the title. ""The Fly"" is a truly visceral experience which the director himself sees as a metaphor for aging: ""In time we all turn into monsters"". This very impressive movie is a classic of a ""the fatal error of a mad scientist"" sub-genre, ""Everybody's a mad scientist, and life is their lab. We're all trying to experiment to find a way to live, to solve problems, to fend off madness and chaos"" (David Cronenberg).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An interesting mix of sci-fi, gore, and a reworked story/mythology","The original ""The Fly"" was a more poigant story of ""man playing God"" and in the process loses himself.  About 28 yrs later, the remake approached the mythology of this classic from a new perspective. The filmmakers injected the story with more horror mixed in with the basic elemnts of sci-fi and the original story. I also felt that the movie's strongest point didn't lie in the special effects or reworked story, but the simple psychology of seeing ""Brundle"" not turned into a fly instantously, but fusing with it on a genetic level, to watch him slowly turn into a creature the world has never seen.  The makeup effects are just awe-inspiring as well as a bit overdone. That is probaly the weakest point of this movie. I think the filmakers went a little far in empasizing the changes we see in Goldblum's character. I liked the gore, but near the end, it got a little too weird and flat-out disgusting. Other than that, the performances are good, especially Jeff Goldblum's,who is the centerpiece of this film and holds it together to the very end. Overall, a good movie, but it could've been better without the gore-overkill",,Anonymous,Horror
An Absolute Classic of a Classic,"Where do I start with this film? It is my favorite movie. Of all time. Because there is no comparison to The Fly(""86)? It's an old, new, true example of an epic tragedy. Such great acting from all three of the actors. Goldblum is the man. Durp. He makes you love and hate and empathize and condemn and understand his Seth Brindle. Hubris. So very sad. The movie is super, duper gross. It won the Academy Award for best makeup. There's a reason. So be prepared for some graphic and awesome stuff. Geena Davis is the best possible person to play the love interest to Goldblum. They were married when this was made and it is completely evident. The chemistry and the way you truly believe her grief is the ultimate testiment to me. The Fly is one of the finest films of all time because it's a Game Changer. It came out in the mid 80's and dealt with the issues of abortion, technology and computers, love, death, mortality, fragility, jealousy etc. The fact you can still feel for this increasingly disgusting and gross monstrosity, is the ultimate reason why this film is one of the best ever.

The movie that had everything to be Trash. But ends up becoming a cult.,"""The White-Headed Fly"" of 1959 wins a remake at the hands of the great and stylish David cronenberg, long that had everything to be more a movie trash movie, or worse, to be a total joke, but the excellent direction of Croneberg removes all The risks of the film being bad, despite an absurd script, we have a movie style, transgressor and that goes from this comedy to suspense going through a good dose of science fiction. It tells the story of Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), a scientist who can find a way to teleport, and in the middle of his experiments he ends up merging his DNA with a fly, and ends up transmuting itself in the insect during the film. This is the script that Croneberg takes in his hand and the ciarra, and makes the trash, a cult. The rhythm of the film is completely linear, although the film is extremely short, it is well solved in what it claims to have, but it has a problem, it was not enough to develop the characters, numerous subplots are created, and none of them is solved. The film pincel deal with a moral about the human ego and the pursuit of professional accomplishment but ends up dealing with love, which is the same regardless of physical appearance, but it is nothing that we have not seen in 500 other films, which we We have not seen in 500 other films is his art direction, which is wonderful, with great and salve highlight the fly that is terrifyingly realistic in all its phases, spectacular work, all hi tech side of the film, which although it is cliché to Season, is very well worked out, and his gray photography does not let us lie that we are seeing a movie from the 80s. Just as jack nicholson already seemed crazy about this first scene of ""The Enlightened One"", Jeff Goldblum already seems a strange being from this The first scene of the film, this is not bad, its performance is good, and the same fulfills its role, the dramatic charge is more for Geena Davis, and she can handle and develop this load, not brilliantly, but Competently.

Still it has a great cast, and it is a well done movie, just needed some kills or something else. He isn't super fly for very long, but for the most part just the melting man.

The eating scene with him showing how a fly eats is particularly icky as are the many scenes of various pieces of him coming off.

Not quite fully an horror movie and not quite fully a science-fiction movie. Instead its an unique movie experience in almost every way possible,"""The Fly"" is hard to classify. There never has been a movie like this before and there will never be one again, since the way of movie-making and story telling is so brilliantly unique of this movie. It's not really an horror movie, for it's not consistently scary and gory enough for that. The movie can be divided into several parts and to every part of the movie a different genre label can be put. Cronenberg simply chooses to ignore that there are different movie genres and he tries to create his very own movie with his very own unique view and take on the story. He ignores all of the 'Hollywood' movie rules with as a result this brilliant and unique movie.The storytelling is for most part slow and mysterious. It helps to give the movie a certain atmosphere of fear and paranoia. The movie has very few settings and actors in it. It doesn't waste anytime on wide-shots, needless side-plots and characters. Instead it choices a straight forward approach. It works powerful and compelling. We as viewers get immediately drawn into the story and the 'action', so to speak, immediately starts of. It are all reasons why this movie is only 95 minutes short but its long enough to cover everything that has to be told.The unique way of storytelling is probably also the reason why this movie feels so realistic to watch. You just never know what is going to happen next and the characters are mostly unpredictable. The story and characters take several turns as the movie progresses.The wonderful dialog is another thing that adds to the realism of the movie. Of course the dialog is also perfectly delivered by the fine cast. Jeff Goldblum plays his character in a way only Goldblum can. With this movie he deliverers one of his most memorable performances. Geena Davis in this movie also shows that she is a very talented actress. It's too bad her career never really got of the ground, in terms of playing respectable and tough roles. She is a well known Hollywood-star but she never really appeared in any widely acclaimed and respected movie, with the exception of this movie, ""Beetle Juice"" and ""Thelma & Louise"", for which she was nominated for an Oscar. Three years before that she even won an Oscar for her role in ""The Accidental Tourist"". But having a successful 5 years just isn't enough for an actress of her caliber. A real shame because when you watch this movie it becomes obvious that the talent is definitely there. John Getz also plays a great role. He plays an unpredictable character that at moments you hate and at others you like him again. Just like in real life, none of the characters are fully bad or fully good. Everyone has a darker less pleasant side and director Cronenberg is not afraid to show this.The special effects are simple and quite poor but considering that this movie was released in 1986, it's acceptable. The Oscar winning make-up effects on the other hand are fantastic. There are very gory. Even more gory than the most hardened horror movie. The make-up effects are one of the main reasons why the horror elements of the movie work out so very well, especially toward the ending. It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time, even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion.It's a very well constructed movie that can't really be defined. A typical Cronebergian gem, with more layers, meanings and elements in it then you would see at first sight. Almost everything about it is unique. It makes ""The Fly"" a one of a kind movie that is an absolute must-see, at least if you have a strong enough stomach, for this movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slowly turning into a monster, aka slowly succumbing to age","An eccentric scientist living in a warehouse laboratory in a big city in the Northeast (Jeff Goldblum) discovers how to teleport objects, which draws the attention of a journalist (Geena Davis). Everything is going fine until he foolishly uses his invention on himself and a pesky fly inadvertently teleports with him. John Getz is on hand as the woman's editor while Joy Boushel has a notable small role as Tawny.""The Fly"" (1986) has a lot of devotees presumably because of director/writer David Cronenberg, but I found it less effective compared to the 1958 version with Vincent Price. Despite the gory state-of-the-art effects, it's just not as compelling or horrifying (especially that final scene in the original). The one-dimensional locations are also a turn-off: Excluding the great bar scene the whole movie takes place in a grungy lab or a swank office building.The cast trilogy is exceptionally tall. While Goldblum (6'4½"") is serviceable and gives it his all, he's not leading man material, although he's fine in secondary roles. And I was never big on Davis, but she's a'right I guess. At least the two absolutely look & act like they were meant for each other.In its favor, the movie is a metaphor for how aging & disease slowly destroys the body. Despite the sickening visuals, it's heartbreaking and tragic, which you might not expect in a sci-fi flick about a guy who morphs into a fly. It thankfully avoids the rut of camp and melodrama.The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Toronto with studio work done in nearby Kleinburg.GRADE: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Operatic!,"This is the only movie I have ever seen that is truly like an opera - a Puccini-weeping, tormented drama.  It could have been a play.  I really, really like this movie, and the fact that it is an opera without song is very high praise.Great opera pulls you in, fascinates you and challenges you to throw away your disbelief (not just suspend it).  And so does The Fly.The Fly has a tightly-written dramatic pull, along the lines of the classic 5-act Shakespearean model, where tension builds and builds, then relaxes, then comes in for the big end.  It has, likewise, a Shakespearean sense of undeserved tragedy, where one is grossly over-penalized for an initial error.Geena Davis here is like Liu' from Turandot and Cio-Cio San from Madama Butterfly.  She plays the tragedy and suffering and shock so well!  But she is not insubstantial.  She is wise and sharp and energetic - and so we feel her pain and fear so much more!It is very rare to see agony and weeping over a lifeless body in a movie. Can anyone name me a scene from a movie in the past 20 years that has it? It happens in every one of Puccini's big operas, however.  And it works in The Fly!  I am completely caught up in her agony and in the tragedy of the scientist's hideous end.Finally, another device in Puccini (and Shakespeare) is a sense of eventuality.  We know from about the 8th minute of this movie that it ain't gonna work out.  The movie does not play with us and tease us and surprise us - it is worthy as a story in itself, and plays it straight all the way through.  Just like La Boheme and Madama Butterfly and Tosca - we know that these Puccini operas are gonna end bad - we know it and we keep watching - we get sucked in because we are enthralled in the story and in the art. Same with The Fly.  The story is so compelling and the characters so interesting.  (And, yes, the special effects only deepen the experience. These special effects service the plot - they do not just exist for their own sake.)I just thought this side of this great movie has been overlooked.

The terror is also real, or as real as can be believed, which is very real indeed. Jeff Goldblum gives his ultimate performance as the brilliant Seth Brundle, a man who's genius goes awry, and soon, his life is turned upside down! Geena Davis certainly gives us a real character to embrace, as she falls in love with Goldblums' Brundle.

"Classic Cronenberg - disgusting, disturbing, and awesome","I really love this movie....but then again, i love david cronenberg movies in general (for those that dont know, cronenberg has a thing for slimy, bloody, creature/monster stories and are always very unsettling to watch). This one does not disappoint in that department - it is pretty disgusting at times and its done really well!This one is a total classic and jeff goldblum at his most jeff goldbluminess - a must-see if you are a fan of ""body horror"" and some top notch practical effects.The story is pretty simple in essence but the slow transformation and mental tailspin that plays out is a great ride.

"Unsettling, Eerie, and Chilling in the Best Ways","The Fly is a film often discussed, but somehow I have never found the opportunity to watch it until recently. Being over 35 years old, most films would look laughable, have cheesy acting, or a simple plot, by modern standard, but The Fly blows away even modern films in comparison. David Cronenberg crafts a story that sends shivers up your spine and makes it difficult to look at the screen, using effects that will still make you uncomfortable to watch. Jeff Goldblum's charm and charisma make it gut-wrenching as the story progresses and his journey becomes more gruesome. The personality that Godllblum brings to the character of Seth Brundle really makes for a memorable performance and one of his most iconic roles. At only an 1 1/2 hours, every moment of this film is beautifully designed and not a moment is wasted throughout. This is not a film you will soon forget and should be on the top of your watchlist if you haven't seen it yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It's Okay, I Guess","I've been dying to see The Fly for two months but finally, when Sci-Fi showed it, I realized that it's not all that. There's far too much sex and too little action or suspense. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good Remake In Many Ways,"Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis work well together is this dark remake of the classic Vincent Price original. In many ways this remake is much more effective than the original. The intrigue, suspense, and frights are much more substantive here. The two central characters are more thoroughly developed as well so that the viewers can relate to and become invested in them. All good for sure. The downside though are the special effects employed here are unnecessarily extreme to the point of distraction. I just think that the way the story was unfolding so well that the flashy make-up just wasn't necessary and takes away from the story rather than enhancing it. Still, this version of The Fly is definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Me and my mother coined the term ""horrmance"" to describe this movie because it is a horror movie with a romantic twist. Don't let the romance part deter you, however, this is a wonderful horror movie full of gore, gore, and more gore.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Fly (1986)The downside to being a fly on the wall is overhearing everyone talk about what a disgusting freak you've become.Something the mutating scientist in this horror-fantasy knows all too well about.While drunk and upset one night over his girlfriend (Geena Davis) seeing her ex, inventor Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) uses himself as a test subject in his telepods.However, a housefly caught in the experiment causes Brundle to transmute into a hybrid.

Intelligent and captivating. THE best horror movie of the 80's,"How rare it is when a remake outshine the original. Not that in this case the original was any good though. This one is a classic. I'm sorry to see the other comments about this movie as just being 'a OK horror flick'. How little do they understand. This is the modern version of Quasimodo or beauty and the beast. The main difference with the other horror movies is this: In most horror movies, the main requirements of the characters is that they must be able to bleed gallons of blood, and they have to scream when touched... or cut. In The Fly the character are filled with human emotions and the deficiencies that makes us humans: ambition, doubt, love, despair, hope and anger. The fear factor here is not the loss of life and limb, but the mechanics of those human frailties that tend to lead us to our doom. The Fly is an intelligent and mature horror movie of the same caliber as Alien. As I flock my memory, I can't remember any other good horror movie after the fly (maybe people under the stair come close). Hollywood is back to courting the popcorn gubling audience watching teenager X being slashed and mangled to dead by creep Y in the dark corner of the silver screen.TIP: avoid at ANY cost The Fly 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Story Of The Mind And The Heart,"I have seen many horror films since the past 10 years. None of them can equal up to David Cronnenberg's version of The Fly. This story has both originality and intelligence.I can understand how most people will consider this film disgusting. What most people I know don't see that unlike Clive Barker's Hellraiser, where you mostly see monsters going the rampage killing people in the most horrible ways, and for what? The Fly was logical and intelligent and it wasn't about, ""Let's See How We Can Disgust Them The Most?"" There was no shock value in The Fly. The Fly is about a man who becomes torn apart between his girlfriend and his work. The most touching part of the film was when Brundle was forced to deal with a decision he could not control. He suffered from an illness which left him with sorrow   and heart break. The telling of the story reflects how a lot of us are put into decisions that we have to do, that of which we would have originally have chosen not to, but our minds say it is for the best. The story was real and I think The Fly will continue to inspire more people as they watch this for the first time.Cheers!Rebbecca McGarity",,Anonymous,Horror
Gradual disgusting,"Fortunately I saw it in the daytime with the sunshine because I didn't sleep out of dread.

More than just a Horror movie; and better than the original at that,"Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is one of those (very) few remakes that are better than the original. Nothing against the original in itself - after all it is a timeless classic of the ""mad-scientist-experiment-gone-wrong"" horror genre. But this one is a pure Cronenbergian take on it's own and probably one of his best movies (if not the best).What really sets this movie apart - even as a horror movie - is the emotional depth and the dialogues. It is rare to get both meaning and emotion working as perfectly in a horror movie as it works in this Film. The dialogues take a rather pleasant philosophical plunge to what ""Flesh"", ""Destruction"" and ""Reconstruction"" are concerned and a latter ""Insect Politics"" can move the viewer if he/she envisions him/herself going through what the main character (Seth Brundle) is then experiencing.It's not a simplistic film. It's not a ""shocker"" per se, but it indeed gets visually shocking and even disgusting to a certain extent (wich is also one of the reasons it gets to be memorable). But in truth, if there were to be none of the intellectual ventures and the emotion that the characters show towards what is happening (and their own relationship) this wouldn't be a Cronenberg Film, rather just another horror show.In my very humble opinion, this is one of the best horror movies to this date. Visually arresting, shoking, deep and emotional. Much more than just a ""horror movie"". And better than the original.9 stars out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Intense Remake.,"David Cronenberg directed this intense & harrowing remake of the 1958 original that stars Jeff Goldblum as brilliant scientist/inventor Seth Brundle, who has created a matter transmission device that can transport both organic and inorganic material from one pod to another. He invites a journalist named Veronica(played by Geena Davis) to his home/laboratory to witness it in action, and is indeed impressed. Seth later decides to try the experiment on himself alone, but unfortunately a fly is there with him, creating a genetic mutation that results in them being combined, gradually evolving into a new fly/human hybrid. Veronica has fallen in love with Seth, and is horrified by the disturbing changes taking place to his body and mind...Highly effective film is a textbook case on how to do a remake right, by updating the technology and making the science plausible. Goldblum is excellent, and film unfolds as a grand tragedy, and(while undeniably disgusting and gross at times) is ultimately quite moving. Not for the squeamish however...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

More gross and disgusting than scary,"David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is a film that revels in its grotesque imagery and graphic special effects, but ultimately fails to deliver on its promise of genuine horror. While the film's transformation sequences are undeniably impressive and disturbing, they overshadow any attempt at building suspense or creating a truly frightening atmosphere.The film's protagonist, Seth Brundle, a brilliant but arrogant scientist, becomes the victim of his own invention when a teleportation experiment goes awry. As he slowly transforms into a grotesque fly-human hybrid, the film focuses on the physical and psychological deterioration of his body and mind.While the special effects used to depict Brundle's transformation are undeniably impressive, they quickly become repetitive and predictable. The film revels in the graphic details of his decaying flesh, oozing wounds, and insect-like appendages. This relentless focus on gore and disgust desensitizes the audience rather than shocking or frightening them.The film's attempts at exploring themes of identity, isolation, and the consequences of scientific hubris are overshadowed by the overwhelming emphasis on physical horror. Brundle's descent into madness is depicted in a superficial and melodramatic manner, lacking any real depth or emotional resonance.The supporting characters in ""The Fly"" are equally underdeveloped. Veronica Quaife, Brundle's girlfriend, is reduced to a helpless victim and emotional support system, while Stathis Borans, Brundle's colleague, serves as a mere observer of the unfolding tragedy.""The Fly"" ultimately fails to transcend its reliance on shock value and graphic imagery. It is a film that is more interested in grossing out its audience than in genuinely scaring them. The film's lack of suspense, underdeveloped characters, and superficial exploration of its themes make it a disappointing and ultimately forgettable experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Crowning Achievement,"Canada's own Horror/Sci-Fi Revolutionary, David Cronenberg, concocted what would be his crowning achievement, The Fly. It revolves around Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum), a scientist who has created a teleportation pod that would ""change the world"". Seth shows his invention to Veronica Quaife(Geena Davis), a woman he falls in love with. The teleportation device would only transport materials, and make a mess of the molecular construction of an organism. Seth finally acheived success with using a human subject. However, there was a slight flaw. A fly had gotten in the teleportation pod along Seth, thus fusing the two. Seth eventually shows his demise as he starts to gain more insect characteristics, and poor Veronica has to deal with all of this. Regardless, her love still remains.

Body Horror Masterpiece,"The fly has a tendency to make you disgust and would not be recommebed to watch while having a meal. David Cronenberg creates a visual narrative that has a tendency to disgust you to the core.The practical effects employed to bring the titular Fly to life has aged like a fine wine. The prosthetics really look convincing even after almost four decades. It is a body horror masterpiece, that speaks volumes of the capabilites of practical effects. You will find yourself squeaming as the movie progressesThere was also a natural chemistry between the two characters Veronica and Brundle. There is a natural warmth between the two, that makes you want the protagonist to get out of his predicament. You would find yourself relating to Veronica and what she is going through.However I did not like John Getz's character arc in the film. He starts in the movie as a misogynostic pig and the movie later tries to redeem him, which doesn't work in any way. The character fails to garner sympathy of any note.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The fly is a classic of a classic,"This remake of the original The Fly is a landmark in David Cronenberg's career. Brilliant lit and cinema-graphed this is one of Cronenberg's crowning achievements in both horror and sci-fi. Re-imagining the whole plot normally kills the original movie but it didn't for this film. In fact it made it more greater. Instead of having a man with the head of a fly you get a man who has almost total transformation into a fly. Goldblum is great as Dr. Seth Brundle a scientist who tries to make a revolutionary design in time-place relationships. Going from the area to another is his idea and with his trusty ""Telepods"" he intends to be a pioneer in breaking research and it almost works. However the experiment goes horribly wrong and Seth realises that he not going to be the same anymore. I have lost count with how many I have seen this but it never gets tiring. The special effects were brilliant and still are to this day. although gruesome sick and very stomach churning, it compliments this classic in the making back in the 80's. Those who have watched Cronenberg's work will notice his trademark in this picture. One being the horrifying FX done fairly close up and the atmospheric score in the background that share the same style of that in Scanners, Rabid, Videodrome and eXistence.All in all a brill horror/sci-fi movie to be enjoyed by adults with strong stomachs and strong hearts.

Bloody (and) Brilliant,"The Fly marks the central point of David Cronenberg's distinguished directorial career so far. He would achieve a certain tabloid notoriety a decade later with the laughable Crash, but this story of loner scientist Seth Brundle's (Jeff Goldblum) fusion with a house fly strikes the perfect balance between Cronenberg's ongoing exploration of squishy body parts and mainstream cinema's demands for high concept genre conventions.It would first appear that the genre in question is horror. Indeed, many of the final scenes, including the gooey Grand Guignol ending, are straight from the splatter canon. There is method to this madness: Seth is dying - literally falling apart; and the insect in him - brutal, totally without compassion or table manners - is taking over. Off go his ears and out fall his teeth. And yet Brundlefly's heart remains untouched - except, that is, by his writer girlfriend, Ronnie (Geena Davis). Here amongst Chris Walas's fantastic make-up is an old-fashioned Hollywood love story. Perhaps that's why audiences have found The Fly the most accessible of his films: because, whether through straightforward exposition or blood-soaked metaphor, an affecting story of love and jealousy shines through. By the end, you won't be certain you've watched a horror film at all. You may also be convinced that life is a 75-year process of decay, but that's Cronenberg's trick: deep meanings in simple, stark images.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfect Creature Feature,"The Fly would be worthwhile if it were only for the brilliant special makeup effects that turn Jeff Goldblum into a gooey, sticky fly, but the script keeps the drama on a real human level and Goldblum and Geena Davis give some of the best, most heartbreaking performances of their careers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very good body-horror movie,"The Fly rests its excellence on two pillars : a great performance by Jeff Goldblum and stunning visual effects. The plot is a fairly straight-forward one of a scientific experiment gone terribly wrong, with a very slow reveal of the horrifying consequences. There is very quick ramp-up of the disturbing factor though, so much so that I was almost ready to close my eyes before the very disturbing final scene.While the plot is a bit clichéd, the characters have very distinct personalities and are far from clichéd. All the three main actors give very good performances, aided by a clever script, but Jeff Goldblum's performance is particularly noteworthy as the eccentric scientist. It is notable that during his character's slow transformation into the fly, we see glimpses of fly-like behavior when he is still a normal human being, and then glimpses of the eccentric scientist even when he turns into a full-fledged monster. The special effects are very good (and gory), and there are some horrifying scenes which appear very realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another sad remake of a good movie.,"Another sad remake of a good movie. It pales in the shadow of Vincent Price's version. It does give a few changes from the original, better, movie, but they are just tweaks to give a different tangent made possible with relatively more modern special effects. The accident that causes the transformation is somewhat different but ultimately the same results. Goldblum was a poor choice as the main actor. He sounds the same in every movie that he is in. He throws around a tirade of 'sophisticated'/'science' words to make the pseudo-intellectuals think that he is smart and the movie is cutting edge. Goldblum is just mechanical, he does not act well. This movie throws in the blood and gore hollywood is using for 'entertainment' for the visceral crowd that aspires to violent and base behavior.

"My favourite film of all time, an amazing achievement!","Quite frankly, this is an exceptional movie. The highly controversial, shocking and stunning visions and taboos of Canadian director David Cronenberg had never been very successful outside of the inevitable cult following he acquired from such body/horror classics as ""Shivers (1974)"" and ""Rabid (1976)."" These earlier films had established him as a master of shock, flinging flesh, sex and gore at the screen while dealing with themes that would become staples of Cronenberg's filmmaking career; the transformation of the human body from one form to another, mankind's uneasy relationship with science and medicine, and general disgust at the condition of the human body.When offered the opportunity to remake the 1958 B-movie ""The Fly,"" Cronenberg could hardly refuse. The film seemed perfectly in tune with his own trademark obsessions (a scientist is genetically fused with a fly as he is teleporting himself in his new teleportation device, and his mind and bodily lusts and functions are altered drastically). Of course, the reason this stands out from his other, less commercial movies is the fact that the dramatic heart of the movie is concerned with real human emotions and feelings e.g. love, jealousy, despair and wide-eyed wonder. Cronenberg felt he could make his own ""romantic story"" and succeeded in making ""The Fly"" stand out from his other films.The film succeeds spectacularly by combining what makes Cronenberg such a unique and special filmmaker (the film contains a number of gruesome, stomach-churning but stupefyingly intense and powerful moments of gory horror, notably the arm-wrestling sequence and the doughnut scene), with a genuinely touching relationship between the doomed scientist (Jeff Goldblum) and the journalist he hires to record his work (Geena Davis). The film is therefore not just a gross-out Cronenberg classic, but a tragic and moving romantic horror in the Phantom of The Opera/Hunchback of Notre Dame vein.The film is a cascade of powerful intensity, notably Howard Shore's dramatic and epic music, the scenes of horror which are magnificently shot and executed (the maggot-birth nightmare is too sickening for words) while the climax is about as beautiful and powerful as science fiction and horror has ever been, with Brundle the scientist, now in total ruin having failed in attempting to fuse his diseased body with Veronica, the journalist's. He begs Veronica to shoot him, and the devastating final shot of the twisted corpse, Veronica's mutilated ex-boyfriend Stathos Borans (John Getz) and Veronica uncontrollably crying is about as human and heartbreaking as science fiction has ever been.It's brilliant, but without the monumental lead performance of Jeff Goldblum as Brundle, it simply would not have been the same, Goldblum's sublime combinations of wide-eyed optimism, pathos and arrogance creating a vitally sympathetic main character, while Davis is also extremely good as Veronica.In the end, the film, being note perfect Cronenberg, is a note perfect movie, full of style, crushingly brilliant scenes and all the perfect elements, not least the gruesome but astounding make-up.Absolutely flawless.",,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Monster Movie,"A bit of a throwback movie, director David Cronenberg's well known ""The Fly"" has been around awhile, and I finally rewatched it again for review. It had been at least 20 years since I last watched. It runs pretty quickly and at times kinda felt absurd, but Jeff Goldblum really put a stamp on and carried this sci-fi monster flick. You can see the chemistry with the actors Davis and Goldblum,, and he is one of the few actors to make a 6 ft Davis seem shorter. John Getz is along as kind of the bad guy, but not completely. The make-up and creature feature not quite as good as An American Werewold in London but pretty close for the 80s. Give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Powerful menace,"This is an excellent character horror with genuine fear that cleverly scares every part of you. The story is amazing and the character development makes you believe the horror that is befalling their lives. This is not a slasher. This is body shock. The parallels to cancer do hit home and make it difficult to watch. This is probably David Cronenberg's best film. Downside is that the pace isn't suited for modern audiences, it takes too long to deliver on the title which is only a minor gripe. Upside is that it has a fantastic ending delivering the title. Clever, fearful and powerful menace from within.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Science Fiction,"In this movie, when a scientist wants to test their groundbreaking teleportation device, a big life form is used, even though it would have been easier in every way to use a small living thing, like a bug, maybe, or a house fly, but then the result of the test wouldn't have been as impactful to the unprepared audience. This smells like style over substance. Also, in this movie, when a person accidentally gets their hand covered in a substance that dissolves flesh and bone causing intense pain, the person just stands there screaming like mad in a static way, unlike a real person in the real world would have probably done in a scenario like this. One could at least try to shake their hand to get some of that acid off their skin. Style over substance, again? The same goes for the arm wrestling scene, of course. These three things damage the realism of what's happening in the film. But they are moments, and they can be rightfully criticized. They damage the movie, that's clear, but do they ruin it?The obvious answer is no, and not for the most obvious reason. David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" from 1986 works, but what drives it, surprisingly, isn't the package, even though it is ""style over substance"" in a handful of moments. By the way, the style, or the package, holds up decades after the release. The cinematography, the visual effects, the practical effects, the sound design, the music by Howard Shore, all these components are strong. And the story told in the film, even though it sacrifices common sense in a handful of moments, does have a point to make. And again, it's not necessarily about how the movie warns you about the danger of love triangles or anything in that regard, no, there is something else here that creates drama. It's the main character who is a brilliant but lonely and eccentric young scientist. He makes the mistake of rushing things and ends up in unimaginable trouble, and it's how he reacts to the things happening to him, how he won't give up in his search for a way to fix things and stay positive in this horrifying situation, it's his character, what he goes through, how the journey ends and, especially, how the one and only Geoff Goldblum portrays Brundle Seth. That's what makes the story engaging and emotional, and if there is ever yet another remake of ""The Fly"" happening, trying to beat Goldblum's performance is likely to be pointless.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
80's practical horror effects to create a poetic Frankenstein feel,"This is one of my all-time favorite horror and sci-fi films. (I almost mistyped ""sic-fi"". Haha, sick-fi could be a new label for gory scifi!) I've seen the movie many times over the years and it always gives the same chills.The main draw has always been the well constructed and gruesome monster effects that remind me of John Carpenter's The Thing - another 80's remake of a classic film by a well known director. Why aren't remakes anymore this good?) At first I didn't know who David Cronenberg is but when I saw more of his films I got some newly found respect also for The Fly. It might not be the most cronenberg-ish film but it definitely fits to his catalog because it has themes of going insane, something about sexuality and physical body, and of course something gross that is hideous to look at.One thing that has always stuck out to me that the list of important characters is very short. If you took out all the special effects this story could be acted on stage with a couple of people. I remember it used to bother me a bit because to my young mind it felt like low budget. But I can't think of any character that the movie needs more. It's all about the change that happens in Seth and to a lesser extent his girlfriend and her ex-husband. There is no unimportant fluff to be found. No Jar-Jar Binks for comedy relief I'm afraid!The Fly is a horror movie in the first place but it has many sides to it. It pays tribute to old monster movies, it's psychological, and an intelligent sci-fi drama with also a little bit of romance. I like it so muh because it blends all this together and somehow reminds me of the classic tale of Frankenstein.

We're gonna need a bigger fly swatter,"The Fly is gross-meister David Cronenberg's grisly remake of the 1958 original. Genius scientist Jeff Goldblum invents a teleporter; a device to transport matter. He shows it to a reporter, lovely Geena Davis who falls in love with him. Alas, Goldblum tests the device by transporting himself, with horribly disastrous results. Be warned. The Fly is not for children. Not since John Carpenter's The Thing have there been such gruesome effects. The Fly is a well-made movie but certain scenes are hard to watch and the ending is a downer. Goldblum's performance was recognized as Oscar-worthy, and it is, but since it's a horror role its importance was lessened in the eyes of the academy and so he was passed-over. I don't think The Fly is as philosophical a movie as some make it out to be. I think it's a flat out horror film and it succeeds. The Fly creature is well done and the entire film is very unsettling, as you'd expect from Cronenberg.

THE FLY,"""THE FLY"" (1986, Cronenberg) is a great film and probably Cronenberg's best. It hits every nail on the head. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are fabulous. The makeup is incredible. The effects are exceptional. It's a powerful piece of filmmaking that doesn't need me to recommend it. But I do.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Considered one of the great remakes,"The 1980s was known for many things. It cranked up several avenues of which people were not used to. Music became fiercer. Hairstyles became more wild. Clothing became more over the top. Violence seemed more like trend than an event. The movies also experienced similar traits. However, the one thing people tend to remember the 80s film industry for, were the horror films. More specifically the remakes of older ones. While many enjoy an original like The Fly (1958) with Vincent Price, many people cannot deny just how much the 80s remake truly helped define horror. Despite is critical success and the imprint it left, it does have one thing viewers may find obnoxious.Adapted from George Langelaan's short story with writer Charles Edward Pogue and director David Cronenberg, this horror remake has several things going for it. The story is about a scientist who is in the process of completing a breakthrough that could change the future. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) has managed to discover the possibility of matter transportation using uniquely designed teleportation pods. Showing this to his new found journalist friend Veronica (Geena Davis), viewers learn along with her that the process has one flaw - transporting living matter doesn't work. Meanwhile, Veronica's on and off again boss Stathis (John Getz) fiddles between professional and personal flirtations. On the whole, the story is very simple and that's good.The fact that the plot only has three main characters to focus on really helps viewers give them something to care about. The issue with it is that while the internal conflicts are what help drive the plot forward, some of the decisions made by certain characters come off questionable. For example, Veronica gave her apartment key to Stathis, but now she wants him out. For him though, he says he'll hold onto the key for ""old times sake"". That's already a red flag. So what does Veronica do? Nothing. Really? Either change your apartment lock or get that key back! It's strange because during the 1980s maybe people were laxer in their privacy, but nowadays, that kind of crap don't fly. Why take the risk? These kinds of moments don't happen too often though.Despite the point above, the acting is still well performed. John Getz as Stathis shows just how self-centered he really is, even though there are points where he sort of redeems himself. Geena Davis as Veronica is exceptional aside from one of her decisions making no sense. Whether she's happy or horrified, her expressions look very genuine. As for Goldblum, who went from a nobody to very quickly a somebody gives an interesting performance. The reason for calling it an interesting performance is that counter to what you'd think, the progression of Brundle is a mixture of disturbing behavior that comes across awkward and comical at the same time. Perhaps that's just the Goldblum charm.The visuals to this picture are top quality too. The practical effects and gore are pretty much what Cronenberg is well known for as well as for this remake in general. Cinematography was handled by Mark Irwin and it looked good. There are some neat camera tricks used for Brundle's transformation. Irwin would also shoot for Dark Angel (1990), RoboCop 2 (1990) and Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991). Lastly the film score composed by Howard Shore is unique. As a horror film, a fan would expect creepy supernatural themes. Here, Shore provides a much more grounded approach giving the experience a human aspect, which also cranks up the dread. While the motif itself is slow, it is memorable.The one thing viewers may wonder is why some of the main characters don't act on things that require immediate closure. It doesn't happen a lot, but it does seem silly. However, one cannot dismiss the prowess of the crew behind this movie. From the effects, to acting, music and cinematography - it is a remake that has been hailed as one of the best.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Brundle museum of natural history!,"It is a very well-made film where all aspects of film making come together to create the intended effect. Visual effects are stunning, specially makeup. A great horror movie needs a great score and the Fly has a great score portraying the tone of the story perfectly.Jeff Goldblum gives one of the truly quintessential lead performances in his role of Seth Brundle- from his nerdy, awkward beginnings to his horrific demise in the final third. I won't spoil anything for the uninitiated other than to say this is like a superhero movie gone wrong. Instead of becoming selfless and heroic as a result of the splicing incident, he becomes hell-bent on self preservation.The grotesque elements are there but they don't seem thrown in purely for shocks - there is a story resonating beneath the on screen mayhem and at no time does the film become too gross or too predictable. Cronenberg has a definite story to tell us and he weaves his magic to make the film both involving and satisfying. The special effects are extremely good and this isn't a film you should go into if you've got a weak stomach, but it is an enjoyable, horrifying and fascinating trip into what happens when something goes wrong in the lab, very wrong! Highly recommended, especially if you're a fan or even if you haven't seen this film at all.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""...crowning jewel of 80s Sci-Fi horror""","To me, The Fly is the crowning jewel of 80s Sci-Fi horror. The animatronics, the special effects make-up, the acting, the story... It all makes for a great movie. From start to finish, this movie is a masterpiece.What I loved about the movie right off the bat was that it did not mess around. The movie starts in the middle of a conversation between the 2 main characters, and Brundle is explaining exactly what the movie is about. From then on the story just flows brilliantly, with no dilly-dallying. There's no mystery, there's no ambiguity, its just a story about an inventor and his machine.The artistry that went into the make-up, and the Brundle-Fly possibly make this movie stand out as the most realistic looking 80s horror. The Fly didn't need to be shadowed, or ambiguously shot, to hide any flaws.Jeff Goldblum's acting is creepy, and suits the character so well. You really got a feeling of discomfort for Gina Davis's character.One scene that really caught me by surprise was the baboon and the fly. It really baffles me how they were able to film a fly and a baboon together in the same shot, and seem as though they could direct them both with ease.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Metaphor of Technology,"OK, think about it.  You're using the latest advance in technology to transport information right now.  Suppose somebody came up with a technological method tomorrow to transport any amount of matter from one place to another.  Not two dimensional text or photos, but three dimensional objects.  Food, clothing, machinery,even people, transported electronically. No more airlines, trucks, automotive industries, OPEC, Middle East crises, on and on.  Hasn't the aim of technology (since Faraday) been to organize ""essential"" matter?  Starting with manipulable electromagnetic waves to form impulses into telegraphic and then radio waves, technology has sought to shrink distance.  Seth Brundle's (fictional) invention is the logical outcome of this quest.  The joke to this theme is in the title.  The ""fly"" is the proverbial fly in the ointment. The dark side of technology is it's capacity to inflict massive suffering on humanity, in the form of war machinery, totalitarian regimes, and  biomedical disasters.  The author of the original story, ""The Fly"", had a prescient understanding of the runaway obsession with technology we are now caught up in.  How many dotcom commercials have you seen or heard lately?  Get ready, the fly is about to hatch.",,Anonymous,Horror
Completely Gross,"A movie that holds cult status in the horror genre, the Fly has a good underlying plot but is not a pleasant watch by any means. Fans of Jeff Goldblum will enjoy his performance, but future Oscar winner Geena Davis puts in a cringeworthy performance as Goldblum's opposite (her screaming and crying is comical). Acting aside, The Fly is among the most visually disgusting films I have seen, with the gross-out scenes not adding anything to plot and merely to disturb the viewer. Couple that with an extraordinarily slow start and The Fly is a cult film worth avoiding.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A tragic horror film where you truly care about the characters,"The Fly is one of those special films where going into it, you aren't quite sure of what is going to happen in the end. It just kept on keeping me guessing and on top of that, the special effects work was absolutely incredible. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is an intelligent but somewhat eccentric scientist and he meets Veronica (Greena Davis), a journalist for a science magazine at a press event. He takes Veronica back to his lab where he shows his invention, a teleportation device. It uses two different pods that can transfer objects back and forth. Although, Seth has yet to make anything but inanimate objects transport, he wants to be able to do so with humans. Stathis Borans (John Getz) is an editor at the magazine Veronica works at and he is still in love with her from a previous relationship, he is trying to get in the way with Veronica's private work with Seth that she is doing completely on her own.Eventually, things go wrong during his human experimentation and Seth begins to become mutated. He becomes essentially super human but little does he know that it isn't as good as he thinks. Jeff Goldblum gives an amazing performance, at first, he is an eccentric scientist but he completely transforms his performance halfway through into a man with an ego and eventual sad realizations. The special effects work is one of the best parts about the film, with extensive make-up work on Jeff Goldblum later on and things of that nature, it's pretty damn incredible to look at, and it stills holds up very well today. Each time more special effects were used, I just continued to get blown away each time as they continued to impressive throughout the entirety of the film.It isn't just special effects and good performances though, the story is a tragic one. The very last part made the movie for me. In fact, the last 30 minutes itself is incredible as things keep on twisting and turning. The very last minute of the film kept me gripped till the end and leaves you with things to think about as well as an incredibly memorable film. Overall, this is a great science fiction/horror piece that is most definitely worth a watch considering nearly everything in it works.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Be engrossed, be very engrossed","Here was another film I really loved to have seen, cinema wise, but again I was one, two years shy of being admitted. The Fly, with those unforgettable tag line words, is a well formed horror film, with wonderful FX, and some strong doses of gore, here and there, where it doesn't, over exploit it. It takes itself more serious as a fine featured horror, and it beautifully is, with it's wonderfully constructed storyline, and gradual, unrushed build, up in an experiment, gone wrong. Genius inventor, Goldblum who's just dynamite, in still one of his top performances, who while stepping into one of his cool shaped tele, transportation pods, makes the mistake of having unexpected company. A small misfortune on his part, as a fly gets in there with him, where both insect and human form one, where Goldblum begins a deteriorating process, as he slowly begins to resemble more features and characteristics of a fly. It's an absorbing and engrossing study, on the writer's part (this guy, also responsible for the Psycho 3, installment, my favorite) only released 3 months before this. Goldblum sickly spouts some funny lines of dialogue. In the early stages, prefore to Goldblum's changing deformities, in that cafe, with a fast talking over hyped Seth, is the one scene that sticks out. Again, great acting on Goldblum's part. Oscar potential. Geena Davis is really good too as a journalist, and Goldblum's new love, Her publisher and ex (John Getz) a refined, slight sleazeball, steals her thunder.... acting wise too. This is one of those better horror films/or Sci fi horrors, that have been shaped, and crafted into one of the more respective ones. Don't go looking for a lot of gore though. One of 87's early surprises. A dead fly was in my special fried rice, the day of the film's release in Adelaide. Coincidence?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly touching,"I'm not, nor have I ever been, a fan of body horror or gross-out horror; true horror, to me, is the kind that relies on suspense and tension. I make an exception with David Cronenberg; even when he gives in to full-on gore, he does so with his own unique vision and spark.The Fly is not quite an example of that; it's much more commercially oriented, much less personal and original than earlier Cronenberg pieces like Videodrome or Scanners, and it gives in to the gore much more whole-heartedly. It remains, in fact, the most 'standart' horror film of Cronenberg's career.And yet The Fly is still a success on a very different level; character development takes the place of world-building, and so it manages to achieve more emotional connection than any other Cronenberg film made before A History of Violence. Jeff Goldblum delivers a shockingly good performance - maybe the best of his career, and creates one of the most sympathetic, pathetic horror-film monsters in history. The fact that we see him grow into the monster gradually over the course of the film makes it even more gut-wrenching. The Fly is not a Cronenberg classic, but it's definitely a horror classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Creepy gory 80s classic,"The Fly is an 80s gory classic - it tells the story of a scientist who is pushing the bounds of science whilst falling in love with a journalist (Geena Davis).  He accidentally tests out his invention whilst merging himself with the genetics of a household fly.  The fly hits the fan (so to speak) - and his body begins to change... The Fly is a great creepy film - which attempts to delve into genetic ethics while being a ""creature feature"".  It's makeup is truly disgusting - but that makes it all the much better to watch - doesn't it? Jeff Goldblum is perfectly cast as a nervous, socially awkward scientist - and his transformation into a ""super"" creature is just great.  Geena Davis is also excellent as the love interest who gets caught up with all the events in the movie.  John Getz is also great - he makes this an 80's movie as the greedy, self-centred yuppie wanna-be Geena Davis boyfriend... Fun but with morals...",,Anonymous,Horror

Ahead of it's time,"Watched The Fly after I saw a tweet related to 80s horror movie. I then searched wikipedia and I was interested to watch the movie after reading one line summary of the movie. I am glad that I watched this movie. One of the best 80s horror drama movie.The movie had a different story for that time. The execution of the story was also good. There are some flaws and some potholes but the movie is made in such an indulging way that you may keep all the negatives of this movie aside. The acting was good, you kinda connect with the lead actors and even feel bad for them after incident occurs. After incident scenes are creepy and you may feel disturbed. The pacing and editing was spot on.Overall, I will recommend this to everyone, except to those who don't like 80s graphics/ visual effects and those who can't see ugly transformations. For others, it's a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cronenberg's Best,"Perhaps Cronenberg's best film has Jeff Goldblum as a scientist who becomes obsessed with teleporting live, human flesh to another location. Just as it seems like he's going to succeed, a tiny fly get into the teleporter with him and their DNA merges on the other side and he starts to turn into a monster much to the horror of his girlfriend (Geena Davis)Nothing about The Fly should work. The story is silly and, at best, it could possibly end up being a great FX reel for a makeup effects artist. In Cronenberg's hands, The Fly becomes grand tragedy and Goldblum's afflictions could be read as a metaphor for drug addiction, AIDS, cancer, dementia, or anything else that wreaks havoc on the body and mind and forces their loved ones to watch them as they slowly deteriorate and turn into someone unrecognizable. Because of this, The Fly is about as moving as any horror film I've seen and it's anchored by Goldblum and Davis' magnificent performances.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brundlefly,"The Fly taught me a valuable lesson. It is important for someone to see a film to understand what the film is about and not just take things you hear from other people to form an opinion.Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is a very smart and different type of scientist. After meeting a reporter named Veronica (Geena Davis) he shows her his latest invention. Brundle has invented a machine that will teleport inanimate objects into another machine. However Brundle has problems when trying to teleport living objects. After much work he finally is able to teleport a living baboon through and then he himself goes through it apparently suffering no problems. However unknown to him a fly was in the teleporting machine with him and as a result it has fused with him and slowly is turning him into a man fly.The main idea and story of this film is great. It is a great science fiction story, teleporting machine that can also fuse organisms together. But there is a lot of Horror in the film as well. So as far as being a good science fiction and horror film this film is quite effective.Jeff Goldblum is pretty good in this film. I really enjoyed his performances in Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Independence Day. He really plays a good scientist with a little oddness in him in this film. He speaks in a way easy to hear and understand and also has great facial expressions and hand gestures. Also the scenes where he is with Geena Davis were really good and no doubt their real life experiences together help them to have such good chemistry.There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this film. To be honest, I thought this film would be about Jeff Goldblums character turned into a normal fly. However really he starts to turn into a man fly type creature. Very disturbing scenes are in this film. If you are a person weak in the stomach this may not be a good film for you. Brundle has to do a lot of vomiting in his fly form and it really is quite disgusting. But it does a good job of getting the point of the film across to the audience and really gets the mood of the film across as well.A good science fiction and horror film. It is quite disgusting at parts but those parts seem to help the film out. I recommend it to anyone who does not get disgusted easy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is one of the most effective movies of all time not just body horror wise but character wise as well, the movie kinda tricks you thinking it's a love story and for the first half hour it actually is. It's a love triangle and then the the experiment happens fingernails start to come off then it turns to a horror movie and it's when it shines. The whole cast is fantastic no performance goes good to bad it goes from great to amazing. Same with the music it gives me a Sweeney Todd kinda feel when I listen to it and it's a great listen. But i have to give a huge props to the effects team because GOOD LORD. They killed it the effects are amazing it needs to be seen to be believed the puppets used at the end of the movie are fantastic, I just love practical effects and this movie gives people who love practical effects more and more as the film goes on.

"A potentially daft idea becomes a 80s horror must-see, thanks to the wonderful combination of Goldblum, Davis and Cronenburg.","David Cronenberg brings his 'theatre of the grotesque' to this 80's remake of the 50's sci-fi horror classic.Seth is a brilliant scientist who has found a way to harness the power of transportation. When trying to transport himself however, a fly gets stuck in the 'pod' and they are inextricably fused together. Over time the fly part of the fusion begins to take over and a battle ensues between Seth and his new insect mind.This film could've so easily have been reduced to a ridiculous b-movie, yet Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis sell it so well and you genuinely care about their characters.

"""The Fly"" is a very devastating film.","Mentally as well as physically, Brudle undergoes a horrible transformation into a fly and it cannot be stopped. ""The Fly"" is a very devastating film. Powerful enough, but not exactly pleasant to look at. Like only the greatest directors can pull this off, Cronenberg overwhelms the audience with a sublime mixture drama, misery and repulsiveness. You feel as helpless as the characters themselves and you painfully wait for the unhappy ending to come! The screenplay is filled with genuine metaphors and the romance between Goldblum and Davis is beautifully illustrated. The special effects, mainly created by Chris Walas (who went on directing the 1989-sequel) are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards.The performances are just flawless and the film also has emotional which makes this a great Sci-fi horror movie with pure though and disturbing images, this one isn't for weak stomaches but it is a brilliant movie that goes into our deepest fears and mind. A winner all the way.Most of the action takes place in the last third of the picture, but there is a great suspense building up to that point. And the special effects are jaw-dropping - Brundle's hideous transformation is reminiscent of Lynch's 'The Elephant Man'. This film has a reputation for being unnecessarily gory, which is actually not at all true.
I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does, even with very obscure subjects, but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Be Afraid.

In short, this is a great horror movie, one that I would almost go so far as to say is required viewing for horror fans and cinephiles in general.

Brilliantly Gruesome!,"Naked Lunch was the only Cronenberg I've watched before seeing this, and although I can't say that I liked it even a tiny bit; I admired the flashes of creativity I've seen throughout its 115-min run-time of an achingly phlegmatic pacing and self-indulgence. Therefore, I was optimistic that this renowned indie director's bizarre style could work for me someday. This day may has come, or maybe it's just this movie. Either way, all I can say is that I was definitely right!First off, Chris Walas's standout, Oscar-winning makeup effects are just superbly sick! The last transformation is case in point, and I really haven't seen anything more impressive than those effects, aside from the equally brilliant practical effects that were used in Carpenter's The Thing.What's even more awe-inspiring is how well-developed every single character in this movie is. They are constantly developing throughout the film's three acts. And each act adds more layers into them in a most graceful and reasonable way.I want to confess that I have never considered Jeff Goldblum as an excellent actor. I always see him as one of the most charismatic actors, who play the same character in every film he's in, and I'm totally fine with that. That's because his quirky distinctive style of acting almost always pays off terrifically, so much so that his character steals the show every time. That said, the different phases his character go through in this movie prove that Goldblum's appeal isn't the only thing he has. For my surprise, Jeff Goldblum turned out to be a really talented actor who can flesh-out his character, figuratively and literally, masterfully.Geena Davis is quite good as Veronica Quaife, whose character arc and the development of her romantic affair with the protagonist near the end reminded me of Belle in Beauty and the Beast a little bit. I think Stathis Borans is an insufferably cartoonish character during the first act. John Getz is not blame at all, as I think he really did a good job. Fortunately, Stathis is also a pretty strongly-developed character that changed a great deal at the third act, and hence became more credible.I was overwhelmed by different feelings of pity, fear, disgust, and so many others, in the course of the movie's 96-min run-time. However, I think the denouement lacks intensity, since I found the ending predictable, and I saw it coming a bit early.Other than the issues I've mentioned above, this movie really impressed me with all its creativity and originality. Cronenberg is truly a visionary filmmaker, and I hope I enjoy the rest of his filmography.(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Fly opens so suddenly and so efficiently that I'm surprised that not a lot of films have tried to emulate it.,"It's very effective. And this kind of paring down to what is essentially a three character play, evidenced in the excising of several melodramatic and cliche deleted scenes, leaves a lean, clean tragic character based dramatic horror.Goldblum plays easily one of his best roles, a buff, likeable and charming scientist, a refreshing change to the nerd introvert scientist that is quite a widespread accepted sort of prejudiced cliche to this day. Geena Davis is a bit wavy but she has an infectious ease and some real standout punchy believable moments.The emphasis on building character makes for lovely little moments of intimacy; the scene in the market with the jewellery callback where he tells her he loves her is a particularly memorable moment.Cronenberg places his leads in scenes and environments that feel very realistic and believable, the bar, the diner, the Party, it all helps sell the realism inbetween the gonzo parts. Especially the close ups of these well lit characters that sets these interesting people on their stage.The slow transition,the way the fly comes in and Goldblum transforms, is almost a thing of beauty. It's Masterful, this sort of sad, smart homunculus emerges. With rip roaring effects, Cronenberg's typical steady eye and some brilliant music, The Fly is clearly a classic that holds up completely.It's got its share of problems; The accelerated romance between leads is symptomatic of those cut scenes. And we spend way too much time with that smug irredeemable yuppie sex pest for ages.So the economical theatre feel makes the film easy to rewatch but also makes the work feel slight, with no real reason to go reaching for it regularly.

One that perfectly captures the horror of living with somebody falling apart from a terminal illness.AIDS and cancer come to mind for this films allegories. But this film isn't just an allegory. It is a finely constructed story that mixes both horror and romance, with some incredible science fiction.Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis give some of the best performances in any horror film ever made. You can forget that it is them honestly. The script helps, but it is all on them that these characters are as amazing as they are.As a Cronenberg film, we of course get more than a helping of body horror. And this may be the put off for many people. It is horrible to look at. Disgusting, scary and deeply tragic. Chris Walas out does himself with some of film histories best make-up effects. It's so real and strangely grounded, adding to the horror of it all. And I get how many may see this as too sickening and gross to enjoy. It is never gratuitous, only adding to the effectiveness of the story. But it is tough to get through, especially if you are not a fan of blood and gore.If you have a strong stomach you will find something special in The Fly. Even if the film is too much for you, there is no denying it is a finely crafted masterpiece. Around Halloween, pop it on and give it a try. Love it or not, it is a film that will stay with you for all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Terrifying ,Unforgettable Classic From David Cronenberg","The Fly is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable classic that combines fantastic direction,terrific performances,amazing special Make-Up Effects and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Fly one of the finest remakes of all-time that is David Cronenberg at his best.The Fly tells the story of an eccentric scientist Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum)who has made transportation pods that can transfer anyone and anything from one place to another. When Brundle decides to try the pods himself a Fly that is also in the pod is mixed with his DNA and stars to make Seth turn into a fly.By 1986 Director David Cronenberg had already mastered and perfected the Body Horror sub genre thanks to great Horror films such as The Dead Zone(1983),Videodrome(1983),Scanners,The Brood(1979),Shivers(1975)and Rabid(1977) but in 1986 Cronenberg would release his swan song to the Body Horror genre and his most famous and iconic of his Body Horror films with The Fly,a brilliant and unforgettable SCI-FI/Horror film that was co-produced by Mel Brooks film company Brooksflims(yes the Mel Brooks)and was a critical and Box Office success for David Cronenberg but is also one of finest remakes of all-time. While a remake of the 1958 classic of the same name David Cronenberg has also re-imagined the story to suit his style in creating one of the most horrifying,disturbing and disgusting films ever made. From start to finish,The Fly is movie that is truly goes with the definition of psychological terror because this is a movie that is intense,gripping and harms you not just mentally but physically as well with a tale that is dark,grim and is like living a nightmare that just becomes more and more frightening and once the Horror starts it never stops. The Fly is one of those films that is not very easy to watch but it's a movie that will stick with you. While The Fly is a SCI-FI/Horror film it's other things too it's a character study,a love story(in it's own way)and a sad tragedy told in Cronenberg's style with claustrophobia and dread. As I said before The Fly is a character study and it's character study of the main character Seth Brundle and his downfall. When we see Seth in the early part of the film we see that he's eccentric and weird,but a decent guy. But when he goes into the transportation pod and comes out with the fly he becomes a different person and we see him in the rest of the film transforming into a monster. One of the scariest things about the movie is that each time we come back to Brundle we see him looking worse and worse as he's becoming this creature(Brundlefly) while his body is falling apart and pretty much losing his mind. Brundle's transformation from human to fly is a tr frightening look at madness,fear and how a science experiment can go completely wrong. One of the things I have to warn people about is the blood and gore. The blood and gore in The Fly is some of the ugliest,gross and gruesome ever shown on screen and is truly not for the weak at heart or for weak stomachs. I mean I have seen many Horror films where I am used to Blood and gore but there is something about the blood and gore in The Fly that is unsettling and make the movie more bleak than it already was will make viewers vomit with agony. The blood and gore adds to the film and gives the movie an extra edge and darkness that hangs over The Fly. The ending of The Fly is amazing and unforgettable with fright,terror and surprises. A terrific conclusion.The cast is great. Jeff Goldblum is excellent and at his best as Seth Brundle,with Goldblum being intense and gripping. Geena Davis is wonderful as Veronica,a journalist and Seth's love interest with Davis having great chemistry with Goldblum. John Getz is fantastic as Stahis,Veronica's ex-boyfriend. Joy Boushel is great and sexy as Tawny,a girl Seth meets. Also,lookout for a cameo by director David Cronenberg as a Gyneocolgist.The direction by David Cronenberg is amazing,with Cronenberg bringing a dark and gloomy atmosphere with great angles and shots. Fantastic direction,Cronenberg.The score by Howard Shore is outstanding,with Shore's score being scary,epic and intense. Great Score,Shore.The Academy Award winning Special and Practical Make-up Effects Chris Walas Inc. is impressive and some of the best and most horrifying Effects ever caught on film. Fantastic Special Make-up Effects.In final word,if you love David Cronenberg,Jeff Goldblum,Horror or SCI-FI,I highly suggest you see The Fly,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable Hrror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Jeff Goldbloom was perfect casting allow ""The Fly"" to... oh, never mind... just watch it!","The pursuit of machines imitating flesh. More pointedly, I'd say, of the intangible need that mankind has for the human element of being. When we're sick, we don't want to be seen at our weakest, but our need for compassion, camaraderie and flesh overcome our egos and shows our humanity. ""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly. Perhaps, she'll die."" Jeff Goldblum was the perfect actor to combine this human element of the film with the David Cronenberg box office draw of science fiction special effects that on it's own makes for an interesting and very creepy experience. How many times can a female lead in this genre look frightened, revolted, curious and yet still rather fetching? Here, at least one more time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"David Cronenberg crafts an incredibly gory, but ultimately effective science-fiction horror that works as a gut-punching scarefest","David Cronenberg boasts a few top-notch tricks under his sleeve to pull off a reimagining of the 1958 original of the same name. For a director with an appealing pastiche of gruesome practical effects and ringing in an effectively grim atmosphere, Cronenberg crafts an astonishing rendition of a man who's human identity is slowly faded away by a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong. The Fly is not your standard horror picture boiled with vicious desires tingle with audiences' stomach with over-the-top gore and repulsiveness, it is one that carries a surprisingly gripping edge and journeys into an emotional territory that most horrors films hesitate to venture in. As disturbing and grotesque as it can get, it rarely pokes you with the feeling that Cronenberg believes that can filling the screen with stomach-turning gore is the only tool to leave you squirming in your seats. Of course, that is not to say it is a good idea to have lunch before sitting through this. This film places its focuses on eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (played by Jeff Goldblum) who hopes to revolutionize technology of his new teleportation machine, which he uses to grab the attention of a cute journalist Vanessa (played by Geena Davis). Determined to take his research one step further, Seth conducts an experiment where he steps into one of teleportation pods, unaware that a house fly has managed sneak into the other. Coming out the pod, Seth experiences bizarre and unsettling changes to his body as the fusion between him and the fly causes him to slowly morph into a hideous human-fly hybrid creature.David Cronenberg embraces his trademark grandeur of gruesome practical effects reminiscent to his previous works, and combines it with sharp precision of storytelling to conduct a brutally bleak horror tale that works in the fashion of a gripping human tragedy. Lead character Seth Brundle has met the love of his life and hopes to impress her with his outlandish research, but all goes wrong when a simple task leaves his man peeling away from the very identity that defines him. And if you think there is no room for an emotional human touch, think again, because Cronenberg places it at the heart of this bodily transformation plot. The story progresses with a menacing tone as the lead character watches as his body steadily deforms into a hideous figure complete with gritty-looking make-up and prosthetics while losing his limbs including his ears, and a sense of dread crowds the atmosphere as Seth sees his relationship with Vanessa deteriorating at the hands of his ugly bodily transformation that makes the Toxic Avenger look like a snuggle doll. And that is just part of how Cronenberg effectively breaths humanity into both Seth and Vanessa. It is an effective alternative element to the more common route of the monstrous villain hunting down victims and picking them of one by one. And this picture would not have worked as strongly without the performance by Jeff Goldblum who poses a convincing a normal human man morphing into less and less of a human. As for Geena Davis, there is no problem with giving her credit.The Fly is a gripping science-fiction horror picture bound with an astonishing human touch that renders the film drifting from your average horror movie conventions. Thanks to David Cronenberg, it works in more ways than what one might expect from an 80s gorefest. One thing is for sure though, it is definitely not for the faint of heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome,"What's not to love here? The story is concise enough for the movie to feel like a breeze, but provoking enough to get anyone talking about the themes underneath that aren't shoved down your throat. It has Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis as their very best. And best of all it has just the right amount of gore and unsettling creature effects that made Cronenberg a household name. This is a legendary horror movie, and evidence of a remake done right.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Well Done,"Incredibly entertaining, well performed, and very intriguing, Cronenberg's The Fly remake provides for an excellent adaptation of the source material and proves to be one of my favorite remakes and creature flicks of all time. Jeff Goldblum provides a terrific performance as Seth Brundle, and goes all in on his character in the most terrific way. I could not picture anyone better in the role than Goldblum, and I find his transformative performance rather inspiring. Geena Davis also provides a good supporting performance, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. The film is very 80's looking and feels rather standard in terms of cinematography, but is very well done in terms of makeup and special effects, and I enjoyed the realistic appearance of it all rather than relying on CGI like most films do now, or stop motion like most films did back then. The film is very well paced, and can feel a little formulaic at times, but provides for an interesting time at the movies and a very fun ride as well.

Gross goodness,"Only Cronenberg could remake the great B-movie original with as much humor as he does terror. The visual effects and makeup in the body horror is undeniable and supremely disgusting, but the way Goldblum's Brundle handles his transformation is dryly and unnervingly funny. Goldblum and Davis are both so great, and the way the movie peals away thematic layers of purity and sex and procreation goes far beyond the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Finally, a good remake!","When I hear the word remake in the same sentence as a beloved movie, I am hesitant to watch it. But this is the rare exception in which the remake equals if not exceeds the original. The movie revolves around Veronica Quaife, who is a reporter trying to interview the scientist Seth Brundle who is attempting to create teleportation devices. In the beginning he tests baboons to see if it works. Let's just say the first experiment was a grisly result. Once he finally gets it to work, he transports himself, not knowing that a fly was in the teleportation device with him. As a result he starts to mutate into a fly like creature. The idea of the film at first sounds cheesy and laughable and something that would be a sci-fi channel movie. But what they do well is bring the plot to life. They focus on detail of the makeup and gore. Teeth fall out, limbs detach, he throws up enzymes. The film is grotesque but it is a rare cross between a bloodfest and a love story. The film is well scripted and it is possibly the best remake of all time. The film did not have high expectations, but Cronenberg made it work.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Classic,"If your a horror fan it's impossible to miss this movie, every horror director should watch and re watch this movie, to me besides the amazing makeup effects it's the human emotions in it, you can see it as a love one going threw a disease it heartbreaking to watch specially with Goldbloom and Davis chemistry.That is what makes this movie so haunting it's how human it is, you feel bad for Goldbloom as he slowly deteriorates into a monster as he looses touch with humanity and the fly starts to take over him and Davis knows she can't do anything about it.I highly recommend this movie is a emotional ride from start to finish and the special effects are a plus and believe me after watching this movie you will want for practical effects to come back.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rewatching after it terrified me as a kid.,"I watched this as a kid. It terrified me. I've avoided rewatching it for years, but the time has come to try watching it with a critical eye... if I can bear to watch. I'm a Cronenberg fan, but this I think has to be his most slimy film. That I can think of at least. It's an oddly simple sci-fi monster movie. The wonderful Jeff Goldblum is Seth Brundle. A mad scientist experimenting with teleportation. Well he's actually done with the experimentation. His telepods are operational. As he proves to reporter, Veronica (Geena Davies) by teleporting her nylon stockings. It's Seth's first mistake, but also the catalyst for him to push further. He wants to perfect teleporting people. Goldblum is that rare thing, an actor finding a part he's truly born to play. Despite the fantasy, he's utterly convincing. This is a good thing, I need his brilliance to distract me from the gore. This is a visual assault from the get go, even before we get into the meat of it. There's not much fluff here either. Reimagined today this would run over two hours and be a bloated mess, but Cronenberg keeps it lean. Seth may be a little reckless, but his world is as much art as its science. He's more poetic and romantic than nerdy, a nice guy. He doesn't really deserve what's to come, but this is what happens when you drink bubbly with a baboon. What's to come of course is some self experimentation gone wrong. I don't think it's a spoiler to divulge that Seth wasn't alone in the telepod on his first test trip. He had the company of a little house fly, that the new Seth is fused with. What follows is what makes The Fly both iconic and disgustingly terrifying. As we descend into the depths of body horror that still looks shocking nearly 40 years on. Seth at first thinks he's superhuman... but he's about to proven horribly wrong. Trapped in his industrial warehouse apartment. Growing hairs, losing fingernails. Seth comes to realise his mistake, but after the initial shock and despite his grotesque new look, his human character prevails. Enough so that he knows his destiny, dark as it may be. It's still terrifying, but I think even on that first watch I understood that this was much more than just the horror. Still I might need to watch some nice cat videos before going to bed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Masterly modernization of Frankenstein's monster,"This is David Cronenberg's defining movie. A reinterpretation of a trashy 50's flick, ""The Fly"" is one of the best and most original remakes of all time. There's just not a single flaw to be found here. From the get go, the director doesn't waste a minute and takes us right into the story.It's amazing to realize that ""The Fly"" is set up like a play with mostly just three people interacting. The cast does a terrific job. A story like this one could easily have bordered on the unintentionally funny, but thankfully scientific explanations are avoided for the most part and the dialog is as solid as the deliverance by the actors.One of the movie's main strengths is that underneath the horror this is really a drama. Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is an appropriate modernization of Frankenstein's monster (only this time Frankenstein and the monster are one and the same thing). Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is transformed into something horrible, but we feel for him, even though we fear him. Cronenberg leads you down a spiral of decay that can't be reversed. You're afraid to see what's coming next, but you can't look away, either. At the end you will be shocked as much as you will be saddened by the shocking fate of the protagonists.""The Fly"" features some typical Cronenberg elements, such as talk about ""the liberation of the flesh"" and lots of graphic body horror. The special effects are awesome. Along with ""The Thing"" and ""An American Werewolf In London"" this movie has the best F/X of any 80's movie (and it is still light years ahead of all the CGI-nonsense that filmmakers rely on these days).While many of Cronenberg's other movies may seem aloof at times and/or move too slowly, this one gets it completely right. Except for a few shots were Jeff Goldblum's body suit doesn't look a 100% convincing, there's not a single flaw to be found in the whole movie, making ""The Fly"" a classic that hasn't lost any of its original impact.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly, perhaps she'll die.""","I think David Cronenberg was in his highest form at the time that this film was released coming after VIDEODROME and THE DEAD ZONE. Jeff Goldblum (who is truly spectacular in this role and should have at least received an Oscar nomination) plays an awkward, but brilliant scientist named Seth Brundle. He has created telepods that will transport an object from one to the other. Geena Davis (who is great as well) plays journalist Veronica Quaife who is given the story by Brundle himself. In turn though, she starts to fall in love with the super-quirky scientist. One night though (after some drinking) Brundle jumps into a telepod to transport himself. An ordinary housefly though flies into the same telepod and that's when the fun starts.Plays out wonderfully as there is no introduction to character or set up of story, you are just thrown right into the mix meeting both Brundle and Ronnie (or Vernoica) at the same time. The only other main character is John Getz who plays Stathis Borans the editor of the magazine that Veronica is working for. Getz is quite good playing a self-centred sleazebag. Also has a nice strong score by Howard Shore that meshes great with the film.I think this really is a great film that works with very few main characters. It works on the acting, great story (writing credits go to Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg), Oscar winning effects (Chris Walas and Stephen Dupuis) and just wonderful direction from Cronenberg.Maybe not for all tastes. Remember this is a Cronenberg horror film, so there is some gore. But think of it as a tragic love story with strong elements of horror and science fiction. If that does sound interesting to you this will likely be a film to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Takes horror to a new level.,"A remake of the 1958 sci-fi epic The Fly, scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) attempts to woo investigative journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) by showing her his latest research of matter transportation involving living creatures. But, a fly enters one of the transmission booths when Brundle attempts to transport himself and finds himself being transformed into a gigantic fly.This is a piece of serious, solemn and creepy sci-fi picture, giving you the chills as you see poor Seth slowly transform into a fly as Veronica watches helplessly. The acting is on-the-spot that matches the serious mood of the film.There are plenty of scenes to creep you out (who wouldn't be seeing a fly in human form), with some gore and graphic elements to make you cover your eyes several times. But, the sci-fi action is supported by the terrific on-screen drama of the plot (with a nice suspense built-up) and acting, providing you with an epic sci-drama that is perfect for a scare or two.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still entertaining,"A cool story, fine performance from Jeff Goldblum, and wonderfully grotesque moments make this film still enjoyable. It struck me that it would have been much better if it had left what happened in that teleporter accident a mystery for us to gradually understand, even though that would also have required a title change and secrecy in the project and its previews. Whether you believe that or not, I think most would agree that the story with the lover (Geena Davis) and her ex-boyfriend/boss (John Getz) is a tad clunky, and it's very unfortunate that the creep-o turns into the hero. Despite the problems, the transformation which takes place is horrifying (and that baby scene too!), so the film delivers and then some in that department. It may be unfair to compare it to the original from 1958, but to me this one is much more entertaining, and at 96 minutes, it's also just the right length.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This film is a buzzzzzzz,"A frightening romantic horror movie. It is very strange since Cronenberg is the master of this kind of stuff that he never made his version of Kafka's Metamorphosis. The fly is so raw that I wondered as I was watching it if I would have appreciated it as much if I was just flicking through some channels and came across it or if its simply my trust in Cronenberg which once I followed it through, I realized how truly amazing this film is. Goldblum is perfect for the part of the nutty scientist with a David Copperfield aura round him Dr Seth Brundle and he does have the characteristics of a fly. he plays the part convincingly, except for the fact that we never see him feast on a big piece of dung or manure. I love Cronenberg's obsession with toying around with the flesh to replace it with something new that always turns out to be most terrifying.

"""Be afraid...be very afraid.""","1958's The Fly is a seminal B-movie sci-fi classic, thanks to its sublime storytelling and its iconic ""Help meeeee!"" scene. David Cronenberg's remake, however, goes a step further and taps into all the unused potential of this classic story. This version of The Fly is grosser, gnarlier, more extreme, more schlocky type of B-movie, but still with diligent attention to story and character.Among the film's highlights, this version of The Fly handles the teleportation concepts in a more earnest manner, to actually show what could happen when different matter collides. The results are often freaky and bloody. Most of the film focuses on Seth Brundle literally falling apart after his body merges with that of a fly, and the film explores the implications in full. The man adopts the various properties of a common fly, even to the extent of spewing digestive acid. It makes for a genuinely sickening and emotionally hard-hitting experience to watch this guy morph into something other than human.The plot is pretty straightforward (much in contrast to the original film, which hinged greatly on its twisty structure). It does have a cast of endearing characters, who show some genuinely good emotional range and are easy to like. What really matters, however, are the themes, which focus on power-hunger and corruption, effectively manifested as physical decay. It's a bit like the portrait of Dorian Gray, only instead of a portrait, it's the man's flesh. And if there's anything that Cronenberg does best, it's in showing just how scary and gross it is for the human flesh to contort and fall apart into something non-human. The Fly echoes a lot of the same themes and grotesqueness as movies like Videodrome, and it is awesome that way.This film uses decent photography and editing. Jeff Goldblum is a great joy to watch in this film, as is Geena Davis, and the rest of the cast is not bad either. Writing is pretty decent. This production uses pretty good-looking sets, props, costumes, and some very wicked make-up effects. Music is pretty good too.If you can stomach it, The Fly is one wicked exploration on the terrors of teleportation mutating the human flesh. Although the original is a classic worth seeing, I do prefer this remake a little more, for all its frightful implications.4.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Fly (1986) 30 years later...,"Recently I decided to watch 'The Fly' again since a long time and I experienced it from e fresh point of view.It is the only horror remake ever to be way better than the original version. I do know that 'The Thing' by John Carpenter is a great one too, but that one is not based on the original movie, but another interpretation of the same book on which the earlier movie was also based.'The Fly' still is an artistic masterpiece. Many of the effects have survived the test of time and of course every review on the internet describes this remake as way better than the earlier movie.When it came out in 1986, many viewers considered it as a cultural metaphor for AIDS, while David Cronenberg never thought of it that way. Cronenberg's view was that it is a metaphor for illness in general and also the process of aging, like midlife crisis.Watching it today and being a nurse in psychiatric fields, makes me interpretate it as a metaphor also for psychiatric conditions, like bipolar disorders or something likewise.Over here in Holland, Dutch actor Anthonie Kamerling was bipolar and he committed suicide. Having been depressed for a long period of time, he was energetic to the max, day and night, just before he killed himself.Manical people don't consider themselves as ill. They're feeling great, life is one big party time. Their families and environment do know something's wrong with them by intuition, but they can't put a finger on it. Anthonie's wife Isa Hoes, also a Dutch actress, wrote a book about him and she described how Anthony was way more powerful with words than she is.'The Fly' tells us a story with same elements within the process of Seth Brundle. After his teleportation, he starts to change in behavior and this proceeds until he starts to see something is wrong with him. By then, it already is too late for him and his breakdown and degeneration as a human being has already become unstoppable. That of course is put in the story for dramatic purposes and it shouldn't be taken as a truthful standard process in illness in general. In reality, much can be done to treat the diseases that I've mentioned and to stabilize them or control them, even though bipolar disorder is not without risk.'The Fly' is a great horror movie that survives the test of time and will never know another remake better then this one...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Film,"This remake of the 1950's 'B' Movie horror classic concentrates on the character's and the science fiction storyline way more then the horror and it is a great film because of this.Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant scientist who is working on a machine that can teleport matter across space, and he invites a young female journalist (Geena Davis) to document the final stages as he tries to perfect it so it can transport living tissue.When he accidentally mixes his own DNA with that of a fly he begins to mutate into something far more vile and disgusting then your average house fly.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"both chilling and strangely intimate, amazing make-up effects, but the depth of a very good play","Here is something of an unlikely, yet very likely, pairing: David Cronenberg and a big studio budget sci-fi remake. His take on the Fly, which was originally a film featuring a man with his body human and his head a fly, is stark as hell, with one of the bleakest endings in any movie of the 80s. Cronenberg is also working at one of his driving thematic forces as a filmmaker, though not as something that feels forced, per-say, which is the two sides to things, to people, to relationships, and to what science can provide in new breakthroughs. We're given the character of Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), who is a shy but massively accomplished scientist who's come upon the breakthrough of a lifetime- teleportation of matter from one spot to another. But a moment of relapse in his emotional state, of vulnerability to his feelings for a woman he gets close to (Geena Davis's Veronica), send him to go for the experiment himself, not noticing the little creature that's going along for the ride with him. It's a gradual change, but one that is not in the physical sense; we're not getting a man with a body of a man and the head of a fly, but a man who we're seeing in a slightly ""altered"" Kafka perspective. Instead of the man waking up to discover he's already been transformed, we're with him as he goes through a grotesque change, all the more-so because unlike in Kafka's tale he's very smart and can speak his emotions throughout the story, but at the same time it's the tragic unraveling of humanity.For Cronenberg, this makes up the crazy dilemma of Brundle, who is truly half human and half insect, and it provides for him little moments of the macabre comedy he's famous for (watch as he exercises, or tears a guy's wrist off when in an hand match), while keeping strong to the darker implications of a story this implicit. It's a tale that starts out in romance as much as in science, with two characters we immediately care about because they're not simple cardboard genre movie cut-outs. They have their consciences, but for Brundle it gets turned up-side down by a force that is essentially instinctual. For an actor like Goldlum, it's not exactly a walk in the park to go from straight-laced (if eccentric) scientist to a half irritable and half deformed bugman. He's daring to go for the physicality straight-on, but to not make it terribly over the top, and it's a fine line to walk that isn't crossed. This is important considering for the last section he is, of course, totally disguised by lots of wretched (but excellently executed) make-up FX. There's not much to be bugged about, no pun intended, by the director or actors in how they approach tricky material.Actually, what makes the Fly hold up isn't just its horror show aspect. Like John Carpenter's the Thing, we're given an atmosphere of true terror, but less for the simple facet of ""ooh, there's something around the bend about to get us"", but about human beings not being able to have trust in one another. Yet Cronenberg is even more operatic than that with his horror: the final scenes are very graphic (make sure you don't have a fly buzzing around the room!), but in still keeping the events on the horror for the characters. The ideas, as with many of the greatest horror films, are paramount, giving rise to everything else that is fun, and quite sad, in dealing with the unimaginable.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kafka meets Lovecraft -- one of the best!,"If you want to see only one David Cronenberg film, this may be the one. It is simply the most accessible and entertaining of his movies, while adding that little extra to the standard horror flick, making it a deeply disturbing treat. It has good acting, outstanding special effects and score, and that hallmark David Cronenberg fear-your-own-body theme.The theme can be summarized as a tale of bodily mutations, as a scientists gets fly DNA mixed into his own. It's like Kafka had met Lovecraft for a beer.But one watch out for the severely cut version: Stay away if it's 91 minutes long! The gruesome ending is cut into dadaism in this version, which sadly is the most common on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bravery is the name of the movie's sixshooter!..,"The movie is a classical Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde story. Movie tells us that from a clear and locally original way. Director's bravery must be acclaimed. He shows us everything that what was happened out there. Ugliness,loathsomeness etc. director is doing those clearly and daring. Acting is so powerful. Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum have made a great couple. Especially Jeff Goldblum as Brundle is breathtaking. His eyes rolling really inspired us a fly's hyperactivity. Another point about the movie is to become so sentimental. Our apathy to Brundle's vanishing is making the movie so sensitive. He is dying day by day and we can't do anything about his falling. Only way to make Brundle alive is to have his child from Veronica. It is the only chance to make him alive but we are unsure about the baby and this point is becoming the movie's mystery...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cronenberg is masterfully happy at work here, establishing his fetishes and gorey effects to disgusting delight.","""The Fly"" finds director, Cronenberg, happily at work inserting his gorey and twisted fetishes to support the story rather than carry it as some of his other failed films have demonstrated. His constant fetish with the flesh was first explored with Scanners, and then later with Videodrome, but with The Fly, Cronenberg has a story, a motive, and a clear conviction doesn't get lost in his own surrealism or artfulness. Jeff Goldbloom deserves credit for his performance; he is believable and even likable all the way through and his romantic moments with Geena Davis are curiously entertaining. Most will remember this film as a cult classic from the '80's, but more experienced film watchers will recognize this as David Cronenberg's finest hour.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the very few GOOD remakes.  Awesome movie.,"Sci-Fi horror at its best. I liked this movie a lot. I give bad reviews to most horror movies because I have high standards and I'm picky...

That's what a remake should be! The plot and character development were impressive. This is NOT a dumb slasher film (although is has more than its share of gore).The acting is good, story is good, the gore and effects are disgusting (in a good way). AND the end was good too.

Cronenberg at his best,"This is one of the best horror movies ever made.  It combines some truly gut-wrenching violence with a touching story of lost love.  Jeff Goldblum gives an excellent performance, moving from amusing to bizarre to out-right terrifying. Geena Davis is also good as his lover; the two display great chemistry with each other, possibly because they were getting married at the time.  It's a pity they broke up; they worked well together.  John Getz is good as Davis's ex-boyfriend; unfortunately, few directors have ever made use of him.This is one of David Cronenberg's best films.  It combines his excellent use of special effects with his talent for extremely odd, engrossing stories. It apparently took him three years to make this film after completing Videodrome. It was well-worth the effort.  It illustrates his transition from a producer of gory horror movies to a director of intellectually challenging freak shows such as Dead Ringers and Naked Lunch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Dreamt I Was A Man Who Saw The Fly And Now I Am Awake,"David Cronenberg's The Fly has always been the scariest film I have never seen. As a child hearing the film's very premise opened my Pandora's Box of dark imagination and I was immediately attacked with a barrage of horrific images of giant human-fly hybrids and body mutation scenarios that seeped deep into my subconscious. Whenever I would hear an adult talking about how scary the movie was, the images would swarm me once again.Five years ago I bought the DVD on a dare. Having checked that the fly makeup effects have aged enough from sneakily peeking at the film's production stills on IMDB, it was only until recently, I have finally built up enough horror movie tolerance to attempt watching The Fly.Having seen the film now, without being hyperbolic, I could say The Fly is a masterpiece and David Cronenberg's best film that I have seen in his catalogue.The special effects makeup, which notably won an Oscar in its day is well done. The early stages of the transformation, like the little scabs and protruding wire-like hairs, were the creepiest parts and just invokes your imagination.The latter stages of Brundlefly, where it looks like they unloaded a cement truck full of plaster onto Jeff Goldblum, have aged. The creature in final form does look surreal at times and from reading the production notes, it seemed the crew was on a tight wire act of keeping the film watchable.Having read about the infamous deleted scene with the cat-monkey hybrid, this is one of those rare cases where the director was allowed to go too far and was able to to reign it in for the finished film. You don't where the edge is until you've crossed it. I am glad they did.Although I could understand the grotesqueries are still going too much for some, David Cronenberg does hit that perfect sweet spot between showing me something I don't want to see (but secretly want to) and grossing me out to the point of me turning off the film.The ironic thing was, while conceptually horrific throughout, watching the film was not an intensely scary viewing experience. IT was viscerally more frightening by comparison. Perhaps I was already all scared out because I have spent so much time imagining how horrific the film would be. It was actually how David Cronenberg focused on the human story between the two leads.I was particularly invested in the Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis love story, which is the big beating heart at the center of the piece. The story starts with a meet cute at a party, eccentric scientist Seth Brundle invites journalist Ronnie to his apartment to show him his telepods and their relationship begins and blossoms. That intimacy is maintained throughout, only covering a total of 3 major characters if you don't count the Fly itself.When the experiment goes wrong and Seth begins his metamorphosis, it is truly heartbreaking to see two likable people that have a good thing going on get ripped apart by an undeserved misfortune. Geena Davis is convincing in showing how Ronnie's increasingly torturing affection for Seth as things worsen and have become insurmountably dangerous.Jeff Goldblum gives a rich textured performance as Seth Brundle. I love that an actor with such a dynamic persona was chosen for the lead because Goldblum inserts a lot of his own quirks and nuances into Seth Brundle and it's fascinating to see that deteriorate as he starts losing pieces of himself.My favorite part of the entire film is when Seth Brundle starts accepting the fact that he's about to turn into a giant man-fly and starts philosophizing in a Jeff Goldblum type way. It's sad and even loaded with some gallows humor that Jeff Goldblum delivers perfectly. I don't know how another actor would have read these lines. Brundle monologues about being the first human-fly politician and how about he's an insect who dreamt he was a man and is now awake is all rich and tragic on a Shakespearean level.The Fly was worth the 20-year wait. It transcends from being just a horror film and but is also a great love story. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This was like the comic storyline of Peter Parker getting the spider DNA but turning into a man spider and not Spider-Man. It was a great tragic horror. It took a while to get to the main event but building on Goldblums character made it a more tragic tale to watch unfold and Goldblum is amazing, he gives a really great performance. The makeup and effects in the film are phenomenal too, they hold up really well, even gross at times with how crazy and real it looks. Watching the descent of this great intelligent man who is in love get his life ruined by a tiny mistake is wild. Really is a tragedy and the ending too is quite the same and shocking. Also the soundtrack for the film is a masterpiece, the music sounds so good! Overall this was an absolute gem and I'm so glad I got to see this masterful film unfold on the big screen.

A great horror film.,"The Fly is an immensely superior horror film, it is paced perfectly and executed by the lead players effectively.Jeff Goldblum is outstanding as Seth Brundle, an eccentric scientist who believes he's created an invention that will change the world; teleporters, which can transport inanimate objects from one place to another.However, when Brundle tries to pass through himself he hasn't bargained on a fly finding its way into the teleporter with him. The horror begins!What follows is terrific, unconventional horror fare, although admittedly its horrors get a little too nasty towards the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Good Remake,"Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of creating a teleportation device that could revolutionize the world.  It can transport inorganic objects perfectly but there is one major setback: it can't transport living matter.  He first tries a baboon as the first living specimen and the results are horrific.  Just when Seth thinks he has all of the bugs worked out, he tries it on himself.  Seth comes out of the chamber apparently unaffected by the experiment.  Then Seth begins to notice a change.  He first finds himself performing acrobatic stunts that he thought he could never be able to do as a normal person.  Next his girlfriend Veronica(Geena Davis) begins to notice a disturbing change in his behavior.  Then Veronica discovers the strange hairs growing on Seth's back.  Veronica, horrified, takes the hairs to a doctor and finds that the hairs growing on Seth's back weren't human, but were in fact, insect hairs.  Seth, shrugging off Veronica's pleas that he see a doctor, decides to review the process as it happened.  He then makes a horrifying discovery, his genetic make up had been accidentally spliced with that of a house fly that flew into the chamber shortly before he teleported and then begins Seth's transformation.David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the 1958 film of the same name, is a completely different film from the original.  For instance, in The Fly(1958), a man just has the head of a fly on a human body.  In the remake, a man and a fly become one being and the end results are terrifying.  The Fly is a total gross-out of a movie.  The horrific, Oscar-winning special effects truly are what I describe them as: horrific.  I won't ever forget the arm wrestling match, or the nightmare sequence, or the ending transformation scene.  I'll admit that I used to be scared to watch this movie, but I'm not anymore.  My mom sort of hates this movie because of the way that it shows how flies ""eat"" their food.The Fly is still a great movie.

"One of the great ""horror"" films","Most remakes are simply not the match of the originals that they have pulled their inspiration from.  Usually, they are rather shallow, poor copies of their greater source material, and very few remakes find themselves the film that is better remembered.  Recent examples of this phenomenon are films such as Planet of the Apes, a truly classic film from 1968 that was remade in 2001 with most of what made the original a special event missing. There are, as with anything, exceptions, and one of the greatest, in my opinion, is the 1986 remake of The Fly.  While I have not seen the original film, I cannot believe for an instant that it is the better of the 1986 version, one of the great overlooked films of the 1980's.The original was based on a short story by French author George Langellan and is most well known for it's famous ending where a child finds a fly in the backyard of a house with a man's head on it, about to be attacked by a spider, as well as the flip side featuring a man with a giant fly head wandering around a lab.  It also starred famous Roger Corman player Vincent Price, the most notable name associated with the film.  While many people looked on this film with fond memories, it is also not really viewed as a true ""classic"" and that is why in the mid-'80s producer Stuart Cornfeld and screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue hatched a plan to remake the film for modern audiences.  With financial backing from Mel Brooks (a rather unlikely suitor) the team of Cornfeld and Pogue attracted director David Cronenberg to the film.  Cronenberg, a Canadian native who had made several unusual low-budget horror films since the 1970s, had created his own minor subgenre of horror that became known as ""venereal horror"" for it's often sexual nature.  The Fly, while much more mainstream than his previous projects to date, would fit his mindset perfectly, and lead to the birth of a veritable masterpiece.The film centers on Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) a scientist who has devoted his life and brilliance to developing teleportation.  He suffers from motion sickness, so his desire to do away with any standard mobile form of transportation makes sense.  While attending a press gathering held by his financial sponsor, Brundle meets and falls for science magazine journalist Veronica ""Ronnie"" Quaife (Geena Davis).  She is late of a relationship with the editor of the science magazine Particle, Stathis Borans (John Getz), and is intrigued and attracted to the rather naive, yet charming and charismatic scientist.  They begin a relationship and she begins documenting his development of the teleportation devices (which Brundle dubs ""telepods"") for a book to be published after the telepods are complete and fully functional. Brundle is dogged by a rather severe set of drawbacks in the development of the telepods when it comes to transporting living creatures, leading to an early scene where a baboon is teleported and arrives in the sister telepod inside out.  Brundle eventually licks the problem and successfully teleports another baboon.  However, coinciding with the completion of the telepods, Ronnie must deal with Borans who is using her relationship with Brundle to try and get her to commit to writing his story for him, as well as trying to not get her to leave his life.  In a jealous panic when Ronnie goes to see Borans, Brundle decides to test the telepod on himself, while unwittingly sharing the telepod with a normal housefly.  Initially, the teleportation is a success.  However, shortly thereafter, Brundle begins to show changes. He is physically stronger than he previously was, with an increased sexual drive as well.  This is also accompanied by a strong temper and rather displeasing personality at times.  Physically he begins showing some rather strange symptoms as well, such as strong acne and tough hairs growing out of different parts of his body.  Ronnie challenges him on these points, but Brundle just dismisses them, saying she is jealous of his new physical perfection, and he separates from her.  But when his fingernails begin falling out and he finds that to eat, he must regurgitate a strange soupy substance on his food first, even Brundle cannot ignore the reality of what has happened.  He discovers the truth of the event and tries to get Ronnie to help him, but she finds that she cannot continue to support him in the midst of the wild physical and emotional changes he is going through.The Fly received a lot of press for it's at times gruesome imagery, and I can't deny that it isn't the easiest film to sit through if you have a weak constitution.  But, that does not make the film not worth seeing.  While on the surface The Fly is categorized as a ""horror"" film, the film cannot be easily and simply classified in that genre.  The film is in fact a strong love story and character study of Seth Brundle.  The film's heart is with the two people at the center.  Goldblum is near perfect as the scientist who knows how to assemble complex machinery and develop brilliant formulas for teleportation, but has a hard time expressing his feelings for Ronnie. It's the ultimate underdog story as the unlikely nerd finds love in the arms of a beautiful woman.  Ronnie is also portrayed well by Geena Davis as a tough journalist who has heard lots of interesting promises from scientists in the field before, but finds herself at first intrigued, and then finally attracted to, Brundle.  Their genuinely touching and involving relationship lays the groundwork for why this film works.  Once their involvement has been established, the film unleashes it's horror elements upon us, in the form of Brundle's disturbing transformations.  Most of the film from about the mid-point on is revealed from Ronnie's point of view and we can only watch in horror as she goes to visit Brundle and see what stage he is in at this point.  The strength of their relationship as developed by Pogue and Cronenberg early in the film makes the latter scenes all the more powerful.Much must be said of the makeup effects created and supervised by Chris Walas.  The film's eventual path lives or dies on the convincingness of the transformations that Brundle must go through, and Walas and his crew pull it off brilliantly.  There are no seams or zippers, no obvious tell-tale signs of makeup work being done here.  We believe, whole-heartedly, in the transformation of Brundle visually, and the film would not be the same without it.  Again, Goldblum helps sell the transformation as well, with his mood swings and erratic behavior, eventually leading to a man scared beyond belief by what is happening to him.  However, it is his powerful, gut-wrenching desire to be whole and human and with Ronnie again where the film's final strength is gleaned from.  The final fifteen minutes are truly difficult to endure first from Goldblum's performance and then from Davis', as the two lovers must come to terms with the inevitable.  There are few other ""horror"" films that are as filled with human emotion as The Fly, and this film stands as the crowning achievement in David Cronenberg's oeuvre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Maximum horror, physically and mentally","The plot doesn't take any superfluous turns. The scientist, the love interest, the invention. The nerd, Miss Sexy, the dangerous chance. After ten minutes, there can only be one direction. No matter, Cronenberg is ultimately transferring a well-known film template to a time of greater technical possibilities and freedom in acting. Cue! Previously unseen mask-based physical transformations, the peak of body horror, the terminology that is essentially associated with this very director. Another apropos: horror. Genuine horror, maybe a little bit of Goldblum's performance, but in general the viewer really feels something here. Disgust, pain, fear, but also a really dramatic component. The failed romance, the ethical dead end of science, a small mistake with a fatal impact. All of this is conveyed by the chemistry of the main characters, no wonder with a couple in real life, but of course also by the damn disgusting effects. Yes, an almost unique effect for the audience: tears of compassion in the midst of maximum possible disgust.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Remake - Better Than The Original,"THE FLY (1986) is a great film on all counts. Cronenberg was in top form as director of this film, and his style is all over it. The story concerns Seth Brundle, played by Jeff Goldblum (who to be honest, I usually HATE, but was actually very good in this film...)who is a scientist working on a teleportation machine. He has various degrees of success and is finally ready to test his project on a human subject, and decides to use himself as the first human test subject. Everything seems OK til Seth realizes that there was fly in the transporter with him, and that they were ""combined"" during the teleportation process...THE FLY hits the mark on every level. The acting, even from Goldblum (did I mention, I normally hate that guy?...) and Geena Davis (another actress that I normally HATE...) who plays Brundle's love interest, are dead on. At first it's fascinating, even fun to watch Brundle's transformation from man to ""fly-thing"" (the extra strength and agility, etc...) until the process becomes accelerated and Brundle starts losing body parts in various gory ways...and there is a good bit of ""gross"" stuff in this one. I remember this film being considered pretty shocking for a theatrical release when it first came out and with good reason. Cronenberg, who never really shied away from showing disturbing images, really went all the way with this one. An excellent film all-around - if you like this one, check out THE BROOD, my personal favorite Cronenberg film. Definitely recommended 8.5/10 for THE FLY",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Fly - ****,"The Fly series is a remarkable one that makes sence,if a scientist actually had a teleportation pod or some typ of machine this is the way it would happen n real life.The movies are jam packed with great acting,action,effects,superb horror and excellent gore. Both movies are very unpredictable and very scary and both films follow right after the other and both main cast in The Fly/Fly II have love interests(Fly I,Goldblum and Davis,Fly II,Stotlz and Zuniga)which is pretty cool.All in all The Fly series is a fantastic series of the 80s(which was a great decade I might add).In MY opinion there will never be movies like this again,they are classics,a real thrilling horror series.When the last time you got scared of a movie???Heres a tip:DON`T WATCH THEM IN THE DARK!!!The Fly part 1 has a great promo in the beginning with great effects.When you first see Jeff Goldblum and Gena Davis your like wow.Ever since you first see them in the film you follow them like glue,you really get attached to them and you even get to know John Getz and begain to get attached to him aswell even though he Ronnie`s (Davis) ex-boyfriend and a fart.As the movie goes on you wonder what is going to happen with the teleportation pods.Will they work,if so what will happen?I won`t tell too much here but when Goldblum turns into the Fly,prepare to be shocked!By the way,listen to the music score by Howard Shore,if you can buy it,it fits the Fly perfectly!Overal The Fly is a great picture,a bit sad but it s very exciting.I rate it (4) four stars ****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Superior to the original.,"The Fly tells the story of an eccentric scientist named Seth Brundle that has invented a device that teleports inanimate objects but has a problem with transporting live things. He meets Veronica Quaife, an eager journalist that hopes to document Seth's work. They end up falling in love, and in the heat of a moment, Seth goes through the telepod. Unfortunately, a fly gets into the machine with him, and their genes splice together, slowly mutating Seth into a half fly half human hybrid.This remake of the 50's sci fi film is a better film all around with a better plot, better dialogue, better acting and it's creepier. David Cronenberg injects his bizarre style into the film making it a unique horror film. The special effects and make-up were so amazing that they earned the film an Oscar. It's really cool to watch as Seth gets more powerful, but then begins to deteriorate into a disgusting mutation. The film is also filled with raw emotion due to the beauty and the beast love story.Even though there's really only 3 people in this movie, it's not boring at all, and the 3 stars play their roles to perfection.

Sci-Fi Horror at its best,"David Cronenberg is up there with David Lynch as one of the top visual surrealist directors. Whilst The Fly is not a surreal like Eraserhead or Naked Lunch, it has its surreal moments and definitely crosses the boundaries in to shock cinema. Cronenberg is a director who has an obvious fascination with the grotesque there are not many more grotesque images than some shown here. The make up used on Jeff Goldblum is brilliant and changes very subtly during Brundle's transformation from man to Brundlefly. To witness the final stages of Brundlefly is particularly disturbing and Geena Davis' reactions mirror exactly how I felt when watching with disbelief. The visuals in this film, although slightly over the top, are fantastic and will never be forgotten. Cronenberg is fantastic as a director because rather than being concerned with making the film accessible, he cares more for making a good film and projecting his vision.As well as being highly imaginative and impressive visually, The Fly has a great plot. The relationship between Goldblum and Davis is very touching and romantic. The relationship is written very effectively due to it being exaggerated to the point that the audience are prepared to believe that this woman will still love a genetically mutating man. The main plot of an inventor creating 'telepods' that accidentally become gene fusers gives the film its Sci-Fi element and the way Goldblum's character transforms after he goes through is very commendable. Whilst not the most thought provoking of plots, The Fly is intelligently written and does well to both entertain and shock.Goldblum does fantastically in making the leap from an eccentric, somewhat childlike scientist to a mutant going crazy. He is perfect for this role in appearance, by voice and by him mannerisms. Jeff Goldblum makes Seth Brundle a unique character and definitely should be the role Goldblum is most proud of playing. Geena Davis is a great actress and does very well in this performance. Her ability at showing shock and disgust is very good but it is the more subtle parts involving her and Goldblum's character development where she really shines.The dark mood of the film is greatly reflected by the atmosphere in the film. Most of the settings are very dark and there are not many characters in the film, helping the audience to focus on Goldblum and Davis. Howard Shore's score is extremely dramatic, slightly cliché but very well done. Cronenberg is an expert at creating moods and contrast. The contrast of a wonderful romance against all the grotesque imagery is very effective as it brings an element of reality to the film. There is also a sense of abruptness to the film; the abrupt ending reflects how quickly the fly's genes fused with Brundle's body. It is the subtle themes that really make this film standout.A classic Sci-Fi Horror, The Fly is a great film and stands proud with many science fiction films of the 80s. The eighties is often mocked as a cultural phenomenon but with regards to this specific genre, the eighties was an immensely important decade. The Fly, along with Terminator, Aliens and The Thing went to great lengths to revolutionise the genre. Cronenberg does a fantastic job with this film. Of all of his more mainstream films, The Fly is his best effort yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The grotesque resurrection of a classic monster,"Some 20 years after The Fly trilogy starring Vincent Price came to an end, David Cronenberg revives this science fiction story with a different approach aimed at body horror. This version could be interpreted more as a reboot or a reimagining because the differences with the original 1958 film are quite large, but the concept is what does not change. Here there are no exchanges of body parts like in the original film that became so iconic to the point of being parodied in many cartoons, David preferred that Seth's genes be fused with the intruding fly to give rise to a grotesque mutation that goes manifesting throughout the film. The original film belonged to the atomic age and at that time it was common for it to give messages about the risks of technology. There is a similar message here, but using Cronenbergn's philosophy about how technology can influence human biology in unimaginable ways.It must be admitted that Cronenberg is a master in the area of fission science with his concept of technology influencing the biology of human beings. This version of The Fly turns out to be a great film in many ways because it is a more grotesque version of the original story. Jeff Goldblum has offered a very good character that made this movie just like Jurassic Park, one of the reasons why Jeff is remembered. We see how Seth slowly changes until he becomes a grotesque creature, but that change is not limited only to his physical appearance. You can clearly see how the mutation is affecting him psychologically, making him mentally unstable. The original movie also used that, but in a more subtle way. Here Seth's psychological decline is much more explicit.The most memorable thing about this film is undoubtedly the special effects. The makeup starts from something subtle and then reflects the creature that Seth becomes. Cronenberg's films do not disappoint in offering bizarre makeup effects sequences and this film delivers on that. Howard Shore's soundtrack also deserves to be mentioned for offering a good atmosphere and having a bit of the feel of the original film.The Fly is another of those films from the eighties that continue to be remembered or loved for the good dose of monsters and special effects they were able to offer. Another David Cronenberg film that meets the standards of lovers of monsters and practical special effects. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrific Tragedy in the Name of Science,"This remake of the fifties sf/horror version is Cronenberg's own masterpiece of horror. Sure, he had original, unusual ideas before this (""The Brood""in'79; ""Videodrome""in'83,etc.) and branched out into other genres after this, so it's odd that a remake is his ultimate effort. But it's here that all the elements of horror came together in a nearly perfect mix. Many of the scenes, particularly in the 2nd half, are uncomfortable to watch, and this may be why many viewers do not rate this film higher - it's just too disturbing to view. A lot of this has to do with the likability of the two main characters, played by Goldblum & Davis. Goldblum as Brundle especially, comes across as a slightly goofy, harmless eccentric in the early scenes. His charm works on Davis and also on the audience; we certainly don't want anything bad to happen to him. But you already get that sense of dread very early, when he first unveils his macabre-looking pod teleporters. You sense he has some bad times ahead of him - you just don't know how bad. The horror is so effective because it gets really, really bad - just so much worse than you could have ever imagined.The other aspect to the story, the progress represented by a scientific breakthrough, is another element which, rather than a potential science fiction premise, becomes subverted into a tragedy of horror. Usually, a concept such as teleportation, successfully accomplished, is cause for celebration (see the Star Trek series & films for a brighter version of such technology). Here, progress such as this should probably be avoided at any cost. But, the real tragedy is Brundle's horrific bad luck, falling prey to his human failings, notably impatience. If only he'd waited another day. If only he noticed that fly. If only he'd placed some safeguard to prevent his machine from performing a function it was not intended for. The machinery here becomes a dispassionate godlike creator of monsters; the machine is not so much demonic as remorseless and unfeeling. It's a most disquieting argument against the supposed benefits of escalating technology.Or maybe it should be termed evolving technology. Brundle's rapid evolution after he first steps into the teleporter touches on some of the most primal fears associated with modern mankind: death and disease. We watch him first seemingly devolve after he first voices our primary concern (""Am I dying?""). A cancer-like affliction cripples him, and it looks like he'll fall apart into nothing soon. Only later do we realize this was only a transitory step and further horrors await our eyes as Brundle changes, changes. By this point, many viewers may want to turn away or turn it off. It's really slow death we're seeing and, unless one has sadistic tendencies, there is no compelling reason to watch. Well, unless it's to feel grateful we will never fall victim to something like this. Or will we?",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror remake done perfect,"If the fly remake isnt on your list of greatest horror remakes ever made, there's something wrong with you pal. It successfully takes all the elements great about the original and cranks them up to 11. Its engaging, emotional, heartbreaking and amusingly grotesque. Jeff Goldblum couldnt have been more perfect for the role of Seth brundle. You have no problem believing he's dorky & full of himself, and the more he loses his sanity the sadder it becomes. Geena Davis plays Ronnie, great heroine & you really feel for her struggle to save Seth. Not to mention her wanting an abortion was pretty ambitious stuff for the time. Her formal lover played by John Getz starts off as a jerk but ends on a good note as Ronnie's support. The biggest change from the original is it's not just a man and a fly swapping heads, but instead fusing with a fly and slowly molting into a grotesque abomination. The effects are incredible and really makes your skin crawl, especially when he removes his fingernails. Finally Howard Shore's score is epic & catches your attention at the right moments.What more can I say but watch it if you haven't. Practically Perfect horror film. If there's issues I haven't seen any yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure Visceral Horror,"I've read that David Cronenberg considers this film one of his most mainstream efforts, which is weird, considering some critics tend to use The Fly as the perfect example the Canadian auteur DOESN'T do mainstream. Well, in my opinion, it's both.The story is certainly a very conventional one: a scientist's (Jeff Goldblum) experiment goes wrong and he turns into a monster. What's unusual about it is the way Croenberg merges the body horror with romance and ultimately uses the terrifying scenario as a reflection on identity (see also Dead Ringers and A History of Violence for further developments of the same theme).Goldblum shines as Seth Brundle, the eccentric genius whose genetic structure is combined with a fly's during a teleportation experiment, an accident which has serious consequences: Seth gradually becomes a ""Brundlefly"", who possesses extraordinary physical abilities (that stage of the metamorphosis reminds of Peter Parker's transformation into Spider-Man) as well as an insatiable sexual hunger (possible reference to Cronenberg's directorial debut, Shivers). Soon enough, though, he and his girlfriend (Geena Davis) realize things are getting very bad (the scene where Seth quotes Kafka to describe his condition is brilliant, another proof this ain't a conventional horror flick)...Alongside the acting, the other impressive thing about this movie is the Oscar-winning make-up: rarely has a creature looked so real and revolting (and there's no CGI involved).And finally, The Fly has one of the best director cameos ever: Cronenberg plays the gynecologist in the infamous ""nightmare abortion"" sequence (a landmark in horror cinema).For fans of the genre, this is something you just can't miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting Film About Transformation And Doomed Love,"Wow!!!!!!! You either love or hate this film and I certainly love it. Very rarely has a movie really affected and moved me like this one. While Geena Davis as the scientist's sympathetic journalist girlfriend Veronica (""Ronny"") and Jon Getz's Stathis Borans are both superb it its Jeff Goldblum's Seth Brundle that really elevates the piece into the harrowing masterpiece that it is. Brundle is fascinating to watch because he doesn't feel any pity for himself but takes his transformation as any scientist would, as an absolute biological wonder. It is not until he really starts to become physically weak and dying that he feels regret for his ambition (but of course towards the end he regains his confidence). I really give so much credit to David Cronenberg in creating a film with such haunting ambience. Where the locations are cold, sterile and kept to a minimum (characters are also kept to a minimum with only three main characters and a few other very small characters with a few lines of dialogue) for a reason: so that you are stuck with this morphing, oozing man. You have got to roost with the fella to really feel what he is going through. Howard Shore of course adds to the sense of forboding and eerie quality of the film with his wonderful score. People often tell me how they thought the film was too violent and gorry. But how could you envision the picture in any other way? Why don't those people make their own ending to the film where the fly joins a beach club and surfs by day and dances by night. The real fans we'll keep the film just how it is. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Simply Outstanding!,"By 1986, director David Cronenberg was one of the rising stars in the horror genre, having a bright career in his natal Canada where he had directer modern classics such as ""The Brood"", ""Scanners"" and the masterpiece of the genre, ""Videodrome"". After directing his first movie in the U.S., ""The Dead Zone"" in 1983, Cronenberg was chosen to direct his first big budget project in the U.S.: the remake of the classic movie ""The Fly"".The plot of the original movie was kept at its core, a brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), creates a teleporting machine, but when he experiments teleporting himself, something goes wrong and he gets combined with a fly. That is the plot outline and all the movie has in common with the original, because Cronenberg took a whole different approach to the story.While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes ""the offspring of man and fly"".The script is simply brilliant, not only it explores Seth Brundle's tragedy, the inclusion of Geena Davis as the reporter who falls in love with the scientist only to discover that his lover is slowly changing into something unnatural plays an important part in Brundle's tragedy. The story is full of metaphors and it is the ultimate romance/horror tragedy.Now, all this would not be possible without the acting of both Goldblum and Davis, their chemistry together is remarkable and their performances carry the film with the power enough to give us insight in the tragedy that slowly gets in the middle of their love.David Cronenberg's direction is outstanding and this is one of his best works. ""The Fly"" truly shows his progression as an artist and it is an important step in his career. In ""The Fly"" he successfully mixes the character study of previous works like ""The Brood"" or ""The Dead Zone"" with the SFX-packed action of ""Scanners"" and ""Videodrome"". this is without a doubt one of his most accomplished pictures.Overall, I could go on praising this film and yet it would not be enough. ""The Fly"" is not only a modern classic of the horror genre (so much that it has casted a shadow over the original), it is a perfect example of the art of film-making. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tragic masterpiece of horror,"A remake of sorts of the 50's sci fi horror film, we all know the story - brilliant scientist Seth Brundle has created the worlds first ever teleporter, and even though it works fine transporting inanimate objects, it doesn't fare so well on living beings. Frustrated with the device and with his reporter girlfriend (who is writing a book on Seth and his experiments) he tests it on himself, not realising that a fly is also in the chamber with him. So begins the horrifying metamorphosis of Seth into a giant man/fly hybrid.I really like the original film, and this film is different enough from it to make it worth watching as well. The effects on Seth as he gradually becomes more and more fly-like are incredible for the time, and this is perhaps the performance of a lifetime from Geoff Goldblum. A true great of 80's horror, and should not be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror classic for the ages,"Simply put ""The Fly"" is a horror classic. From its set-up that pulls you right in to its abrupt, yet necessary, ending there is not a false moment in it.Bouyed by Jeff Goldblum's great performance as the doomed scientist, you watch helplessly as he slowly turns from man to fly.The film's violence is somewhat jarring (especially the arm wrestling scene) but Cronenberg knows when to shock and when to scare. And at the end he even has us feeling sorry for the former scientist, now deranged fly.And finally I'd like to mention the brilliant score by Howard Shore. It's unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic horror,This is one of those really gory horror films you watch when you're ten years old and are never the same again.The original movie was a bit of camp fun (Scientist gets head turned into a crap plastic fly mask) whereas Cronenberg chooses to take things seriously and give us gore and suspense.  Goldblum has never been better (notice he nearly always plays scientists or teachers) and the special FX still stand up nearly 20 years later.Shame about the nasty sequel.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A brilliant, must-see exemplar of horror","Every now and again one comes across a movie so mesmerizing and exemplary that for all the enthusiasm one might bear towards it, putting that enthusiasm and praise into words is peculiarly difficult. This is one of those movies.The 1958 flick with Vincent Price is an undeniable classic, and it still holds up. David Cronenberg is easily one of my favorite directors, and unmistakably a great one - marvelously imaginative, with an exquisite eye for visuals and a sharp mind for intense, riveting drama. Even knowing the reputation of the filmmaker and his 1986 remake, until one sits to watch it one can't fully understand how perfect a marriage it is. Cronenberg's penchant for exploration of body, mind, sex, and transformation is one of the defining components of his features, and it's arguably never been stronger than it is here. I of course assumed that I'd enjoy 'The fly,' but this is truly, absolutely exceptional.To whatever extent screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue, producer Stuart Cornfeld, or other interested parties had a hand in shaping what this movie would become, Cronenberg's mastery of the medium is all over it. Drawing out the transformation allows the narrative to focus more heavily and zero in on the changes that overcome protagonist Seth - physically, and mentally; this is as much psychological horror as it is body horror. More than that, there are powerful dramatic beats that carry real weight, unexpected for such a genre flick from so niche a filmmaker. Beyond this, the terrific shot composition and orchestration of every scene reflects an artistry that alone makes Cronenberg's works essential, whatever flavors the content may bear, and they work wonders to bring this cringe-worthy tableau to life. The set pieces, the lighting, and the environmental effects are all excellent. And it's also worth mentioning here Mark Irwin's stupendously crisp, vivid cinematography, and the fine editing of Ronald Sanders, for both these aspects serve to magnify every tiny detail throughout the film.And there's a treasure trove of such detail, isn't there? Among all else that's so tremendous in 'The fly,' a couple additional bits particularly stand out. First is the acting, for while the cast is small, they are magnificent. I don't think I've ever seen so strong a showing from Geena Davis or John Getz, least of all in a genre film, and both demonstrate outstanding emotional range that do much to round out the picture. More than this, Jeff Goldblum gives a performance that may actually be the very best of his entire career, and it's clear he was robbed of well-deserved accolades and nominations. Especially in early scenes he demonstrates the same idiosyncratic aloofness and excited energy that rather seems to a chief characteristic in many of his roles as we see them ('Jurassic Park' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' being two highly prominent examples). Yet Goldblum's turn as Seth Brundle goes far beyond this recognizable trait; the actor's very physicality, and basic expressions and body language, undergo nuanced shifts as the plot advances. Brundle is a demanding part, and Goldblum embraces it with spirit and skill that's among the very best the medium might offer.To that point as well, speaking of complexity and change - the makeup and practical effects in this film are second to none. Chris Walas, Stephan Dupuis, and the puppeteers have created ingenious and astonishingly monstrous imagery. If years from now many other facets of modern horror become passe and old hat, as conceptualizations of the genre from the 30s or 40s sometimes are now, I firmly believe this will endure. The blood, gore, hair, vomit, pustules, deteriorating body parts and every other slight facet of the stages of transformation are vibrant, striking, and sickening in the best way a cinephile and horror aficionado could hope for. Rarely has the genre ever been so gnarly and genuinely horrifying as it is in 'The fly,' and a substantial portion of that achievement can be chalked up to the wretched look and feel of the ""Brundlefly.""As if all this weren't enough, then figure in another fabulous, dynamic score from Howard Shore, lending considerably to the atmosphere and drama. In every possible way this is incredibly well made, crafted with love, passion, intelligence, and incredibly hard work. With little variation David Cronenberg's body of work is filled with fantastic, unforgettable titles; several made such an immediate impression that each in and of themselves instantly solidified the man as one of my favorite directors. For all that he has done, though, still 'The fly' might remain the single most monumental and lasting testament to his wit and capabilities. I had high expectations before I watched, and still they were totally blown away. I sit here in dumbfounded amazement, struggling to summon forth the words to best communicate how utterly, indisputably splendid it is. There's no doubt in my mind that this is one of the greatest horror films that will ever be made. I don't even know what more to say at this point, except that 'The fly' earns my very highest and heartiest recommendation; if you've not yet seen it, don't hesitate a moment longer, and if you have already had the pleasure, this is worth watching again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Tragic Evolution of the Human Soul,"The Fly, directed by David Cronenberg, is a horror masterpiece that expertly blends body horror with emotional depth, creating a film that is both terrifying and tragic. A remake of the 1958 classic, this version follows the brilliant but eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) as he accidentally transforms into a hideous human/bug hybrid after an experiment with teleportation goes horribly wrong. As his condition deteriorates, he becomes increasingly monstrous, both physically and mentally, leading to a heartbreaking descent into madness. The Fly is not just a horror film, but a deeply human exploration of obsession, transformation, and the loss of self.Jeff Goldblum gives an incredible performance as Seth Brundle, perfectly capturing the character's initial charm, intelligence, and vulnerability, which gradually give way to horror as his transformation progresses. Goldblum's portrayal of Seth is both tragic and compelling; as the physical changes take over, his emotional collapse is equally devastating. The film's success is in large part due to his performance, which grounds the horror in a very real and human experience. Geena Davis, as Veronica Quaife, Seth's love interest, delivers a strong performance as well, showing both her growing horror at Seth's condition and her deep empathy for the man he was before the transformation.Cronenberg's direction is meticulous and effective, creating a film that is as deeply psychological as it is grotesque. The film's pacing is slow enough to allow for character development and emotional investment, but quick enough to build to the grotesque climax. Cronenberg's use of practical effects is groundbreaking, particularly in the physical transformation of Seth. The makeup and special effects, supervised by Chris Walas, are nothing short of spectacular. The gradual change from man to insect is both horrifying and fascinating, with each stage of Seth's transformation more repulsive and heartbreaking than the last. The body horror is on full display, with some of the most grotesque and memorable effects in horror history, making the film unforgettable for its shock value and artistry.The film's thematic depth sets it apart from many other horror films. While it deals with the grotesque and the terrifying, The Fly also explores themes of love, loss, and the fragility of the human condition. Seth's descent into madness and monstrosity is not just physical; it's emotional and existential. The loss of his humanity is not only a physical transformation but also a loss of identity and relationships. The horror, then, becomes something much more than skin-deep-it's about the destruction of a person, both inside and out.The film's conclusion, while tragic and gut-wrenching, provides a fitting end to Seth's journey. It's a final, heartbreaking moment that resonates deeply, leaving the viewer not only repelled by the horrific transformation but also mourning the loss of the man Seth once was. The film leaves an indelible mark, not just for its shocking visuals but for the emotional complexity and depth that underpins the horror.In conclusion, The Fly (1986) is a brilliant fusion of horror, tragedy, and emotional depth, with Jeff Goldblum's unforgettable performance and groundbreaking special effects making it a landmark in the genre. Cronenberg's direction elevates the film beyond simple horror, creating a haunting exploration of transformation and loss. While it is certainly grotesque and shocking, it also packs an emotional punch that makes it one of the most memorable and impactful horror films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not just a horror classic,"This film is one of the few instances where the re-make outdoes the original.  Not only are the special effects more realistic (and gruesome), the writing and acting also improved over time.  Jeff Goldblum turns in a truly wonderful performance as the driven scientist.  Geena Davis is absolutely fantastic as the torn reporter.  David Cronenberg once again has proven his dominance in the horror genre.  What makes this film stand out, though, is not the acting or the effects or the direction.  It stands out for the wonderful love story between Goldblum and Davis.  Some of the scenes in this movie are truly heart-wrenching.  This is definitely one of the top ten horror films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even Creepier Than The Original,"It's not all the time I would see a remake that's even better than the original, but The Fly from 1986 takes even more to a new level than the original 1958 film. It upgrades the story for this version and makes this both scarier and edgier. The story is very intense, the visuals are creepy in an awesome way, the acrobat effects are extraordinary, and the characters were able to stand out from the original with something new for their personality traits. If you're huge for science fiction stories, I think I recommend this one even more than the original. But hear about something I need you to prepare for. The fact that this is a R-rated version of The Fly and it will get even creepier. If you think you can handle that, you're on for something great. Not only would I say it's better than the original, but also one of the best movie remakes I've seen. The experiment Seth have worked on seemed real dangerous, but I would be down to experience that again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thought provoking...,"David Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" elevates this simple story of an experiment gone wrong into a carefully paced character driven drama/horror. Thus adding a whole new layer of depth to what could've been a sub-par horror film.The idea is simple. Jeff Goldblum is the scientist Seth Brundle, who after a what appeared as an successful experiment in the fields of teleportation finds himself slowly turning into a half human half fly hybrid. Gena Davis plays Veronica Quaife, Brundle's girlfriend and also former girlfriend of the third major character in the film, Stathis Borans played by John Gets.From the beginning to the end Cronenberg focuses the movie entirely into these three characters. Establishing a sort of love-triangle between them as both Brunle and Borans develop or still have feelings towards Quaife. While at the same time facing their own deeper fears as the transformation from man to ... something else, begins slowly digging at Brundle's humanity. And it is here where Cronenberg excels with his ability to properly direct human reaction to situations that are often found unnatural. Employing a turn in character focus that causes the viewer's own established empathy towards them to change. While in the first half we saw the developing relationship between Brundle and Quaife with Borans's character portrayed in a more anti-heroic role, in the second part we witness a complete switch of roles as Brundle is becoming more and more distanced from human feelings and logic. Culminating in the last scene with him finally realizing what he has become and what must be done to stop himself. Even then, at that point we don't see him as the beaten villain but as a casualty of his own personal desires.Cronenberg sets a dark serious tone to the film and he never changes the pace. Even though the plot outline might sound as something found in the B-movie standard of horror, there isn't a single scene that could be considered cheesy or weakly executed. The effects also help in that matter, with the breathtaking design of ""The Fly"". It is really no wonder why this movie won an Oscar for make-up. But it should have won for a lot more...People who are searching for a horror film that delivers far more then some cheap scares should give ""The Fly"" a try. Not just because of its effects or its strong focus on character but also because of the powerful and well executed idea of finding humanity even when you've thought you've lost it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A GUY, A GIRL AND A FLY:  A LOVE TRIANGLE","This is probably Jeff Goldblum's most compelling role. He got into shape, and had the major role.  This film was well done, and fluctuated between a love story, a science fiction movie and a horror story. I found this idea of transportation interesting. The movie is off-beat, but entertaining and well done. It's somethimes refreshing to see a script that is clever and goes off the beaten path of other cookie cutter Hollywood productions. Gina Davis seems to gravitate towards these kinds of roles.

This is probably Jeff Goldblum's best film. I like it even more than ""Jurassic Park"".My only complaint is that I wish it was longer. I feel like they could have shown us more of Goldblum going insane. The music is great and it's full of moments to make you jump out of your seat. I think most people probably already know the plot. It's about a scientist who uses a teleportation device not knowing a fly was with him, causing his DNA to merge and turn into a giant fly.

"""The Terror Of Genius""","One of the greatest genre films to come out of the eighties. With this film David Cronenberg finally realizes his full potential,and in turn creates a riveting experience that few audience members can ever hope not to forget. The always enjoyable Jeff Goldblum shines in a career-defining role, while sultry Geena Davis proves she can be more than just eye-candy. The concept of disfiguring illness and mad science experiments gone awry have been utilized in genre films before to varying degrees of success. Cronenberg's films, however, are always much deeper than their initial face value, and The Fly is certainly no exception. It is the agonizingly, realistic, well-paced transformation sequences that cement the film in the minds of viewers and film historians alike. By depicting the devastating after-effects of Seth Brundle's abuse of his own genius, whilst in a jealous rage over Davis' character, we as an audience can feel for ourselves the pain and mental anguish exhibited by Goldblum at his body's ultimate betrayal. When we, as a species, create for ourselves (whether through cultural choices or imposed and regimented political structures) an environment where the value of our own Humanity is negligible, then we cease to be Human at all. In fact, we become a form of contagion. A master germ of hellish intent and purpose. The mutation has begun, and everyone's invited to the party.

The story may seem far-fetched, and I guess it is, but it just adds to the intensity of the movie. In addition, Jeff Goldblum, as the main character Seth, gives one of the great performances in the history of sci-fiction movies. As the audience watches Seth slowly but inexorably change into something loathsome and awful, we witness how he fights to maintain his dignity and humanity against all odds, knowing that ultimately he will succumb.

"Maybe Cronenberg's best, definitely his most accessible","David Cronenberg is a master of technological horror and always manages to create films chock full of interesting ideas. The problem (or really cool thing ) about some of his films however, is that he lets his ideas overwhelm the story. His films become more like puzzles than straight forward pictures, and often require the viewer to sit back and decipher what they just saw. While The Fly still explores Cronenberg's characteristic theme of the transformation of the human body, it does so in a way that never overwhelms the story. The film remains at its core a tragic love story, aided greatly by Jeff Goldblum's very human performance. The emotion here doesn't seem forced or artificial like some of his other movies (Scanners, Dead Ringers), but actually comes across as sincere. For a director so consistently concerned with artificial human manipulation, Cronenberg has managed to create a film that is surprisingly genuine; supplying this film with a good dose of what many of his others lack: humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ayy Caramba!,"'The Fly' encompasses everything the 80's did right for the horror genre and single handedly launched horror into a different, more grotesque, direction -literally paving the way for movies like 'Saw' to come to fruition. This movie shocked audiences in 1986 and it shocked me today. It is wildly wicked and shockingly evil. The cast was fantastic. I had honestly put off watching this movie for well over twenty years because I thought it would be bland and boring. What's so scary about metamorphosing into a fly? Needless to say, don't sleep on this movie!!!!!P. S. Jeff Goldblum is a stud and Geena Davis is a knockout!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Loses Itself Somewhere in the Second Half...,"There hasn't been quite as difficult a film to review as ""The Fly"" in a long, long while. I quite enjoyed many aspects of the film, but there were some elements that seemed to be lacking. While the evolution from man to fly was interesting, there were so many in-between subjects that seemed to slow down the film quite a bit. The entire tale seemed a bit...well...fake. Although that may be the idea.It is, of course, a retelling of the 1958 classic of the same name, which was a bit tongue-in-cheek and ten times more corny than David Cronenberg's 1986 remake, which seems to take itself a bit too heavy at times. The 1986 version is a very, very gory film. Imagine the abilities of a giant man-fly who spews a decomposing acid from his mouth in order to turn his prey into liquid so he can then drink them. If that sounds a bit uncomfortable for you, ""The Fly"" is not your movie. But this will enthuse die-hard gore fans, the type of fans who like gore in their stories more than the story itself.I liked the setup. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a socially outcast scientist, who - like in all mad scientist movies - has managed to make an amazing machine that thousands of scientists combined couldn't even begin to create. But he can, because he's the Mad Scientist. When Ronnie (Geena David), a reporter for Particle magazine, is shown his newest invention, she decides to devote her life to chronicling the events and experiments of Brundle, in hopes of writing a book when it is all over and done and exploiting him for all he is worth.You see, Brundle has created something marvelous: A giant, designer phone booth, a.k.a. a ""transporter,"" which can transport ""non-animate objects"" from one phone booth to another. It is run by a large computer console which has a large LCD interface, contains extra-large font (just in case the scientists don't have good eyes), and can solve complex algorithms like, ""What is two plus two?"" and so on and so forth. There are two large pods: One the subject goes into, and another the subject is transported to through a series of connecting wires along the floor (consider it a large fax machine). And just like in all mad scientist movies, the mad scientist, frustrated that his machine isn't working correctly (as seen in any movie about mad scientists with never-before-seen creations), decides to try it out himself, and whaddaya know, it works (just his luck). Brundle gets transported from one pod to another. But when Brundle gets transported, so does a small fly that has sneaked into the teleporter. The computer is programmed to transport one being, it has no idea what to do with the leftovers, so it combines them together. After the fusion process is complete, Brundle is no longer Brundle. He is ""Brundlefly,"" part-man, part-fly. Over the weeks to come, Brundle's fingernails fall off, he gains incredible strength and energy, and he starts to grow strange, black hairs over his body.Ronnie is skeptical about it all, she gets the hairs analyzed and comes to face the facts: They aren't human. She tries to tell Seth but at this time has has no idea the fly was ever in the machine. ""You're jealous!"" he yells at her, only to turn around and look in the mirror and realize something is wrong with his face. He's ugly. Well, uglier than he used to be.This is a very basic update of the cliched Mad Scientist tale. After Ronnie realizes she is pregnant with Brundlefly's offspring, she tries to have an abortion, but Brundlefly leaps through a glass window (he is now super-fly, despite the unheard fact that flies are weaker than humans), picks her up, and carries her off into the night sky, trying to preserve his baby. A giant fly crawling skyscrapers with a woman in his arms? ""King Fly"" would be a better title for this movie.The ending is extremely predictable, not to mention darn (stero)typical. How many times have we seen the heroine in danger from a mutating monster bent on destroying her? Too much, that's how much.David Cronenberg is a talented director, it seems, but he relies too much on gore and faked romance to carry the story, rather than a strong narrative. The beginning setup was fun - it showed a Mad Scientist with a bit more depth, a Mad Scientist who seemed to have a bit more backdrop to him than the usual over-achiever-scientist-turned-freak. But alas, the end resorted to gore, gore, and more gore. You could call it an homage to the classics. I call it crap.I enjoyed much of ""The Fly,"" but there were certain elements I couldn't get around. The screenplay seemed forced in certain areas, as well as the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. No sparks flew at all. Why would a woman like her want a geeky scientist like him? Ironically they were married in real life during the filming of this movie. The horror.""The Fly"" spawned a camp sequel directed by the creature effects artist on both films, Chris Walas. I enjoyed the second film more, I think, because I expected something horrible and found the film to be fun. I expected a lot from ""The Fly"" and got nothing in return. I liked the gore, but it seemed to be the only thing going for it by the end of the film. Show me a film with more gore than ""The Fly"" and I'll show you a puddle of vomit.2.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not succesful,"I´m a big Cronenberg connoseur and have seen all his work. This one, his commercial succes, and most popular movies has a major flaw. The acting of Jeff Goldblum. Although it´s pretty intense it just falls short of the more truthful acting performances in ""Videdrome"" and ""Scanners"". Somehow Goldblum just doesn´t fit in a horror-sci-fi Cronenberg picture and not surprisingly they have never attempted to repeat the ""succes"". Although very 80s and impressive for its time I think this movie is a big compromise with Cronenbergs ideals. I think his early and late work (especially ""Videodrome II - Existenz"") is the best. ""Spider"" and ""Madame Butterfly"" was interesting too (notice the references to insects). Insects are rather interesting, I agree. This fly just don´t fly. Brundle fly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Frightening, But Loses Its Way.","""The Fly"" is truly terrifying for the most part, but the film literally falls apart during its final act. Jeff Goldblum stars as a somewhat mad scientist who accidentally turns himself into a six-foot fly. Of course the change goes on for most of the film and the Oscar-winning makeup effects are amazing to say the least, but the movie becomes too bent on making the audience physically sick during the closing moments to really succeed completely. Shock factors are a little too prevalent as the film progresses and that fact grounds the fly in the end. Only fair when all is said and done. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror
Jeff Goldblum & David Cronenberg's Finest Hour (and a bit),"What can be said that hasn't been said about 1986's ""The Fly""?

It is IMHO David Cronenberg's BEST Film by miles & how Jeff Goldblum did not win the Oscar for this performance is beyond me (I will have to look up who won it that year because he must have been exceptional)These guys had no right to turn such a hokey film into such a HORROR CLASSIC...The Script is great (with many amazing words from Brundle which every fan knows by now...I'm an Insect that dreamt he was a man and loved it AWESOME) the Effects are Mindblowing, the acting & directing amazing with Geena Davis the perfect match for Goldblum.A TERRIFYING LOVE STORYOne of Cronenberg's Very Best along with ""The Dead Zone"" , ""Videodrome"" & ""Scanners"" how I wish he'd make more like this rather the more recent ""Cosmopolis"", ""A Dangerous Method"" & ""Eastern Promises"" which simply aren't to my taste.AND THAT ENDING IS JUST A KILLER!!!A Rocketeer Flyer Rating of an UP UP & AWAY 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest sci-fi horrors ever...,"For me, this movie is a rare thing: a GOOD horror movie. It's not often that I find one. Yeah, there are some decent ones but the majority of the horror flicks I've seen can summed up in one word: lame. I've also noticed that a lot of my favorite horror movies were made before 1990. This one is definitely high on my list. David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is a remake of the 1958 film starring Vincent Price.What sets this movie apart from the other horror flicks? Plot!! This movie has a wonderful story that doesn't just rely on ""Look out behind you!"" scare tactics. Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, an eccentric scientist on the verge of a great discovery: teleportation. When he firsts attempts at teleporting himself through, a fly makes it into the telepod with him and their genes are spliced together. Geena Davis is his love interest, playing a journalist who becomes interested in his work. Aside from the horror of this man's transformation into a monster, the movie has an emotional aspect of the characters' relationship and how it is tried by these tragic events. Davis's character is forced to watch the man she loves disappear.For those who hear that and are turning away because love is invading their scary movies, don't worry. While the special make-up and puppet effects may seem a little dated, it isn't enough to draw you out of the picture. The gore and transformation effects are definitely enough to gross you out. I recently showed this movie to my girlfriend for the first time and she could barely watch it.This is horror with heart! A magnificent combination that I wish we would see more of in modern movies...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
swat this bugger,"I tried once before and my review didnt go thru, so I must try again to warn people about this film.  Im sure most have already seen it or at least heard about it, but for those who havent, this is one of those films that has one scene that entirely destroys the whole film.  A film where everything is so good but one moment towards the end negates all the terrific qualities about it.  The plot is pretty basic as Goldblum is a reclusive scientist testing a transporting machine.  At first he uses food items or animals, but one night out of anger he dares himself to go through, which he does successfully.  Unaware to him was that a fly was in the booth with him and their genes get spliced together causing him to slowly turn into a big bug.  We watch him deal with the sadness of seeing his life dramatically change and how he loses the love of his sympathetic girlfriend (Davis).  You'll really pull for this guy, hoping he finds the cure and can reverse things.  But just as you think hes about to in the films climax, he turns psycho and does something so unbelievably cruel, that he turns into the bad guy and you say screw his cure, let em die.  Thats when he gets ahold of John Getz's character, who is trying to rescue Davis, and vomits acid on his hand, melting it in a truly disgusting, disturbing sequence. We have to listen to Getz scream in pain for some 45 seconds (at least) until his hand is reduced to a stump.  Goldblum sets him down and just when you think thats it...he vomits on Getz foot, dismembering it from his leg!  You think 'why the hell was that necessary?' until you remember David Cronenberg, who likes to torture his characters, co-wrote and directed the film.  Only undamaged thing to the film was the great, creepy Howard Shore score.  But thats what I meant when I said one scene killed the whole film for me.  And if youre like me, you'll be glad when Davis.................",,Anonymous,Horror
Beauty and the Beast for adults!,"The Fly is a great movie. Its a compact 91 minutes that veers from intriguing romance, to disturbing unravelling of man. Jeff Goldman is the victim in question here. A man literally consumed by his work, as he turns from scientist nerd to a twitching, vomiting nightmarish monster. Goldblums work has often been seen as irritating and mock-able, but it works beautifully here. His bug eyes, his gangly frame, and his quick delivery, perfectly fit Seth Brundles enthusiasm and following decline. Geena Davis comes off weaker, but still effective as the suffering Veronica who knows the fleeting time they had together, will be with her all her life.It may well prove to be David Cronenbergs masterpiece!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gruesome yet sad,"A really good movie, but also a very uncomfortable one too. Jeff Goldblum is superb in this role as a nervous, well intentioned likeable scientist who is willing to share his new discover with a sceptical young journalist. The scientist is something of a loner but falls in love with the journalist who also returns his affection. There's a jealous slightly unhinged man though he needs to keep his eye out for.I really loved the production design for this film, the use of practical effects, the music is incredible and the blu ray delivers a superb transfer nicely showing off the colours, the shadows, the textures of the clothing. The acting is superb and the casting really couldn't have gone better. The film reminded me a bit of classic old horror films like the Phantom of the Opera or even a little bit the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Beauty and the Beast, an outcast living in his fortress, living under some awful curse.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A horrifying romance tale.,"One of the most horrifying, and moving love stories ever made. It is a horror movie without a doubt, but in a lot of ways, it is a twisted romance as well. This movie shook me up to the core and left me in tears as well as a bit disturbed. In some ways, this is the ""Beauty and the Beast"" for adults. It combines elements from that and turns it into a very mature and dark tale. It is not for the faint of heart. What makes this film work so well is how it was made and all in all everything just worked perfectly. It effects us the way it should. It shows us how shallow the world is and that in some ways we are all fly's on a wall, or beasts in some ways. David Cronenberg has crafted a masterpiece here, and something that will remain timeless. It is one of the great horror films of our time and also one of the greatest love stories as well.http://calebisaboy.tumblr.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
David Cronenberg Horror Masterpiece,"One of the few and great I never tire of. I find this movie quite flawless, and for a number of reasons. First off, it took a classic from (I've seen both the Vincent Price original and its sequel) and refurbished it for another time. I still love the originals, but the remake is different enough to truly stand on its own. Secondly, casting was first rate. Geena Davis IS awesome and yes even the at-times pure douche John Getz is just great. And Jeff Goldblum, I can hardly muster the words. Behind the make-up and off, every time I feel for his character. The story has the feel of a great tragedy, telling the tale of what could've been.The special effects are quite remarkable and remain to this day unchallenged if you ask me. No amount of CGI can beat the amount of effort put into that make-up, the animatronics, or the wall-crawling scenes. Owning the DVD, I pop this in every now and then and the sight of 'Brundle Fly 'still evokes quite a bit of fear in me. And topping it all off is Howard Shore's incredible score. More and more I'm seeing how awesome of a compose he is. Check this one out!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has a great myth which overcomes rather dated limits,"Just re-watched it. It was enjoyable and thought provoking, though a few things niggled.I can't help but think that the depiction of the computer interface would be much better done today. Cronenberg vests the production with brains and passion, and this made me overlook the hokiness of that representation.And as much as I can certainly see his straining for professionalism, Getz's work here is distracting. Was it a lapse in Cronenberg's direction?But it's safe to say these distractions can be set aside in order to mainline the payload myth, which has to do with... the nature of nature, at its most elemental. I suppose more folks might pick up on a ""tech hubris"" message... and that's OK, too.If you haven't seen it, it's pretty much de riguour for buffs, so get it under your belt, already!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Prepare to witness the Metamorphosis! David Cronenbergs best film above all his others.,"This film is what made the world notice Cronenberg's genius at direction. It truly stands miles apart from the rest of his work.It is a fresh remake of the older 1958 film The Fly, based on George Langelaan's short story The Fly. You should see the 1958 film before you see this film. There is also a sequel Return of the Fly (1959).However back to the 1986 film. This story starts at an science convention where Veronica Quaife (played by Geena Davis), a journalist, meets Dr. Seth Brundle (played by Jeff Goldblum) who is a scientist and inventor. He goes in a conversation with Veronica saying to her that he has an invention that will ""change the world as we know it"".Veronica is intrigued. She drives Seth back to his apartment where he shows her his invention, a set of Telepods connected to each other. She however thinks that Seth is bluffing and that the Telepods are fake. Seth proceeds to show Verconica a demonstration of the Telepods true purpose. He asks Veronica for a personal object. She offers one of her stockings. He places it in a Telepod and activates a computer program to begin a teleportation sequence.He tells Veronica to keep an eye on the Telepod with the stocking in it. There is a flash of light and the the stocking miraculously disappears from sight. Veronica still thinks Seth is playing a game with her. Seth then diverts Veronica's attention to the other telepod where he retrieves her stocking.Veronica is amazed and begins asking a flurry of questions. How did Seth keep his invention from the world? How was the machine built and its workings? Seth tells Veronica not to write anything until he has fully mastered and corrected all the flaws of his invention.He tells Veronica that he can only transport inanimate objects. Transporting living organisms leads to their deaths when they are transported through the Telepods due to a defective re-integration process. He claims that the computer becomes ""crazy when handling flesh"".However he soon finds a way around that flaw with fatal consequences that will change his life and Veronica's forever.Watch the film to find out more.Brilliant direction by Cronenberg. The Telepods actually look like a fly's egg. Jeff Goldblum has all the mannerisms of a fly himself with his eye movements. Geena Davis is the sexpot of this film. Cronenberg's films have some allusion to sex in them and this film in no exception. The special make-up effects have to be seen to be believed. The musical score is by the veteran Howard Shore. Outstanding cinematography by Mark Irwin. Creature effects are by the brilliant Chris Walas.Overall 10/10 for the terrifying conclusion, casting and acting, brilliant special effects, background score and sound effects.The film has a sequel The Fly 2 (1989) which is a good follow-up in its own right and definitely worth watching for its special effects. It is directed by Chris Walas who did the special effects in The Fly (1986).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's a film which I've been eager to see for a fair while, because the concept is so unique and unpleasant, and I was fairly impressed with it, I must say. Not only is it comparably disgusting in a way which can easily be compared to modern gorefests such as Hostel and The Human Centipede, it also carries with it an emotional sub-plot which neither of said films can claim.Jeff Goldblum is an actor whom I've always had my doubts about, but he certainly nailed the stereotypical role of mad scientist here. He doesn't overplay his character in the slightest, and the viewer is left with a very real and lasting impression.

Spooky and Intense -- One of Cronenberg's Best,"Deeply unsettling David Cronenberg remake of the sci-fi chiller about a scientist playing around with genetic experimentation who accidentally mixes his DNA in with that of a house fly. The slow deterioration of his body as he turns into a mutated monster gives the makeup and special effects artists for this film free reign to create all manner of gruesome and frightening images. Jeff Goldblum, as the scientist, gives perhaps the best performance of his career. As an actor, he's always a bit off-kilter, so he's a natural fit as a mad genius. Geena Davis, as his love interest, does terrific work too, and delivers a performance that's something more than the standard issue work you might expect in a movie like this.Though the film is full of scary moments, perhaps the scariest is when Golblum's scientist character calmly asks Davis's character to leave his apartment because he's afraid he will hurt her if she stays.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely buzzin',"David Cronenberg is well-known for his incredibly repulsive films, and this one has to his most revolting film he's ever done! You really need to see ""The Fly"" to truly believe it. If you don't cringe at least once then something is really wrong with you. I don't want to sound negative about this film because a man turning into a human fly isn't going to be a pretty experience to behold so I really admire it's sheer power to disgust, and for a film that could've gone the wrong way so easily, this is really a masterpiece.""The Fly"" could've ended up really cheesy. Jeff Goldblum could've gotten into his telepod with a fly in it and come out immediately sprouting wings or having big bug-eyes (like the original) but instead the genius lies in the way the film slowly burns as we watch a brilliant man turn into something so unrecognisable. ""The Fly"" could've also fallen short if it copied the original which so many remakes tend to do when there's no point! Nope, ""The Fly"" perfects the original by about 10 miles, by taking a whole new direction.What really makes ""The Fly"" is its hideous make-up and special effects they are truly gut-wrenchingly A-mazing! To be honest I think it would be a crime if it didn't get an Oscar for them because even now they look amazing. I can see that if ""The Fly"" was remade again today (I wouldn't be surprised) hideous (not in a good way) CGI effects would pollute the screen and take over from the incredible story. I know I sound like some grumpy middle-aged man when I talk about the effects of today but I'm not one yet.David Cronenberg's directing is also really good! He makes everything seem so positive at first and it's the way David handles the gradual changes in his personality and appearance and the way it effects the people around him. This also goes for the screenplay which is also written by David, as it's equally fantastic and handled with precise care. The finale has to be one of the most mind-blowing I've ever seen, it is just completely over-loaded with suspense and terrifying special effects. It also makes you feel sorry for the fly in the end; even though it's hard to tell if he's a villain or still the hero now.""The Fly"" is a must see. Not just for horror fans (although it helps) but for everybody. It's handled with perfection and style with strong performances by Jeff and the other woman who was in ""BeetleJuice"" was OK as well. ""The Fly"" has everything: Great characters, a great plot, more than great special effects and brantastic direction. It'll have you buzzin'!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Every time I remembered this came out in 1986 while watching, I was astonished. The practical effects are so much more grotesque and horrifying than modern CGI. Very well deserved Oscar win.Unfortunately for Brundlefly, the splice with a fly was not as successful as the spider was to Spider-man.

"Terrifying, Nasty and Brainy, it's Impossible to Turn Away From","Classic 80's gross-out horror with an analytical science fiction twist. I admire the way this skips the typical pleasantries and dives right into the action, omitting any back-story to commence with the freak show everyone in the audience came to see; expertly streamlined, it's non-stop substance without a dull moment. Despite the occasional campy slip-up, the primary storyline has actually aged surprisingly well and still plays as an eye-widening exhibit of suspense and repulsion. Jeff Goldblum, with his quick lip, piercing eyes and slightly inhuman appearance, was seemingly born for his role as the bright, socially awkward science geek-turned guinea pig that sparks the entire affair. Despite a throwaway evil ex-boyfriend angle that lingers around its fringes and a title that shamelessly gives away its biggest moment, this remains an unpredictable thrill ride of an experiment with a one-track mind, a few serious questions about the rate of scientific progress and some great visual effects.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There's a lot of really black humor in this movie, and along with the superb acting, pacing, and makeup effects it combines to make an excellent film.Another thing that I really liked was how the movie presented teleportation in a way that made it seem plausible.  Goldblum talks like he's believes in what he's doing, and he explains things that make logical sense (computers are dumb, because they only know what we tell them).The only problems I had with the movie were the lack of characters (there's on 3 main characters, and the minor ones never appear in more than one scene).  Besides that, it is enthralling from beginning to end.  I'd give it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Shocking.  But for Reasons You May Not Expect,"When hearing or reading about The Fly you will usually hear praise for the special effects, the gore, or maybe even the acting (all praise well deserved). What you probably won't hear about as often, though, is just how absolutely tragic and heart shredding this film is.The aforementioned gore and special effects really do deserve attention, though. They are still 25 some years later impressive, more so than about 90% of effects today. They are real. They aren't CGI added after the fact, covering up the fact that the actors are interacting with nothing. They are there with the actors, allowing them to see and feel something, and this matters. They also happen to look astounding. When Brundlefly truly emerges at the end it is not only one of the most disgusting moments you will ever see, but it is deeply disturbing on a very intimate level.That intimacy is because of the actors here. Davis and Goldblum have a real chemistry here that only works to create a deeper connection with these characters. It's not surprising to hear that they were together when this picture was filmed, and it shows on screen. Their love feels real right from the start.The Fly is a hybrid. Much like the main character, it transforms as the story progresses. First it is a light romance, then slightly comical, then deeply frightening and then finally, extremely sad. In the end the movie balls up all these different aspects and gives the viewer a rush of emotions that is hard not to appreciate. And this is what makes this movie so special. This emotional core is the soul of the movie. It's why the film works. And that's the most shocking thing about this movie. It is more than what most would assume. It is more than most other movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An intense heart-felt love story.,"David Cronenberg was obviously interested in fully exploring an intense heat-felt love story in the face of (extreme) physical deterioration (think: disease or ageing) and succeeds - if you can take it; Jeff Goldblum is remarkable performing the scientist's transformation to ""Brundlefly"".",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Brundlefly Effect,"David Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" doesn't really bear that much resemblance to the original 1958 film. Sure, both feature a scientist whose experiments go horribly awry due to the intrusion of a fly but besides that the stories aren't really that similar.In Cronenberg's version, eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) ends up unwittingly merging himself with a fly at the molecular level. He initially considers it an improvement but as his humanity deteriorates it puts a strain on his relationship with journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis). The script, co-written by Cronenberg, displays his trademark style and has a depth that is unusual for a horror film.As for the acting, I'm not crazy about Jeff Goldblum in general but I'd have to say that he did a pretty good job here, particularly as the film progressed. Geena Davis is just as impressive (perhaps even moreso) while John Getz is solid in a smaller but pivotal role.Cronenberg's direction is well-handled and the film generally looks attractive throughout. The visual effects are convincing while the makeup effects were impressive enough to result in an Oscar win. Howard Shore's score isn't bad either but not especially noteworthy.Overall, Cronenberg's version of ""The Fly"" is a well-made science fiction/horror film with more verve than most of its kind. Both this and the original version of the film are well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Metaphor,"***** WARNING SPOILERS ****** As explained already, ""The Fly"" (1986) is a re-make of the 1958 sci-horror of the same title. However, whilst the earlier film is a simple horror story of a man who (part) mutates into a fly, Cronenberg's version is a much more complex pic that appears to be a metaphor for mental illness more than anything else.Story focuses on Seth Brundle (Goldblum), a gentle, socially awkward yet genius scientist who is working on a cure for his motion sickness (the latter preventing him from getting out much), in the form of teleportation through telepods. Brundle meets Ronnie (Davis), a journalist, and, keen to find a companion in his work, invites her to his warehouse apartment. Ronnie is immediately intrigued by his work and his boyish charms, and ends up agreeing to record his work to print an article when it is complete. Almost immediately, they begin a love affair.Their affair is ultimately the making and breaking of Brundle and is the turning point of the film (rather than Brundle's teleportation through the pods). Having previously been a recluse, confined to his apartment, obsessively wearing the same clothes every day (and who considers cheeseburgers and a deluxe coffee-machine to be the sum excitement of his life!), Ronnie's sensual (and almost motherly) love awakens a passion (and conversely a jealousy) in Brundle he has never known before. Indeed, Cronenberg conveys this metaphorically. Brundle cannot teleport flesh (and there is a nasty scene with a baboon when he does) until his love affair with Ronnie - who essentially teaches him ""how to be made crazy by flesh"". This is literally what happens. Brundle realises his missing component, re-programmes his computer and the teleportation is successful.Whilst his love for Ronnie helps to complete his work, it ultimately destroys him. In a fit of jealousy when she goes away to confront her meddlesome and lecherous ex (Getz), Brundle recklessly teleports himself, not knowing the pod is contaminated with a fly. The insect is obviously another metaphor, otherwise Brundle would have fused with every mite on his body! The telepods are Brundle's only means of leaving his confined existence - a form of deconstruction/reconstruction that fuses him with an insect at genetic level which is at first exhilarating then terrifying. It is from here that (well I believe) the film becomes a metaphor for mental illness. Having lived with someone with bipolar disorder, Brundle's behaviour very much mirrors the symptoms and personality traits: initially, he is sexually insatiable, promiscuous, irritable, unable to sleep, aggressive, speaks too fast, has an almighty God complex and oodles of energy (very much like a high - even to the extent that he craves sweet foods). When Ronnie can't keep up with him, she becomes ""a drag"", who only has a ""basic understanding of the flesh"" - clearly meaning he has ""progressed"" from mere sex to a higher level of consciousness (bipolar sufferers often feel they ""see"" and appreciate life more than others). Inevitably, his actions end their relationship because she doesn't understand him.Before long, ""the insect"" starts to change him physically as well. He develops skin rashes, his nails, teeth and hair start to drop out and he is unable to eat food (food ""hurts"") - common fears with Anxiety (particularly food intolerances) when the ""high"" starts to wane and the reckless behaviour catches up with the body. What is noticeable is that Cronenberg very much focuses on Brundle's psychological changes before the gruesome physical downfall. There is no scientific explanation of why he physically metamorphs the way he does because it is really not important. Ultimately, his physical and mental state spiral down into something incapacitating (depression) and ugly until he becomes emotionally devoid to the point of dangerous (when the insect is ""awake""). He feels his only option is to merge with Ronnie and their baby, but his attempts at ""the perfect family"" fail. Ultimately, from being at his mental and physical peak, Brundle is left with nothing, marked by the fact that it is the lecherous, ""disgusting"" ex who eventually who steps up to the mark of hero by helping Ronnie with her abortion and saves her at the end.The poignancy of the film is that Brundle is always alone, no matter what stage he is at, be it reclusive nerd, arrogant genius or horribly disabled. Whilst the brief relationship with Ronnie is both tender and sweet (he even asks if it is a relationship, he is that naive) it is only brief and ultimately the cause of his demise. One can only wish he had never met Ronnie and kept to his caged existence. It shows the frustration of someone who cannot handle ""the flesh"" - i.e. a relationship - who is always relegated to a life alone constantly craving understanding.My criticism of the film is the amount of gratuitous gore which looks both dated and ludicrous (particularly when she pulls his jaw off) and which distracts from the main theme of the film, to the point that a lot of people don't get it. Also, I felt Ronnie's character was very one-dimensional - ultimately a catalyst for Brundle - although Davis brought a natural, intriguing intelligence to it and did the best she could. Also, the leads' off-screen romance helped a lot with the chemistry between the characters.A brilliant film that is probably the best so far of conveying the horrors and frustration of a world confined by illness.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gruesomely compelling,"David Cronenberg scores a victory with The Fly, and proves remakes can be as great as the original. Anyway, Jeff Goldblum owns his role and chews the screen for sure.

The fly,"Amazing for its time.Considering when this movie was made it is greatly Sophia for its time, from the way it's shown to the design of the fly the movie still holds up to todays standards. Although the plot is simple it's shown in an appealing yet compelling way, throughout the movie however there is a hint of mystery surrounding the scientist, he's always a bit unpredictable yet interesting. The acting is also quite good but of course in my eyes the best aspect of this film is the design of the fly, how each time you see it, it gets more and more disgusting and severe, the design is truly the most horrific creepy and disturbing costumes maybe in all horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Modern Day ""Beauty and the Beast""","At first glimpse, ""The Fly"", loosely based on the 50's version of the film by the same name, might seem to be just another 80's horror flick. However, after viewing and a closer look, it seems like more of an interpretation of ""The Beauty and the Beast"" than anything.""The Fly"" is as much of a love story as it is horror, and these two contrasting elements are balanced very well. It is exactly the love story elements which make ""The Fly"" work so well...who wouldn't be horrified by watching someone they love slowly turn into a monster? Both of these elements add up through the course of the movie to create a dramatic finale.""The Fly"" works if you're looking for a horror flick that is simple entertainment with cheap thrills, but is more than that when looked at by an intelligent film-goer.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Horrifying, Tragic, and Powerful","The Good: Jeff Goldblum's performance here is truly magnificent. He really transforms himself into Seth Brundle, not just as a hideous monster, but as a real person with a lot of quirks and idiosyncracies that make his dramatic (and disgusting) turn as the film progresses even more tragic. Geena Davis and him have excellent chemistry as well; I like how much of a ""doomed romance"" their relationship feels. They didn't know each other for a long time, but there was so much potential. That it evaporated before they could see it through is so sad.And that's the thing about The Fly. The practical effects are incredible; I first saw this movie as a child (bad idea) and the imagery has stuck with me since. There's something about the tangibility of what you see on screen that is so much more memorable than a CG. (Slime and goo just hit different when it's real, you know?) But that's not what makes it a special movie. It's emotionally powerful, tragic, dark, and beautiful. I can't overstate how much Goldblum adds here; his inflections, his odd cadence, his tone, convey so much confusion, hurt, anger, but eventually, pure madness. As detached from humanity as he becomes, he's never someone you can't understand.This movie is not for the faint of heart, but it does a lot less showing than you'd think. It's restrained and tasteful. To me, it's easily Cronenberg's best film and fully encapsulates his approach to filmmaking.The Bad: There are a few logical inconsistencies and plot holes here and there, even if the script is overall quite tight. I still don't fully understand what Seth does to fix his machines and make them able to carry living things; it's super vague and I get the impression Cronenberg had no idea how he would either. It's not a big deal, but it does make up enough of the plot that I felt I needed to mentionWhile the film is also a tight hour and a half, I still felt it gets a bit repetitive towards the end. Ronnie (Davis) goes to his apartment, is horrified, goes back, and this cycle continues for a couple more times. Again, not a huge issue, but it's something I noticed.The Ugly: It's funny, when I was a kid, the final scene is what stuck out to me and was just seared into my brain. Watching it now, the scene where Seth reunites with Ronnie after several weeks and he uh...eats the donut...is much worse. And the I'm very happy Cronenberg had the restraint to spare us seeing him um...film his eating process. Thanks, man.Oh, and while it's never confirmed, in my head this film is set in Toronto. Don't care what anyone says, this movie is over 40 years old, let me be happy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Disgusting indeed, but that's the way it's supposed to be","Magazine journalist Veronica ""Ronnie"" Quaife (Geena Davis) meets scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) during an interview, at a science fair-like party. Seth has been working alone on ""teleportation"", a new way of transportation, if successfully developed, you won't have to get car-sick, or air-sick, or sea-sick, or even tricycle-sick...any more. Ronnie witnesses Seth's experiments, right from the turned-inside out baboon (it seems to be a prophecy for the future horror)  to success. And eventually, the two fall in love.Seth tries to teleport himself and he makes it. What he doesn't know yet is that a housefly gets into the booth and is stuck there with him. The computer gets confused, mixes Seth's DNA with the insect's. He begins to transform into a half human, half bug monster. His changes are not just physical, not just what he looks like, but also mental. He's no longer Seth Brundle, the gentle, shy, intelligent, charming and lonely scientist, he is now vicious, aggressive ""Brundlefly"". He doesn't act like a human being, because he's not a human being. He acts like a dangerous, brutal mutant.It is fascinating to watch the process of Seth Brundle's metamorphosis. At the beginning Seth is scared, then he becomes more like a freak psychologically, although he desperately wants to be a human again. His profound sadness, shame and despair become fury when he sees Stathis Borans (Ronnie's editor and ex-boyfriend, played by John Getz) accompany Ronnie (nothing else, just accompanying her, that's all). This could be the reason why later Brundlefly attacks Stathis so mercilessly. Although it is out of self-defense (Stathis is about to shoot Seth with a shotgun, trying to save Ronnie), but Brundlefly almost kills Stathis because he has always been so jealous of Stathis and hates him so much, even Stathis is no longer involved with Ronnie.Originally it is a good intention to invent teleportation, but when something goes wrong during the scientific experiment with Seth himself, it becomes a personal tragedy. The film itself is intense, Geena Davis delivers a powerful, fantastic performance as heartbroken Ronnie. But I find Stathis Borans an especially likeable character, at first he is a bit annoying and possessive as Ronnie's ex-lover, but later when Ronnie is in trouble, he lovingly helps her and stays by her side.Followed by a compelling sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
David Cronenberg at his best,David Cronenberg is an artist and the Fly is one of his most amazing efforts- This is a remake of a much older film but Cronenberg gives it sufficient touches to be considered the maker.

Jeff Goldblum as the crazy scientist who starts transforming into a fly is great here as is Geena Davies as the reporter turned lover.

The Fly is an elite science fiction horror movie that is an absolute must-see,"I recently watched David Cronenberg's classic, The Fly (1986), on MAX. The storyline follows a contemporary scientist who involves his new girlfriend in documenting his experiments, and as their relationship deepens, he ventures too far into the unknown, making her involvement a matter of life and death.As mentioned before, this film is directed by the iconic David Cronenberg (Dead Ringers) and boasts an all-star cast, including Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park), Geena Davis (Beetlejuice), John Getz (The Social Network) and Leslie Carlson (The Dead Zone).The Fly masterfully builds tension with a well-paced narrative, showcasing the main character's transformation brilliantly. The cast is impeccably chosen, with Goldblum delivering a captivating lead performance and Davis providing strong support. The psychological and physical changes are portrayed flawlessly, while the sets, props, and special effects spark the imagination. The transformation pods feel convincing, and the inclusion of visceral gore adds to the film's impact.

"David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"".","The Fly (1986) was another movie that David Cronenberg played ""director-for-hire"". Unlike most hired guns he had someinput in the final product. The movie updates the 1950's classic giving it an 80's feel and utilizing some of the most vile effects to date. The Fly remake is more of a product of it's time than a true remake. Only a few of the elements from the original film can be found in this one. Cronenberg also takes advantage of the high-tech gore effects and a ""liberal"" R-rating in this film.Jeff Goldblum stars as the scientist Seth Brundle (this is the buff Goldblum, he doesn't look too much like the walking stickthat he was during the late 70's). He invents a device that can transport matter from one place to another. Geena Davis (looking good) co-stars as Seth's love interest. Whilst the transporter can be a miracle of science, it has some negative effects on genetic tissue. Can the two lovers make it through this picture? One has to find out for themselves.Cronenebreg reinvents the original film with some creepy results. This depressing film is a must for Cronenberg fans and horror film buffs.

So much meaning,"Seth Brundle is a young scientist who wants to perfect teleportation. Veronica, a journalist, is there to help take down his progress(an early case of taping everything that goes on, including the worst moments, perhaps especially them), and the two have a romance. One night, he tries to transport himself through the machine. And something begins to change. He soon learns that there was a fly there with him, and he's now transforming(and it is terrifying to witness) into... what, exactly? This is not a direct remake of the original 50's one(that I haven't watched, but I understand it's a pretty straightforward creature feature from the period), it's a rethinking of it. DNA was common knowledge, and other traits from the time this was made were incorporated. As he alters before our very eyes, many comparisons can be made, a lot can be taken from this. He goes back and forth between trying to accept it, even asking others for help, and refusing to see any negatives to what's happening. This could be seen as a metaphor for a deadly illness, a drug addiction or even simply the process of aging, and as he articulates what is going on inside of him and his reactions to it and we see the impact on the relationship between the two, this gets to be about so much more than it seems to be on the outside(other than that, as a ""human"" monster flick, this does utilize primal fears). Through the love triangle, sex and intimacy is seen to be potentially dangerous. We only really have three characters(her former boyfriend and current employer is the third), and they are credible and well-acted. Geena is cute and interesting, and complex beyond what ""the girl in a horror movie"" usually is allowed to be. She and Jeff work well together, it's not surprising that they were a real-life couple. The humor is great. This is grand, and the operatic score fits perfectly. The FX are amazing and hold up incredibly well. This is not one that will leave your mind sometime soon, for several reasons. There is disgusting, gory, violent and immensely disturbing content in this. The Cinema Reserve 2-Disc DVD comes with an interesting, informational and funny director's commentary track, a 2 hour and 42 minute documentary, one at 12 minutes length(both of them I will review on their own pages here on the site), one that has a 7 minutes running time, 16 minutes of deleted/extended scenes, 7 and a half minutes of film tests, 4 minutes of interviews, trailers and TV spots, still galleries, two screenplays(the initial one and David's rewrite), magazine articles and the short story that this was based upon(a decent read, takes you about an hour... I can imagine that it could be pretty easily adapted into the Vincent Price take on the concept, if you know what I mean). Yes, if you like extras, this is well worth the purchase. I recommend this to any fan of Cronenberg, and anyone who can handle how far this goes and want a brilliant allegorical tale. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Buzzz! Is it a fly? No, it's the great Goldblum","An 87 classic, I never get sick of watching.

He runs experiments in them, transporting items, etc, from one telepod to another with not always successful results. Here to witness his experiments is a reporter, Ronnie-Geena (Ms soon to be Mrs Goldblum) Davis who becomes his love interest. One night, when Ronnie leaves Seth for a few hours, to officially end it with her ex and arrogant boss (John Getz, the character actor, again great as he's been in other films) Seth, orders home delivery Chinese, gets drunk, and makes a fatal mistake. He goes inside the telepod, only a fly gets in there with him. From here, we like Ronnie, notice changes in Seth, not just physical, as he horribly undergoes the slow and ugly disintegration of a man, as if a fly. Not only that, Ronnie has got pregnant, where Seth and her did it that night, after he made the transformation, where Ronnie now knowing the full story of Seth's fate, must decide whether to keep the newborn which leads to the culmination of our tale, amidst some nice bloody bits of violence that run at occasional tides throughout this lovable horror flick. Goldblum I must say, with his long hairdo, that's unlike Goldblum, really impresses, in still one of his best performances while he has great support. He really has his moments too. It's poster design plus title, really stands out too. Special effects are fantastic. Horror flicks like this, made the eighties what they truly were.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great remake...of Icarus,"Much modern drama is not really so new.  In this case, Cronenberg took the original plot of ""The Fly"" and used it as a framework for the retelling of Icarus.Goldblum is the genius who flies so high...higher than anyone before him. Even the telepod is bottom-lit, as if he were flying over the sun.But flying so high has a price, and he pays it in spades.  The film's focus is more on his descent than on his rise.  The end is inevitable:  you know at least half way in that Seth Brundle is deluding himself about becoming a new, better creature.  You know what waits for him as he falls.The ending is as traditional greek tragedy as it gets.  Seth has met his fate, and Veronica's life is shattered.I know a lot of people who disliked this film for its ending.  Granted, it was abrupt and tragic, but that was the story.  God bless Fox for not insisting on a happy ending, as is the case with so many films these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
a classic of body horror,"""the fly"" is an original and very different film, even though it is a remake. It has an original, attractive and captivating story.It's a film with great performances, a great soundtrack, but most importantly, some of the best practical effects i've ever seen. Probably the film with the best visual effects i've ever seen.I saw a lot of similarities in this film with the most recent release, ""the substance"". I think both films have a lot of scenes in common and that they are both great body horror films.Completed, ""the fly"" is an incredible film, which continues to influence current works and which will always be one of the greatest classics of the body horror genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best movies of the decade. It's perfectly balanced filmmaking.,"The Fly (1986)4/4'The Fly' is likely the legendary David Cronenberg's masterpiece. It's a horror film, but it's got multiple parts to it, besides great makeup (which would be enough to recommend it on that alone). It is a love story, a comment on journalism, a somewhat thought piece on the ridiculous life of an overworked scientist. The movie could have been a disaster. It could have been shlockly, trivial, dumb, etc. Cronenberg took the original 1958 film, and transformed it into something truly brilliant. 'The Fly' is one of the best movies of the 1980's - a lot of movies of the era could never live up to something this dazzling.The movie follows a genius scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), who comes up with a method of teleportation, while also falling in love with a journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis). As he continues work on his experiments, one of them goes horribly wrong, and he begins to slowly turn into a fly, or as Seth would call it, a 'Brundlefly'. Meanwhile, Stathis Borans (John Getz), a former boyfriend of Veronica, tries to take advantage of the situation, and wants to use Veronica as a gateway to a new breaking story.It is hard to put into words how brilliantly Cronenberg treats the material. It is directed with the slickest style and the highest substance. Every moment is dashing, beautifully constructed, and brilliantly made. It is a masterpiece, especially for the 1980's, a decade where toothless slashers dominated. It is a movie of emotion, power, and charge. It is not only deeply thought-provoking, but also has superb make-up from Chris Walas, who did many other movies of the decade. He and his partner, Stephan Dupuis, one an Oscar for their work here, as they should have.Every aspect of 'The Fly' is brilliant, and declares Cronenberg as one of our best directors working today.4 STARS (OUT OF 4)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
David Cronenberg's second best masterpiece!,"Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on a project which is a teleportation device that can teleport molecular structures until one day he experiments on himself with it accidentally lending a Fly into the machine with him being fused. He seems normal after that but days later he is changing and even his sexy journalist girlfriend (Geena Davis) even starts to notice his weird changes he grows through each day like if he's decaying and that he will soon become a monster.Powerful and horrifying remake of the 1958 Vincient Price Science Fiction horror classic! Canadian Sci-fi/horror/thriller mastermind David Croenberg sets up another masterpiece much like ""Eastern Promises"", ""Videodrome"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""Scanners"", ""The Brood"" or even ""A History of Violence"" for proving he's a genius on all levels. This one nearly tops the original in some ways using state of the art special effects and gore from Chris Walas (""Gremlins"" and ""Scanners"") which are quite disgusting to this day like the stomach churning dough nut scene. The performances are just flawless and the film also has emotional which makes this a great Sci-fi horror movie with pure though and disturbing images, this one isn't for weak stomaches but it is a brilliant movie that goes into our deepest fears and mind.A winner all the way!

Disgustingly good,"Forgive me, but I can't stand the loftier/more experimental David Cronenberg movies. I watched his most well-known stuff years ago, and was only exploring his more obscure stuff within the last few years. There are films of his I genuinely kind of hate, and it had me worried whether I'd have a completely different experience going back to revisit the films of his I remembered liking.Well, thankfully, that's not the case. In fact, I like The Fly even more than I used to (and I used to like it a lot). It feels like someone was reining Cronenberg in a little, or making him stick to telling a story, and the result is just something that hits the spot for me. It's an almost perfectly told, straightforward, never-boring, and surprisingly emotional story. The characters aren't complex, but they get the job done. You dislike certain ones and pity others. And things build to a crazy conclusion before ending right on the emotional high (or low) point of the entire thing.It's Cronenberg being kind of conventional. He's telling a straightforward horror story, and someone let him put in all his gross body horror. And it really works. It doesn't disappear up its own butt. It's wonderful and creepy and accessible (except for anyone easily grossed out). Goldblum and Davis are also both great, the pacing is just great; maybe almost too fast (more on that in a bit), the special effects and makeup work still look astounding, and I loved how it kind of turned into a modern gothic horror movie by the end.Everything's perfect, except it's a bit weird how fast the two fall in love. Just one more scene as a buffer between them meeting and then getting involved? It just felt jarring, and I'm not going to nitpick or complain about anything else. But that part did strike me as odd.Anyway, it didn't bother me for long. Everything else about The Fly is excellent. Cronenberg in sorta-crowdpleasing mode is what I like, it turns out *proceeds to get booed off the internet by more sophisticated film fans *",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Something went wrong in the lab today. Very wrong""","A brilliant but eccentric scientist begins to transform into a giant man/fly hybrid after one of his experiments goes horribly wrong.So, every 80's movie I hear of nowadays, I expect to be entirely cheesy and nothing special. But after watching this, it altered my vision of the 80's. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, and the overall movie is fantastic! I never would've expected this. This film reminds me, and a lot of other people, of Black Swan. These two films can create a sub-genre known as ""body-torture films"" as they both display the transformation into.. well something not human. Out of this and Black Swan, I would definitely check this one out. The film has has lots of gore for you easily-disgusted people out there. Not that bad. The film isn't just about a man turning into a fly, it also has drama which makes it have a rather slow build-up. Not a problem, the film knows this and masters it. So if your looking for an interesting movie and nothing else is to watch, I would DEFINITELY see this! And this is DEFINITELY going to my Blu-ray movie collection and into my personal favorite horror movies. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

one of my favorite films.,let me start by saying i love the original Vincent price version. but this is a spectacular movie in a completely different kind of way. this movie is amazing. i first saw it when i was seven years old -I'm 28 now- and have watched it a MILLION times since then. I'm not exaggerating either. this movie broke me in at a young age and not many other films -and maybe no other film- has ever come even close to creeping me out like this one. I'm not a fan of remakes usually but this one is a BIG exception. this was before Hollywood big budget bastardized remakes. the effects are real effects done the way they were supposed to be. the way they should be done now. and the way they always should be. no phony looking c.g.i. here. this is also to this day one of the goriest films i have ever seen. and done so in a way that actually adds to the film. it just wouldn't be the same without the bodily disintegration of the main character.i absolutely adore this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The fly,"The Fly, of the same title as the book by Jean Paul Sartre The Flies, with actors in it, is an excellent movie. The first one did not go through now the second one will go through: watch it with popcorn and Pepsi and even your kid will laugh its piggy-ass off. At Cornell University I watched the year 1996 the film -Au revoir les enfants-: you will want to review the book -The Day of the Locust- when all the flies fly to the New England, Mid-West and Western states: if you understand this with the other classic -Altered States- you will fall again in your piggy ass. Watch it with you aunt Tita along a beauty ride at the magic Mountain at Walt Disney World antiques: Dracula will scare your piggy ass O.K. but I believe this one in negative will fly you to new heights.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A gruesome movie with greatly developed characters,"This tragic and disturbing body horror film has strongly developed characters which make it a surprisingly affective horror film.After a scientist attempts to teleport himself, a fly accidentally gets in with him and he begins to gruesomely transform into a man/fly hybrid.This movie is all about tension. It leads up to the big reveal of the monster at the end. Also, it has greatly developed characters. The movie does a great job making us sympathize with Brundle and at the end, it contains a tragic ending which works so well because we can't help but feel sorry for Brundle after seeing what he's been through. It's pretty hard to watch but it's fitting.The special effects look phenomenal and despite being almost 30 years old, they still look gruesome today. Few movie monsters are as disturbing to look at as this one. I once thought that The Thing (1982) had great effects for its time (which it does) but this movie clearly has put as much effort into making the effects as gruesome and realistic as possible.But I didn't like how the movie started off slow. It took half an hour for Brundle to first get infected. I get that the movie was trying to set up the characters (and it succeeded in doing so) but the first half hour felt much slower then the rest of the film. It should have been cut down a bit. However, the other hour of the film which follows is well-done and it had great buildup and tension.Despite a slow start, The Fly is a very well-done movie which has strongly developed characters. Its effects are disgusting and realistic and they still hold up today. Its ending is very tragic and it gets me every time. If you don't mind gore then I strongly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Peep This Reviews,"Be afraid. This is the epitome of ""body horror"". No need for CGI, this film is full of some of the best practical effects and costumes you'll see and they still hold up to this day. One of David Cronenberg's finest achievements. Just wow...be very afraid. A rare instance where the re-make is vastly superior to the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A brilliant fusion of tragedy and horror,"I love the way that Cronenberg fuses the tragic romance with the sci-fi horror, in much the same way that Brundle is fused together with the housefly. Though it can make the film seem corny and melodramatic at times, it also adds an emotional layer to a genre so often lacking in one. It's not a typical mad scientist film - Brundle is not crazy, and his mishap is not a scientific mistake, but a mere turn of bad luck - and so it doesn't fall prey to the typical clichés of the form, but instead forges its own narrative path. That makes it highly unique and a refreshing change from the monster movies I'm used to, even if it contains many of the hallmarks.Goldblum is really quite terrific, conveying many different emotions even while masked under layers of terrifying makeup. The way he can switch between drama and comedy, romance and tragedy without overacting is fantastic, and the fact that he manages to create a believable character at the same time is truly remarkable. It's a type of performance not usually seen in a film like this, and it's more than welcome. Both Davis and Getz are solid, but they simply pale in comparison. This is Goldblum's film.In a similar way, the film also belongs to the amazing makeup effects. They're stunning and disgusting simultaneously, and yet add another layer of realism. Even the final transformation, while being even more revolting, manages to evoke sympathy in the audience, an amazing feat for a monster in a horror flick. Indeed, Brundle's story seemed more akin to the monster in Frankenstein than the doctor, though his character embodies aspects of the latter.This is the best film I've seen by Cronenberg so far, and it's largely due the blended story, terrific lead performance, and fantastic visuals. It branches out from the typical mad scientist/monster movie into something more, a tragedy almost worthy of Shakespeare. Grounded by Goldblum's realistic performance, it does not simply show off the terrific effects, but instead uses them to enhance and perform the story. It's a rare treat in a horror film, and makes this one of the greatest in the genre, bar none.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
nothing new,"i have seen this movie in 1995 or so. The story was known to me since its was a pretty famous movie.I cant say that it is a bad movie but it was somehow boring. There was nothing intresting about the movie except that this crazy scientist, Jeff Goldblum, became a FLY !!! i dont know why he became a fly just cause there is a fly in it. The fly could become a human too. I dont see a difference. Jeff Goldblum is pretty funny. In a scene, a woman asks him whether he is a body builder or not. He says something like this since he built a matter transporter ""I crack body into pieces and then i bring the pieces together. yes, i am a BODYBUILDER"" That was perhaps the funniest scene in this movie. I would not say that this movie is a masterpiece since its a remake.",,Anonymous,Horror

Not the kind of horror movie you would expect,"This isn't the kind of horror movie you would expect to come out of the eighties.  Instead of having the main character Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) go and kill many innocent victims, the movie focuses on how a man must come to terms with his transformation (showed in graphic detail) from man to a mutant fly which is symbolic for the process of death.  It is also a terrific romance film.  The relationship between Seth and Veronica (Geena Davis)is beautifully haunting.  If you want an intellectual horror/thriller instead of the usual slasher movies, check out the fly",,Anonymous,Horror
A great movie!,"The Fly is without a doubt one of the best movies to come out of the 1980s. Jeff Goldblum gives a fantastic performance in the leading role. The movie is a perfect blend of science fiction and horror. There is also some humor to lighten things up, but beware, this movie is not for those with weak stomaches. There are quite a few things in The Fly that would gross some out. In the end, however, it really adds to the power and drama of this movie. Hands down, an excellent movie. Thumbs up.",,Anonymous,Horror
David Cronenberg's trademark saved this remake,"After watching the original, directed by KurtNeuman, back in 1958, for his last and best film, you could be scared to watch this one, made in the eighties. I was scared too. Because it seemed impossible to bring something better than Neuman's masterpiece, except maybe in terms in special effects, CGI ad so on.... But I forgot that movie was made by David Cronenberg, and his obsession in mutation, transformation topics. And that's precisely what is the most interesting here: the slow but sure transformation of Jeff Goldblum's character. It was a perfect plot for Cronenberg, the best mutation stories director ever, mutations of all kinds, physical as well as psychological. One of the most poignant ending ever made, and abrupt too.",,Anonymous,Horror
A special remake. Goldblum & Davis were the 'it' couple of Geekdom,"This remake does a good job of modernizing (80s era) the tech - I've always loved, in particular, the explanation of how the computer tried to digitally 'interpret' what a steak should taste like. How it's a simulation, not the same thing (sorta like Beyond Meat).It's an enGROSSing picture in more ways than one (my friend calls it: The Gooey Version). Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis were THE geek movie couple of the time. It's their relationship which makes the film work. Every sci-fi nerd could only dream of a woman like Geena's Veronica, and Goldblum's Seth Brundle had his charms, too. Great chemistry between them (they did have a marriage). By grounding the film on a personal level, it makes the subsequent events that much more palpable.Still, when Goldblum devolves into the Brundle-Fly and Davis' character retreats the story-telling fumbles a bit. The ex-boyfriend character, Stathis (John Getz), is too annoying and obvious a cliche antagonist and Cronenberg's insistence on body decay gets in the way of the central dynamics. The 'birth' scene, however, is still as nightmarish as it was in the mid-80s: Complete with Cronenberg himself as the gynecologist fiendishly overseeing the procedure).Still, nobody but Cronenberg could have made something as gruesomely moving as the finale with the gun despite all the orgiastic grue and viscera. Even though it was an animatronic - you still BELIEVE that it is Goldblum's Seth Brundle under all of that tech. And, that's what makes THE FLY so special.",,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic,"I saw the 1958 version of The Fly last week. That version was definitely good and way more faithful to the short story, but it's this version that sticks out even more. Much more effective, better made, overall more cinematic and much more memorable, this is body horror at its finest (or should I say, ugliest). The acting is great, Goldblum really sells the character even though on first glance he looks nothing like a scientist like that should. Davis is also effective. I've only seen a few of Cronenberg's films but this is easily my favorite of his, and you can see why it made him as famous as it did. This is strongly recommended to all audiences.",,Anonymous,Horror
This movie really isn't as bad as the posters here make it out to be!,"This is probably one of my favorite Cronenburg films.  I liked it better than Videodrome, The Brood, and Naked Lunch.  It's the story of a scientist (Goldblum) who creates the first teleportation device.  A journalist (Davis) talks with him about it and decides to go to his apartment for a closer look.  He tries to teleport a few things (apple and a cactus) and ends up screwing them up.  He tweaks the machine a little bit and puts a monkey inside, only to find out that it came out inside-out on the other side.  He tweaks it yet again and tries to teleport himself.  What he doesn't know is that a fly flew into the pod with him and their genes fused.  Geena Davis eventually has an affair with him, and finds coarse black hairs growing on his back.   This is where the movie really picks up.  People say this movie is gory, but I wouldn't really say that, it's more gross or nasty than anything.  We get to see Jeff slowly transform into a hideous mutant, losing his hair, parts of his teeth, his fingernails, and even an ear.  He also gains superhuman strength, the ability to walk on walls, and he is also able to spit corrosive acid from his mouth for digestion purposes.  Weeks later we find out that Davis's character is pregnant.  She has a weird dream where she gives birth to a giant maggot.  Towards the end of the movie, she makes one final appearance at Jeff's apartment.  He is hardly human anymore, looking more like a hunchbacked neanderthal with a bad complexion than anything.  Her ex-boyfriend comes to the rescue, only to have acid spit on his hand and ankle.  Finally, in the goriest scene in the movie, Jeff Goldblum's head splits open as his eyes melt from their sockets and he sheds his diseased-looking skin.  At this point, he looks kind of like the Toxic Avenger with a giant mosquito head.  He grabs Davis, and drags her to the teleportation chamber in hopes of fusing her with him.  Instead, she breaks loose and her ex blows the lock off the door after it closes so Jeff can't get out.  The computer makes a mistake and fuses Jeff with the other teleportation chamber (what?!?) and he comes out the other end missing his legs but instead sports a bundle of wires and cables in their place.  Geena Davis blasts him in the head and the movie ends.This movie was great because Craonenburg is simply a great director.  If he makes a film with violence in it, he tries to make it a more creative, surrealistic effect rather than the always conventional shotgun blast or stabbing.  If you like his artistic and surrealistic flair, be sure to check out Videodrome and Naked Lunch.  This movie had a sequel, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first.  It's a lot different (in a not-so-good way) and the final creature looks more like the aliens from Species than it does insectile.",,Anonymous,Horror
the best horror film of the 80's,"This remarkable film is one of the greatest in the horror genre.  Within it confronts the very real, and frightening, prospect of having a disease with which there is no control.  Goldblum pays a nerdish, awkward, yet brilliant scientist whose discovery of transputation pales into insignificance when he thinks his first ever girlfriend (Davis) is about to return to her former lover.  From here, science, ambition, and jealousy are released in an horrific cauldron.  Watch it.  Savour it. And be Afraid.",,Anonymous,Horror
Cronenberg at his best- The Fly is a must watch film,"One of the most hauntingly atmospheric and most mainstream work by Canadian David Cronenberg The Fly is an amazing film that is part horror, part science fiction and perhaps most surprisingly a tragic romance. Jeff Goldblum plays an introverted eccentric scientist who, by accident starts transforming into a housefly. Geena Davies plays a reporter who starts off covering his ""case"" but slowly falls for him. The special effects are very good, and the slow transformation is repulsive yet heart-wrenching. This film proves that old school puppetry when done right will always trump computer effects. The setting- Cronenberg's Toronto- is not just a backdrop but almost a character in itself. The actors are all very good in the role from Goldblum's quirky(a perfect casting if there ever was one) yet tragic Seth Brundle to Geena Davis as Veronica the love interest/reporter and John Getz who isn't like your typical villain. The Fly's esteem has only increased with each passing day and it will not only be considered as one of Cronenberg's most approachable films but also among the finest horror-scifi films.",,Anonymous,Horror
A gruesome and perverse vision of science,"David Cronenberg is a filmmaker whose films you just simply love or hate. He has a peculiar, disturbing, raw and perverse vision of the humanity, and in great part of his motion pictures, explosive and controversial themes like rape, incest, murder and homosexuality are analyzed in a cold and honest way. The Fly's main character is Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum, giving his career's  best performance), a brilliant scientist who works with insistence in the ""Telepods"" :two capsules that supposedly are capable of disintegrating a body and transport it to another capsule in which it is reintegrated. Seth meets an attractive and ambitious reporter (Geena Davis) in a party and the two fall in love. She starts to share with him the experiences, but something comes out wrong when Seth uses his own body for the experiment - his genetic cells are mixed up with the DNA of a fly. This is the beginning of a nightmare that will throw Seth in a mutation process. The mutation will turn him progressively into an implacable monster. Cronenberg made a film that doesn't follow the basic formulas of the gender. The Fly is not exactly a horror movie, but a mixture of drama, romance and, of course, a lot of violence, blood and gore. The Fly is so violent that makes Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 look like a Disney film.The magnificent special effects took home the Oscar in 1987, and even after 14 years, the scenes in which Goldblum progressively ""melts down"",  shocks for its realism. The director doesn't spare the audience and, unlike The Blair Witch Project, that scared just suggesting, he maintains the cameras in focus, documenting exaggerating cruelty scenes. Jeff Goldblum never delivered such intense acting in all of his career after The Fly. Without a doubt, this film deserves to be a part of any movie lover's collection  - buy the movie. Twentieth Century Fox  did with The Fly the same thing they did for Alien (1979), they released with a lot of excellence a terrific DVD, bringing extras, back stages and an excellent image and sound.",,Anonymous,Horror
fly digestion,"The best part of this movie was when the apple i-pod (or should I say ""fly-pod""!) guy threw up on the donut and then ate it anyway. Its so funny because its true! It reminded me of the time that I chewed up a bunch of oreos and didn't swallow them and then drooled them out of my mouth onto the floor and my dog molly ran over and ate them up. My sister was really grossed out, but at least I didn't throw up (or should I say ""toss my cookies"" ) on them and then eat them! At least I didn't bite her head off! At least I didn't grow giant fly hair out my back, at least not yet, and then get caught in a big spider web and yell ""help me! help me!"" while my brother Vincent price picked up a big rock and smashed me. And I certainly never married the US President of a dramedy made some 20 years later. No way!

Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.,"A clever example of science-fiction & unsettling work of horror, The Fly tells the story of Seth Brundle; a brilliant but eccentric scientist who is near a revolutionary breakthrough as his teleportation machine is near completion. Earlier only able to teleport inanimate objects, he finally is able to send through living objects from one pod to another. But while he is testing the machine on himself, a housefly manage to enter the pod & what comes out from the other pod after teleportation isn't completely Brundle.This is the first film by David Cronenberg that I've seen so I had no idea what to expect. And as the film ended, I was left astounded by what I've seen. Cronenberg's direction is absolutely fabulous & the manner in which he has structured & progressed the plot from start to finish is amazing to observe. The screenplay is very much focused on Brundle & thanks to Jeff Goldblum's superb performance, he's able to connect with us much before his accident because of which his character arc feels less appalling & far more tragic.The performances by Geena Davis & John Getz are no slouch either but this is Jeff Goldblum's film all the way. Cinematography & editing plays its part well but it's the make-up department that deserves the most applause for its equally shocking & impressive design of the creature & Brundle's gradual transformation. And the music by Howard Shore leaves no stone unturned in turning this cinema into a potential nightmare. On an overall scale, The Fly is one of the best films of its genre that even today remains as disturbing an experience as it was during its time of release.A must for fans of horror, a must for fans of science-fiction, a must for fans of David Cronenberg & a must for anyone who is looking for a cinema that would make them skip their meals for a day or two, The Fly is highly recommended. Turns out that the makers of this film truly meant it when they put out the tagline: ""Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.""",,Anonymous,Horror
"Why I haven't seen this before yesterday, I do not know","Ok, so I was at a film festival last night, and they were showing The Fly as one of their features.  I had never seen it before, so I go thinking it's going to be a cheesy horror flick.  When Goldblum steps out of the transporter, I was expecting a human with a fly's head.  Little did I realize that the horror of the movie came in this man's fall, his inevitable change into ""brundlefly"" and his slow decent into insanity.  The real horror comes from the movies disgusting scenes (something that was lost in the 90s), and I should have known what I was getting into when the baboon turned inside-out.  I personally thought that it was quite possibly the most disturbing horror sequence I've seen, and part of the fun of watching The Fly.  Try watching this movie in a theater with surround sound if you can, the score augments the horror precisely.  Basically, I'd recommend The Fly to anyone who is a fan of horror and wants to find a diamond in the rough.",,Anonymous,Horror

The acting is superb .... Jeff Goldblum provides a fantastic preformance as Seth Brundle....and is quite a trooper for wearing all that nasty makeup ....definately deserved an award. Geena Davis is great! Especially with all those emotional scenes and the love scenes....very convincing I must say and John Getz plays Stathis great! As I watched him act out those scenes were he was acting like a total dick , I was convinced seriously and I was thinking ""wow   he's a *beep*"" . The special effects are VERY WELL DONE ...The Telepods....Brundle himself..The birth scene..the fly..his jaw getting ripped off....the monke...scuse me BABOON... and the teleportation act itself was well done. This is one of those movies that get passed up on how great it is and what terrific actors are in it for unspectacular bullsh** like ""From Justin To Kelly"". And The plot is well written may I say.. . And I am the target audience for movies like FJ2K .. Im only 14!! I am over impressed with this movie. But The Fly 2 is another story.All In All  10/10  I own this on tape and DVD!!!!P.s. I wish they would re-release this movie on DVD so we can see those deleted scenes ! And Hopefully if they do  Maybe A Commentary By David Cronenburg, Jeff Goldblum , John Getz and Geena Davis?",,Anonymous,Horror
Real science and THE FLY,"The greatest thing about Cronenberg's version of THE FLY is how insightful it was about its science.  In 1985, when this script was being written, Cronenberg and Pogue almost certainly could not have known how close they were to the truth of things regarding DNA.Scientists have known for quite a while that just as all computer programs can ultimately be broken down to 1's and 0's, the fundamental building blocks of human life are the same in all living things.  Human beings and flies share over 95 percent of the same DNA code.  So, the concept of combining these two things on a ""molecular-genetic level"" is not as far-fetched as it might seem.  In fact, scientists actually have done it the other way around.  They have replaced sections of fruit fly DNA with human DNA, and bred honest-to-goodness humanflys.A much newer discovery is even more fascinating in light of THE FLY.  Dolly, the sheep clone, recently developed arthritis.  That's not interesting in and of itself:  sheep commonly get that ailment.  The strange thing is that Dolly got it at a much younger age than she should have.  Scientists believe that it has something to do with the fact that she was cloned.  It's as if the sheep lost something in the copying process.Now, this does NOT make scientific sense.  Cloning is like copying a CD: it's digital.  The exact same DNA should create an organism that has exactly the same body (and chance of getting sick) as the original.  But the real-life experiment with Dolly seem to bear out the idea that there is something creepy and mysterious about messing with things on a genetic level, even if--scientifically--it seems like everything should be kosher.So, in the FLY, when Jeff Goldblum starts slowly metamorphosizing, with both positive and then very negative results, I believe it's scary because it rings true, and we actually believe that it would happen that way.How cool is it when science-fiction actually predicts science, and not the other way around?",,Anonymous,Horror
Mutated to perfection,"The Fly is definently the BEST horror movie in the field.  The script is strong and interesting to say the least.  The acting is superb; Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum show excellent chemistry on camera.  However, I do not recommend this film to those who easily hurl at the sight of intense gore. The F/X are very unpredictable as Goldblum goes through many stages of mutation into the final form of ""BrundleFly"".  The finale is entertaining, but this is one of the many times when the F/X take over your stomach and push your dinner out onto the floor.  The film is almost flawless.  A 9/10.",,Anonymous,Horror
