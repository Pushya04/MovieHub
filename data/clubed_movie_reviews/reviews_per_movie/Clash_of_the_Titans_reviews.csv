Mishmash of the Titans...,"I've never seen the 1981 original version of Clash of the Titans. I wasn't originally planning on seeing this new updated version either. Going by the previews, this looked like nothing more than a CGI-fest...which is what it pretty much ended up being. To quote Sam Worthington from various interviews, it's basically him ""in a skirt with a rubber sword, killing monsters"". If you're expecting anything more than that, then yes, you will probably be disappointed.Some of the cast manage to make the most of what they're given to work with. Having not seen Sam Worthington in anything prior to this film (except Terminator Salvation), I don't really have anything to compare his acting to. He was good in Terminator Salvation and he's good in this as well (despite the occasional slip-up of his accent). He serves his purpose as Perseus, playing the action hero well enough. His interaction with the humans who accompany him on his journey is probably the most entertaining part of the film. Mads Mikkelsen, who was a memorable villain in Casino Royale, actually gets to play a fairly decent good guy in this film (Draco). Sure, it's the role of the typical grumpy guy (who's reluctant to follow the ""saviour"" and is a bit of a bully) teaching the hero how to fight and who eventually comes around to respecting the hero and ending up on good terms with him...but Mads manages to make his role a bit more than a cardboard cutout, thankfully. The other men who accompany Perseus aren't too bad either (they do provide a bit of humour), but they're not given much character development at all. Actually, there's very little development for any of the characters.As far as the gods are concerned, they're basically just a bunch of folk who stand around in Cloud City (I mean Olympus) and talk. Liam Neeson isn't given a whole lot to work with as Zeus (shining in his silver armour as brightly as Marlon Brando did in the original Superman movie wearing his tinfoil costume). Ralph Fiennes, while good, is kind of irritating with his raspy voice as Hades (though, thankfully, that goes away by the end). The rest of the gods have jack squat to do or say.I really didn't like Jason Flemyng's satyr character. Alexa Davalos pretty much just plays the damsel in distress in the movie and leaves very little impression as Andromeda. Gemma Arterton (as Io), however, proves to be the most successful female character in the movie. As a sort of angel on Perseus's shoulder, she guides him, teaches him and actually proves *useful*. Her and Worthington work well together/have good chemistry and I enjoyed watching the two of them share scenes. I was happy with how they ended up in the film.As for the FX, the previews basically give it all away (Clash of the CGI might have been more befitting a title for the film). Perseus fights giant scorpions, Perseus fights the Kraken and Perseus fights Medusa. As large-scale as the Kraken was, I personally enjoyed Medusa more. The fight with her proved to be the most interesting of the many fights in the film. I liked the 'look'/design for her and I also really enjoyed Pegasus, the flying horse.I'll just come right out and say it: the movie has many a flaw. The story isn't great, the pace is off, the writing is slapdash and most of the dialogue is sketchy at best. While the movie does try to get across a message, it comes through in a somewhat haphazard sort of way. Having said that, if you go into this film not expecting much more than a Monster Mash of the Titans...then hopefully it should prove to be entertaining enough.Crap of the Titans? Not quite. But at the same time, it's kind of forgettable. As Worthington describes it, it's a ""popcorn flick"". Take from that what you will.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, but not enough Titans","Clash of the Titans, from the title alone, made many promises. We expect to see many monsters of Ancient Greece, and we expect them to do battle, alongside humans and the Gods. We expect many many epic battles, lots and lots of CGI and appropriately over the top performances to go with them, but mostly, we want the monsters. While Clash delivers on some level for each of these promises, it surprisingly really lacks in the monsters department.It must be said as fair warning, you do not get to see Kraken VS Hydra or anything like that in Clash of the Titans. The action is centered squarely around demigod Perseus, who for our purposes is basically a man secreting badass. After Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken on the city of Argos, Perseus and a group of soldiers go in search of a way to kill the Kraken, encountering many perils along the way.The problem is its always Perseus and the soldiers who end up fighting the monsters. I'm sure I'm not the only one who expected the beasts to fight one another at some, mythology be damned (not like its particularly close to the myths anyways). Only four real combat beasts emerge anyways: the Kraken, Medusa, a mutated Acrisius and some random giant scorpions. Not even the Gods get to fight much, despite the much-hinted battle between Zeus and Hades.The Kraken in particular really should've had a battle with another beast thrown in, and its use seems like a wasted opportunity. The scorpion battle is quite exciting, though is broken up as its really four fights with different scorpions simultaneously. The Medusa sequence is easily the best of the film, as although we know from a plot perspective Perseus can't die, the fate of the group of soldiers is considerably less clear. It all makes for a very tense and rewarding sequence, somewhat hindered by the surprisingly poor CG on the Medusa character model. Shame, as the rest of the monsters are quite good looking.The cast is quite good on paper, but it doesn't work as well as expected. Worthington is a suitable lead, but I see him heading to Stallone-esquire B-movies quickly if he doesn't find more interesting characters. Liam Neeson is fairly underused, and aside from the ""Release the Kraken"" line, never gets any moments. Ralph Fiennes is the biggest disappointment as Hades, spending far too much of the time whispering like a bad Sith impersonation than being actually menacing. The standout is easily Mad Mikkelson as the leader of the soldiers. While not a terribly meaty role, he has more than enough charisma to be much more interesting than Perseus himself.Clash is definitely not a waste of a matinée ticket, and I felt I got almost what I expected. But I know it could've been more, and it seemed to be purposely saving certain creatures for a sequel. Its solid fun, but hardly the must-see some might think from the trailers.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An entertaining and action-packed movie, but don't study for your Classical Lit exam with this","""Clash of the Titans"" (2010) provided everything its cover image and trailer promise, except for the part about authentic Greek Mythology, but if you can get past that you'll have a good time. The draw of the film is fast paced, adrenaline pumping action, a lot of tough guys & gals who never smile, and really cool monsters and special effects for 2010.It's rated PG-13 for some violence and gore, and there is no sexuality, nudity or profanity (except 1 awesome use of the word b*tch). The ""violence and gore"" is shot very fast, so even though it depicts people being ripped in half & such, it's not quite as disturbing as, say, a Quentin Tarantino film where you watch a guy slowly bleed to death for 15 mins. In other words, this is good stuff to watch with your teenage kids or puritanical parents, either way.There are some big names on the cast, and all performances were solid, but nothing really stood out as remarkable. That is to be expected in a fast paced film. But I would have preferred a powerful monologue or two just to use the talent to its full potential. I will say Ralph Fiennes did a chillingly original portrayal of ""Hades"", making him to be a twisted, limping, bitter wretch who still possessed terrifying power and fury. He is definitely my favorite part of the production.Now on to the bad, which others have covered in detail so I'll just graze over. If you think you can study for your Classical Literature exam by watching this, you're going to get flunked all the way back to James Whale's 1931 ""Frankenstein"" (the most successful yet inaccurate adaptation of literature ever). Different characters in mythology seem to have been transposed, juxtaposed and just plain posed for the sake of this 2010 story. The biggest liberty is that here our hero Perseus is fighting against the gods when the original literature shows that he was tremendously helped by the gods by being given special weapons and gifts. In this film he is given those same gifts which he indignantly refuses but then later sheepishly accepts them because they'll save his life. I'm not sure if that was meant to be hypocritical, ironic, or just a sloppy oversight in the screenplay, but it's worth noting. Just what exactly is this film saying below the surface? That humans have outgrown gods? Or that we ultimately still need gods?But for the most part, this gives us a decent taste of Greek Mythology which was truly the origin of the timeless scifi/fantasy/horror genre thousands of years ago. Chances are, most people will simply enjoy this movie for its action, fantasy and special effects. For that, yes, it delivers. But for literary accuracy... well I would be terrified to approach any literature teacher with the mere mention of this movie. That teacher would kick my Assaracus out of school and I'd be crying all the way Homer.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"~Great CGI effects, very enjoyable, worth your money~","I saw Clash of the Titans in an early screening, and I didn't expect the film to be good. I thought it was just another ripoff. But at the end of the film I was really liked it. The creatures looked great, the acting was good. And I thought it would be corny, but the majority of it wasn't at all. I am actually really glad that I saw this film. I really think Sam Worthington did an okay job as an actor, it was certainly believable. If he keeps doing films like Avatar and Clash of the Titans, he could have a long career in his life.The special effects and the CGI was okay. However there was some disappointments, the Kraken scene felt very rushed and it wasn't as epic as I wanted it to. There should've been more fighting scenes to make up for the poor story.An overall fun, good CGI film that is recommended. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Little to take away; good or bad,"Clash of the Titans reminds me much of my feelings towards last year's blockbuster Wolverine; satisfied, but far from enamoured. During the running time we are roused by the numerous action sequences, the special effects are well done and the plethora of A-list stars keep the story grounded (at least to some effect). Yet after the screen last grown dark there is little to remember; bad or good. You know you had a fun time no more, no less.You will not find me clamouring for the DVD upon the films home release date but I would not be above having another look if I came across it on TV. Mostly, I am torn (As you can surmise by this pseudo- recommendation). I went in expecting dumb fun and hammy acting and I got just that but to that same effect, Clash is nothing to write home about so to what standard should this film be held? Pondering aside, I will move forth and let you make your own final ruling.The 1981 original of the same name (which I admit I have not yet seen) has those devout followers in equal part to those who find it a dated clunker. With 2010's Clash I can by no means foresee this following any trajectory other than that of a by-the-numbers blockbuster; cult status is not in this movie's stars. But as I alluded to it is entertaining popcorn fluff, bogged down however by an overabundance of mish-mashed lore and mythology. Clash does not play by any sort of rules but seems to make them up as it goes along. Whenever our heroes find themselves in peril a character or creature pops up with a unique skill to save the day. There is never a sense of tension or danger as you can tell that a hidden gift or plot contrivance will appear to vanquish all foes along with narrative coherence.Clash of the Titans is at its best during the action set pieces and I suppose that is the only real reason to venture out anyways. Whether it be giant scorpions, the monstrous Kraken, the cackling Medusa or the gods themselves the battles are first rate. Amidst these, dare I say clashes, our half man half god Perseus (Sam Worthington, who was proved himself to be a charismatic leading man) sets out on a quest spurred by the deaths of his mortal parents. Prophecy has foretold he will be the one to defeat the mammoth see creature called the Kraken and weaken its master Hades for good (or something like that). Despite the aforementioned oodles of mythology, plot takes a back seat and truthfully would you expect anything more?As the immortal brothers we have Ralph Fiennes as Hades and Liam Neeson as Zeus and both are the real stars of the movie in my opinion. Neeson brings the appropriate level of pomposity and empathy to the character while never playing it too straight; he knows what movie he's in. Nobody can play evil like Fiennes and his Hades apart from being realized skilfully in a visual sense, is very menacing portrayed in a forced whisper. Kudos should also be given to Mads Mikkelsen as Draco (a gritty companion or Perseus) who strikes a delightful balance between humour and badassery.It often annoys me when people affirm that people should take a movie 'for what it is', especially for outwardly awful cinematic blunders. Clash of the Titans is neither one of these blunders (at least not entirely) and frankly in this case, it is what it is.6.5 / 10.0Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Occasionally entertaining, yet ultimately hollow","Ah, the pre-summer action movie. Admittedly, due to word of mouth from those who had attended earlier screenings of the film, my expectations for Clash of the Titans were fairly low. On top of that, many of the initial casting choices appeared to be somewhat suspect. So, what's my verdict? Well, I didn't hate itThe plot of Titans is extremely straightforward – practically to a fault. Often, the film acts as though it's in a hurry, attempting to get from one action sequence to the next as quickly as possible. The scenes that occur in between each of these battles ultimately amount to nothing more than brief segments of exposition delivered by Perseus' ""guardian angel"" of sorts, Io (Gemma Arterton). So, while the film never really drags, it feels very soulless.And while we're on the subject of these action sequences, none of them end up being particularly memorable. About half of them are so frenetic to the point where they're almost disorienting - honestly, I'm glad that the 3D screenings were sold out this time 'round. On top of that, there's virtually no character development outside of Worthington's character (and even he isn't all that likable), so I never really cared about the outcome of these action sequences either. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my biggest fear with Titans was in regards to the acting, and thankfully, most of the cast do what's expected of them. Neeson's Zeus aside, none of the performances truly stand out, but they're nothing cringe-worthy either.Ultimately, Clash of the Titans ends up being a forgettable piece of entertainment with a couple of gaping plot holes, hit-or-miss action sequences, and performances that fail to leave much of an impression. It's not horrible – just hollow.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining enough but not memorable.  Slightly disappointing,"This is one of those movies of which I had high expectations as a blockbuster. sorry folks, this is no blockbuster, it is nowhere as good as 300 and the recent Percy Jackson and Lightning Thief scores for me a whole lot better in terms of interpretation of Greeks mythology.Sam Worthington as Perseus is likable but thats about it. He is no Sean Bean and doesn't deliver a strong enough character performance for me for a 'demi God' and the women throughout are models rather than actresses delivering good lines.The opening boat scene is intriguing enough but the first let down is seeing the haircut of Perseus on the beach as a child, trying to connect where he was and what he was doing, it didn't wash for me. His taking to the Argos King and Queen and the confrontation inside the Palace was bizarre.I agree with comments about the Krakken and the Medusa, they could have made more of Medusa and exploited more the real myth of Perseus and Medusa. My 11 year old son liked the film and things like Zeus giving Perseus the coin to enter the Hades underworld (same as in Percy Jackson) was interesting.I don't say the film wasn't interesting or entertaining and there were some great scenes but I didn't go to see a mix of King Kong meets Lord of the Rings. Too much wizardry for me and the logic of Greek mythology became lost. Too many corny lines, poor lines, too much emphasis on the action without really connecting it to the story.Certainly not a film to see in 3D.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It made me sad watching this ...,"The myth of Perseus is based on deep philosophy and tragic elements, which have been popular throughout the centuries. You may want to Google it and read the original. You might discover a few things that didn't know, for example that there is no Cracken, no scorpions, and that Medusa's head ended up decorating goddess Athena's shield, just as real shields had often Medusa painted, to scare the opponents.The Cracken and the scorpions were ""invented"" by Ray Harryhausen in 1981, because this was his job: to display fantastic creatures on the screen. In doing so, he based the stories on existing myths, respecting the characters and plots as best as he could. Great work.Now, why in 2010 they had to copy the copier, and not the original, it is a mystery for me. Scorpions AGAIN ? Cracken AGAIN ? I mean if you're going to deviate from the myth, why not deviate in an ORIGINAL manner ?Mythology is the legacy of the centuries gone by. Film makers should respect it and learn from it. It's funny how they think they can do better :)",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Juvenile adventure-fantasy about the valiant Perseo who  undergoes a perilous journey to free Andromeda from monstrous Kraken,"Imaginative spectacle based on mythological Greek legends spectacularly realized by Louis Leterrier and formerly adapted (1981) by Desmond Davis and Ray Harryhausen. Exciting fantasy derived from Greek mythology about a valiant and handsome hero (Sam Worthington as Perseo , role formerly played by Harry Hamlin ), the mortal son of God Zeus (Liam Neeson whose character was interpreted by Laurence Olivier) who must face a variety of extraordinary challenges in pursuit threatening Medusa and kill Kraken. Winsome Perseus, the son of Zeus , must save the gorgeous Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos in the role previously acted by Judi Bowker) who is daughter of Cassiopea ( Polly Walker) . As the son of Zeus embarks on a risked voyage along with a brave group (Mads Mikkelsen , Vincent Regan, Luke Evans and Gemma Arterton), all of them go to stop the underworld ruled by Hades and its minions from spreading their evil to heavens as well as the earth. Trouble appears in the shape of monstrous Calibos (Jason Flemyng in double role also as Acrisius) and the God Hades (Ralph Fiennes). In order that the horrible Kraken not be released, virginal Andromeda has to be sacrificed . Then Perseus fights giant scorpions , gargolas , monsters and searches for the three Stygian witches , confronts the snake-haired Gorgon and slays her ; her head is the only mean that can defeat the sea giant called Kraken . Perseus attempts to rescue the beautiful maid from the terrifying massive monster freed by Poseidon .Overwhelming fantasy based on Greek legends with breathtaking special effects in computer generator and 3D . However I miss the primitive creatures made by the pioneer and maestro of great illusion Ray Harryhausen and his assistant Jim Danforth in the first and classic version directed by Desmond Davies . Extraordinary support cast playing the Mount Olympus Gods as Zeus -Liam Neeson- , Hades -Ralph Fiennes- and many others . However , everyone are overshadowed pretty much by the spectacular but excessive special effects .

Release The Crappen!,"And once again Hollywood proves it has run out of original ideas. Why else would they remake this movie? Back in 1981, when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films, we had the original CLASH OF THE TITANS. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences, especially when Perseus (Harry Hamlin) met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods, how they felt about humanity (and how humanity felt about them) dominated the storyline. Yes, there was an ACTUAL story.Fast forward to 2010 and you get this ...this ...this mess-of-a-remake that relies almost solely on CGI and, well, basically nothing else.The brief understanding of the god/human relationship is thrust aside in favor of action scenes galore which have squat to do with the story. There are so many throwaway characters as to be laughable. And 3-D? For marketing purposes only. Save yourself some cash and see it in 2-D ...if at all.My son went with me to see it (he's as much of a movie junky as I am) and we both nearly fell asleep for lack of anything approaching a viable understanding of who was carrying the storyline. We still ask each other, ""What was the point, again?"" Sam Worthington seems to be a hot commodity in today's movie market. TERMINATOR SALVATION and AVATAR are two of his more recent accomplishment. And although I found those two to be lukewarm in terms of story, they at least kept me engaged enough not to yawn. And Liam Neeson has also been splattered all over film posters (from TAKEN to KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). But a god? And Zeus for that matter? Not the best casting choice. He just didn't have the presence I was expecting. Perhaps the story (or lack thereof) stifled his performance. Probably.I also MUST caution women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here. There's really no good female character to be found. The closest was Alexa Davalos (DEFIANCE) as Perseus' love interest, Andromeda. But her role is so laughably short and misunderstood that you won't care what happens to her (and things do happen).My final word of caution comes to those of us (all of us) struggling in today's economy. We need our escapism, and sometimes (occasionally) Hollywood allows us to have it. But not here. You might as well sit on the toilet and release the crappen!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Remake the Kraken!,"This CLASH OF THE TITANS, it turns out, is a marked improvement over its original version, at least for someone (me) who has no nostalgia for the original. That it's almost an hour less than AVATAR is one of the best things about the film; whereas AVATAR was predictable and long, CLASH is predictable, but brief. The plotting is brisk and action-packed, eye-roll dialogue is kept minimal, and, it's good, stupid fun watching Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes partake in the time-honored tradition of great British actors slumming it for blockbusters. As divine brothers Zeus and Hades, these guys are clearly havin' a laugh, just as Sir Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith did in '81 when they screwed around Mount Olympus for a hot shilling.Read more at STEVENSPIELBLOG.COM ...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good Story but Presentation Failure,"The change of story is a definitely fresh choice which is great. The emphasis on more action is definitely fresh as supported by great Visuals.The Plot being switch to Perseus revenge is a great move also. (You cannot follow the same old story) However the movie failed to present itself properly throughout the end with loopholes and unexplained being noticed everywhere.Still the lack of different type of monsters (e.g the two headed dog, Calibos with his tail, the great Vulture) is the biggest disappointment though the CGI for the scorpions and the Kraken looks great. The flying Cyclops is really wasted the budget efforts as I cannot see their face at all.I really expected more to come from this highly budget movie over the original stop motion movie which makes me begging for more.There are also not enough invention and ideas to make the plot look meaningful such as the riddle from the original, special powers such as the helmets and the shields.The appearance of Hades on the mortal world looks silly. (No Gods will appear in their true self before man), Statuttes or material forming his face will be a better choice.The addition of Io is hampering the direction in the movie because she only knows how to talk. The loss of Bubo role as a sidekick to Perseus also contributes to the unliveliness in the movie. The soldiers accompanying Perseus on the quests still appears feasible and helped to make the quest more interesting.The witches scene was also unimpressed as I found that the witches had foreseen Perseus is ready to visit them. For the battle of monsters, the action on the scorpion looks great though there presents many loopholes. It is contradicting on what the hunters gives the scorpion's armour as a protective shield while Draco could pierce the top of the scorpion with a spear.It is strange that Perseus could survive inside the scorpion after there is a great impact when the scorpion rams through the cement structures.Medusa looks unreal in her face and her secondary appearance which have sharp teeth put her even more unconvincing. Furthermore she does not even look scary at all and it is ridiculous as she moves so fast as though she is riding on a bike.The original with her scary and fearsome appearance create more buzz in such way.There are many loopholes in her scene however I found that the most important why the charcoal man is ahead of Perseus and ambush Medusa at a certain place where he is not running at all.The final scene with the Kraken is better than the original though the flying Cyclops is uninteresting themselves is getting on my nerves.Conclusion the more invention of special powers,more monster, more interesting scenes and less loopholes on the original gives a better edge over this.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
3D ripoff,"This film would have been in line with Louis Leterrier's previous work: highly enjoyable high octane action movies that even adults can appreciate.

Wait to rent it on Blu-Ray.,"3D is not perfect. Avatar may have shown its full potential whilst Alice in Wonderland and How to Train Your Dragon have continued to prove it can be utilised successful, but if not given the time and effort it requires, the third dimension on screen can actually detract from the movie. Unfortunately this is the case here. The last-minute decision by the filmmakers to add the extra dimension feels tacky and lazy. The objects in the foreground don't seamlessly meld with those in the background and a lot of the action is blurry and unfocused. The desert-brown palate is dimmed even more by the glasses – something the aforementioned movies could cope with due to their vibrant colours – and all of the wide shots are blotchy at best.It's a shame really as some of the action scenes are quite impressive and boast fairly decent special effects. The various creatures we encounter aren't quite always photo-real, although the sheer size of them – especially the tentacular Kraken – are impressive enough to wash away any glaring flaws. However seeing as this blockbuster lives and dies by its amped up, large-scaled sequences – the screenplay is utter tripe and doesn't even bother to try to make the links between the action interesting or reasonable – it regrettably falls on its own sword, thanks once again to the indolent 3D. Take that away and you might actually be able to enjoy the CGI and the ridiculously big set-pieces with the picture clarity they deserve.New Aussie on the block, Worthington, takes a misstep in his recently flourishing career; his acting is wooden and unconvincing. It doesn't help that Perseus is a massively underwritten role and only requires Worthington to look good and occasionally mutter something heroic. Neeson and Fiennes come across as cheesy in their roles of Zeus and Hades respectively, their experienced acting chops can't save them from atrocious wigs and laughable costumes. Standing out – which isn't overly hard to be honest – is Arterton and Mikkelsen, they give decent performances as the heavenly Io and the disgruntled Draco.If you must see this on the big screen then do yourself a favour and see it in normal 2D.

Just Say No to Crrrrahhken,"Ah, another great movie opening yesterday: ""The Clash of the Titans"". What I mean by that is not that it was a great movie, but a great opening; I mean, what's not to like? It's a summer movie in the spring. Grab your popcorn, kick your feet up on the seat in front of you, and enjoy. Almost any movie can hold up under these favorable conditions.Well, ""The Clash"" does hold up okay. Now, I'm not one to expect Oscar-worthy performances from a movie like this; but it was a bit disappointing to see Liam Neesan, Ralph Fiennes and that other guy who was recently blue in Avatar just PHONE IT IN. Liam Neesan plays Zeus. What a great role. It's like saying, ""Liam Neesan is a Jedi."" We expect great things. Or Ralph Fiennes as Hades. Hades!!! Wouldn't you expect some bluster, emotion, EVIL??? He looks bored as he hovers around in a black cloud. ""I'm Hades...(yawn)...RULER OF THE UNDERWORLD...(zzzz)."" Okay, but what's worth the popcorn? The Cracken, or as we say it with a bit of Ahhhhrish (you have to roll the ""r"" in the back of your throat - that's it) - the Crrrahhken. This is a great creature from the deep. I think it's the same Cracken that was in Pirates of the Caribbean, but it's been working out. ""Release the Crrrahhken,"" says Zeus, now a little upset that the movie took this long for him to get to his line. You can almost picture Liam Neesan saying, ""Release the Crrrahhken so I can get out of this really hot armor,"" or ""Release the Crrrahhken because Ralph Fiennes is SOOOOO boring."" Don't take this as a negative review. I mean the Stygion witches and the giant scorpion pack animals are really quite nice, and the CG version of Medusa is okay too (actually, I thought the Umma Thurman Medusa in Lightning Thief was better). And there's this dude with blue eyes who looks kind of like a mix between a tree trunk and a Transformer, with very halogen-blue eyes. This reminds me of two Hollywood producers sitting around talking about the plot, and one says, ""Hey, my cousin has this really cool alien costume that he never used in 'Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull' so how about we put that in the movie for all the kids. They love aliens, and this movie doesn't have ANY aliens! GIVE ME ALIENS!"" You'll see what I mean.For those who remember the original movie, with Burgess Meredith as Perseus's ""trainer"" and the robotic owl (it actually makes a brief appearance in this remake), this movie is prettier, but just as campy as the first one. For you youngsters out there, ""campy"" means you'd rather GO camping than try to explain the plot. The plot is so dismal...ugh! But here it is in one sentence: Demigod Perseus has to show the decapitated Medusa to petrify - literally - the Crrrahhken before the princess - yes, she's very pretty, but who really cares if she dies - becomes Crrrahhken fodder.Regardless of what you may think about this show, it's great summer movie stuff.

A waste of money,"Clash of the Titans is a bad fantasy, adventure film. I have not seen the 1981 film of the same name, but I might be interested in checking it out in the future. I could not believe my eyes when I saw that this movie cost 125 million $ and that it grossed almost 500 million $. It makes me sad that such movies earn so much money.First of all, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I didn't understand anything from the action scenes of this film. I found it weird that some people could not understand the action in Transformers and its sequels when I had no problem figuring out what was going on. This being stated, the action scenes in this film are very confusing, especially a scene involving giant scorpions. At first there was one scorpion and minutes later, there were about 5 more and I couldn't figure out where the hell did they come from. I blame this on Louis Leterrier, the director of this film. Definitely, the worst part of this film is the directing and I can almost say that it is one of the most poorly-directed films I have ever seen.Second of all, the script is full of stupid lines and a lot of scenes in the film feel cheesy and worthless. The characters suffered because of this and not once was I actually rooting for Perseus to defeat Hades. And when some characters stood out and I actually got interested in them, they immediately did something which put me off.The acting of the film is most likely the only good aspect, but not a stand-out. The actors who did a great job were Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They were awesome, although after thinking of it, Hades' voice was too similar to that of Lord Voldemort, but no biggie. Definitely the two of them worked great when they were on screen together and they possibly represent the only good aspect of this film. Another character I liked, but was barely in the film, is that of Spyros, foster father to Perseus, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite. Maybe Gemma Arterton as Io and Mads Mikkelsen as Draco are also worth mentioning. Now I don't know if his acting was the worst in the film but it definitely annoyed me the most. I'm talking about Sam Worthington. Can he be more hollow than this?! He is the same character in every film and I can't understand how he gets so many important roles.Overall this film is a 6. I was wondering if I should go higher but after further thinking about this film, it's definitely the correct rating. I suggest you avoid this film unless you are very bored and are in the mood for some mythological-related action.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh how the mighty titans have fallen,"I, being a huge fan of the original, was probably more excited to see this movie than anyone. And in 3-D no less. So...I walk into the theater with my 3-D glasses on my head, holding my $5 popcorn and get ready to watch my favorite childhood movie and...and...and...oh no. Oh no. This is awful. I sat through the movie wondering why I don't care about any of these characters. On top of that, I'm wondering why I spent the extra money to see it in 3-D. The best 3-D effects came during the opening credits. Other than that, I could have thrown the glasses away. Now I know why James Cameron is not a big fan of making films 3-D after the fact. To make a long story short, I was incredibly disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Go see the original ""Clash of the Titans"" if you want to lose yourself in a good movie. After seeing this one all I could think of was ""oh how the mighty titans have fallen.""",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun fantasy movie,"After his roles in Terminator 4 and the blockbuster Avatar, Sam Worthington continues his fantasy leading man roles as Perseus in the remake of the 1981 cult classic, Clash of the Titans. This is a new imagination of the timeless mythology of the world of gods, monsters and men. No stop-action animation and obvious miniatures this time.Perseus begins his life simply enough as the son of a fisherman. But life soon takes a cruel turn when the only family he knows is taken from him by the gods they serve. Soon he is presented with an opportunity to get justice by a chance of birth, his own. He is told he is the son of Zeus. But Perseus takes no pleasure in this information, he spurns it. He even turns down an offer from Zeus himself to be given sanctuary and end his quest of revenge. Ultimately he embraces being a demi-god to strike a blow at the gods that no mortal man ever could.In this adaptation Perseus is not motivated to battle medusa or the kraken to save the damsel in distress, Andromeda. No, he is on a mission of revenge. This is what I liked most that gives this contemporary Perseus an edgier demeanor. He is of the mindset that if Andromeda or anyone else happens to benefits from his conquests cool, but that is not his goal. He is a man with a single focus and determination, destroy Hades.Continually catching my attention in this movie were the locations. There were views from mountain tops overlooking a sea of clouds, barren inactive volcanoes to jutting cliff sides, visually stunning.The story line is predictable, so what is there to like? The fight scenes! He and his companions battle witches, gigantic scorpions, a deformed king, medusa and finally the kraken. With the new digital technology you believed they were fighting those scorpions. Medusa on the other hand; hey, even with new technology medusa and her head full of snakes is only going to look so real. But, I love to watch a good fight.

Plenty of CGI and noise fills the time left by an absence of anything else,"The original film is a nostalgic mix of mechanical owls, Division One footballer haircuts and lumbering beasts in my head – no more than that. I'm sure if you put me on the spot to comment on it I would have fond things to say but perhaps this is only due to the passage of time. Perhaps the original Clash of the Titans was nothing more than a rather wooden effects movie like this remake is – but yet for some reason the 1981 film is given praise for it and this remake was battered for doing just that. Well, I don't have enough memory to be able to compare and contrast so I will just focus on what I watched last night.It is just what it suggests it will be by producing endless CGI beasts and effects in one serviceable action sequence after another. I only saw it in 2D (3D still not really attracting me) but I have to admit that the size of the creatures and so on was impressive even if only in terms of being to see all that money up there on the screen. Of course this is not the same as saying as the film is particularly good – because it isn't really - it is only ""OK"". Part of the problem is that it is a very hollow movie; everything looks pretty good on the surface of it technically, but there is nothing below this. I'm not suggesting that the film must be some worthy epic with layering and character depth, but to be honest I would have settled for a bit of fun or a bit of actual excitement rather than just lots of things to look at. As it is though the film is all about the effects and nothing else is really forthcoming.You can see this in the cast – not so much their names (because there are some big names in here) but more in their performances. Worthington is a solid actor and good looking guy – that is what he brings to the table and in this film he probably does enough with that. Neeson and Fiennes have nothing to do – Fiennes in particular looks awkward and uneasy with his character and it is clear this film is a ""job"" to him rather than a project. Flemyng is OK under all that makeup while Atherton is pretty but pointless. None of this is a surprise though, it is not a film for actors but rather for effects.Clash of the Titans is a shrug of a film. If you are looking for undemanding noise that will not tax you one bit mentally but will provide big creatures and spectacle to stare at then this will do the job. It won't do the job particularly well, but it will do it and then move on – you'll have forgotten it within a week though as generally it doesn't have much special or of interest about it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Clash is unmemorable but too fun to ignore,"During the era of divine defiance, a man named Perseus is forced to see his family killed under Hades' hands. He vows to kill him and stop his evil from spreading onto the worlds of Man and God. The plot is as paper-thin as can be and provided opportunities for big action, sounds fun for an adrenaline-fueled director but not the audience during their sit-through. As for me, it was entertaining as hell but sure is forgettable by the next morning.ACTING: Sam Worthington is certainly capable of showing rage alongside with being tough and all bad-ass, which is something you only see in 1/3 of Avatar. However, there is a sequence where he absolutely does not show how Perseus is tormented by his childhood or torn at the incident that fuels his revenge. This is the same when at Medusa's Lair where he has to face the losses of characters quite close to him. In the end, what we have here is a character so ""stone"" that he seems more artificial than realistic, or in this case, more God than Man. Thankfully, he seems more versatile now rather than when he was Marcus 'Mechanical' Wright in Terminator Salvation. But then again, he has room to improve. Being Io, Gemma Arterton is under jeopardy the most as story-wise she is unnecessary to say the least and her accent is a bit of a turn-off (remember QoS?). Gladly, she proves that she is one tough shell when directly in the fight with Perseus and that accent only adds to her alluring exoticness. Her chemistry with Sam albeit not solid on any level but you can sense some light relationship tension between the two, which is good enough considering the movie is not about developed characters. The supporting cast is full of familiar faces, but they are heavily underused or written. It is so sad to see Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are so expendable for a story about Greek mythology (where is Poseidon?!). And don't get me started on Alexa Davalos and Mads Mikkelsen. In short, the characters are really put to where they are in this film - that is, if you are a main one, you are put to the highest spot and the opposite otherwise.SCRIPT: Like I said, people will be easily put-off by the too straightforward of a story that 'Clash' has. Even more, the dialog twists the common knowledge on Greek mythology just to give sense to the plot e.g. the Kraken does not attack near shore and it is not a creature that belongs to the Greek myth universe. The lines are sometimes quite good but most others they are just sub-par (probably due to the delivery?). Yet, in general they do not add more dimension to the character. The Gods are script mannequins, as they are just there to do nothing when expectations run high about seeing them. In reality, none of these issues are even bothered with since viewers are already so drenched in the ensuing chaos.DIRECTION: Louis Letterier will always be to action-philic and hating story. Having seen him doing exactly so in The Incredible Hulk, in which the character literally (and visually) screams ""destruction"", this movie has the formula that he can effortlessly bind to. And it shows. The action sequences are huge, better choreographed than Hulk, consistently fantastic and perhaps more fit-to-context than the horrendous Transporter 2, where realism of automobile sequences is bent to madness. It was smart that after a CGI sequence, a shot of real-set scene is immediately followed and this helps in grounding the audience in believing the universe in 'Clash'. Very well done, I might say. As an action-first director, it is wise to beforehand expect some quick cut shots. However, in my opinion, they will not be as hurtful as Bourne series that many seem to complain.MUSIC: While the music is more along the lines of John Powell or Harry- Gregson Williams for 'Clash', that does not mean Ramin Djawadi will not put a hint of rock in the score, which is what he did so well in Iron Man. It amps things up to an extent and serves the situation properly. Most notable is the score for Hades, where Ramin employs a typical repetitive tune that just oozes homage to the antagonists of cinema. Oh, the nostalgia! In short, Ramin Djawadi's take on Greek myth is perhaps a bit more techno than what we should expect but he does it with absolute flair that to not love is just impossible.CINEMATOGRAPHY: I'll be short with this one since you have to see how amazing it is for yourself. There obviously are plenty of swooping angles and wide shots that display the grandeur of the locations. Interestingly included in the combo is decent hand-held camera-work in fight scenes that greatly enhances the battle's intensity and makes the effects believable. Lens flares are used, making the images lively and ""not sterile"", as J.J. Abrams put it. In other words, Peter Menzies Jr. is just an awesome cinematographer.VISUAL PRODUCTION: Flying horses, a snake-head woman and a colossal octopus might seem far-fetched but the visual effects team makes you feel they are really there. The sets are detailed, gigantic and adaptive to the current mood of the plot. My only hitch I got is the scorpions, where their movements are a bit iffy at times and their close-up shots display some hazy effects build. Besides that, can I get a ""WOW"" for it?'Clash' is the very definition of style over substance. Greek myth has a huge effect on viewers but it was left to dust for this one, making this ride unmemorable but too fun to ignore. See it for what it is: a popcorn flick (and in 2D is enough).From Vietnam, Denisvn93-1",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was 'OK',"Went to see this movie at an early screening. The previews/trailers made this movie out to be EPIC, Avatar epic...Well, it fell short of that lofty goal. The movie was 'OK' for me. The 3-D was decent, but I thought the effects in Avatar were far superior. To me, the best part of the 3-D was in the opening monologue.I am not a huge Sam Worthington fan. It seems that all of his roles he ends up having the same range, that is to say little to none. The look of the gods was silly, I though. Most of the action sequences were very well. There were 1 or 2 parts in this movie (and I won't give them away. I'll let you decide for yourselves) where I watched the scene unfold and was just like 'Huh? That makes no sense.' I give the movie a 7 because it was better than it should have been, but not as good as it could have been",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should this be compared to the original?,"I am fortunate to have survived to see both movies on their launch day. Given that I was still a young lad when the original premiered.I vaguely remember being awe-struck by the myriad of creatures and monsters in the movie. I was even covering my eyes when Medusa made her monstrous appearance in the original. This was the movie that led me on my life-long ""quests"" to discover European and Middle-eastern mythologies.The cast, acting and sets were state of the art then (so was the stop motion capturing of various creatures). It was a blockbuster then and was much talked about in its time.Forward to April 1st, 2010.This movie struck me as a run-of-the-mill, CG-laden movie based on the original. This new one has a good cast, although most of the other Greek gods have little or no dialogue at all. they were just images that stand or sat there, like holograms. they have almost no interaction with each other or the mortals.CG in movies have reached an extent where it is no longer a novelty, but a must-have. Even so-called rom-com usually comes with various CGI touch-ups that we never really pay attention to. The creatures and environments created by CG, are pretty standard, even though they are well-designed.Acting is good all-round. The only person I detest in the movie was that doomsayer who coax people into giving in to Hades. I found the character to be over-acted and frankly, quite very annoying.However, the action sequences are well-choreographed and nicely edited. they were exciting enough to keep me from getting too comfortable with the back of my seat.However, I found the final fight to be some what disappointing. I was expecting sword-fighting sequences, but most of the time was dedicated to an aerial chase and the grand entrance of the Kraken.Overall, if you are looking for a Troy or Lord of the Ring, look elsewhere. This one is purely an adventure set in the Greek mythos with thin plot and story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Clash of the Titans,"Clash of the Titans is one of the earliest films I can remember having watched it as a kid in a big theatre, not the multiplexes we have today, and I liked it so much, it probably ranks up there as one film that I've watched the most times, on television reruns, or off a recorded video tape. The story's fairly simple, but to a kid it had plenty of charm, and a basic 101 guide to Greek mythology, of which the promiscuity of the Greek gods struck me as quite odd, save for the need to produce plenty of demi-god heroes from which stories are spun of.Percy Jackson probably drew first blood in saturating the market about the new adventures of a fresh teenage demi-god, having him battle creatures similar to those found in this mythology. In fact, Clash of the Titans would find it difficult to beat the fun factor of the original film, and the modernized spin that Percy Jackson had to offer. There's little story here, and everything that happened was a sad excuse to get the story quickly moving onto the next big set action sequence. Lead character motivations had been changed significantly, especially with Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) being nothing more than a flower vase, and having her romantic subplot with our hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) being totally removed. I felt that was the first sign of narrative trouble.Then it became more generic approaches in how to string the action scenes one after another. Each battle will last a significant amount of time, then a little more posturing, before going onto the next. It can easily be split into this sequence of scorpions-medusa- kraken, and each creature design was a shadow to predecessors like Scorpionok's attack in Transformers, Uma Thurman's rendition of Medusa, and Hollywood's Godzilla flop, coming complete with that foam on water approach to the mainland.If anyone wants to make a film about a hybrid character, then look no further than Sam Worthington, who has been half man half machine in Terminator: Salvation, half man half Na'vi in Avatar, and now, half-man half-god who's tasked to save Andromeda of Argos from being monster sacrifice, should he be able to defeat Hades' Kraken, the source of his power and threat to mankind. Worthington seems pigeon-holed into these kinds of role, and because of Hollywood's current dearth of worthy action heroes, Worthington becomes the latest It boy with his physique and perpetual scowl, being suited perfectly well into this scarcity of actors who can act with their fists, without the compelling need to launch into lengthy dialogue as a professional and career development.Otherwise the other star studded cast don't do much but pose and prance about in their costumes, with Liam Neeson looking constricted by his Zeus armour, Ralph Fiennes playing Voldermort all over again with his rendition of Hades, and Mads Mikkelsen as Drago the Argos general who has the nicest smirk caught on screen. Gemma Arterton is a surprise inclusion in the film as Io the immortal, which is a new character and given a lot more significance in the mythos now, and is in part one of the major changes in Perseus philosophy, tutoring and motivation, so much so that if I were to use a modern term, the word ""cougar"" would suit their relationship just fine.And it is these kinds of little artistic license taken, that will likely leave the purist in you perturbed. Bobo the Golden Owl has a quick cameo to appease fans, but like the gods who are never satisfied with the pittance of worship obtained from the humans, we too think that it's not enough, since Pegasus too went through a none too subtle change in skin colour. Sorry, but to me, Pegasus the winged horse, will forever remain white. There are a few conversational pieces in the film that brilliantly introduces us to the world of the jealous Greek gods and they work wonderfully, such as their innate differences and why the brothers Zeus and Hades hate each other so much, but some were rather cringeworthy, especially when modern curses somehow found their place in a swords and sandals film as this.I suppose you'll know by now that the film was never shot using 3D technology, and that it was only during post production, thanks to the mega box office success of Avatar, when it was decided to have a 3D version made for this film as well. The result? Millions spent enhancing nothing. Sure there's depth of field, but nothing to wow a jaded audience familiar with what a 3D film is expected to bring to the table. In fact, this film would be better off seen in a digital 2D format, since none of the action sequence even had a whiff of a suggestion of being in your face, since after all, it was conceptualized for a flat presentation.Bottom line, it's extremely sterile and devoid of soul, whereas the original film had plenty of heart, and charming stop motion special effects to alleviate it to cult status. This one will likely be forgotten since it's nothing more than mediocre drama and ordinary set action pieces, though I will not deny that its marketing would ensure that it will garner some decent cash from the Easter holiday market segment. The original is so much better since this is all generic action and little charm.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Perseus, Let's get Kraken","Greetings again from the darkness. I have a weakness for the 1981 version and still get a kick out of Ray Harryhausen's stop-action art in that film, as well as the Sinbad films. One of my favorite trivia questions is ""What film starred both Harry Hamlin and Laurence Olivier?"". That cracks me up, and stumps most people ... even though most have seen the original.Director Louis Leterrier provides a remake that is very much a film project of current day despite the mythology involved. Here, Liam Neesom as Zeus and Ralph Finnes as Hades are (not so close) brothers supposedly battling for the same thing - getting those pesky humans back in line. This comes after the army of Argos gets fed up with the whims of the Gods and makes a move toward independence. You either know the story or not, but either way shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the movie.Sam Worthington, fresh off his ""Avatar"" fame makes for a solid Perseus, the half-son of Zeus (thanks to an earlier trick, that most would call rape). However, I never could make sense of his perfectly barbered look of facial and scalp stubble, while those around him all sport the late-60's Hell's Angels look. Gemma Atherton (former Bond girl) plays the quasi-God who is to protect Persues, and Mads Mikkelson (former Bond villain) fights alongside him. However, this is not an actor's film.The special effects are bountiful. Hades comes and goes as a cloud of thick black smoke and is quite comfortable splitting himself off into a flock of evil-spirited flying dragon things. Pegasus, the flying horse is back, as are the giant scorpions, who are much bigger and badder than before. Still don't understand how they went from mean to sweet between scenes. Of course, the coolest thing is Medusa and her hairdo of creepy, crawly snakes. That's one bad chick. The most impressive special effect is the Kraken, Hade's underworld pet who is ""released"" to destroy mankind (unless Perseus can stop him).There is one humorous tip of the cap to the original, but most of the other shots at humor fall extremely flat. This is not a movie to see for the dialogue. The mythology and wonderment of the Gods have a certain appeal, though this one certainly falls short in providing us any real insight into the daily tasks of the lucky few on Olympus. So enjoy this one for what it is ... and stump your friends with that trivia question!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For better or for worse, this movie is a kick","Most people, yours truly included, usually approach writing a review of a movie as a chance to rip it. Finding faults with historical misrepresentations, factual blunders, inept acting or direction, even criticizing the composer of the soundtrack for a less than stellar score. This review is different. While I have read some of these criticisms about this movie, I personally do not think that any of them apply.This movie is, above all things, great fun.Anyone who watched the Harry Hamlin version of this story back in 1981 and wants to compare it with this one would do well to remember the differences in cast and production capabilities. The special effects for this new trip with Perseus are excellent. The creativeness and production values are way up there on the scale. And, while the dialog may occasionally slip into the region of corn and cheesiness, the story flows in an entertaining manner and doesn't leave the viewer wanting for much.Probably the only real criticism I had was regarding the Kraken. Yes, it was fearsome, ginormous, loud and, in general, everything you expect a mythical monster of mass destruction to be. But you never get to see a complete picture of it. OK. I'm picky. So sue me.So grab your popcorn, Jujubes, sodas and hot dogs and sit down for a rousing and action-packed movie.

OK, maybe acting and dialogue aren't the best at times, maybe the plot leaves you wanting for something more, but who cares, if you are looking for any kind of depth, this movie is not for you. Clash is just for those looking for a fun and adventurous ride.When i was little i really loved ancient Greek mythology. I read the stories over and over again and when i saw the trailer i was like ""awesome"". At that point i knew instantly that there is no point for hoping for any kind of accuracy and after seeing that campy and godawful ""300"" i was kind of sceptical for this one. I am really glad and thankful that Clash succeeds at everything ""300"" failed at. It is great, its not overforced, visuals are way better, we have a plot which works well and acting is fine too.All in all, it was a great watch and i really loved it.

Trash of the Titans,"You know, i really looked forward to this. A movie about gods and creatures set in the ancient world? Well, i like movies set in the ancient world, movies with creatures and movies about gods. So this could have been the blockbuster of the year for me. In addition, i am a fan of the 1981 original and felt that, with todays advancements in special effects, it would be spectacular. But it turned out to be the disappointment of the year (at least so far).And i am usually quite tolerant with movies like this. If they are fun to watch, the creatures are well done and the visuals are impressive, i don't care much about story or characters, as long as they keep the movie going. Hell, i even like ""Dragon Wars"" and the Japanese Godzilla movies! But in ""Clash of the Titans"", the story and characters are so terrible bad that i just can't overlook it. The Story has great potential and i even like the changes they made to the original. But it is so badly told that i never had a chance to dive into it, to get carried away. The same goes for the characters. They are so hollow that i never cared if one dies or not. It was as if i couldn't watch the movie, but only notice it. I sat there in the theatre and yeah, i was aware that there was something going on on the screen, but i didn't care. That was really strange.And the worst thing is that i had to endure the non existent story and characters for almost half the movie before anything happened that was spectacular enough to distract me. And even then, because i was already bored and didn't care for the story or the characters, it just didn't impress me that much. Yeah, the creatures are well designed and executed (except the Medusa who was almost as bad as the scorpion king from ""The Mummy returns""), the action quite spectacular and the visuals really impressive. But in a movie that is as bad as this one, it just is not enough to turn the rudder around. If at least it had the charm and fun factor of the Japanese Godzilla Movies, but it hasn't. It is just bad. Without charm, without fun, just bad.My advise to everyone: Even if you usually like this kind of movie: spare you this one. It just isn't worth your money and time.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Shallow, Hokey, kind of fun (not quite enough though)","The year is young, but Clash of the Titans qualifies as the hokey semi-epic of 2010, the same way Forbidden Kingdom was to 2007, or 10 000 b.c. was to 2008. From a lobotomized point of view, I suppose the action scenes make up for the total lack of story and the frustration generated by the pointless use of characters and bad acting. So I guess, the film is superior to the 1981 version, but it's got a long way to gothe story is a retelling of the Perseus myth, and the screenplay does it no justice. It feels rushed and cheesy, with not a moment of time spent on intelligent dialogue. Director Louis Leterier likes to stage his fights in martial arts cinema tradition, and although he takes it a bit over-the-top with too many slow-mo shots, I suppose it's fun stuff. Of course, it has nothing on his last movie, The Incredible HuIk. Also, would've liked to see a little more from the climax, which is far too short, and presents a pretty big plot hole (which for obvious reasons I wont describe)The geology of the movie is fascinating, but half of it is not Greek. (I know I've been to Greece). It's pretty easy to recognize the volcanic ash fields of Argentina, used in numerous movies before, or the lush green wet forests from the Pacific coast. Not like any of this is a real problem. I also like the make-up jobs on peoples faces, although to be honest Ralph Finnes and Liam Neeson look more Viking than Greek, and ironically Zeus's beard 'clashes' with the color of his armour.Sam Worthington is hot stuff, but he cannot act. He's the new Jason Stathum. It's not like he has much to do or say though. Clash of the Titans is just another case of poor script = mediocre movie. The special effects do make a difference next to Ray Harryhausen, but the movies intention to honor him, is inept, and I think it could've delivered more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poor movie in every aspect,"This movie is possibly one of the most poorly written screenplays out there. The characters can't be related to, the supporting characters aren't explained and die very quickly, the whole movie feels rushed and incoherent, the action is cliché and predicable, the climax is 2d and involves no engaging plot twist, and the ending is just as silly as the rest of the film. I think the people who wrote this film should find a new job. Also, the acting was very poor. The actors look like they are standing in front of a greenscreen and saying their lines in a ""cool"" accent. The costuming is either plasticy or obviously CGI. While this type of movie may be amusing to ten year old boys, it does not stack up against other movies of the genre.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Swords and sandals in 3D epic adventure treatment,"With the boom in 3D in recent years, Greek tales are an easy choice for a cinematic extravaganza. A modern take on the old Clash of the Titans (with a few old references to the old movie) this is as you would expect. Big action, big set pieces, big monsters and big kills.The story encompasses Greek god rivalry, family revenge, mankind's attack on the Gods and statecraft. Yet this is all in the way of the action. The storyline just doesn't develop enough and the directors are just setting all up for the action scenes. That's disappointing as with Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes playing the warring Gods, there was room for a stronger story.The graphics and the actions are impressive and fine, but not more so than many other of the ilk in recent years, so doesn't amaze as could have. Possibly getting harder to do so.Overall, it's a fair popcorn flick which could have been more. It lacks the character of the old more popular version of the film which is a hindrance to this. Not a bad film, just nothing special despite the big cinematic treatment.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I actually really liked the improvements to Medusa, and while the other creatures did not have any of the personality of Harryhausen's work (very few CGI creatures do, in my opinion), they were pretty cool and I enjoyed those scenes.it did feel like a throwback to 1981 and to some of Harryhausen's movies. Which is not necessarily a good thing. Outside of Ray's creatures, the movies were sometimes dull, predictable and the acting mediocre. In many ways, this movie had the same flaws.But in the end, I enjoyed it and didn't regret seeing it on the big screen. And yeah, I plan on getting the DVD.I deliberately saw this in 2D based on the reviews I saw. Reviewing the film I really can't see how 3D would make a difference, so unless you have a burning desire to spend extra money I would think the 2D experience is fine.I didn't go into the plot, because that is covered by other user comments, but there were some nice plot twists over the original and some very nice touches of humor (which works here and did not work very well in the original).There was something that was lacking however, to make this a great film. Good, not great.if you go in with reasonable expectations, you might enjoy it.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beyond dreadful. Appalling.,"Think of the worst film you have ever seen. Now double it. That film is Citizen Kane compared to this utter dross. This film is so bad I almost don't know where to begin. Firstly the 3D is the worst I have yet seen in a movie. It's blurry, dark, the 3D effect makes things just behind the forefront - like people's ears and the back portion of their heads look really huge and fake. The special effects are pretty bad, with poor CGI. The gods look like rejects from a kids TV version of King Arthur, stomping around in glowing gold armour that is 1500 years too late for the period when the film is supposed to be set (yes I know it's a fantasy, but it's still set in Ancient Greece). Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson are incredibly hammy and unbelievable, especially Fiennes who comes across like a villain from a Kid's TV show.The script is wooden, the editing is poor, with some serious plot holes. The casting is dreadful, with the heroes mostly spindly with puny arms and legs, that don't look at all believable. Jason Flemyng is sooo bad as Calibos, who was a very menacing figure in the original, despite being made of modelling clay (and much more scary than Flemyng in the remake). The acting is also very poor, but the worst problem of all is the atrocious Sam ""the woodsman"" Worthington.His Aussie accent sounds totally absurd in Anciert Greece, he looks flabby and untoned as a demigod. His delivery is so bad as to make his screen presence almost totally absent...Please don't just don't go and see this film. The 1981 original is far better (and that's no masterpiece).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Sam Worthington stiff, lot of CG","The Gods demand the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or they will unleash the Kraken against the city of Argos. Perseus (Sam Worthington), demigod son of Zeus, accepts the task to fight the Kraken. To fight the Kraken, he discovers that he needs the head of Medusa.They got some big names to play gods including Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes. Gemma Arterton plays Io who guide the quest. This is chalk full of CG battles. The biggest problem with that is the rush to put it in 3D. Many complaints follow, but if you watch it in 2D, there shouldn't be any problems. The acting is basically stiff. Sam Worthington is not a natural acting, but he has the built to be heroic. It does get too chaotic, but it's pretty watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing Special,"Just your basic action movie fodder.It's not particularly big, it's not clever, really, it doesn't have much going for it.One of the serious hindrances is that you don't connect/care about any of the characters: I felt no anger towards the Gods or any sympathy towards Perseus. It was even hard to notice when any of the characters died! However if you're hoping that this will be compensated for by mind-blowing fight scenes and dazzling special effects, then prepare to be disappointed, as it certainly doesn't do that. The final showdown at the end is especially brief and for me a total anticlimax.I watched the entire thing completely unmoved and only vaguely entertained.All in all, utterly uninspiring but not particularly terrible.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Special Effects without the Charm of the Original Movie of 1981,"I totally agree with JoeB131 that wrote in the title of the previous review: ""There should be a rule against remakes"". ""Clash of Titans"" (2010) has great special effects, but without the charm of the original movie of 1981, one of my favorite fantasy films ever. The plot of this remake is very weak; uses a black Pegasus; forgets the delightful mechanical golden owl Bubo that makes a cameo only; and creates a diversion to the viewers with gorgeous actresses and stunning special effects. The awesome ""Total Recall"" seems to be the next victim of these brainless greedy people of Hollywood. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Fúria de Titãs"" (""Fury of Titans"")",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great but horrible,"The movie was really good but it had a $?!/ ton of flaws. It had a really good story, good cast, and good action. Those were all the pros now to mention the cons, that will make this review as long as a kraken. Bad vfx, bad dialogue, to short, bad acting, bad cinematography. I could go on for hours. I watched this movie with my Dad and my brother. My Dad said he'd rather not watch it because it was all junky, and when I watched the movie I could tell what he meant. My brother searched it up and said, wow it's old as, it's from 1981. This is the 2010 version, but to be honest most of it looked like it could be from 1981.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

All that this movie existed of was battles with 2 lines in between broadly explaining the next creature to fight. Don't get me wrong, this I had expected. But even the fighting scenes were bad! All you could see was people running at yet another unoriginal monster, only to see them flying in the next frame as they apparently have been knocked back! or something anyways...Why did I not listen to the warnings of all those reviews I had read saying that I shouldn't go...

I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing the movie because I already feel like I've lost 2 hours of my life while watching it.I was anticipating this movie like a child anticipates Christmas because I loved the original as a kid. I figured with all the new technology, they could really do something special with CGI rather than stop motion clay animation. This movie must've been rushed because the CGI didn't look much better than the clay original. If you've seen the movie already, just remember the whole Medusa scene! Not originally meant to be 3D... yep, you sure could tell. Just the studios way to suck another 4 bucks out of us at the theater.I'm done, I could go on all day long about how bad this movie is.

great steaming piles of poo,"I only give it 1 because nil is not possible. I recently watched High Plains Invaders, only because it 'starred' James Marsters, and when I say that that pile of steaming excrescence was Citizen Kane in comparison to this $158 Million Hollywood 'Blockbuster' I think you get my point. I paid £5 at Tesco for the DVD of this only 1 year from its cinematic release and that should have warned me. But I was prepared to give it a go. I think I will go and paint the back bedroom as watching paint dry will be more exiting. I saw this for sale immediately after seeing the original on Film4 and the other half said that she would be interested to see how it compared. All I can say is that it does not bare comparison. The original was inspired and well original, the copy less than a reflection in the back of a bronze mirror.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots of action,"The humans wage war on the Gods, and in order to succeed, the Demi-god Perseus, son of Zeus, goes off to find and kill the Kraken. So far so good, but if my memory of history lessons serves me right, the Kraken belongs to Scandinavian mythology. It allegedly resides outside the coast of Norway... To be fair, the Greeks had grand monsters too. The fight a two-faced coin; Zeus gave life to humans, but he is also dependent on their love and worship.It's an epic movie of an epic tale. Grand sceneries and battle scenes. Love, death, and danger. I, however, found myself cheering on the Gods and not the humans. I realize that Perseus is supposed to be the hero of the story, but it's not really working out. I don't know if it is the actor or the script, he just doesn't do it for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sam Worthington can't be a lead actor,Definitely not as good as the original but entertaining nonetheless less. I really enjoyed the CGI. But Sam Worington just doesn't do it for me.

a BIG let down,"A remake of a classic which just can't compare to the original despite the digital effects. I was expecting so much more! The film didn't really seem to have any content, very poor dialogue, a few battle scenes and a non-existent climax at the end. The 3D was a huge disappointment (after watching avatar) and if anything made it harder to follow the fast action movements on screen. Aspects of the film were poorly explained, for example one quick shot of an owl, which didn't appear to have any relevance to anything else. Despite the star cast they just couldn't pull it off! The set of the gods and the hazy glow around Zeus, brought back a Flash Gordon-like image to my mind. I went with 3 friends and none of us would recommend paying money to see this film. Shame really.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
very free adaptation of Greek mythology,"It is true that many people in Greece were offended by the treatment Greek myths receive in the hands of the movie industry. This movie gave reason to do that again. I am not sure if that is a correct reaction though. Since mythology is not history one can take liberties with mythology since myths have many versions and no canonical corpus exists.This has happened in the present movie where the Greek elements of myth have been enriched by the sea monster Kracken-which I have first encountered cinematically in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""- although the Kracken in Clash of the Titans is much more impressive. It is also strange that being a sea monster is not under the control of Neptune but of Hades. Also some Beduin/magicians which seem like the magicians Xerxes had with him in the ""300"" have been added, giving a ""Prince of Persia"" quality to the the movie. They ride huge scorpions also. The monsters of the film are disgusting enough, especially the fluids oozing from the giant scorpions when killed or mutilated, as well as the former King Acrisius turned in Kalyvous.Except the crude monsters, the citizens of Argus, that is the humans of the story, have a distinctly middle-eastern flavour and the soldiers are called a legion although this is a Roman and not Greek military term. On the other hand the gods inhabit an ethereal universe and their outfit reminds one of seventies pop groups.The most inspiring moment of the movie is the bonding that exists between Perseus and the team of warriors that follow him in his quest to defeat the Kracken and save Argos. It reminds one the bonding among Ulysses and his comrades- and the similarity goes further since only he survives.The interplay of gods, humans and monsters is good and attuned with the Homeric poems, where those entities co-existed and manipulated each other. The relations of the godly family are no better than most human families since sibling rivalry is rife between Zeus and his brother Hades, ever envious for his brother's predominance over Olympus while he has been relegated in the shadowy underworld.Good moments exist and the film has an actor from ""Agora"" who from fiery parabolano has became a hunter thus creating a tradition of portraying characters in a semi-civilized state. The film may be crude and sometimes even buffoonish but I will not agree that it is a total failure since it has some sound moral message about comradeship and courage in the face of odds.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Utter Tripe,"Sadly, this movie follows the very tired blueprint that so many other subpar movies do these days: 1. Poorly developed characters. You don't get a chance to connect with them early on, so you don't care about them throughout the film.2. Dramatic music during every second of every scene. Ugh.3. Over stimulation through computer-generated imagery.And let's face it, Sam Worthington would probably be a great underwear model but he sure as hell isn't an actor.If you liked the original, go rent it and send modern Hollywood a message: that they won't get your money until they earn it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Don't espected 1/10 of the original because you wont get it. When you watch the original you see bad FX, but such a envolving story that you will believe in the magic of the movie.This movie doesn't have magic at all.

Another Bad Remake,"You know a movie based on Greek mythology is bad when Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is a masterpiece by comparison.Sam Worthington (Avatar, Terminator Salvation) stars as Perseus, a demi-God who must defeat the kraken before it and its owner, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), God of the Underworld, takes over human civilization. And. . .that's pretty much it. Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) wasn't interested in story and character development. He just wanted to get to the next action scene. What Leterrier fails to understand is that action scenes don't work when the audience doesn't care. Perseus fights demons, beasts, and Gods in spectacular actions scenes but there's nothing to get excited about since interest is absent. And to make matters worse there's the 3D. Unlike Avatar, Alice in Wonderland, and How to Train Your Dragon, this film was converted to the format at the last minute to cash in on the fad - and it shows. It has the worst 3D in recent memory. It's sad when Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser was a better 3D experience.So, if you haven't, just watch How to Train Your Dragon instead or just rent the original 1981 version with Harry Hamlin. With the recent increase in 3D prices there's no reason to waste your money on this garbage.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Silly Fun,"When one considers the epic sweep of Greek mythology it is clear that it was the closest the ancients could come to the effects-laden blockbusters that delight audiences today. In this spirit, ""Clash of the Titans"" is exactly what it should be- a big, spectacular, effects-laden blockbuster with an undemanding plot and a good helping of eye candy. The story centers on a young man named Perseus, who steps up to save the city of Argos from the monstrous Kraken. In order to do this, he and a small band of soldiers have to face all sorts of perils so that he can get the only weapon that can defeat the aforementioned beast. His efforts are both helped and hindered by the gods themselves who cannot decide whether mankind should be taught love or fear.This film is a whole lot of fun. The plot moves at a good pace and the running time passes quickly. The monsters are imaginatively designed and skilfully brought to life by CGI. Also, the numerous battle scenes are exciting and well-filmed. Another nice touch is the inclusion of elements from Norse and Arabian mythology. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are obviously enjoying themselves as Zeus and Hades- the lords of Olympus and the Underworld respectively. Sam Worthington is decent as Perseus but he is really a bit dour, a little bit of humor would have gone a long way. However, overall it is very clear that nobody is supposed to take this film too seriously. This is a very successful update of the 1981 original and provides it's audience with a highly enjoyable night out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"CLASH OF THE TITANS (Louis Leterrier, 2010) **1/2","When I first heard about this one, I was not enthused – not just in view of Hollywood's lamentable obsession with remakes (and it no longer even matters whether the original was successful, or for that matter any good, to begin with!) but also because the 1981 film had been partly shot over here in Malta and had been among my very first trips to the cinema!In retrospect, the result is more or less the equal but certainly not preferable to it – especially when pitting the earlier version's charming stop-motion technique vs. today's over-reliance on CGI; for all the progress in the art of visual effects, nothing they came up with here can be compared with Ray Harryhausen's still-amazing creatures from the original: especially lacking in this regard are the none-too-scary Medusa and the absurdly ALIEN-like Kraken dispatched in no time at all during the climax!Sam Worthington in the lead role of Perseus comes across as appropriately stoic but still miscast, given that his mannerisms are all-too-modern! Liam Neeson, then, is imposing as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes a menacing Hades (though some of the latter's over-the-top antics brought to mind those cheesy effects-laden flops from my childhood days – namely BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, HOWARD THE DUCK and THE GOLDEN CHILD {all 1986})!; incidentally, watching this, I completely forgot these two actors had already appeared together in SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993).The new CLASH OF THE TITANS is oddly compact (running 12 minutes shorter than the 1981 film), so that it then ends up feeling somewhat undernourished as a narrative! For one thing, I did not approve of the various plot changes: why should Hades (who does not even figure in the original) hold dominion over the Kraken when it is a creature of the seas, hence Poseidon's territory (played here by a barely-glimpsed Danny Huston – which goes for the other Olympian gods as well)?! Similarly, Calibos' role is diminished in favor of Hades (not to mention, sporting a far less terrifying guise than Neil McCarthy's in the original) and, in the same vein, Perseus gets a fellow demi-goddess for a lover (Gemma Arterton as new character Io rather than Princess Andromeda – again, greatly undermining the latter's stature and Perseus' interest in his quest to begin with!). Yet another novelty is the Gill Man-like creature(s) Perseus & Co. meet in the desert: with this and the tamed giant scorpions, one has almost begun to perilously tread ""Star Wars"" terrain! And what to make of the hysterics of that insufferable high priest, inciting the people to human sacrifice in order to placate the wrath of the gods?!Mind you the film is more than adequate entertainment for the duration (with reasonable action sequences and a surprisingly good sense of a devastated world) but it is also not particularly memorable or rewarding – unlike the earlier version which, furthermore boasted a majestic music score that finds no equal here. In this respect, it is telling that the only previous effort I had watched from director Leterrier was the likewise unoriginal (if slightly better) THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Amazing What You Can Find At Argos These Days!,"Clash Of The Titans (2010) -I bet that they had a Kraken time making this film, but why is Voldemort pretending to be Hades? Everyone knows that the only real Hades is James Woods! And why is he so angry with Qui Gon Jin?Ralph and Liam's slightly wooden, samey and cheesey performances aside, none of the cast is that bad. Mads Mikkelsen stands out as the best performer, but Sam Worthington also seems appropriate playing a new guy who doesn't know his way, as Perseus who's thrown in to action, whether he likes it or not. Although he was a bit corny at times.There are actually a lot of famous names in this one. Not many of them last very long and overall there are a few too many characters that you don't really get to see anything of, but perhaps it is more accurate to the original mythology that they were there? I have never studied the Greek myths, so I can't say for sure.But what was the point of the girl from 'Skins' (Kaya Scodelario) and 'DS9's' Dr Bashir (Alexander Siddig) at all? And 'The Hound' (Rory McCann) from 'Game Of Thrones', as well as the 'X-Men's' 'Beast' (Nicholas Hoult) weren't used very well either.Perhaps their parts were drastically cut in editing (Sounds Painful!), but they could all have been played by any extra for far less money and no less well for the amount of screen time that they had.I think given the treatment of 'The Lord Of The Rings' (2001-3) and a longer running time, it could equal it, because the basic foundations are there, but it seems like the production doesn't have enough faith in themselves. Maybe there is a directors cut where 'The Hound' and 'Beast' get to show why they were there? I just don't think that they utilised the talent properly. You could literally blink and miss Luke Evans as Apollo! I'd actually forgotten that he was even in it.The story also moves too fast without a complete explanation of what's going on, so it seems rushed, which is another reason why it should have been given more time and more attention to detail.Generally, storywise it feels like someone got a bit scissor happy with the editing and didn't have the strength to fight the studio for a longer running time, because I think it could have been really enjoyable given the right focus. Instead it comes out as only just good and leaves a few questions unanswered.As for the CGI, it wasn't bad, but I think that I will always prefer the work of Ray Harry Hausen, who sculpted the creatures for the original film of 1981. I'm just old school that way. It was funny to see the owl from that older film turn up as an 'Easter Egg' though.Like the Harry Hamlin version, it's a perfectly acceptable watch and you can put it on the TV on a Bank Holiday weekend to satisfy the whole family to some degree.662.486/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Clash of the CGI Effects Houses,"I was expecting this to be horrible after reading the flogging this film got in the reviews, actually it was done very well. Director Louis Leterrier did as well as he could for 2008's The Incredible Hulk and of course the original Transporter film, I do not know if this film puts him in the same league as Peter Jackson and James Cameron. He did however do a good job.The whole look of this film is very good - The landscapes are believable and the characters are as good as any of the gods from the Xena/Hercules franchise (Which I loved, by the way, especially Ares). The CGI blends in with the practical elements very well, and I think my favourite image is the Djinn and his little blue flame. Leterrier clearly steals some of Guillermo del Toro's disturbing imagery with his Stygian Witches - And a few other Del Toro-isms appear, placed in perfect places.Of course I watched this due to Sam Worthington, who is the new Orlando Bloom of the 2010's - Just as Orlando Bloom was the action star of the 2000's. These guys give the film industry great new blood, I love these guys. Basically, James Cameron made this guy a superstar, but he is just a great stock actor- I love his little slips into Australian Accent now and then.This film is a feast of great actors, a lot of them just doing cameos - Mads Mikkelsen leads the support cast along with Pete Postelhwaite (Perseus' Fosterfather), Lliam Neeson (Zeus), and Ray Fiennes (Lord Voldemort of Harry Potter) as Hades and that a great casting job. In the background we see Danny Houston and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's Dr. Bashir, Siddig Al-Fadeel (as Alexander Siddig). Alexa Davalos is Andromeda and probably the most beautiful actress to date, Gemma Arterton as Io.This film is basically the story of Perseus lopping off the head of Medusa, a story that has been told and retold in books and films since forever, so that cannot be a spoiler as we all know the story - but unlike Harry Hamlin - Worthington shuns the help of Zeus at every turn.The Kraken in this film is probably my favourite creature of the film,not a but like the great Ray Harrihousen depicted it, and not like the beast from Pirates of the Caribbean, almost a cross between the two.I also like the Punk Rock look of Medusa, she can turn me into stone any day, I think the idea of making love to a woman with a snake-hairdo was probably sexy to the men who originally thought up the Medusa story, this treatment of Medusa is very sexy, the upper half at least. And casting Natalia Vodianova was a stroke, she was not monstrous unless she was looking at someone.The standout performance of this film of course is Jason Flemyng as Calibos, I did not recognise Flemyng at all underneath all that hair and stuff.I've watched this about seven times so far, and I've enjoyed it each time. It is done rather well, but probably not as a 3-D film, it was made and released very rapidly when Avatar was released, so it was not really filmed to be a 3-D film was Avatar was filmed specifically on 3-D cameras. It does well however on a regular flat screen, that's how it should have been released- It is probably more effective in 2-D anyway - But as I have never seen this in 3D, I don't know.I always like to enjoy movies for what they are, not for what the shameless publicity hype said they were.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clash Of The CGI and Disabled Story,We all know when remakes are done there is a certain methodology to adhering to the original. In this case we fell way short. Yes there were similar characters but the way they developed the story had little to do with the original. I am certain this is in one way to be a stand alone film in it's own right.The CGI was rampant in this film and was rather tasteless in my opinion. Sam Worthington as Perseus was ok but NO Harry Hamlin. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were less than stellar in their respective roles. Maybe it is just me but the original held more plausibility. Medusa was down right deplorable in this film compared to the original. Due to the CGI and actors associated with this film I give it a hard fought 6 out of 10.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crash of Titans,"Badness and worthlessness of this movie leaves me speechless.Usually, there are certain aspects of a movie you like or dislike. One could agree or disagree certain take that director chose to do, certain changes, something that was below par, something that could have been better, that one could talk about. However, in this case, the task of reviewing this movie is difficult as from the very first scene to the last scene this movie is one unbearable, soul-less, boring, ugly and horrible disaster.The original is a classic! It has heart, romance, soul, humor, sweetness, feel of an epic, beauty, nobility, overall feeling of an adventure, a quest, and yes it also had certain spooky quality, and deviousness.This remake has NONE of those qualities. As if lacking anything interesting or worth liking was not enough, this movie tortures you with horrible darkness and senselessness. A fisherman comes up with empty catch, so declares war on Gods. Really? Why even be a fisherman then? Just sit at home and demand food and other necessities be delivered to you, and if that doesn't happen, just declare war on Gods.From Andromedae to Zeus, the characters are either evil or robotic. Its a world of mindless creatures. There is no way to get emotionally involved, even though you go to the theater with every intention to like it, and enjoy and give it every break possible.The girl playing Andromedae doesn't even appear to be a leading lady and appears to be sick and weak. The Princess is a meaningless entity in this movie. She was his love in the original. Even the monster, Cracken is boring. Medusa left a permanent scar in the original, but here it just might be a giant mindless snake. However, the soldiers trying to kill her are even more determined to be killed by her gaze. One of them could have simply avoided that fate, but the writers probably ran out of script for him, so he had no choice but to gaze straight in Medusa's eyes.Just a bad movie. Avoid it at all cost. I am disgusted the time and money I wasted on this one. There is absolutely nothing, not one thing in this movie that is worth cherishing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alright for brainless entertainment,"This film is about the Greek Gods unleashing their wrath because humans lost faith and respect for the heavens. This causes a huge war between heaven and the mortal world.""Clash of the Titans"" has good visuals (I watched the 2D version), a tight plot and an endless stream of action. However, subplots are not explained so well, such as why the scorpions switches side to side with Perseus. Other subplots are just woefully neglected, such as the two civilians who claim to have specialist knowledge and volunteer to join in the battle. Io, played by Gemma Aterton, is so dispensable in the film. It seems that her only reason to be in the film is to have a girl among the group of guys. The filmmakers could have at least given her more seemingly valid reason to be on screen.""Clash of the Titans"" has the ingredients of a summer blockbuster. It is alright for brainless entertainment, but ultimately it is not so memorable.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Marine haircut & khaki T-shirt in the midst of Greek beards & panoply,"This is not a movie. It's just a random collection of scenes picked from the 1981 version sewn together with a dull and heavy needle, interconnected by a few embarrassing ""comic"" inlays and CG effects which, strangely, though the original is almost 30 years older, are not more awe-inspiring than the original ones. Practically the only construct that was added in this version is the inner conflict of the protagonist between his two natures, but even that was half-cooked and the writer forgot about it in the process of writing. By the way, could anyone please explain to me why is the Medusa, which is supposed to be so ugly that she turns anyone who sees her face to stone, played by an actor with a beautiful face?",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Popcorn action with one big flaw,"Clash of the Titans, starring new Hollywood wonder boy Sam Worthington, is not a bad movie. In fact it is great fun - fast-paced and ambitious.But therein also lay its weakness. Running in around 1 hr 45 min Clash of the Titans never takes the time to build characters or delve into the mysticism surrounding for instance The Stygian Witches or the frightening Medusa. It becomes a classic example of the sacrifice movies relying heavily on CGI has to make nowadays, where the characters rush from one scene and location to another.2D, 3D or not - Clash of the Titans could have been a massive movie beyond what the title would suggest, but instead ends up as yet another expensive blockbuster-tailored Hollywood flick lacking in suspense and imagination.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the clash without titans,"I've just seen the movie this night in a special midnight preview for good money and, damn, I was excited. waiting months for a movie can do that to me. I even got an upgrade on my seat, middle row center seat.But the best seat in the cinema couldn't change the disaster on the screen. I wasn't expecting a high class movie with great storytelling or great acting. but this was ridiculous. I like big movies with great action and I enjoy a good anti hero but this was nothing at all The gods looked more misplaced in there medieval armor than frightening or superior. the performance of Neeson and Finnes was nothing I would ever expect from one of the two. no emotion, no style, no gods. Worthington was as disappointing as Perseus as Arnie would be as Hamlet. it was flat. I mean really flat. 2dimensional. all characters were just black and white figures with no intentions or depths. The dialogues were mere excuses to get them to the next place to kill some monsters and get killed. but I guess there are enough people out there that talk lots about bad actingwhat really disappointed me was the lame action. where I expected to see long shots without any cuts to enjoy the epic of a true battle I only found a MTV music video clone in theatrical length. To many cuts, the camera as steady as filmed while an earthquake. you couldn't settle for one moment because the next one was just rushing in to confuse you. How can it be that the trailer of this movie is more calm and ordered than the movie itself? I just wanted to see an all out epic action movie. what I got was a waste of timeand fanboys, don't get me wrong, I love movies like this. the epic, the pathos, the action.

"Hey Hollywood, you think I'm that stupid? Guess I am I just gave you twelve bucks!","If you don't care about plot or character development, go ahead and watch it.It was so bad, at the end a few people (who probably aren't very bright, hence their ability to enjoy this waste of film) clapped and tried to get others to join, and no one did.I was excited when I first heard of this movie but within the first 15 minutes the plot holes appeared. The actors do their best with what they are given but the dialog is rife with bad one liners and is down right cringe inducing. The storyline is non existent. The ""love"" part of the movie felt shoehorned in.Perseus's issues with his dad were so badly written that I just didn't care. I watched How to Train Your Dragon which is a kid's movie yet they made me care about the father/son problems. Sad when a movie for kids is better written than one made for adults. (if you have kids, you should be even more insulted, Hollywood thinks your children are smarter than you!)I am not religious but there were strong atheist tones saying man is better than God. It annoys me that they're slapping the audience in the face to us ""LOOK! LOOK! Look at that dumb zealot trying to get people to worship the gods! Isn't he an idiot? Religious people are stupid fanatics!"" I don't go to church, but I went to see this movie for a STORY, not for the writers to shove their beliefs at me. I didn't get the feeling I was watching a movie set in ancient Greece at all. Speaking of Greece, if you have any knowledge of Greek mythology, some of the stuff might bug you, such as Io being all knowing and not a cow, she was an annoying know it all character. Also, the ""comic relief"" characters that come out of nowhere to join the heroes. So predictable, haw haw, they're funny but what a surprise, they can kick ass.There other attempts at humor that fell flat.The effects were sometimes passable and sometimes lazy CGI. The monsters were not very good either, their faces looked too alike. And the action...well..it was OK... 13 year old boys and people who care not about plot will love the movie for it, I wasn't impressed, it wasn't as epic as I would have liked. Since the story was so lacking a tad more blood would have been nice...OLD ONE TO NEW ONE Yes, I did like the original. I went into the theater with the mind that these are two different movies so not to judge this one based on the original. I was hoping it to be good story. The old one is far superior. The old effects are campy but were so impressive FOR THE TIME that the movie became a classic. The new effects are not that good by today's standards and no good story to make up for it. Judging STORYWISE and not OMGSPESHULEFFCTS the old one's FAR superior with less plot holes, better acting, and likable characters. I didn't like Calibus's origin in the new one, it sucked. I also didn't like the portrayal of the gods. Humans were their playthings and they used them like chesspieces but in new one Zeus is oddly loving towards them. Wasn't Perseus in love with Andromeda not that cow Io? I knew they'd stray from the story but they'd have been better off if they didn't. Guess they didn't want to make it about love because that's not ""badass"" enough so instead they changed it into a vengeance thing. And wtf, they made Medusa's face pretty? I thought she was supposed to be hideous! I wasn't impressed with the Medusa battle, the old one actually had more tension and was actually creepier in a way. They added these things called djini which are from middle eastern stories, NOT Greece! It annoyed me that they underestimate audience's intelligence. The old movie did a MUCH better job at portraying the way Greeks viewed their gods and just gave out more of a Greek feel. The new one gives a Christian feel to the Gods Zeus= God, Hades= Satan, Perseus= Jesus. It's a story about ancient Greek gods so make it SEEM like a movie about ancient Greece! They were trying so hard to make it seem cool and modernly kick ass/rebellious they couldn't write the characters to fit into that ancient world. Let's face it, the old one wanted to tell us an interesting story with interesting characters and use effects that BACK THEN made people wonder.The new one simply wanted to make bank by taking an awesome, epic story and stripping it of its soul and replacing it with with empty bravado and run of the mill cgi.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nothing Close to being a Classic,"I went to see this movie with an absolute high hope thinking it gonna be big!! It gonna be Hugh!! An Epic!! Somewhat like The Lords of the Ring. After all, the name itself already implies that –it is Clash of the Titans. But for crying out loud – this is nothing more than just a mediocre old age movie with really bad script and probably worst editing I've seen this year.It doesn't take me long at all for me to realize that this is not going to be the movie I hope for (about 5mins into the film). The script was plain flat, no character development no nothing – heavily rely on how the action sequences and how going to turn out. The worst part was it very chopped up and everything seems like a race. One minute you were watching this, next minute is totally different situation – it was so fast I don't even have time to absorb anything. (For Pete sake! How cans anyone put an epic into 90 min movie?) Plus this film got really weak dialogue and completely uninspiring lines.I'm really sorry but it doesn't really stop there. The casting was just awful (solely because of bad script) – I like Sam, but this movie make me realize –he doesn't have much personality or character at all, it is like he play the same character for every movie. The others are – you don't really care about them at all, much of their story and background have been omitted and so I don't really feel the connection or care how they're going to be.I can't really point out the good part of the movie at all – but maybe a couple of decent CGI of the monsters and some fast pace action sequences that remind me of Transformers 2. The wardrobe was out of place, out of the blue there is couple of white dude wearing something like an Indian holy man, and the army suit was weird (though I do like Zeus suit).Overall I'm quite disappointed with the whole movie and its story. But I guess the pre-teen boys might enjoy this with all the monsters killing, slaying the Medusa, and the quest to save the life of the princess he doesn't even know. No wonder it was release now rather than in the summer.Reason To Watch: If You're Looking For the Action and Nothing Else Then This Might Be the Movie For You.Reason Not To: Please Read the Above.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D )",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An entertaining take on Perseus the gorgon slayer, loosely but effective.","I haven't seen the original Clash of the Titans so I can't compare this to the original, and the first time I watched this I wasn't aware of the story behind Perseus the gorgon slayer. However I can say I am now, and this film makes for an interesting version of the story. A lot of it is different, but that's ok because the original story wouldn't make for much of an entertaining movie. There isn't a lot of meat on the bone so to say, this film has just captured the best parts and made the best of it with other segments of the story as well as some new ones.For example in the original story it is Athena and Hermes that help Perseus with his quest to slay the gorgon Medusa, but they not in this and instead Zeus fills this role. The kraken fills the role of the nameless monster that is to devour the princess Andromedea, just like in the original story; but Hades is not the one that creates it.The cruel king is nowhere to be seen in regards to setting Perseus on his quest, but Acrisius is; and some of what happens here does happen in the original tale.But enough with those comparisons, the movie itself is enjoyable; the characters are fine, the pacing is quick, and the action is entertaining. The title is a bit confusing and misleading but, this is a remake of a film so remember that and don't take it too seriously.In my opinion, this is one of the better Greek Mythology films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Reasonable Remake Unlike Most,"Generally I'm not a fan of remakes, its lazy creativity, offering simply money for the studio from something that made them money before.Best example I can think of right now Point Break. A shameful grab for cash.However, sometimes a remake can modernise things adding a polish that helps take a movie to the next level and I feel that is what has happened here.As a kid I loved CotT, I was too young to care about how dodgy the effects were (or later on how camp the movie actually is). It was a good tale. When I watch it now the effects of the movie diminish the joy.The remake, yes it does lose a little charm, fixes all the effects issues. Now the movie looks and sounds fantastic. So in this instance I think both versions have value and add something worthwhile to the historical movie library.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"New sandals, old hat...","New sandals, old hat, Clash of the Titans is an enjoyable remake, but the original only made in 1981 doesn't seem that long ago.The 2010 version strength is that you don't see sandals, Gods and monster adventure films much these days(unless they are made for TV). However, you cant help but think why remake Clash of the Titans when Jason and the Argonauts would have been more advantageous.Sadly the score is pretty forgettable but the effects are great, minus a disappointing CGI Medusa. The old world feel is captured perfectly credit to director of photography Peter Menzies Jr. the locations are breathtaking, Sam Worthington is a reliable as the an action hero but his character is underdeveloped. There are some great performances by Mads Mikkelsen and heavy weights Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. The rest are a mixed bag, yet Gemma Arterton is startling first-class as to is the almost unrecognisable Jason Flemyng as Calibos. However, if you've seen the original, Calibos like Perseus lacks characterisation.Apart from a few tweaks, director Louis Leterrier's version retreads the first. While it exceeds it predecessor in some parts, thankfully there's no owl, it includes the Sheikh Sulieman; Lo; scorpions; Pegaus and flying monsters; in places it fall short of the original -The Medusa scene;the training of Perseus and Calibos role.Nevertheless, it's a fun adventure film and I'd happily watch an inevitable sequel.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forget the Titans,"Ray Harryhausen would have been rolling in his grave. The special effects in the update of Clash of the Titans are entirely done by computer. Quite obviously, a lot has changed since the 1981 version, some for the better but most for the worse. The new Clash of the Titans is enjoyable at times, but most of the time, it is boring and tiresome. Some of the action sequences are cool, but these sequences cannot make one forget the horrible acting and silly script.The remake of Clash of the Titans follows a similar plot to the original. In ancient Greece, the people have turned against the gods. Zeus (Liam Neeson) is extremely mad and decides to punish the people of Greece. When Zeus vows to kill Andromeda, the beautiful princess, the people assemble a group of warriors to fight back before Andromeda dies. Perseus (Sam Worthington), a demigod who also happens to be the son of Zeus, is chosen as one of these warriors.The movie's uneven pacing is responsible for why it is so boring sometimes. The movie trudges along for the first 45 minutes, in which barely anything happens. But after it is done being slow and eventless, the plot ends up moving too fast, skipping most of the good parts. The action sequences are, for the most, part slick and fun to watch, but unfortunately, there are only three of them. All of this can be attributed to a bad script that makes no sense and forces the actors to spew sentences that sound strange and unbelievable. On top of all this, the acting is terrible, which makes the delivery of these lines even harder to like. Sam Worthington's dull acting lends no help to the movie's problems or the audience's interest. But an acceptable performance from Liam Neeson is not horrible to watch.The film's other main problem is that it takes itself way too seriously. The old 80's version felt hokey and fun, while this one wants to be good so desperately that it constantly trips over its own feet. At least the old film has not been completely forgotten. Fans of the old version will be pleased to see Bubo, the mechanical owl, making a brief appearance. Louis Leterrier's clever placement of allusions to the 80's version let me appreciate the film a little more because it showed that the film was not only a remake, but a homage at heart. Still, the older version remains far superior.3-D cannot save this film. Clash of the Titans is somewhat fun, but mostly forgettable due to a poor script, B-movie style acting, and a lack of action. Although Leterrier has left a few hints that he still cares about the original, the movie is too serious and not hokey enough. Even with 3-D, the film still feels dimensionless and contrived most of the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not one I'd personally revisit,"A mixed bag.I didn't really enjoy 'Clash of the Titans' but I didn't dislike it all that much either. The cast do alright, as Sam Worthington sticks out most - the rest kinda merge into one in my memory. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes feel very underused, in fact the parts of the story involving them onscreen didn't do anything for me - Worthington & Co.'s bits are far more watchable.The special effects aren't the best, including those used for 'the gods'... though Fiennes as Hades looks fine enough. It's mainly the creatures that don't work as well, most notably for the giant scorpions on the wide shots. On that note, I did rate the long, sweeping shots that are used throughout... the music is strong too, I'd even say Ramin Djawadi's work is the best thing about this 2010 flick to be honest.Not one I'd personally revisit... still gonna see what they did for the sequel, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A disappointment, a missed opportunity and not a very good film","Did you hear that? That was me sighing, the trailer certainly gave the impression this was going to be something special and that they had nailed the fantasy action target. Unfortunately they haven't.. It's a film that isn't as good as the sum of its parts, no wait a minute, that's wrong, even the parts aren't that good. A series of loose encounters that seem under played and under worked leaving you with a feeling that it's all style and no substance. From the moment the rating was unveiled it was clear that they were going to pull all their punches to allow as wider audience as possible to see this mess. A tighter, leaner more adult approach would have benefited this film no end, instead we get superfluous, ridiculous looking characters that come and go without any real purpose. Where is the suspense? Where is the tension? Where are the darker elements the story aspires to? You don't get any of these elements. As an example, they have to kill the infamous mythological creature Medusa and there is no sense of fear or tension. And that counts for practically all the enemies in the film accept, perhaps, the giant scorpions. Anyway, enough is enough, a disappointment, a missed opportunity and not a very good film.

Full of expectation - what a disappointment - terrible,"This is the first review I've written on the IMDb but after just watching Clash Of The Titans 3D in my local cinema, i felt i just had to let the movie going public know how bad it was.As a boy of 12 years of age when the original Clash of the Titans first came out in 1981, i like everyone else in the movie theatre sat spellbound throughout the entire movie. Not just because of the special affects - which were another fine example of Ray Harryhausens work, but because the story and the character development made you care about what happened to Perseus, Andromeda and all those who had helped Perseus in his quest.Move forward almost 30 years and i still find it hard to believe how badly this film has been remade. Its not really the actors fault, as the fine cast assembled should have been able to produce what we all hoped would be another classic.What happened! i'l tell you - a terribly written story and cheesy dialogue which bares hardly any resemblance to the original film at all. What you have is a series of blurry, difficult to watch 3d action sequences which don't tie up with one another, and characters that you simply don't care about. The only exception to this is Mads Mikkelsen who manages to look and sound great in a movie that no-one else does. Even The great Liam Neeson and promising new leading man Sam Worthington are completely wasted here and appear wooden, like they simply don't believe in the script themselves. What a wasted opportunity.Why did they omit the wonderful and creepily suspenseful scenes in the marsh, when Calibos set his impossible riddles for Andromedas suitors. Why did Andromedas character play no real importance in this film apart from being food for a hungry C.G.I squid! (Suposedly the Kraken) No love story, no interest as far as i was concerned.Without going on and on about the mistakes in this movie ( i could though) i just need to mention the mythical creatures in the movie. Calibos - i like Jason Flemyng but he wasn't right for this part, just not scary at all. The kraken - way to large, the C.G.I looked very cartoonish and boy was it easy to kill. The scorpions - pretty good actually until they were suddenly tamed, a saddle and harness put on them and ridden like docile cows! Whats that all about! Finally though the scene with the Medusa - in the original it was scary, suspenseful and very exciting. In this it was rushed, the C.G.I was poor,(Bring back to the good old days of stop motion clay model effects if this is the best C.G.I has to offer) and overall, what was always the best action scene in my opinion in the original film was completely ruined in this remake.Supposedly, the director was a big fan of the original film. By watching this you would be forgiven for thinking he actually hated it and wanted to make this film as far removed from the original as possible. In that one aspect he truly succeeded.Special mention to the most irritating aspect of the film, every time that awful skinny prophet of doom appeared on screen wailing and crying out those silly noises. Why didn't the kings guards simply kill him the minute he opened his mouth.To sum up, i really didn't care by the end whether or not Perseus, Andromeda and the whole city of Argos was destroyed. In fact, it would have been the one change to the original film, that would have signalled a welcome end to what was truly an awfully disappointing movie experience.If this is what we have to look forward to from now on from the Hollywood - cash in on every great movie memory we have crowd. I feel very sad. Surely we as the paying viewing public, who pay the wages of all those in the movie industry deserve better. I hope so, or my days of going to the cinema to watch the latest summer blockbuster are numbered.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dumb fun, but not enough","On paper, Clash of the Titans was a good idea for a remake, since the original, while fondly remembered, hardly qualifies as a classic, with its uneven acting (notably male lead Harry Hamlin) and dated - though still quite impressive - visual effects. Throw in a director who knows how to do action (Louis Leterrier), some classy supporting actors for the divine parts (Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, last seen together in a totally different film, Schindler's List), and the new superstar of the decade (Sam Worthington), and you've got all the right ingredients for a fun romp. Unfortunately, the new version, while good in parts, fails to deliver as an overall viewing experience.Surprisingly enough for a remake, the script sticks quite close to the original: Perseus (Worthington), a demigod, has to face numerous perils in order to save princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) and prevent an all-out war between gods and men. What's new is a more epic approach to the story, with a focus on the rivalry between Zeus (Neeson) and Hades (Fiennes), and a bizarre ""romantic"" twist, with the mysterious Io (Gemma Arterton) replacing Perseus' elderly mentor (Burgess Meredith) from the first film.In theory, there would be no need to bicker about the plot: Clash of the Titans is meant to be nothing more than sheer, dumb fun, and anyone with a true passion for Greek mythology might want to look away from blatant alterations to the myths (see the whole story about Perseus' birth) and borrowings from other cultures (the Djinn and, of course, the Kraken, recently brought back by the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise). However, whereas Desmond Davis' 1981 take on the story truly opted for sheer fun, the 2010 update stumbles into a few logical pratfalls (Zeus' behavior is a bit schizophrenic in the last act), chunks of appalling ""contemporary"" dialogue (the protagonist's warning about Medusa: ""Don't look this b*tch in the eye!""), a pointless cameo by the infamous mechanical owl Bubo and a plain ridiculous epilogue that - rumor has it - was added at the last minute to leave the road open for potential sequels (what a surprise...).Another major problem is the ""big"" new contribution: 3D. Having seen both versions, it is safe to say the three-dimensional Clash is a rather unappealing sight. This is because, unlike Avatar or Coraline, which were conceived and filmed in 3D from the start, and made an intelligent use of the technology, Clash of the Titans was shot in 2D and subsequently ""converted"" to the new format in the wake of Avatar's huge business (the fact that Worthington stars in both pictures may also have been a factor). The result is a movie whose action scenes, which are edited very quickly, become unintelligible in 3D, which takes most of the fun out of it (also, slow motion looks awful with the added dimension). With the exception of a couple of scenes, namely those that were fixed in post-production to begin with, the experience is a pretty negative one.However, there are still a few things to enjoy: with the 3D out of the equation, Leterrier deserves credit for nailing all the huge sequences - Scorpioks, Medusa, Kraken - with a subtle use of CGI that sort of pays tribute to Ray Harryhausen's original work. Additionally, the cast does a more than passable job, although the wide array of accents on display (Australian for Perseus, Irish for Zeus, unspecified for Draco and English for everyone else) is a bit baffling at times. As expected, Neeson and Fiennes are the best of the bunch, with the kind of gravitas only British actors seem to possess in this kind of production, while Worthington delivers a committed but not entirely charismatic performance, occasionally coming off as a bad Russell Crowe clone. It is also worth wondering why the filmmakers bothered to cast relatively famous actors for throwaway parts: Danny Huston (Poseidon) and Polly Walker (in a role reminiscent of her Rome character) are wasted, while Alexander Siddig's appearance is so brief even die-hard Star Trek fans could have trouble spotting him (that's what happened to me, anyway).Overall, the new, ""improved"" Clash of the Titans provides some excitement but generally disappoints, compared to other blockbusters of recent memory. Best stick with the original: it may have aged a bit, but the fun factor remains unaltered.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
AWFUL remake.  Avoid this crud and watch the original!,"If you want to see Clash of the Titans with a compelling narrative, good creatures, good action sequences, and a SUPERB cast, watch the 1981 original.

His treatment of that classic prop/character could not have been more dismissive and insulting. It clearly shows how little he respected the original film, as do pretty much all of his other directorial choices.A terrible and entirely pointless film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Classic Too Updated,"As a child, the original Clash of the Titans was one of my favorite monster movies. I still have a nostalgia for watching it periodically today.The majority of people going to see this movie want to watch humans battle realistic looking monsters. However, this film attempts to complicate the original story with a subplot about ancient gods needing prayers and fear for their own immortality. An additional subplot about the hero rejecting his demigod status and therefore refusing help from his father was also added. This just bogged down what should be a straightforward excuse for showing realistic looking monsters on the big screen.The CGI beasts were much more impressive than in the original. However, the action sequences were shot too close and too fast to allow the viewer to have a good understanding of what was happening.Unlike Jurassic Park and The Lord of the Rings, most monster movies fail to transcend visual candy. That is fine. Sometimes a mindless monster movie is a visual masterpiece that hits the spot. I could not tell you the plot of a single Godzilla movie. This film attempted to complicate the plot and transcend its monster movie status instead of just sticking with a basic story. The result is a movie that is partial eye candy and an attempt at plot depth, both of which were incomplete and left me unsatisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is the prayers of the mortals that give the gods strength so with no where else to go Zeus turns to his brother Hades for help. Zeus tells Hades to unleash the Krakken a powerful creature created by Hades himself onto the humans in ten days if a sacrifice is not made to please the gods. However Hades has his own plans, which involve taking over Olympus. So its up Zeus' son and others to try and stop them before its to late.While the action sequences are enjoyable you can't feel the suspense of the fight because the characters just aren't that likable. I have seen some of these actors in other films and they are a lot better than they are in this movie. The roles could be good for them, but the way the script was written it was like the film-makers didn't want there to be any emotion at all. The characters are just plainly boring and not likable at all, end of story. Another thing is mostly action and not enough of the story (while it is nice the story can't truly be seen through all of the action).If I could I would give one star for a good story and nice setting, two stars for beautiful special effects and great action, and two and a half stars for characters being boring and not likable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not even so bad its funny good.,"This movie was not good and its not horrible. That right there is the problem, you will simply be bored almost the entire way except for the occasionally unintentionally funny line. It is simply too bland. I can only recommend this film if you are intoxicated in some shape or form, then this would probably be fun to see, but even they I'm sure you could just stay home and save the money.Avoid this movie because:Many things are not explained and just make no sense even on a ""its a movie"" levelThe CGI is all over the place, from great effects to very amateurish work that you can't believe they let slideThe acting is just terrible, what few lines of dialogue that aren't groan worthy are delivered either completely dead-pan or with so much over exaggeration they are ruined. In the way it worked in 300, it does not work in this.For a movie called ""Clash of the Titans"" there is very little action in the movie and most of it not very entertaining. There was more talking in this than any movie of this type should have.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
very good movie,"Not seen such good one for some long time. very nice...! good effects, and exciting plot. I give it a straight 10 of course.

The story tells a lot about humankind and basics in our lives.Don't understand underestimated preceding reviews, i cannot agree with them. Then again i'm not Zeus.

Liked the original a little better,"This remake is a bit better than most remakes at showing respect for its source material, but it's not perfect. The visuals are reasonably impressive, but effected with a zeal for ""really big stuff,"" rather than story telling. The 3-D is attractive, but doesn't really add much.The story has been shuffled around from the original film, but basically is faithful to the premise. A few characters were traded for new ones, in order to tweak some scenes. The Medusa/Perseus chess-match battle was one of the best scenes of the original, but this film eschews that in favor of a wild CGI free-for-all that looks more like a soccer match. Like many action scenes, there's an overwhelming amount of stuff hitting you in the face all at once. Medusa herself looks more like a Bay Watch babe than a hideous creature that can turn you to stone.The Hades plot is unnecessary. Just bring on the Medusa, the scorpions, the witches, and ""Release the Kraken!"" That's all this story needed. But give the CGI wizards credit; the Kraken makes a pretty cool debut.It's a decently fun ride, an ambitious but flawed effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
MTV piece,"The special effects are all. Fights, adventures, heroes are only its fruits. Not very fresh, not extremely tasty but fruits. The curiosity and MTV civilization are enough for to sell a product like this. Like many movies about mythological aspects, Clash of titans is about nothing. Only excuses to impressive but no one sense. Terminator and few good guys, huge scorpions and head of Medusa as nice clothes. Not explanations and a Liam Neeson from another story. Junkie food, it is a stupid game or a strange improvisation. So, the realistic aspects are food without salt. And the Clash is only search to understand a mystification of a lost world.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The gods must be crazy, but how would we know?","I think you'll find just as many people love Clash of the Titans as those who do not love it. I went with the boy (who is actually 18, for those of you who are not familiar with his nickname). We were both underwhelmed. In fact, when the credits started to roll, he took off his 3-D glasses, looked at me and said, ""Well, that sucked."" That warranted a smack from me, because he's not allowed to use that word around me. I forced him to be more specific in his criticism, and as it turns out, we totally agreed on our review.Good news first. Sam Worthington is terrific, as Perseus. I think the production value is high. The movie, the settings, look beautiful. It's an interesting story. The set up is good. I am sad when Perseus' human family dies. After that, though, it's all a blur of action and mess. It seems like they're trying to cram every detail of the Greek epic plus every effect and monster possible into 90 minutes. None of the characters are developed enough in that time. How could they be, when they're fighting monsters and on an adventure and there's an Olympus back story? If all the warriors on the odyssey were actors I already knew, maybe I could keep them straight. But, I don't, and I don't get to know them, and therefore, I don't care when things happen to them. It's not that the characters aren't interesting. I would love to see a movie and learn more about Andromeda and Draco and these two crazy brothers who like to hunt things.At this point, I'll defer to my son's review. He says he wished the movie was longer so we could get more character development. He liked another epic guy, Jinn, but said he didn't learn anything about him, over the course of the movie, and that was frustrating.""It seems like these guys know each other for five minutes, then they're like, Hey, we're not coming with you but here is this cool shield. Andromeda is like, hey, I gave you a cup of water, now you should be my king."" We both would have preferred a movie even 30-45 minutes longer that left us more satisfied.While the 3-D is good, the creatures all seem cobbled together from other films. There is a cute homage to the original Clash of the Titans. Our disappointment is more pronounced, because this cast is really good. The acting and characters could have elevated the movie above the effects, given time to develop. We give Clash of the Titans a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No Titans, Debatable 3D","It seems I've had a stream of bad luck of late with films such as 'Percy and the lightening thief' claiming to be the American 'Harry Potter' and turning out to be just another iteration of the 'Scary/Epic/Hero Movie' genre. However films like these at least stayed true to themselves once you got into them and played on the strengths of the teen comedy/spoof genre's.'Clash of the Titans' doesn't seem to know what it is.I'll first start by saying that there is NO WAY this film was made for 3D. The trailers before the film were far more impressive and interesting. Depth perception rapidly changed from scene to scene (painful on the eyes) as if each shot was not planned with 3D in mind. Other shots only had 3D elements or none at all, evident by 0 distortion when removing the 3D glasses; this was also straining on the eyes and far less vivid than a true 3D experience. The best existing example I can think of is the old 'Doom 3D' game where the levels were 3D but the monsters were just 2D sprites floating around in them. Clearly most 3D was done in post editing.The story was rushed and given poor delivery, though given the quality of the content you may consider this a blessing. The film attempted to mix serious moments with comedy spontaneously transforming itself into a big lump of cheese. Actual CG was top notch but sparsely used until the last ten minutes, by which time you may have already left the room. Acting was generally on the mark but again let down by cheese oozing from the mouths of the Actors and Actresses.The Director clearly had access to some great CG artists and some fairly decent Actors but his script and screen play would have worked just as well if he'd picked hobos up off the street and placed them in front of a green screen (though credit to him that he avoided the green screen wherever possible).In short, this movie is terrible, it's mostly slow passed, boring and delivered poorly. Do not go to watch this in 3D, you will have higher expectations and will be sorely disappointed. I give it a 1/10, as I had the urge to leave consistently from the first 10 minutes, which I've never felt so strongly before; if you go to watch it in 2D, maybe you'll want to give it a 2 or a 3, but I seriously wish that you better spend your time on some of the other great movies currently showing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What is up with that 3D,This was just the worst 3D l have ever seen. Who ever made it should be fired. sometimes the characters were 4 ft long. it was just awful. l watched most of the scenes with my glasses off and it looked much better. As for the movie. l never saw the original one but l am planing to. it was awesome good action and all. some funny moments. As a whole a typical Hollywood movie. Sam may have done one two many movies tho. He plays the same character over and over in all of his movies. anyway this movie is good to watch but not in 3D. Just better wait for the DVD to come out or just go to a non-3D theater. l'm giving it a 9 out of the awesome action and that Achilles jump outside of Medusa's lair. People who say the original movie was better really don't know what they're talking about. The makers just excluded some parts of the first movie that's all.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How To Make A Bad Film Worse; Do A 2-D To 3-D Rush Job,"Man I love movies. Out of thousands of films I've seen in my lifetime, I can honestly count on one hand the number I walked out of. This film needs to be stopped from being shown in 3-D. Not only is this a haphazard remake/revision, it contains some of the worst 2-D to 3- D conversion to date. The company that ripped Warner off was Prim Focus - charging something like $104K PER MINUTE for the conversion. But that's what happens when you shoot a movie in 2-D and then at the last minute decide to up convert it to 3-D, but only give the converters ten weeks to do it! Anybody out there wanna take a guess at why Alice in Wonderland's release date was pushed back three times? Yep, it takes a long time to convert to 3-D because the technology really isn't fully there. Try finding technical articles on how its achieved and you'll finish reading with more questions than answers. Anybody see G- Force? Love the film, but in 3-D it is painfully obvious (on repeated viewings) during the live action sequences that it was a 2-D film switched over for 3-D midway through its shoot. At least the converters did a decent enough job to where you really have to pay attention to catch that's not real 3-D. But in Clash it looks like a pop up book and thats putting it kindly. I have the advantage of knowing several theater mangers in my area and I asked one if they could screen the film for after hours with brightness turned up. This helped out with the darker sections in the film, but it made the 3-D even worse - or rather it showed how bad of a rushed job this really was. Warner Bros is gearing up to unleash the new Harry Potter in 3-D Using the same converting studio - to say I'm wary is an understatement. If you want to see good 3-D from Warner Brothers try finding a 3-D film festival (most large cities host one a year or so) and see their early 1950 efforts like House of Wax, Hondo, Phantom of the Rue Morgue. and Dial M for Murder.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Good Movie!,"I believe the Movie could have been a little bit better, But overall in my view it was a Great Movie! I loved it!! If you like fantasy/action Movies, this one will not disappoint you. I like the fact that it is easy to follow and understand. If you like Greek Myths, You'll like this Movie. Now I have to Point out that I saw this Movie on HBO! I missed it when it was playing on the silver screen... And only now did I find out that it was made in 3D! I notice someone posted that it should have not been made in 3D in Theaters,.. I don't now.. I never saw it in 3D so I cant give you my take on the difference. All I can say is that the Movie was not Bad.. Not Bad at all!! Now if they could only find a good beefed up actor (and when I say beefed up I mean like Arnold you know who when he was a Bodybuilding Champion!) And they made a Movie like this one but having to do with the Greatest Myth DemiGod of All... Hercules!!!

Clash of the TItans: Everything I expected and it was great!,"I don't know what all the critics are smoking, but Clash of the Titans is a great fantasy movie! Now some of the mythology was changed and it doesn't have some deep life changing plot, no, but that isn't what I came to the movie to see. I am a huge fantasy fan and this movie delivered exactly what I wanted: epic weapons, great fight scenes, amazing monsters, gods, creatures and beautiful women.Overall I was satisfied with the acting and dialog. Sam Worthington is a good actor and really made his character engaging and fun to watch and I felt he really fit the role well. The dialog was also on par. None of it was cringe inducing which is very common in most Hollywood block busters. Even Avatar, which is also a great fantasy, had some pretty cringe inducing lines in it.The plot was straight to the point. I was a little disappointed that they didn't use the original plot twist of Perseus being prophesied about killing his mothers father, the king, and the king killing both daughter and son to try to prevent the prophecy, inadvertently making the prophecy come true. But I suppose they changed it to streamline the plot for a two hour action movie. What they replaced it with was sufficient, I didn't feel too 'cheated'.Now the monsters and creatures are what I came to the movie to see and they did not let down! Zeus is amazing looking in his sparkling armor :), Pegasus was beautiful and I can only wish I could ride it, Olympus is magical and I will dream about hanging out there with the rest of the gods and the Kraken is ungodly HUGE and just awesome. I only wish the fight scene was a bit longer with him cause he was just soo imposing I'd like to see more. My favorite creatures has to be the charred wood un-human desert Gin people. They were just cool looking and I would like to meet one :) (that was fantasy is all about right? to fantasize?)I saw the movie in 3d and overall I didn't think it added that much to the movie. It actually would of been better in 2d as I could see the detail of the CGI better. But, I'll rent this movie on DVD to catch more of that later. So save yourself the $5 and watch it in 2d.If you are a fantasy fan this movie is a definite see. I went with a group of friends and they all agreed the movie was great too. So I wouldn't listen to the stupid critics. Go watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cool for 3d, Story... Not so much...","If your lucky enough to see it in 3D, Wow, Very cool looking...Great movie to see if you want a good 3d movie, Now, onto the movie it self... Now, I was expecting a really amazing movie, I was left disappointed..OK, to sum up this movie, its about the Greek gods, and man deciding. We have had enough of the cruel treatment and the neglect over the years... So man decides to step up to the gods and fight them, but it doesn't work so well, the gods get angry, and lash back at man.It has everything you really need to have a good movie. sadly this movie just wasn't quite there... They jumped from one thing to the other, and hoped that everyone would follow it perfectly, which made you go... Huh? How does that work? They didn't really focus on the characters throughout the movie.. They didn't really evolve, you didn't feel a connection to them. They were so life like in 3d, but they felt they weren't there... that they were missing something...If your expecting a EPIC movie... not gonna find it here.. The fights weren't that amazing, they were predictable, short, and slightly frustrating and confusing to watch. When they were getting ready to have a huge fight, that looked like it was gonna be awesome. They had sort of mini-fights.. Where they kept on switching, between the groups, it was hard to follow, who was dead, who was still fighting, where they are... and what the heck was happening...When the movie was said and done, you were left with a feeling of... Why did this happen, what happened to that part... Why didn't they do that at the beginning...Sadly this was one of those movies where they had too much of a story to fit into a short running time, so pack it full of special effects, and hope that compensates for the lack of story.In my personal opinion to wrap up this movie, it tended to drag at a lot of parts, the special effects were really cool, the 3d was great. But the gods felt stupid, and week. and not so... well god like... The parts you couldn't wait for, took for ever to get to, and were gone in seconds...Was it worth paying for? Sure, for a quick flick you might like the movie. (If you can't see it in 3D, its not so worth it) If your into Greek mythology and / or awesome fight scenes, you might find this movie aggravating.If your wanting to see some Titans (The name has titans in it, but it has no titans in the movie it self.)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Definition of mediocre, but nice Opening Scene!","As a film, Clash of the Titans does not succeed. The story is unengaging, and the direction sloppy. Some of the action sequences are entertaining and boast some nice visuals, but ultimately it is not worthwhile. As a 3-D experience, it completely FAILS! I am not one of those people who just want 3-D to see things pop out at you. For me, when 3-D is done right it transports you into the actual film, where films like Up, Alice in Wonderland, How To Train your Dragon, and to a greater extent Avatar succeeded. BUT this is my first unnecessary 3-D experience. The only scene that is actually amazing in 3-D and transports you to another world is the opening scene with all of the mythology and the heavens. It looks utterly amazing! That is actually the best scene in the entire film, and what a shame the rest of the film failed to live up to that one scene. Overall, the film is sloppy and predictable, but for those seeking out some (not all) nice action scenes and visuals, go see it, but please, do NOT see it in 3-D because there really is no difference. This film is the definition of mediocre, not good, but not entirely horrible.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clash Of The Titans Is Decent But With Flaws That Weigh It Down,"Class of the titans is decent but with flaws that weigh it down which I'll get into later. I thought it was all right but not the greatest. First off I didn't think it was very realistic that in a land full of bearded and long haired men Worthington's Perseus was clean shavin with a buzz cut. Worthington was okay as the lead but the role and performance seemed very familiar to Avatar and Terminator Salvation. Director Louis Letterier has shown in movies like Unleashed starring Jet Li and The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton his talent as a filmmaker. This on the other hand isn't the best movie he's directed at least not to me. I liked Unleashed and the new Hulk film more than this one. The rest of the cast is decent including Liam Nesson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, Gemma Atherton as Io, and Alexa Devalos as Andromeda with what little they were given because most of them don't have a whole lot to do (with the exception of maybe Fiennes and Atherton action wise anyway). Mads Mikkelsen was the stand out as Draco who gave the movie some much needed comic relief from time to time. Pete Posthewaite does what he can with his brief part. He's written out too quickly though for us to care about him. James Flemying is pretty good as Calibos/Acrisius despite a lack of development and screen time. Danny Huston makes a blink and you missed it cameo as Poseidon with one line of dialog before disappearing for the rest of the film. The dialog was weak occasionally and the movie itself as a whole felt rushed. The two most disappointing things were the Medusa creature and the Kraken mainly because they're hardly in the movie at all. The fight with Perseus and Hades at the end after The Kraken's dispatched was also a let down because it's over in the blink of an eye before you can enjoy the showdown between them. Some build up that doesn't have any real pay off. The Medusa action sequence was okay but the character gets 5 maybe 8 minutes of screen time tops before being killed off. The same can go for the Kraken that shows up near the climax to destroy a small portion of Argos and just when the terrifying beast's face is finally reveals it's easily defeated. It seemed like a total waste because it obviously took so much money to build this creature in a computer and to only show the Kraken for a few minutes was a big disappointment. This movie could've been a lot better. It has some character development (mainly Perseus), decent action sequences but none we haven't seen before, so-so acting from the cast and average special effects. The climatic final battle with the Kraken at the end however was a major let down. I actually thought Prince Of Persia was slightly better which had it's share of flaws but I found it to be more entertaining than this remake.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Pretty Decent Effort at an Old Favourite,"After reading one of the reviews, I felt it necessary to put in a few good words for this film which I thought was a pretty decent effort! If you are looking for entertainment where you can park your mind at the door and just enjoy yourself, then Clash of the Titans fits the bill. Having read and enjoyed ancient Greek and Roman mythology for over 30 years, I always find it refreshing that the legends are kept alive in one way or another through new forms of storytelling. I didn't think the effects were dodgy at all - the fighting scenes were reminiscent of what one would expect in an epic battle and frankly, I thought it was very well accomplished. It's a pity not everyone was able to relax into the adventure and were more focused on looking for the 'ooo-ahhh' moments. Perhaps the advertisers shouldn't be hyping the effects as much as the story so that people don't go into these movies with false hopes. If you like adventure - see this; if you want a thriller or a mind bender - look elsewhere. Ultimately, the choice on how to spend your money is up to you!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"AWFUL, typical low quality Hollywood action without acting or story","The original movie was so much better. You have to forgive it's 1980s special effects, but the acting was better and character development led you to care what happens to the characters. The new movie was only made for the special effects and nothing else. The acting is horrible, the lines are cheesy, and the story is HIGHLY altered from the original movie. There are new characters added that had no point, and parts of the movie were drastically altered for no purpose other than it might be cool for little kids to watch and draw more people who only care about high-end special effects. For anybody who liked the original movie a lot you will be VERY VERY VERY disappointed. I nearly walked out of the movie, but I was with friends and that was the only thing that kept me.

Better Than IMDb Reviewers Say,"I just finished watching this at home (BlueRay, Surround, 55"" TV) and came to the IMDb to read some reviews. I have to admit. Reading some of the critical reviews here made me laugh out loud. One guy actually complained about the movie's logic as it related to what the Gods/Titans could do and not do and what they should have known and not known. Another complained that the main character's motivation of vengeance failed in comparison to the one in the original movie, which was love. Are these people serious? They act as if they know Greek mythology. Alas, dear Yurik, they don't. They're all bent out of shape because a Hollywood movie didn't take Greek myth seriously. Pleeeaaaaase....First of all, in truth, Perseus seeks Medusa's head because he's embarrassed for not bringing a present to a wedding. The cheap bastard is basically shamed into doing something brave. Yeah, great stuff for a big CGI movie.Secondly, who the hell cares that there's no Kraken in the ancient myth? There are all kinds of other mythological creatures. And this is a great Kraken. Beats the hell out of Godzilla.I'm sorry, if you want to learn about Ancient mythology, go back to school. Don't try and learn stuff from a Hollywood movie, and don't think you're getting much wisdom by reading reviews from a bunch of whiny IMDb know-it-alls who wouldn't know a Harpy from a Sharpie.If you want have some fun on a Friday night, and you liked the original, and you don't want to waste time searching for deep and meaningful cinematic allegory, Clash of the Titans might fit the bill.

"Awful, just plain awful","This movie should have been called ""Clash of the Boring Idiots."" I am a huge fan of the original 1981 classic film, and I was excited to see a remake. I thought it looked like it was going to be amazing judging by the trailers that I watched. Wow, was I ever disappointed! This movie was terrible! The trailer was awesome, and it fooled me. I was hearing a lot of bad reviews before I went to see the movie, and I did not believe any of them. Again, the trailer looked so cool, I figured that reports of the actual film had to be erroneous. But the film just sucked.The special effects were great, but the story was just terrible! You would think the original story was so great, it would be hard to mess it up! But they did. There was no character development, and I found myself not caring at all about any of the characters. Characters seemed to just appear for no reason with no back story, and then disappear as quickly and easily as they had arrived with no wrap up or resolution. The story telling really felt rushed and underdeveloped. It was very boring.And officially, I am DONE with 3-D. I was not impressed. In fact, I was annoyed more than anything and I finally took my 3-D glasses off and tried to watch the movie in 2-D.The Boo Bo cameo fell absolutely flat. It did not make me laugh. I thought it was just pathetic.My recommendation: Go re-watch the original. Andromeda was way hotter, anyway (she is SUPER fine in the 1981 original, not to take away anything from Alexa Davalos). And even despite the old stop-motion special effects, aside from being a bit old fashioned, I think it holds up great and is a lot of fun to watch.

How can Hollywood make so many idiotic movies in a very short period of time? Its unbelievable. Maybe 40 years ago they actually cloned Ed Wood and made many copies of him, i cant find another explanation. What a waste of time, of money, of good actors, of everything. I understand that Hollywood make movies for brainless teenagers but there are also other types of population in the world for good sake. There are also intelligent people who want to watch intelligent movies, please have some mercy. We are running out of good movies if you don't make new ones, i am tired to see the godfather, matrix, and a history of violence. After seeing this piece of garbage, i guess i am seeing the 1981 version one more time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
OK but could have been much better,"I recently took a classical mythology class and the myth of Perseus is strongly to believed to be a children's tale rather than being a full blown myth. The reason for this is that Perseus doesn't really have an internal struggle and he is helped greatly in his adventures with gifts from the gods. Sadly this movie doesn't really deviate from the children's tale, which is too bad - it had a lot of potential.Also, this movie seems to suffer from the ""Mummie"" movies' problem of using way too much CGI for the monsters. Don't get me wrong, I love CGI, but when creatures are made so huge they become cartoon-ish. Sometimes less is more.I think a lot of people will like this movie, I just found it to not have enough ""grit.""",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Release the kraken!!,"I'll be honest i can't deny the great action this movie had,i saw it in 3D and was pretty impressed,i enjoyed most of it,i have to admit the story was kind of all over the place and i found the movie was short and trying to fit in all those plots in such a short time just made everything seem too jam packed,i was soo excited to see the kraken but really it had like maybe 5 minutes of screen time and it didn't really do all that much,i was a bit disappointed by that,sam worthington didn't really look like he was all that much into his character not like in T4 or avatar,one thing for sure is i didn't waste my money on this i've seen so many bad movies that i regrett spending money on,at least this was not one of theme,It wasn't great but it was fair.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Effort At All Had Been Put Into It,"A severe disappointment. To be honest, I could only expect this one to be a movie with ""great visuals, but weak story,"" but I was unprepared for just how bad this movie was.My first huge complaint with this movie is with Sam Worthington and the character he plays. Worthington seems to be making a point to play overly bland characters. In Avatar, he played a character who's part could have been covered by anyone--literally anyone, with the movie's CGI his role could have been filled by an ape--and Worthington didn't bring anything to the table. In Clash of the Titans, he brings less than nothing to the table. His performance is so wooden and his character is so bland, that I was more interested in Medusa, who has no lines and is only in fifteen minutes of the movie, than his character, Perseus. I couldn't get over how bland his character was; I just kept thinking to myself ""Wow. I didn't realize Perseus was so boring."" But Worthington wasn't the only bland character in this movie. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Star Wars I, Batman Begins) and Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Harry Potter 4 & 5, Red Dragon) I can usually trust to give great performances and were the main reasons I decided to give this picture a chance. To my great astonishment, not only do both actors portray boring characters, but both actors are just so bad. Liam Neeson keeps putting weird inflections into everything he says and Ralph Fiennes plays half of the movie with this annoying hoarse voice and sounding like he wants to get up a fur ball.And then there's the movie's dialogue. Again, I wasn't looking for anything particularly phenomenal; just competence. The dialogue was so stilted and so bad that I was hoping that the last hour of the movie would be played in silence. It wasn't the worse dialogue I've ever heard; if it had that probably would have been fun to listen to. The dialogue was just so mediocre--as though no effort at all had been put into it--that it really gave me pain to listen to it.Usually in these kinds of films, they can make up for a lot of their short comings with good action. Not in Clash of the Titans. The action scenes are thrown haphazardly together and sometimes you can't even tell what's going on because the director made the awful choice of using shaky-cam while filming the intense action sequences. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield again, but in Cloverfield you were supposed to not know exactly what was going on, but you did get enough information to know. Here, you get nothing. At one point, Perseus jumps out of a giant scorpion's back. I guess I missed how he got in there in the first place because that part utterly confused me.The one scene in the movie that I really did like was the fight with Medusa. Not only was the director actually able to balance the action scenes right, but the character of Medusa was really fun to watch. Other than that, there really wasn't anything else in the movie that grasped my attention that well. A lot of the scenes were directed poorly and some of them served absolutely no purpose. And some characters are treated the same way. There are two characters who--I think--were meant to be our comedy relief. But they get hardly any screen time, leave halfway through the movie, and make one 4 second appearance toward the end of the film, but aren't mentioned after that. They did seem like some vaguely interesting characters, claiming they knew exactly how to kill such creatures as centaurs. I would have liked to get to know more about them, but they're hardly given any time on screen after that.Clash of the Titans was an interesting experience with some pretty cool visuals, but the direction, acting, screenplay, and characters were so badly conceived that the film ends up leaving no impression of any kind on the audience, except, perhaps, that this was a complete waste of time.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable take on Greek Mythology,"This 2010 take on Greek Mythology is both exciting and spectacular without it ever becoming boring
This time around the Supreme God Zeus is taunted by his God brother to punish humans for their rebellion against the Gods . This results in a series of calamaties besetting upon the humans and which Perseus fight together with a bunch of courageous warriors and bounty hunters picked along the way
the Special effects are spectacular and realistic. The story line in essence follows the 1980 film but with battles set on a big scale and more fights. The acting is good and the storyline beleivable to what it is set to do

Does not meet the hype.,"Well it may not meet the hype, but it is not terrible. Other critics are comparing it to Transformers 2, in the way that it is all special effects with some plot thrown in.And in some ways, they're right. The effects are probably the best in recent history. The story is very strange; Louis Leterier did his best to keep the original story relatively intact, while adding a whole new antagonist in Hades.This resulted in many characters being cast without any meaningful roles. All of the gods are in this movie, with only 3 of them featuring lines. Hades and Zeus of course, and Apollo throwing in his bit with one line.As much as this is much like the original, it is much more noticed by modern standards.The acting is nothing Oscar worthy, Sam Worthington (Avatar) and Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) all giving passable performances. Two big surprises were found in Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) and Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace).For me, if Louis Leterier had nailed this movie, he would be on my watch list for directors. Considering he had just remade The Incredible Hulk really well, I thought he would be the ideal director for this movie.I still recommend it even though the plot is messy and the most of the main characters are forgettable. Come seeking action with a touch of romance.7/10 Nothing Special.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clash of The TiTans,"I may say only this, I saw the Original adaptation of it from 1981, it is much more better than this 3 reasons why:1. The original 1981 adaptation stocked more towards the storyline and a wide cast of characters from the Mythology being portrayed well - although some the characters were unreal but the adaptation was very new and good at that time and still it is if you will have a chance to see it, compared to this none of the above exists.2. This is just a stripped off version from the Original 1981 movie with the help of CGI's and inaccurately following the actual Mythology of Persius and that for the pleasure of watching can be very pleasing at certain points but it has so many potholes that even a toddler will raise some questions at the end.3. There's no sense of seriousness or real adventure portrayed in a calming maneuver like all other good stories like Avathar, which was long and therefore should be but in Clash of the Titans everything looks so rushy and everybody just wants to get this movie ended as soon as possible, there should be a catch phrase to the next scene making the movie watcher glued to their seats but here there is none to be worth to tell - therefore to portray the story more properly they should have elaborated more on the character in a calmer and longer way so that it will give an essence to the film's credibility, that's lacking of confidence to any movie goers.Nevertheless its watchable, but just for the CGI's and passing of time for the real adventure you MUST at all means stick to the Original Version.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ridiculous But Satisfying,"I admit myself a bit biased (and therefore a failure as a film critic) when it comes to Clash of the Titans for several reasons. Firstly, as a young lad I fell in love with the 1981 original. I still occasionally watch the film, although it is more of a nostalgic experience rather than an entertaining one. Second, as a former student of classical Greek mythology, I'm always interested in the newest depictions of the ancient Greek characters and legends, no matter how much of a Hollywood treatment they may have received. Thirdly, the film boasts two of my all time favorite actors: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, longtime friends who are sharing the screen for the first time since the Holocaust masterpiece, Schindler's List. For these reasons and more, I have closely followed the development of this film from the scripting and casting process all the way to the heartbreaking news that it would be receiving the 3D treatment.The story is loosely based on the thousand year old legend, while adding elements of the 1981 original. The filmmakers have also added elements of their own, which I believe was a wise choice since everyone and their mother should know the basic story. Sam Worthington is Perseus, the demigod who is chosen to save the city of Argos from the Kraken, a great big beast with an appetite for the young virgin princess, Andromeda. As an action hero, Worthington is great. But for a fisherman who claims to be nonviolent, it's odd to see him walk, talk, and grimace as though he's about to jump into a boxing ring. There's also the never aging Io, Perseus's lifelong protector and possible love interest, played by Gemma Arterton, who serves the film mainly to stand around and look good. Neeson and Fiennes play Zeus and Hades, and are great as usual, but the real scene stealer in this film is Danish actor Mads Mikkelson. You probably last saw him in Casino Royale as James Bond's blood weeping nemesis. In Clash, he plays Draco, a hardened warrior who supports Perseus on his journey but is hesitant to respect him.The 1981 original used impressive claymation to create the beasts and monsters; today's film uses CGI, and results in some of the best visual effects I've seen in years. There are plenty of giant scorpions, winged horses, and of course, the Kraken, all of which look terrific. Medusa's design is disappointing, but the scene leading up to her beheading is thrilling and satisfying. Another surprise is the use of landscapes, which I believe were filmed in Ethiopia. If you really want to enjoy the visuals, stick to the 2D theaters. This is the way director Louis Leterrier intended it to be viewed, and you'll only miss out on a few credits flying through the screen.I enjoyed this film, but I'm afraid a lot of audiences won't. I suppose it's hard to be accepted as a fantasy movie in the serious world of post-Lord of the Rings Hollywood. Clash of the Titans is a relatively simple film about gods, beasts, and plenty of battles. There are plenty of ridiculous bits of dialogue, impossible stunts, beheadings, and de-limbings. I would call it lighthearted and fun. A lot of viewers will use words like ""silly"" and ""dumb."" Does it have its flaws? Yes. Am I happy I saw it? Absolutely.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Remake or new movie?,"As an original film, I have to say that I enjoyed Clash. As a remake it was an utter, abysmal failure. The first film stayed close to the Greek mythology it was based on while this one rewrote most of the actual story as it went along. Perseus actually made his speedy trips with a pair of winged boots and not a horse with wings. The remake had great special effects (but, agreeing with an earlier reviewer, you want to take the glasses off at times, but this makes the picture almost impossible to watch, go and see the 2D version), good acting and an engaging story line. If you are up for a fun afternoon, go grab a ticket and have a seat. If you are looking for a remake of the original or a story that follows Greek mythology, skip this one. I do have to give a nod and a smile to the creative folks that put this film together for giving the mechanical owl a quick cameo. I got it, but the 15 teenagers that went along missed the joke entirely. The kids sitting near me got a few pieces of info about the original and now they all want to see it. We will rent it, or I will bring in my old VHS copy and VCR to the place I work so the kids can see Harry Hamlin and the special effects of 1981 at work. They will also have the chance to see some of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen at work.Original Story 7/10 for all the pieces, i.e. special effects, acting, story, etc...Remake 3/10 There is almost nothing left of the original film",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The problem with Clash of the Titans,"I finally saw it in glorious 2d on my high-definition TV set. The ingredients could have been there for a wonderful heroic movie but it was a miss for me. The special effects were certainly professional, especially the creatures, but I felt disconnected and even bored more than once. The heroics you would expect were not exciting or elating like they should have been (see ""300"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" for that). The deaths were practically all lame and anticlimactic. In fiction, I expect deaths to shock, amaze and/or move me. None of that here. Worst of all, sometimes I didn't even know if a named character had just just died! Not for suspense reasons but because it was badly filmed. In an epic fantasy movie, I expect to feel some awe and wonder. Those feelings were not really there for me. The flight on a winged steed didn't thrill me at all as it did in ""Avatar"" or ""How to Train your Dragon"".The characters were mostly cardboard, uninteresting and didn't have much presence except for Io, the only female companion, who had an otherwordly yet classical beauty quality to her, and Hades the God of the Underworld. The little seen Greek Gods were underwhelming and the more present Zeus (Liam Neeson)'s armor was not only too shiny (perhaps to hide the low-quality craftmanship) but his beard was ugly and distracting. It bugged me that Perseus the hero became a master swordfighter in one battle (heredity can only explain so much) and that no one bothered to close their eyes or cover them while fighting the Medusa. To people who say there's no story, I would say instead that there's a simple one. The problem is that it's not that engrossing or memorable. You can easily be distracted by the successions of fights especially when the few character moments (supposed to build up sympathy for the characters) are lacking.The story also relies too often on surprise allies or cheap gimmicks to get the heroes out of trouble. For the last adversary who should be near impossible to defeat, it felt as if the director just badly needed to wrap things up quickly. It doesn't excuse how short, illogical and disappointing that ""battle"" was. Oh and lest we forget, there is no clash between ""Titans"" per say. It's more clashes between humans and mythological creatures. This remake is certainly watchable, would make an acceptable rental for fantasy fans, but it lacks in heart and talent what it certainly does not lack in budget.Rating : 4 out of 10 (Poor)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Zeus's BUTTHOLE,"In short, this is yet another remake that fails to live up to its parent original.There have been a few plot re-arrangements, which I felt might have been interesting, but ultimately amounted to not a lot. The main thing I noticed, is the role of Calibos seems to have diminished somewhat, together with the whole riddle & burn thing. This in itself did not detract too much but its just one thing in a long list.The Medusa sequence, the ""prize fight"" if you will, has become a bit of a Tom & Jerry slapstick moment. Medusa nips around like a hamster in a cage, playing peek-a-boo, failing to bring any sense of dread with her.The Kraken, which had every chance to thrill, given CGI's advantage over stop-motion, was pretty run of the mill. We've seen all this before over the past decade - nothing new brought to the table here.However, it's the woefully stale performances, character development and screenplay which, for me, drag the film down above all else. Perseus is regularly upstaged by all those around him, making each rushed scene a bit of a free-for-all.Having recently seen the original after many years away, I was disappointed that it hadn't aged better but after seeing the remake, that's not such a big deal.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Kraken is released (again).,"Perhaps the worst thing any of us movie lovers can surrender to is blind trust in film critics. I have always wondered from what dark tank in hell do these (mostly men, for some bizarre reason) so called critics emerge? Very few that I have read appear to have ever set foot on a set much less partaken of one shoot in the production process, for they often irresponsibly toss off extraordinary efforts and artistic triumphs with great expense in blood, sweat, tears and resources as one would pick out an overdone piece of popcorn and toss it.Thus, having read several critics on the new milling of Clash of the Titans and remembering quite well the awful Second Avenue-second hand budget of the 1981 rendition with its stop motion animated puppets, I dragged myself to the theaterwith it in mind that I would once again have to hear Liam Neeson shout, ""Release the Kraken,"" after wincing from a dozen or so trailers that followed my favorite news programs on TV.What I experienced was stunning production values crowned by brilliant Homeric design and art work even to the minutest detail in both sets and costume. There was so much detail that even some of the men's hairstyles were impressive (Sam Worthington – Perseus' - ""do"" notwithstanding). In this marvelous production was one instance where I expected nothing and got everything. The very fine cast is icing on the cake.As an old fan of Greek mythology I found myself highly rewarded. However, while the script simply nods at the original tales of Perseus and Andromeda there is so much good action here in a strong plot, and done so stylishly that one quickly leaves the original mythology in the vest pocket, perhaps where it really belongs.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hollywood Greeks,"I'm a sucker for the Greek mythology so despite a rough around the edges 'retelling' of the story of Perseus I though I'd take Clash of the Titans for another spin and it was exactly as I'd forgotten it....Neeson & Fiennes are both wasted here, practically phoning their performances in, I mean come on nothing here is a stretch for them. Worthing is just a dull handsome Hollywood hunk that lacks the acting chops to command an inspiring speech.

Loved the original film,"To be honest, I'm not sure I finished watching this film at home. Was so excited about the remake at first, but the movie gutted everything I'd loved as a child about the movie, which was the first class ham and cheese served up by some of the world's most beloved actors, including the wonderful Burgesss Meredith. I think the owl was my favorite character ever, but I just found out he wasn't in this movie very much because Sam Worthington tried to get him cut out of the film. I can't tell you how disappointed that my favorite childhood film was remade this way. Seeing it as a four year old in a drive-in theater was larger than life!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Adequate but unremarkable,"I'm pretty sure I watched the original Clash of the Titans and forgot to rate it. Now I have no idea what I thought of it. Anyway, there is enough of a deja vu from having watched Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.This movie was quite adequate in terms of special effects and action, but unremarkable in every way (I say that now that it's been 3 weeks since I've watch the movie and I'm hard-pressed to remember any good scene). Sometimes the special effects were too obvious - as with medusa and the kraken - but at other times it looked pretty good. The story, meh. I don't know which bits were the original mythology but it all felt too manipulated towards its inevitable conclusion. And I'm pretty sure Zeus can't resurrect anybody without getting Hades to do it.I'd like to comment on Sam Worthington but I can't. If he had been painted blue, I would've thought I were watching Avatar. He hasn't really been given a chance to progress beyond emo action hero. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are both hammy and disposable. I think they really should've gone with legends for the roles of gods, like how they had Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith in the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch the original if you want a story rather than a string of contrived action sequences,"I don't mind a remake and try to be open-minded, however, what this remake does is take all the action scenes from the 1981 original, add some more (presumably to squeeze in some 3D effects), and instead drop most of the storyline! What you are left with is a thin contrived plot where the actions of the characters make little sense.The action scenes and CGI are good, but basically the kind you find in any average blockbuster movie today. There is no innovation, the creatures' looks seem contrived - the riders on the scorpions remind me of the Haradrim of LOTR, and the Kraken's face looks remarkably like a cave troll.Without spoiling it, the original has intrigues amongst the gods and provides reasons for the actions of the characters (gods, humans and inbetween) - all missing from this remake, which rather concentrates only on the action sequences.The reasoning of the protagonist makes no sense, as he changes his mind about accepting the gods' gifts when things get tough. The newly introduced love interest makes no sense, their dialog (like most of the lines in the movie) is bland, uninspired & uninspiring, and full of clichés.The best acting is arguably from Pete Postlethwaite, but he doesn't get to say a lot.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you want to see a real ""Clash"" rent the original and save your money. The actors seemed in a daze - maybe Medusa got to them before the film started shooting.

It is what it says on the tin.,"Don't expect much more quality than an old ""B"" movie with a bigger budget. Dialogue poor, Steve McQueen would have had problems minimalising it.

The acting surprisingly below par considering the cast, and I don't think it does Sam Worthington any favours. Only surprise was the comedy input during the quest. Some very strange 3D effects, eg in close up the heads seem to have an incredible depth to them, quite unnatural! Much of the action so quick you can't see what's happening.

Clash of the freethinkers.,"This movie is interesting. It diverges far from it's source materiel, and takes a radically different route. It ditches the whole believe and follow your parents faith, and instead toys around with some deeper concepts. Enter Perseus. Perseus has led a hard life, his adoptive family have struggled to catch enough fish to eat, and storms regularly claim people's lives. When Perseus loses his family to a storm, his disappointment for the gods becomes hatred. King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia's army finds him and brings him to their city. There, the populace has become heathens, resenting their gods and defacing the temples and statues that are devoted to them. The queen claims her daughter is prettier and more attractive than the goddess Aphrodite. Zeus's brother, the embodiment of evil and Greek equivalent to Satan, the misanthropic hades, is given permission to spread mayhem with his pet, the kracken,an immense beast with virtually no shortcomings, by Zeus, as punishment for humanity's defiance. However, if Andromeda is fed to the kracken, the monster will become pacified, and refrain from exterminating the human race. Perseus realizes that Zeus is his father, who impregnated a human. His biological mother was killed by her human husband, but not before giving birth to Perseus. Questing across the lands in a bid to find the means to defeat the kracken, Perseus frequently is offered help from his heavenly parent, yet refuses his pity. He much prefers justice and care for his fellow humans, and would rather die among them than live forever in heaven. Throughout his quest, battling many nightmarish creatures, he barely scrapes through, yet never asks for any help from the gods. His morality was above the gods who created him, and their threats and the massacres they carry out on humans never intimidate him into submitting to them. It is only later in the movie does Zeus soften up, and Perseus admit he loves him, but he never allows himself to mould his own morality around Zeus, or depend on him as a guide. Perseus doesn't even need the threat of hell and reward of mount Olympus, or heaven, to dictate who he his. He sticks to his own morality, and aspires to help his fellow humans, whether the gods approve or not. He is even offered advantages from Zeus, that would rise him above the mortal humans, yet he refuses them. This movie definitely paints freethinking in a positive light. Without needing faith, Perseus remained kind, caring, tough, brave, and well-rounded. He still learned to love the gods, and respect them, but never relied on or allowed them to dictate him. Interesting ideas stemmed from this movie. Gods being reliant on, and friendly with the very demon who punishes defiant humans, and the fact gods need prayers to survive, or they die, are not to be overlooked. Religious and atheistic people should definitely gives this one a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

OK story and special effects,"While the acting is nothing to talk about, the movie does have good special effects, but not great.

There they encounter these mystical people and giant scorpions. Here we get a battle scene that after a while gets old. One of the desert people joins the quest as they go to see these witches to learn how to defeat the Kraken. Then it is off to the underworld and to kill Medusa. The Medusa part was OK, but the special effects could have been better. Then the fall of the Kraken was rather uneventful.FINAL VERDICT: The story definitely could have been better.

Should be the called The Crash and Collaspe of the Titans!,"Congratulations the Clash of The Titans or as I renamed, see review title above. You've just been found the worst film of 2010 so far. The Book of Eli, which I originally deemed the worst has moved up by one spot. Clash of The Titans had very mixed reviews from audiences (though most critics hated this) but I liked the look of the trailer and the film had an excellent cast. How wrong was I? This was a load of crap. A trashy Hollywood film that was desperate to make money. A sham! The story was predictable, the acting was awful, like Sam Worthington (whose was so wooden I felt like I had splinters), which is sad as I liked him in Terminator Salvation and he was very good as the lead in Avatar, Ralph Fiennes got on my nerves as he sounded like he had a parched sore throat and Gemma Atterton though pretty spoke like a posh girl shopping for shoes! The acting was theatrical. I felt like I watching this on stage. And because of the superficial acting there's no depth to there characters and I didn't care about any of them particularly when Sam Worthington kept flying through the air like a demented monkey screaming like Tarzan. (He would be good in the circus trade).The 3D and special effects though okay in parts was mostly tacky and the whole thing took itself so seriously it was pathetically lame. I just laughed at it and the action sequences were boring and lacked excitement not to mention the camera swung so fast for some of it I couldn't see what was happening (Michael Bay, grrr!). The last action sequence was a very anti-climax and lasted about two minutes. Some of the scenery was nice though and I thought Liam Neeson who played the god Zeus, his acting was good but it wasn't enough. The director Louis Leterrier should be ashamed of himself. This film promised so much and dosen't deliver. It's an insult to the audience. Boring, uninvolving and rubbish dribble that crashes and collapses into garbage.

"""I'd rather die in the mud with those men than live forever as a god."" - Perseus","Perseus, son of Zeus, embarks on a mission to thwart Hades from releasing the Kraken.Guilty pleasure film as I've always enjoyed ancient Greek mythology and that's what this movie is all about! Sure it's silly, sure the dialogue is cheesy and sure the acting is over the top but it's still fun. I've only ever seen the 3D Blu-ray version and it's not a great 3D film as it wasn't filmed with that in mind so certain things looked too 3D and made me sick, had a pop up book effect making it look fake (or more fake) or has very little 3D - I was frequently taking my glasses off to actually see if it was still projecting in 3D. The storyline is a little convoluted but I prefer to just sit back and roll with it as the set design, costumes and CGI really do draw me into the film. Oddly, I'm not a fan of the actual Kraken and the end fight is probably my least favorite section of the film. My favourite scene was any featuring Calibos - a big, strong, near invincible bad guy who takes so much punishment but just keeps coming back for more. Calibos really does look ugly with his split skull and all, it was great makeup effects. There are a number of great actors in this film who are all underutilized to be honest, Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Liam Neeson, Mads Mikkelsen, Luke Evans, Danny Huston, Nicholas Hoult and Pete Postlethwaite. It had so much promise... Now I like Sam Worthington, but as Perseus he was probably my least favorite character even though he's the lead! Just a very one dimensional character with very little emotion other than anger which comes across as unbelievable... Mind you, this movie is about the action and CGI, not the acting!Final verdict: I get why people hate this film but the action is fun and enjoyable and the costumes and special effects are still really good (except for maybe the giant scorpions...). If you love Greek mythology or sword and sandal adventures in general, you should like this film. Just don't go in expecting Gladiator...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Clash in 3-D,"11 April 2010. The technical visual effect of 3-D of this movie still hasn't reached that qualitative level of authenticity...the overall look is like a souped up fancy Disneyland ride that has a fancy, special look but interestingly enough detracts from the intensity of the movie, especially a few early scenes when the entire screen isn't fully focused, that completely destroys the 3-D experience. This updated JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS (1963) nicely infuses the plot with a rich assortment of Greek classical legendary myths. However, the script fails to fully capture the Zeus legendary emotional God paradox and successfully execute the special effects action/chase scenes like the last three STAR WARS or even HARRY POTTER movies were able to formulate. There are some very good thrills in this movie and overall the script does relate the story well.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's definitely better than it's getting credit for. But still could have been better.,"I've noticed that most of the reviews panning this movie seem to be more about complaining about the 3D effects. News flash people; the greedy studio heads decided to convert this movie to 3D at the last possible minute. Therefore the 3D effects look like crap because not only was it rushed, but it wasn't filmed in 3D!!! So if it was that bad why the hell would you sit through the entire movie then write a review on how bad the movie was? Go get your money back and watch it in 2D! As for the movie itself; I had only seen the original about a week before seeing the remake. While I enjoyed some elements of the original, I thought it was lacking in terms of pace. This film, definitely improves on the pace, and you get to care a bit more the rest of the soldiers that followed Perseus into the underworld. My main complaint is that they added a new female character to the plot, and as much as I enjoy seeing Gemma Aterton, it pushed away focus from Andromeda. Who really was crucial to the plot. So here we are caring for Io, and not really seeing enough of Andromeda to really be concerned for her. Yet the whole plot is about saving her more or less.Bottom line, great action/adventure movie. Doesn't really follow Greek mythology so don't let that shock you. Could have used a bit more character development but most action movies could. I give it 8/10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
""" Despite your reluctance,  you were and always will be the son of  Zeus""","Audiences across America have waited for years to see a remake of 'clash of the Titans', the reason for that is because the original 1981 version was absolutely incredible. There were a few minor flaws in the original, but audiences hoped they would be refined for this update version. The title is the same "" Clash of the Titans "" and since it stars Liam Neeson as Zeus, we figured, how could it fail? In this film we have Sam Worthington playing Perseus but one look at the rugged actor, tells us this movie is not going to be based on good looks, but a tempest tossed story filled with stark Black images, dark pitiful creatures and gritty, marsh monsters. Although, there are sufficient fiery, exciting scenes, filled with arching volcanoes and incredible CGI created creatures (I liked the BLACK Pegasus), director Louis Letterier allowed the story to be filmed too close to Hades instead of glorious Olympus. As a result, horror, tragedy and beautiful ugliness are the paint brushes of his canvas. The storyline is further burdened with too many options and no central resolution. Still, the final caparison will be up to the forgiving audience, but as far as this reviewer is concern, I liked the original. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good as the original.,"When this reboot came out, it outgrossed the original due to the high 3d ticket prices despite being converted into 3d postproduction. The success of this film spawned a sequel, which didn't live up to the original. Made during the peak of the 3d movie craze set by Avatar in late 2009, Clash of the Titans has an unmemorable soundtrack, crappy CGI, and dumb acting. Stick to the original 1981 classic and stay away from this carcass of a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Quite terrible, really","It's a shame to review this movie so terribly, because there are things about the film that were done quite nice: the artistic direction, from the costume, the animated creatures, the digital mattes. All quite superb. But, the script is so bad that none of that can be overlooked while trying to enjoy the picture. The original 1981 film didn't have a fabulous script either, but it was head and shoulders above this. And the effects in that film, even by Ray Harryhousen's standards, were a bit rough. But it made for a much more enjoyable evening. I don't think the actors can be judged, because the lines they were given no one could deliver. It does all come down to the script. Or some over zealous producer demanding scenes and plots get added. If anyone has ever seen Kevin Smith's story about working on a script for Superman and the producer kept saying, ""yeah, cool. But, can we add a giant spider in there somehow?"". That's what I was reminded of the whole time watching this. Terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
directors on drugs,"3/10 is where I'll start with this. It may be generous, but it isn't all terrible. Over time it may creep up to a 3 or 4 out of 10, if it gets edited.It's loosely the story of Perseus, no more or less digressed than most films. A Greek hero kills monsters and rescues a damsel in distress.What is done with the film is pretty annoying. The script is cliché, but we can live with that. Lots of characters look like carry overs from other action films. There's a few twists that may make it a little less bland.The actors do their job. I have no problem with them. They deal with a very mundane script and poor editing. The little people involved in make up and other jobs obviously made a serious effort.The director seems to be on drugs, however. We have no logical pattern. We aren't really introduced to most of the characters, and the action is just a dork's video game, a complete blur, ridiculous and impossible to follow. There is no logical sequence of events in the action presented, or in the characters. Again, not the fault of the actors, but of horrid directing. To call it splotchy is an understatement.It tries to make some points, and for the effort people made, I generously give this a 3/10. Still, it is very disappointing, and makes the original look like a classic.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Started yawning towards the end...,"Much ado about nothing. This is a classic example of a trailer being much better than the movie it represents. Sam Worthington is cut out of every other movie he has previously been in - cardboard acting, terrible job of hiding his true accent, tough guy persona with modern-day haircut and attitude. Same with Neeson - he plays the same character in virtually every movie he's in - from Darkman to Taken to Love Actually to CotT. Many of the supporting actors feel properly cast beyond the main few though - I like seeing no-namers in new roles, actors with something to lose. The CGI is OK, sometimes you catch the actors looking at nothing in front of them - the interactions are very loose here. The Kraken is a remake of the Godzilla remake - beady eyes to go along with a head full of teeth. This remake won't make anyone forget the original in the long run. I saw it cause I bought into the hype and the wife likes Worthington. But I could have - and should have - easily caught this one on DVD from our library for FREE in a couple of months. If you miss this one in theaters, you're okay - the world will still turn. Saw it in 2D by the way, and I don't feel like I missed much.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great,"I went to see this last night at my Odeon cinema, in 3D with my Real D glasses on, I expected to be entertained.I wasn't disappointed, Real D 3D technology is something to behold at the moment a novelty, but fast becoming the norm. I'm not 100% sure the effect works in all situations especially in this movie, but I can forgive it's imperfections.This film should have been great, the original film starring Lawrence Olivier won awards and that was nearly 30 years ago ! The fact that is was good but not great is testament I think to the lack of depth that is given to the movie.At 1 hour and 45 minutes long, the film follows a very simple plot that you're not left in any doubt will be fulfilled by the hero...So like the film Titanic, you know ultimately what will happen, but as with Titanic there's scope to build in sub plots, a love affair, a troubled hero and some really nasty villains... well, in clash the last one only survives. It's a real shame that the visually stunning effects of the 3D genre weren't put to more use and a more grown up film perhaps lasting 2 - 2 1/2 hours wasn't put out.It's almost like the script was re-written by a five year old.The cast are excellent and believable, if a little hamstrung by the limited script.The CGI elements work quite well, but again, once you've seen one giant scorpion, frankly you've seen them all.There's being faithful to a story and there's being faithful to a story, this one doesn't deviate, so what you end up with is a plot that you know, an outcome that's not in doubt and some big monsters in between.Chuck in some slow motion stuff (frankly the only point to showing wizzy flight scenes in 3D is in slow motion) and you've got the basis of a good movie...It certainly isn't going to win any awards.I would just aim a little criticism at both Zeus and Hades (though if I do they might smite me !!;-)), The ultra too shiny armour that Zeus wears, I'm sure is relevant to something, I seem to remember seeing it in the original, but really is that beard necessary too !!? Hades, well the voice, sounding like you've eaten one too many strepsils, again really isn't necessary and belies Ralph Fiennes actual ability to act a menacing character.All in all worth seeing but don't beat yourself up if you don't get to see it until it comes out on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
3 bad things,"Clash of the titans is great but they could have made it better if it wasn't for some mistakes which is pretty annoying. First of all the Kraken was a giant squid that crashed ships and so on, didn't look like that, this Kraken looked more like that pale alien that get sucked out in the space in the end in one of the Alien movies, don't remember which Alien movie to be honest. Second the the flying horsey Pegasos should have been white and not black, you guys should have done more research. Now the third thing and that was the fighting scenes was to short, like against Kraken and Hades just trowing a sword and he goes down to the underworld again... thought he was more powerful than that...could have dodged it or grabbed it. Oh yes one more thing, too many died in the underworld like Mads Mikkelsen should have survived too famous to die:"")This move didn't suck the sequel did and so did The immortals!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the biggest disappointments of my movie watching career!,"First of all, I got to say that I was hugely excited going in to the theater. I had actually been waiting for the movie to hit the theaters for a couple of weeks. Having previewed the plot this movie had all the right ingredients to be an instant classic, an epic tale, great mayhem between a man and a god.After all this hype and anxiety I finally got to see the film, and boy, was it disappointing?! I mean, the story was flat, it was not just predictable and boring but it was simply a BAD story. I didn't expect it to be a new Shawshank Redemption, no, but anyone could write a better script with the ingredients given for this film.I also made the mistake to see the movie as a 3D version. Only thing that I got out of it, was a headache and an additional 2,50 euros gone from my wallet. All the action sequences, where they tried to do something with 3d effects were blurry and just horrible.I suggest not to go see this movie, do not rent this movie, ever. You might wanna download it one day, but make sure you don't waste your money on it. This is a bad movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An entertaining fare for the weekend,"When I first saw the previews for Clash, I wasn't terribly thrilled. I never saw the original, and don't have much interest in seeing it. Neither have I been too big into Greek mythology. While I always found it kind of fun and exciting, it's nothing I rush out to see. So, Clash seemed like the kind of film I would see if nothing better to do. Suffice to say, the trailers didn't exhibit a whole lot of excitement. But, fueled by a recent play of God of War III and some 300-style excitement thanks to Sparticus: Blood and Sand, my interest was more so peaked. And sure enough, Clash delivers about what you'd expect: a fairly entertaining affair that probably won't be remember far beyond the theater.The film doesn't waste much time with mythology lessons. It explains, very briefly, that the children of the Titans, the Greek gods headed by Zeus, used a powerful creature, The Kraken, to kill their parents. But much of the film is a tale about half man, half god Perseus who sets off to defeat the mighty beast, whom Hades is trying to use to bring down Zeus and steal his thrown. And, pretty much the entire film is driven by it's action scenes, with some fairly epic battles, most notably against giant scorpions and Medusa (the Medusa battle was particularly fun).Most actors do a wonderful job in their respective roles, with Liam Neeson playing Zeus, Ralph Fiennes mimicking his Voldemort role as Hades, and favorite new action hero Sam Worthington as Perseus. The lovely Gemma Arterton, an up and coming actress who can next be seen in Prince of Persia, also does a fine job as aid to Perseus, Io, although her role seems a bit wooden. The three aforementioned actors though are the most entertaining, with Fiennes' Hades and Neeson's Zeus demonstrating a good bit of their acing finesse. Worthington proves once again that he is an excellent action hero, with him being the new reluctant hero for our time. Unfortunately, I can't help but feel as if his typecasting might wear thin. Having to watch Sam do another role like this might be it for me. But for this film, it's suitable.The action is the primary reason to see this, and it is quite exciting. It's nothing that makes you go wow, but it is quite entertaining. There's enough interesting Greek mythology here for a good time at the theater and it's certainly not a waste of time. Unfortunately, that missing wow factor hinders the film. I doubt that this will be remembered much outside the theater. The special effects never really present anything we haven't seen. Even the epic Kraken, which is given quite possibly the most epic introduction ever, isn't all you think it would be cracked up to be (no pun intended....on second thought....). Nothing really pops here, and that's a real shame. With all sorts of great Greek mythology to pull from, it could have even been possible to pull off something as epic as was played in God of War III. Or perhaps that's asking to much.All in all, I can't complain too much. The film doesn't try to be much more than what it is. It also doesn't go much beyond one action scene after another. So, for what it was, I suppose I got what I expected. Which is nothing I can complain about at all. Better than being disappointed. Hopefully you enjoy the film as much, or even more, than I did.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Some flaws, but it's an epic mythology-based action flick.","I have previously stated that I'm a myth buff, so I might be slightly biased to this movie from the get-go. It also has Sam Worthington from the new Terminator and Man On A Ledge. It also has Gemma Arterton, from Prince Of Persia and some other movies.This movie has it down to the lore for the most part. It's ironclad with epic battles and awesome special effects. It's got awesome characters and great acting. It also has a great cast. The story is interesting, though kind of cliché.And they use Perseus, one of the most ignored myth figures (more on him later).""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!""Can't ignore one of the greatest lines in history.This movie is one of the best, entertainment wise. The fight scenes were fast-paced and awesome, the special effects and musical scores were epic. It's pretty fantastic for a popcorn film with some humor mixed in some parts.However, it's one of those ""clusterfuck of death"" movies. Which are annoying go say the least. Like 3.5 soldiers live including Perseus. Yeah, there's a point five in there for a reason, I didn't just randomly throw it in there.Plenty of people rip on the plot and premise, though I gotta say I don't see what they're getting at. Yes, there's your predictable messiah complex, and yeah, the deaths of most of the characters lack impact, but in terms of the world and such, it's actually pretty interesting (though not much is really done with it). The people of Earth begin shunning the Gods, no longer praying towards them, so Hades comes to Olympus and talks Zeus into chastising the humans. And by chastising, I mean brutally murdering and then giving an ultimatum to those still alive: sacrifice the princess of their region or suffer a tentacle-y death (from the Kraken obviously). So Perseus who had been taken into ""custody"" and a legion of soldiers go off to find the Moirai, or the Fates, and hopefully find a way to kill the Kraken. The city is taken over by civilians who just want to live, while Perseus and his troupe of soldiers go on their mighty adventure.One big thing I want to criticize from a mythological standpoint is that while Poseidon is portrayed quite well (a psychopathic rapist), Zeus and Hades aren't. Both Zeus and Poseidon had sex with so many creatures before humanity was even a thing, yet Zeus genuinely wants Perseus (his son; a demigod) to survive/not be killed by the Kraken. Dude, Zeus would want to eat Perseus if anything to prevent his own death, which is something he did A LOT in the mythology, because he was paranoid. Hades, as usual in Hollywood fashion, is portrayed as your usual bad guy. And just so everybody who isn't a myth buff knows, Hades wasn't actually a bad guy. He kinda got screwed over and thrown into the Underworld, but he was actually a good guy; his brothers were asses, but I digress. The worst thing he did was kidnap Persephone and force her into marriage, and while it's no defense for what he did, here's why he did it: he didn't know any better. He lived in his father's stomach for years, only to be sent to the Underworld after the war against the Titans where there was no time for love. He kinda was just stuck there and never really learned a good way to romance, so when he saw this beautiful and nice girl, he practically hopped on a chariot, went into the overworld, picked her up and drove her back down with him. He was lonely and again, not an excuse, but that's the reason. And you can tell he was a good guy because he still let her go to the overworld one day every year (which is when spring begins). So he suffers the same fate of Magneto: misused as the token villain.It gets a 10/10. It's epic. Don't listen to the critics, this is an awesome movie. One of my favorites. Definitely better than ""Wrath"". I hope Rage can return this franchise to its roots of badassery.﻿ While it does a good job of respecting the mythos, it still does its own thing. For example, the Perseus of myth, like most heroes, had no real personality. Instead here, he does some (thin) depth.I haven't seen the original Titans film (I own it, I just haven't gotten around to it yet), but I'm pretty sure most people hate this because ""Aaaargh! Reboot!"". But my family (who has seen it) explained to me where this film deviated from the original, so I can tell you that this film does its own thing; but on the other hand, it does respect the original with some Easter eggs (which I found out via wiki lol)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's all Greek to Me,"Let me get this out of the way first: I have not seen the original Clash of the Titans. Because of this, I'm—obviously—unable to compare this remake with the 1980′s flick that so many people have fond memories of. I must also explain why I chose to experience the latest vehicle for now Hollywood commodity Sam Worthington the old fashioned way (which, of course, would be within the realm of the two dimensional). Knowing that most 3D endeavors are typically laden with the worst sort of filmmaking gimmicks, I wanted to give this one the chance to ""wow"" me without waving the tail of a giant scorpion in my face or having a larger-than- life Kracken tentacle bearing down on me as I inhaled popcorn.So, how does this over-the-top tale of Greek gods and mythical beasts fare? Really well, when one considers the fact that it was meant to be nothing more than a B-movie set in a long-forgotten world that plays within its own set of clearly defined rules.If someone enters Clash of the Titans expecting high art, then A) they haven't seen a single one of the previews for the film, B) they've watched any one of the Lord of the Rings movies one too many times or C) they've somehow managed to snuff out their inner child. What we get here is essentially a watered down version of the God of War video game series: the character of Perseus isn't nearly as well developed as the ash-covered anti-hero Kratos, but he's infinitely more likable.After watching his surrogate family perish at the hands of Hades, the demi-god (who's the son of Zeus) seeks revenge on the overly malicious god of the underworld. As he encounters the citizens of Argos—a town that's doomed because of it's blatant refusal to worship the inhabitants of Mt. Olympus—Perseus' motivations slowly shift toward the humane, and, after it's all said and done, he does emerge an enlightened protagonist. The word ""enlightened"" should be taken with many grains of salt, though, as this is character development of the most barebones variety. Titans is a movie that, despite its gargantuan scope, is strangely episodic in nature. Depending on your expectations, this is either a good thing or a bad thing, but, given the implicit nature of the movie, I found it to be entirely appropriate.As one would imagine, this doesn't meant that Titans is entirely without fault. It does become a little tedious to watch Perseus hurl himself from one exotic/mysterious locale to another, and we hardly get to know any of his companions before they're impaled, dismembered, or turned to stone. And at 106 minutes, the movie feels like it ends prematurely (there's also the long-anticipated confrontation with the oft-alluded to ""monster of epic proportions,"" which, like a number of other scenes, is over far too quickly).Still, this is a movie that's all about temporarily excusing reality and soaking up some beautifully crafted eye candy. In that regard, Clash of the Titans is just the sort of light-hearted fluff that most moviegoers are able to appreciate",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bomb of a nuclear proportion,"Never have I had the urge to leave a theater before a movie ends so much till this piece of junk was rolled in front of me. That was exactly how I feel during the running of the latest remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS. If it were not for my friend whose eyes were zealously piercing through those 3D glasses onto the screen, I would have been long gone even before 30 minutes into the movie. Yeah, it was THAT BAD. Throughout the entire movie one quote kept on running in my mind:""WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!""I am usually skeptical about watching remakes especially after the numerous spawning of such mediocre productions over the past decade or so. Yet when I read news that there would be an update version to the 1981 CLASH OF THE TITANS, I was conflicted with both enthusiasm and skepticism. For one thing, I have such reverence for the original version in terms of its faithful storyline in accordance to the legends and its authentic Greek feel. On the other hand, I felt that there was also a need to update the effects via new technologies; which I initially admit that the Ray Harryhausen's stop-animation masterpieces were pretty tacky and cheesy.I was hoping for too much.The result is a total waste of time for the audience and waste of talents in the lights of the actors, even for the gifted director, Louis Leterrier (who previously directed THE INCREDIBLE HULK which was good).The 2010 version of CLASH does not live up to its predecessor on so many levels. In fact, personally, I feel that it's really a bomb of a nuclear proportion.For a start, it felt too rushed as if trying to feed the audience with too many food from the buffet table all at one go so much so that as an audience I felt lost for most of the time. There were also too many unnecessary characters that not only disrupt the plot but were extremely annoying as well. Another point was that, some of these characters had almost no background stories at all. It's as if the writers felt compelled to showcase their existence in the film just so they could tie in to the mythology without having any need to have a proper introduction. For instance, Pegasus suddenly appeared all of a sudden without informing the audience where this creature came from leaving some of those (ahem...ignoramus who have no idea about Greek mythologies) audience clueless.The appearance of cameos were equally wasted on their roles that came on screen only for a few minutes. Screen veterans such as Pete Postlethwaite, Polly Walker, Jane March and Danny Houston were on screen for a mere several minutes with some of them only uttering a single line. Mind you, these are good Hollywood actors whose time were much deserved on better film projects.And just because the buzz word in films these days is 3D, that does not necessarily translate as making this ""supposedly blockbuster"" crap into one as well. Plus, it's tiring to have those glasses clutching onto your head throughout the entire movie especially when the only prominent 3D effect that was visible on screen was the subtitles.Now, having seen the new CLASH, I somehow have grown an immense respect for the 1981 version. I felt that those tacky and cheesy effects in the original 1981 version were but minute and trivial altogether in comparison to its bigger picture of the movie itself. I somehow feel humbled by the learned writings of Beverley Cross who designed the story almost accurately to the real legend and the gifted Desmond Davis' vision of the original for their masterpiece deserves all the respect of movie audiences who heard about CLASH OF THE TITANS both old and new. Last but not least, to the ""tacky and cheesy"" stop-animations of Ray Harryhausen who does deserve a considerable amount of credit for his effort in bringing the legend of Perseus to life.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Its the stuff of heroic romantic fantasy that every girls dream of, being swept off her feet by her hero riding a flying pegasus and all.But watching how badly this remakes tears apart our beloved couple, turning them into total strangers, and ended up our hero Perseus with another total stranger that, seriously i don't like and care at all, its really makes me wana scream at the big screen every time this Io whoever she is stroll along Persues like nobody business.Poor Andromeda ends up like so much baggage in the end.

A joyless soulless bore,"After his father and mother are killed at the hands of evil god Hades, demi-god Perseus plans to get his revenge on Hades. However, Hades isn't done yet and vows to unleash the Kraken (a deadly sea monster) which will destroy all of Argos unless a human sacrifice is made. Hades brother Zeus offers Perseus sanctuary on Olympus, but Perseus refuses and decides to bring the fight to Hades and protect Argos and its people at all costs...In action films I always feel that there has to either be strong character chemistry or the characters have to be intriguing in order for me to be able to invest in them as people. Sadly Clash of the Titans offers none of these things. Whilst some of the actors are good (Fiennes was great and belonged in a different film) others were not so good. Sam Worthington had zero charisma and made for a worthless lead. Gemma Arterton was similarly bland (the way she randomly appeared out of nowhere several times at the start of the film reminded me of Mr Benn).The action isn't that great either and even the much talked up battle with Medusa was not all that enthralling. Liam Neeson (a good screen presence and capable actor) is sidelined for most of the film (despite him being the god of the gods). Other things aren't really explained; who exactly were those group of people who save the team from the scorpions and where did they all go? Only one of them joins the team on their adventure; wouldn't it have made more sense if they all came along? Strength in numbers etc....The film ends in predictable fashion though truth be told I couldn't care one iota; I struggled remembering who was who here and what role/purpose they served.... as they were basically that uninteresting.In all honesty this is probably a 2 out of 10 film all day long, but Fiennes efforts alone are worthy of an extra star, but this is not enough to make this film worth seeing.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The initial moments of the film are a bit cheesy , but as the movie progresses, it gets better and better, well, the movie has its flaws, well, the flaws firstthe characters have little or no development whatsoever,no real scope acting either,and well, some stuff just happen for no real big reason ( the scorpion fight * not that it bothered :p *well looked like the editors and the directors decided the drama wasn't really all that important,so the drama is all sappy, too cheesy and clichéd ! i mean just cos the fisherman doesn't get some fish ( Perseus's dad ) the gods be damned. and well there isn't a LOT of development as to why the clash should even occur, well this why the movie was a bit flimsy, but digest these and your in for a treat. the action sequences are very well done, and unlike some recent movies ( * gasp ! transformers * ) the action can be seen , the handy cam effect wasn't overdone, well, the graphics don't feel as good as avatars, but other wise, the sheer scale of things is enough ! another thing is, in spite of all the action, its just so good that you would be left wanting a lil more, ( *especially with the kraken* ) but never the less this is pretty good entertainment.! and lemme tell you the KRAKEN IS A CGI TITAN !!! really cool stuff there !!! just get in there with family/ friends and get ready to have a nice time !!! p.s avoid the 3d if the fact that ur not watching 3d doesn't bother you a lot !",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Avoid even if you think you will like it,I probably should not review a film that I didn't even manage to finish but it was so bad I thought I should warn people.I thought this may be worth a viewing but with low expectations it would at least be some light dumb entertainment. I usually get through films like this even if they are not the greatest but this is very bad indeed.The script (if there was one) is awful so it doesn't matter how good the actors are (there are some very good ones in it) they have no hope of rescuing this.Stick to the films like Troy and Gladiator if you like that kind of thing and leave this well alone.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as the reviews make out,Ok so I don't know much about cinematography etc etc but I watch enough movies to know what is good and what isn't. The original is one of my favourite films but I was never going to compare the two.. That would be ridiculous however I really liked this. I couldn't help thinking of voldermort whenever hades was on screen haha and I'm sure I'm not alone but I sometimes wonder if I pay too much attention to reviews on here sometimes because most of us just want to be entertained and we don't really care about the specifics.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clash of the goofs,"I was very much disappointed by the movie overall. Firstly the story line went so fast that I couldn't catch the pace in the movie, second the movie is much more smaller than the original one made in 1981. Thirdly the acting was horrible and the dialogues were not up to the mark. Either the movie has a fault in itself or the director just made it to his own way just to fill the box office rush. This movie can be much better if given a bigger length, means up to 2 and a half hours with complete description of characters and origins of Greek Gods. anyway, the graphics were cool and for that I have rated it 2 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
An opportunity wasted,"The first thought that came to mind after watching Clash of the Titans was What an opportunity wasted!Now the movie isn't bad by any means & is an easy one time watch. But it could have been so much more.The Greek mythology is as rich as the Hindu mythology. Titan is the term for god in Greek mythology. Although the Greek gods are nothing more than a myth now, it would be wise to know that once upon a time they were thought to be real & a great civilization has worshipped them for centuries. There are many wonderful stories in Greek mythology & the story of Perseus, son of Zeus (Zeus like our Indra is the head of gods) is one of them.Based on the heroics of Perseus, Clash of the Titans was first made in 1981. With the current advances in visual effects, it's a nobrainer to remake it & so we have the current movie directed by Louis Leterrier starring Sam Worthington (Avatar fame) as Perseus, Liam Neeson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades (god of underworld & brother of Zeus), beautiful Gemma Arterton as Io (kind of guardian angel to Perseus), Alexa Davalos as Andromeda (princess of Argos) among others.The movie starts with a brief intro of current Titans & the rescue of baby Perseus floating in a coffin by a fisherman. How & why the son of a god was floating in the sea was narrated later in the movie. For now he grows as a simple man. When soldiers of the city Argos destroy a statue of Zeus thus declaring war on gods, Hades kills most of them & the family of Perseus who were just passing by. Remaining soldiers capture Perseus & take him to Argos. Hades appears at Argos & warns that if they don't sacrifice princess Andromeda in 10 days he will release Kraken (kind of huge monster with tentacles) on to the city. Although initially perceived as an enemy, Perseus was released by the king of Argos seeing his anger towards the gods & realising that they need him to defeat Kraken. Io who has been watching Perseus all his life advises Perseus to defeat Kraken. So Perseus & a small group of soldiers start their adventurous journey in which they face a lot of CGI enemies including the snake haired Medusa which finally ends with the defeat of Kraken & Hades being sent into the underworld.By the way, I always thought that Pegasus was white. Is it really black or white? Any Greek scholars reading this, clarification would be much appreciated. And why is Worthington having a military haircut? It suits well for Avatar or Terminator. But it is awkward with the skirts that he wears in the movie.Louis Leterrier's previous movie was The Incredible Hulk which I enjoyed immensely. Unfortunately he could not replicate the same here. At the end of it, Clash of the Titans is nothing more than a few action set pieces. If you only concentrate on the action sequences leaving aside proper story & character development, you can't have a die-hard or an incredible hulk. 300 was an exception but it was very stylish & it works once. Perhaps Clash of the Titans should have been made by a better suited director for fantasy genre.This is the 3rd heavy budget action flick in the last 2 years for Worthington after Terminator & Avatar. He is alright as Perseus. Liam Neeson in that silver costume & beard was highly misfit in the role of Zeus. But I think he would superbly fit into the role of Lincoln which by all means Spielberg is going to direct in future. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Hades & I guess his experience as Voldemort has helped him. I couldn't stop thinking about Deathly Hallows. I have a thing for British actresses & Gemma is very beautiful in the role of Io.All the technical aspects including cinematography & visual effects are very good. The action pieces are good & you will get your money's worth if you see this in 2D.I saw the movie in 2D although it is also released in 3D. There are 2 types of 3D movies. The 1st type are the ones which are actually shot using 3D technology. Avatar or Up or The Final Destination falls into this category. The 2nd type are the ones which are shot normally but are converted into 3D in post processing at the last minute by the greedy studios in order to increase the collections as 3D tickets cost more. Clash of the Titans falls into this category. So 3D viewing is unnecessary & you are not going to miss anything if you watch this in 2D. An extra benefit is that you will save money.It feels a little painful when what could have been a potential classic was made into an average popcorn flick. If you like action movies see Clash of the Titans but I don't expect you to remember the movie after a while.See more of my reviews at http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Aaaahhh... Wait A Minute...,"As one who's made a study of mythology and religion, I found myself cringing back HARD into my chair! And that's not to say that the Harry Hamlin movie was that much better, it's just the version I grew up with in the 80's!Were it not for the AMAZING cast - many of which you only get to see in the background *ahem Olympus* and the stunning CGI, this would be a horrid flop! This movie lost sight of all things that made the mythology an important religion. What's next? The new Bible movie in Disney land with the cast of Harry Potter?

Flashy action flick,"CLASH OF THE TITANS is surprisingly fun for an effects-heavy Hollywood blockbuster, a remake of Ray Harryhausen's last movie (of the same title), made in 1981. While this is the inferior version - and I'll always plump for stop motion effects over CGI - it remains an engaging, entertaining piece of modern cinema.Meathead Sam Worthington gives another ultra-wooden turn as Perseus, a demigod on Earth who decides to go on a quest to teach the vengeful gods a lesson. He's teamed up with a bunch of characters who are far more interesting than him (including Mads Mikkelsen and a wooden golem type guy) and spends the rest of the movie battling various CGI creations.The story is slim and the dialogue slimmer, filled with predictable characters and stereotypes (Gemma Arterton's walking exposition-type character is particularly ill served). The scenes with the gods are silly and trite, with the likes of Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson looking like they're dressing up at the local panto. In essence, CLASH OF THE TITANS is a string of set-pieces involving the mythological monsters of old, including the Medusa and the Kraken.Yet something works. It's an easy film to watch, light-hearted and unpredictable in places in regards to the fate of certain characters. The movie is heavy on spectacle and the action isn't too bad at all. I enjoyed it, and I'll be sure to check out the sequel (WRATH OF THE TITANS) in due course...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Next time go and rewrite the Bible,"Well, after seeing a few reviews here I was expecting the worse before seeing this movie, but even then it exceeded (in a wrong way) my expectations. The whole movie looked to me like a hallucination of someone high on drugs. The director/writer(s) just dumped a few (imho important) parts and characters off the classic myth, then filled the empty space with stuff they made probably during/after a really hard drinking night. Conflict between Zeus and Hades? Revenge driven Perseus? Who the hell is Io anyway? Pegassus coming from nowhere acting like a puppy? Djinns? They look like Treebeard from LOTR, but what do they do in this story? And last, but not least - anyone who did not bother to read the Greek mythology before seeing this **** will keep on asking: - Who is this Andromeda girl? What's the big deal anyway? Just dump her in the water and call it a day! I could continue, but this movie just isn't worth it. A nice classic story misused, raped, chewed and spitted to the ground, added some CGI and that's it. The outcome is shallow, boring and absolutely disappointing. I gave it 2 for some acting and the Medusa fight scene, which I find the only so-so interesting part in the whole movie. I was looking forward to it, as it had a great potential to be nice using modern technologies. The puppets in the '81 original did not really give her justice, so OK, the movie earned an extra point for the Medusa and some CGI. That was the actual way of making this movie I'd expect. Take the part of the story, maybe tweak it a little, make it look good and that's all. Yepp, and did I mention Kraken looked to me pretty much like the monster from Cloverfield?",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Action sequences linked together by mediocre dialogue.,"For these types of movies, where the trailer has more to do with showing off visual effects rather than hooking your interest on the story itself, I go into the theater with fairly low expectations. That mindset did not help me this time.Some characters could act better than others, which made the movie seem... Unbalanced. Terrible character development and chemistry. Certain characters would seemingly die at random, impossible turn of events/action sequences - even within the context of a mythological movie with gods and titans were far too fake and extreme.Towards the end, the producers decided that they needed to wrap up the movie's plot very quickly - and they did, but the speedy ending shows. At certain moments during the movie, it seems the editor would cut an entire dialogue section out and then stitch the beginning and end together.If you want to be visually entertained and have little else to do, it may be worth seeing; this movie, however, is purely trailer driven.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No Clash, No Titans","OK. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen a lot of bad film makings this year, so where do we start?? Oh, just for the record, if you witnessed 1981's ""Clash of the Titans"" you'll understand what I mean. I was just 10 years old when I watched it and it was brilliant - No 3D, no CGI, just a great story with a great ride to be on for 2 hours. When there's a remake of an old movie, it should add some depth, some good acting, some ""WOW"". There was nothing there. Actors were as if they were reading from a piece of paper learning how to be in a movie; false feelings, false rage, false fear..I didn't care for any of them. Sam Worthington is not a good actor (And I am an Avatar fan), the accent is awful. He shouldn't star in these ""block buster"" films. The movie is too hollow, too shallow, its just one action scene to another with nothing in between. Definite 5/10 at the most.

Why the brickbats ?? it's fun!!,"*******1/2 I just don't understand what people wanted to see in this movie. It doesn't claim to be an accurate mythological account...not at all! It's a fun upgrade of an earlier movie of the same name telling the tale of Perseus,the son of Zeus. It is chock a bloc filled with action involving demi-gods , monsters, mystical creatures,eternal beauties, jinns et al!! Awesome C.G.I.adds to the thrill ride! I myself do not like pretentious movies, and expected this to be one...but it isn't. Right from the beginning it rarely takes itself too seriously, so you know it's not trying to be another Troy or even a 300 for that matter!!!And for its entire running time it never dragged. Such mythological movies do not get made as often as in the 60's or 70's and it was really wonderful to see a quality cast and some great acting( of course the performances are a tad melodramatic, but that's how it was intended to be!!)! Sam Worthington is good as Perseus(though he always seems to be limited in his repertoire of expressions) Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus and Hades are great as usual, Mads Mikkelsen is slowly becoming one of my favorites (watch him here as Draco and watch him in Valhalla Rising and then go see him in Adam's Aebler!) Gemma Arterton looks stunning... much better than her recent act in Prince of Persia, the rest of the cast also gives great support!! This is a good movie with wholesome clean entertainment for everyone and has enough thrills to give one one's moneys worth!! so do see it only on the big screen, but be sure to know what to expect.... a made for fun action adventure epic... and not an accurate mythological drama!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been so much better..,"This movie had great moments, no doubt about it. Its source material also had great potential. Its set pieces, visuals, and overall artistic direction were all fantastic. Most of the cast are also well-chosen actors with good ability. The problem here truly is the writing. Not that it's bad, it's just...well...lacking. Lacking in focus, lacking in rhythm, and lacking in character development. Perhaps the greatest flaw is in the fact that all the supporting characters are far more interesting and textured than the main character.Truthfully, I don't know if it's Sam Worthington's acting, Leterrier's directing or just the material; but Perseus is just a flat, boring character for most of the movie. I mean yes, he makes decisions, he moves around and he fights but there's little to no emotional investment in this. I can't tell what he's feeling at any given moment, no matter how earth-shattering the events are around him. Consequently, I can sympathize or empathize with him as a human being. His characters opinions and decisions also very often seem out of the blue.And then there's Andromeda, I mean jeez talk about wasted opportunity. This girl is hardly in the movie! Alexa Davalos can act, and the character had huge amounts of dramatic potential. A kingdom falling apart, parents who dared challenge the Gods, and the duty to end it all by sacrificing herself. There's great stuff here, but sadly either the writers or the director decided it wasn't important enough to show us.Time management seemed to have been a really big issue here. Or just focus. They had two hours to set up the players, build up to climaxes, and tell us a story. In my opinion they spent far too much of it showing us inconsequential things. I don't want to spoil anything, but really the entire twenty-minute opening of the movie could've been shortened by half and/or merged into the next twenty minutes with nothing lost. Because the didn't do this, I had a feeling they were forced to wrap up the climax and conclusion in far too sloppy a manner.Great action, good atmosphere, just wish they did the main character more justice. Hell of a supporting cast though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining but only light fluff,"Remakes in general have a pretty big hill to overcome. Whether producers, actors and studios alike think they're doing the fans a service, it is still very likely approval will be low. A remake of an original work can't have tributes alone to satisfy viewers. But this is also the problem, a remake has to do something different from the original but also not completely alter everything, or it will alienate its base. The only way a remake can truly have success is if the original was either not that good to begin with or it manages to step up its game. Most of the time, these kinds of opportunities are far and few between. For this remake, competing with the original Clash of the Titans (1981) was already a tough call. With so many aspects of the original enjoyed by many, this film had to meet some high expectations. And while it wasn't as well received, it did manage to still produce some popcorn fluff. Just not in all the right places.With Travis Beacham (who would later work on Pacific Rim (2013)), Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (Æon Flux (2005)) as writers to this film, it is apparent that they tried to make it similar to the original. When a man named Perseus (Sam Worthington) witnesses his family's death to a god, he sets it his mission to fight back. This motivation is only reinforced when the city of Argos, a rebellious city is threatened by Zeus (Liam Neeson) to be destroyed. With Hades (Ralph Fiennes) being granted permission to let the kraken loose on the city thanks to the queen (Polly Walker), Perseus and Argos' strongest men seek the answer on defeating it. Directed by Louis Leterrier, a guy with many action films tied to his name like Transporter (2002) and Transporter 2 (2005), certainly has what is needed for a film that needs lively energy. The biggest issue though is the script and Sam Worthington as the lead.While Worthington can grimace, yell and move athletically, his emotional range needs some work. Being that the script relies more on the loss of his family and less about romance, there lacks an emotional balance in the story. There's barely a time where Perseus even cracks a smile or wise remark. As a result, the lead feels less charismatic and more just a pawn in the story. With the writers' screenplay failing to incorporate more of this, it feels as though they forgot the heart of the story. Yet somehow they did remember to include charming and more favorable dialog for the supporting actors like Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, Hans Matheson, Ashraf Barhom, Mouloud Achour and Nicholas Hoult who play Argos' top warriors. So, not sure how that works. Even Ian Whyte who plays some mysterious humanoid scorpion creature is more interesting to watch.Aside from this, the writers do include some other references to the original like Jason Flemyng who plays the cursed Calibos. Even Bubo the mechanical Owl appears for a cameo. Action sequences are by far the strongest this film has to offer. Whether the fighters are fending off other human attackers, human sized creatures or giant monstrosities, the action is lively and engaging. The best set piece is when Perseus and company come across super-sized scorpions. Even the battle between Perseus and Medusa (Natalia Vodianova) is fairly entertaining even though it won't ever top the original. The weakest was probably the one between Perseus and Calibos. All this is most likely due to Louis Leterrier's experience working with action set pieces. Believe it or not though the graphic content is turned down. Although that's probably just to attract a wider audience.Visuals to the film are an unfortunate mixed bag. While the imagery, makeup effects and creature designs are creative, their CGI counterparts tend to suffer. Although watching movies can be used as an escapist activity, to watch actors walking around and interacting with various settings that are CGI ruins the whole experience. There's barely a place that feels like it is physically tangible. The cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr. (The 13th Warrior (1999) and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)) was adequate, it was just the CGI scenes that felt the least credible. Producing the music was composer Ramin Djawadi, who had worked on Blade: Trinity (2004) and Iron Man (2008). Relying heavily on strings and electric guitar, Djawadi makes an interesting interpreter for the film. Sadly, it has very little resemblance to that of the upbeat and adventurous sounding score from the original.The supporting components to this remake are probably the best thing it has to give. From the supporting cast, to the music, cinematography and action. Yet the fault in the foundation are the CGI effects, a less than charismatic lead and rather unemotional screenplay revolving around the lead. It's fun but not for frequent revisiting.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

bland and boring,"The Greek Gods unleashed their melodramatic wrath on men last Friday with the release of Clash of the Titans.Men have grown tired of following the will of the Gods and have declared war against them but the mortals don't stand a chance against the power of the gods.Then enter Perseus, (Sam Worthington from Avatar) the mortal son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). Perseus doesn't want this war but is motivated by the death of his adoptive family by a god, Poseidon.So there it is, the reluctant protagonist motivated by the death of his adoptive family to seek vengeance against his biological father aided by an eclectic group of allies makes for the typical fantasy-action movie.This movie clearly tried to ride on the excitement of the action sequences and effects of the CGI and at times that was possible. The scorpion fight scene was particularly well done. But later in the movie as the plot begins to weaken more and more those scenes loose their impact.The movie relies on its special effects a lot. Not quite to the extent that Avatar did but still the effects are a big crutch for the movie to lean on and they are done well. The gigantic scorpions are frightening and the glowing hall of the gods was particularly stunning.Neeson plays Zeus well, the authority can be heard on his voice. Ralph Fiennes, who always seems to play the villain, is Hades. He is great as the ruler of the underworld, a master manipulator. Worthington as Perseus is dull, he plays the protagonist with little emotion and makes the character bland. He also appears to the only person with a razor at this point in history. While everyone around him has biblically long beards he manages to maintain that constant tough guy stubble.Clash of the Titans tries to mask a predictable story with over the top fight scenes and a pair of good actors but can't quite pull through and leaves viewers in disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Let me take you when I was 10 years old, this was the time I starting to love the art form know as film and understand it. And then saw the trailer for this movie and thought to myself "" this is going to suck!"" and funny thing is I think people had the complete opposite reaction as me because I think they though the trailer looked great and then hated the film while me I hated the trailer and Loved the film. So one Friday night I went to blockbuster and rented this movie and order some Pizza, I went home saw it with my sister and some slices of Pizza and completely loved it. And then went on a trip to San Francisco and told to my cousin how much I loved this movie and regretted I did not see it in 3D cause that was the time I started to love the 3D gimmick. But then he told me this movie sucked and did not believe it but then the reality came that most critic and movie fans hated this movie and I felt like the only person who really enjoyed well this is not the first time it happened (Spider-Man 3 and Tron: Legacy I also saw later that year and still really enjoy it) and that the 3D conversion was terrible. And then I grew up and realized script was not great, but I still have so much fun watching it. Like the customs for the Gods are so flashy and ridicules but it so funny. The acting Ralph Fiennes over acting it, Liam Neeson always sounds like going speeches , Gemma Arterton only there for being hot and Sam Worthing being likable but not the best actor around but I kinda like him actually.

"This new version wants to be bigger than it is. What could be a new epic, stumbles in several respects, and ends up as just a passing adventure and disposable","When it was announced that there would be a new version of the classic 1981 Clash of The Titans from director Desmond Davis and had like stars in the cast Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Ursula Andress and Harry Hamlin as Perseus protagonist - we are concerned in view of the remakes they always tend to be lower than the original. However, this movie is extremely interesting, because what is being discussed and polemic is far from the story itself, but as it was released and sold to the public. Later on go into detail on these issues.The story is virtually the same as the previous version with slight modifications. The great controversy is evidenced unreasonable and unjustified use of 3D. Probably being seen as the worst work launched in format, thanks to a conversion done in just over eight weeks and packaged by the absurd success of ""Avatar"", tried to pull a little more money of moviegoers, thus increasing their box office worldwide. The 3D is extremely poorly implemented, and we see the characters and converted elements standing out in the foreground, but also continue in the background, and just seeing a greater depth in the scenes but with duplicate elements and characters, looking like the ""ghost"" as common in analog TV broadcasts that is still very present in our homes daily. This quick conversion, being accepted by the executives and the French director Louis Leterrier, showed nothing but opportunistic and not bothered to offend the intelligence of the viewers.
In this new version, there Titans, now classic 1981 Thetis was present. However, a mention: the Kraken would have decimated the Titans in battle. No reference historical or mythological, serving solely to increase the fear of the creature with which Perseus is not enough to fight, after all, only the head of Medusa can defeat him, since petrifies anyone or anything with meat that look.
Other distinct and divergent points between the two versions are: In the current film everything revolves around the trio Perseus - Hades - Zeus, while in the 1981 film have featured other gods like Athena and Aphrodite (played by Ursula Andrews), in 1981, Medusa is a creature that turns any man into stone, if he looks straight into her eyes. In 2010, with the help of computer graphics, Medusa has quick movements and crawling like a snake; On film Desmond Davis, Pegasus was a white horse, with artificial wings. In the new version Leterrier, and Black Pegasus is largely created in computer graphics, which makes you more beautiful and very realistic for his scenes in the air; mythological Kraken monster has tentacles and is weevil, referring more to Godzilla and the effects the time in stop-motion reaches deep cause nuisance to see something so badly done. Meanwhile the Kraken 2010 earned more teeth, was much taller and imposing, with its tentacles and size of sight destroy whole villages; Gods of Olympus in version 1981, had white clothes and discreet. Now the current gods, 2010, earned a more detailed costume and constant brightness, with a sort of divine aura encircle them all the time; In version 80, Perseus is hairy as the other warriors and people of his time. Already, Perseus Sam Worthington appears with his head almost shaved unlike all the others who shared scenes with him: The scorpions in the desert in 1981, come from the blood of Medusa's head. In the new version, they arise from the shedding of the blood of Hades had given powers to Calibos to destroy Perseus; witches who predict the future are present in both versions. The difference is that in the 2010 version. they are more distorted and dark.
While the film from 1981 bet on love story, defined as the hero Perseus and Calibos protagonist as a villain (deformed, punished by the gods and dedicated to kill the hero who was his disgrace), the new version brings gods who are now demanding other men are egocentric. It is not a matter of faith, but rather to measure forces. Perseus and Andromeda star in one of the most famous love stories of Greek mythology, whose version states that the love of Perseus by Princess ordered to be served in sacrifice to be devoured by the Kraken (the monster Cetus, the myth) so you can save Argos from destruction, motivates him to challenge the wrath of Poseidon and Medusa.If the 1981 version is approached the love story between the demigod Perseus and the beautiful Princess Andromeda and all obstacles to the realization of this union, the 2010 version passes away this synopsis. Without any justification, the focus was turned to war and not for romance, even though the events between the versions are very similar. Probably the greatest misconception in this new version has been put aside the fact that instead of falling in love with Andromeda and risking his life for his love, as legend, Perseus has now thinks of revenge and hatred against the gods here the figure of Hades, who killed his adoptive parents. The existence of the island of Sefiro and myths of Andromeda and Cassiopeia, are but a mere citation and attempted to curl the public does not know the background story.The Perseus from Leterrier further denies his paternity. He is more rebellious and tries to solve everything with his own hands, without the aid of the gods. Do not accept gifts sent by Zeus (a sword and the horse Pegasus) and not lose the chance to say that will solve the problem ""like a man"", leading phrases and clichés effect as: ""I'd rather die like a man than live like a god. "" Clearly, Perseus is not on your journey to save the people and much less by the princess - whose only contacts were at the beginning of the plot and when he saves her in the end - but to prove they can beat the Kraken in search of his personal vendetta. Another factor is that Perseus, after being diminished and treated badly by gods and men pay revenge to liberate the people of Argos. In the original film, the link was much stronger, because he was in love with Andromeda. But worst of all is that Perseus can master a sword very quickly and with great skill, which may be acceptable for him being a demigod within themselves, but it is still difficult to imagine being that he was a fisherman who had never caught a sword before in my life.The big problem is that Clash of the Titans is a movie that tries to be great that ceases to have essence. Perseus lack charisma, lacking a better script developed on relations of his characters, lacking a real enemy since Hades is immortal and Kraken has right destination. Lack emotion and realize that the journey of Perseus, while interesting for opponents faced along the way, goes very quickly.What actually inherited this remake of the 1981 film were attracted big names to head the cast. Sam Worthington is probably one of the misconceptions in the movie. Coming from big blockbuster movies like Avatar (2009) and Terminator Salvation (2009), he seemed to operate in automatic and as a vengeful hero and no sense of humor, pulled the proximity to the audience. Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do what they can, but the script just barely does not help much to develop their characters, like Jason Flemyng as Calibos / Acrisius. Alexa Davalos is already beautiful but the real story of Andromeda and was left out and she just has the chance to show what came. Gemma Arterton is also stunning and mesmerizing and just his presence alone is a reason to grudarmos eyes on the screen.Clash of the Titans is a production with many flaws and the screenplay shallow and emotionless, lacking a story that really meddle and make us vibrate every fight scene, always on the side of the protagonist, and also lacking in most villain's incisors and imposing. The end result presents us with excellent action scenes and effects - especially the scene the scorpions that are larger and more threatening to the scene of cut off Medusa's head, where we noticed a great finish and shows the magnificence of the dreaded woman petrifies those who look, and clear to the sequences of flight Pegasus and creatures that Hades turns in the air to kill the soldiers of Argos at the beginning of the film pursuing Perseus and Pegasus at the end of the film, and this without mentioning Kraken that is incredibly bigger, better and more frightening - and that far surpass the lamentable and laughable effects from the previous film.We cannot be hypocrites and the fact that this latest version has modified some things and rely primarily on effects, like we find effects of the 1981 film better or more original than today. After all, the worst thing is that we stand before a movie that tries to be serious and cause fear in the scenes of Medusa, the scorpions and especially the Kraken, and all that is able to make us laugh, even for someone who was at the time the film original. This takes away all credibility of the work, so much so that even today when we speak of the film, rather than the story itself, the first thing we hear are teasing the stop-motion effects, further being done after George Lucas had revolutionized recently the Question special effects in cinema with ""Star Wars."" If we compare a decline is absurd.As said before, the problem with this new ""Clash of the Titans"" is want to be too big. With the technology available today, Leterrier - the good The Transporter (2002), Danny The Dog (2005) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) - might actually have performed an epic blending action, romance and Greek mythology of the best quality. But unfortunately what we see is a plot fragmented, too simplistic for the claims of the film and how it was sold in the disclosure and full of clichés and easy solutions. Serves the same purpose and to appreciate the great adventure. Disappointment for what could be a new epic, stumbles in several respects, and ends up as just a passing adventure and disposable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Funny? Action? Characters?,"I know, that many many people invested years into this movie. It took millions of dollars and a lot of time and effort. I am sorry to say, that this film was disappointing. A few funny scenes, sometimes a nice scenery and plenty of opportunities for action, but in the end this movie was a waste of time and money. Most of the special effects were second class and I am glad that I did not invest in the 3D Version. The script was not able to create enough tension to keep me close to the story and again, there was no character I could identify with. I did not care if the hero was successful or not, I was not afraid of Hades or Medusa. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes are great actors, but they had no chance to look good in this story. Zeus with his curled beard and this twinkling armor was ridiculous and Hades was a lame enemy. The story itself was full of logical gaps and could not rivet my attention.4 Stars for the investment of time and effort, that I appreciate, but not really a movie the world needed.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Decent"" = Disappointment","To label a movie like this as being ""not bad"" is in itself an oxymoron. If you had to call it 'not bad' to cleverly avoid calling it 'not good', than the movie didn't live up to it's hype, and left you disappointed. You should instead think about it for a second and say 'Could I have spent my money on something better?' Sadly in my case the answer is yes. This movie had plenty tense action scenes and some awkwardly placed humor (which was hilarious) for me to call it decent but to be 100% honest, let me get to the point. Redbox it. If you've got money to blow, and you insist on seeing every popular title for yourself, than have at it! Make sure it's in 3D, and I hope you enjoy! But if you're on a tighter budget and would enjoy a more satisfying theater experience, save this title for the Redbox - rent it for a few nights, hell even let the dog get a hold of it and drag it under the couch, and return it a few days later. Whatever suits your fancy. But if you are on a tight budget, don't spend more than 5 dollars total on seeing Clash of the Titans. We spent 30 for two 3D tickets. Shamefully, this turned out to be a waste of money. I never check IMDb for fear of being misled but in this case I must say, the current rating of 6.8 is about right. Don't expect an epic phenomenon, the movie is simply Decent. Impressive CGI can sometimes glorify mediocre movies, so take that into account when reading some of the more Grand 10-star reviews. Movies like Avatar or Lord of the Rings (plenty others. dare I mention Titanic?) would have still been amazing movies even if made in 1990 with minimum use of CGI. But astonishingly realistic CGI is what takes them from 'Amazing' to 'EPIC'. Again, sadly this remake would flop horribly if it were made in 1990 with more basic CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Epic with nothing really Epic.,"This movie should have been great, should have been a classic and it should have been Epic. It was not. The original, with a limited budget and quite frankly silly actors, was still a great movie. It told it's story well.This version on the other hand had a huge budget, some very fine actors and yet it lacks in almost every aspect except CGI. It seems all action blockbusters these days have no real substance other than their effects.The script is the poorest aspect of this film. Even the lines which were supposed to be Epic and the big lines of the movie did not pay off. The movie jumps around from place to place with no cohesion. There seems to be no real motivation for most of the characters to be doing what they are doing and many seem just thrown in there for the sake of it. Sam Worthington impressed me in Avatar, but is completely lackluster in this movie. His facial expressions and his way of delivering the rather poor lines was pretty awful. Gemma Arterton has been thrown in for eye-candy and her lines were also painfully performed.None of the other actors in this movie had any decent lines and so their performance was also rather poor. This movie doesn't sag in the middle, it sags the whole way through.The CGI and action sequences were very good, but they are few and far between. They hold your attention during their duration, but then it returns to it's painful to watch story.As previously stated, with the large budgets, good source material and some very fine actors in this movie, it should have been great. It should have been Epic. But, instead was actually very poor. Even for a no-brains-required action summer blockbuster.There are rumours a COTT 2 is in the works. If I could ever request anything from it's makers, is to hire some decent writers, get a decent script and work on the story before a CGI computer is even turned on.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cash'in of the Titans,"Seeing as the original Clash of the Titans was the very first movie to capture my imagination and offer my childhood a lead to conquer and vanquish any villain my games could conjure, my expectations might have slightly jaded my impressions before the e-transaction for a couple of tickets to this 3-D remake had been processed.Then again, this is not the making of a book into a movie where one can always expect a depreciation of the plot and running thoughts in favour of action sequences or musical montages. This is the remake of a movie and if it's only purpose had been to revamp and modernize the effects from the original, it could have indeed been what some critics are labelling as ""epic"".The truth is that, they took the plot from the 1981 version, mulched it to a fine paste and steamrolled-it flat to make it easier to digest. By offering it in 3-D (which clearly came as an after-thought), my guess is they had figured this would bring back some depth to the classicTotal miss.In sum, this movie is hardly worth seeing but if you are going to, don't bother seeing it in 3-D.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hollow yet entertaining,"Just finished watching this movie, with a bit of mixed feelings. First of all, movie on it's own is not that bad as people describe it to be. True there is no resemblance to original myths. Also true that this movie is exact reap off the original 1981 movie. Despite all that, effects are great - really enjoyed them.The paste is fast and action scenes are decent. Kraken scene is the best. I felt what was really missing from it is the heart and the acting (besides Liam Neeson, solid as usual). It felt like director tried to simplify already simple story, which in turn made it look extremely hollow. Sam Worthington couldn't do what he did in Avatar and terminator - look charismatic hero. in fact at times he looks quite degenerate - but i think it's the producer's fault for cutting all the ""unnecessary"" scenes. The story of soldiers and hunters are not told at all. In any case, I saw it and it was OK, but if you look for something more spectacular, go see Avatar again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Intellectual, Inspiring, and passionate film-making !","I want to review this film by comparing it to the original and as a film on it's own. As a kid, I watched the original on HBO over and over because it was the most mesmerizing thing on TV at the time. Even Star Wars didn't immerse me into the mythological world like Clash of the Titans. After seeing this re-make last night, I could honestly say that this film is going to stand the test of time and eventually become a cult classic like the original.I left the theater with goosebumps and still have them as I write this review and think about the film. Now I'm not the type of casual movie fan that enjoys everything with great CGI and pretty actors like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy 3, or other mindless swash-buckling adventures.Clash of the Titans is not that kind of movie. I'll even go as far as saying it is superior to the original. The reason is that the producers of this film were very passionate about it and put lots of love into the making of this film. Being a lover of old mythology myself, I was really inspired by this film and was surprised to see such a smart, metaphorical, religious and inspiring movie. It never gets boring like Lord of the Rings did at times. There is always something happening to keep you on the Edge. The choreographed fight scenes were pretty good, and there was lots of wire work which was pleasing to see. At times, the movie felt like a God of War video game with a boss fight at the end of every scene! The main character really grows with each minute and you care about him in the end.Now as for the acting, well, top-notch all around. What do you expect with such talent on the screen by the leads and supporting actors. Sam Worthington is no joke, he's going to be a bigger star than he already is, and on a side note; I find it odd he always plays a character that is half human. Lliam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are imposing as the Mighty brothers Zeus and Hades and look very similar in appearance. I think they really are a match made in heaven; (No pun intended) I wish they had more screen time, better yet, I wish the film was longer in general! Now the directing; excellent! Paced very well. Louis Leterrier has a new fan. He really has the promise to be the next Ridley Scott! Too bad this was a big budget B movie, and if he had more funding, this film could have been as Epic as Lord of the Rings or even the Ten Commandments and Ben Hur. It really reminded me of all those films, it reaped quality.The sets were epic! A true old fashioned film in every sense. Fans of the original might find a surprise in this film in the shape of a stop-motion, metallic bird! That's all I'm going to say! Finally, the soundtrack impressed as well and featured such beautiful music! I can't remember the last time I purchased a soundtrack not made by Hans Zimmer or Danny Elfman. I am buying the soundtrack for sure.Summary: 9/10 A film with great acting, directing, music, sets, CGI, plot and characters. Oh and I didn't mention the Pegasus! Wow !",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent film!,"As a fan of the original ""Clash of the Titans"" from Harryhausen in 1981, I dreaded the idea of a remake that would crush the magical fantasy land that he created with the first version. And lo and behold, my fears were confirmed.This film tears to shreds the ""Perseus vs. Medusa"" myth and replaces it with mindless power chord progressions, endless action sequences, and a trivialized view of the Greek gods. Sam Worthington has proved himself to be a competent actor recently, but his performance is just nauseating with his embarrassed delivery of wooden dialogue. The script is awful, and the overblown spectacle of the entire thing is so self-indulgent that I was bored within the first 15 minutes.I will say however that the only redeeming factor is the film's action sequences. Though they do tend to drag on for nearly 10 minutes too long in every case, they are well shot, and the hand-held camera adds to the effect of the battle's intensity.Slightly below average action film. Don't go expecting a faithful adaptation of the original myth or even a quality remake of Harryhausen's classic film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I expected better,"I was really disappointed with this movie. I have never seen the original but the previews for this looked decent.The movie is not that well made. To me it seems like the director tried to add elements that made other movies famous or popular.I am not usually picky with action movies but i found myself looking at the clock often through this one. Some things this movie fell flat on:1)Storyline - Boring.You barely get to know the main character and don't really know most of the other characters at all. They seem more like extras than support cast.The story moves along in a rather choppy fashion. Bad storytelling.2)Special effects- Not much better than the original which was done nearly 30 years ago. IF you are expecting Avatar level CGI you are going to be greatly disappointed. Even the magical special effects for the ""Gods"" were boring.3) Witty comments- There are parts of this movie where it seems it was trying to be like 300. Unfortunately it just made the movie more cheesy.4)Action- Shaky camera syndrome incoming. Its hard to follow action when it looks like someone is running around the fight with a camcorder. The action scenes make you beg for more walking and talking and less action.5)Musicial Scores- I had this problem with the new Star Wars movies and it was the only thing i hated about them. I cannot stand it when The musical score/sound effects are so loud you cant hear what people are saying. Even with my graphics equalizer set for human voices and toning down highs and lows the music and other sound effects were to overpowering to hear what the characters were saying at times.I find it annoying if i have to struggle at all to decipher voices from an overpowering musical score.Overall this movie wasn't very well done. I gave it a 4 because its better than watching reruns on cable. It is mildly entertaining but its nothing that your going to remember the story on when you wake up tomorrow. Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief is a much more entertaining and put together story about the Greek gods. I would only get this if i couldn't find another new release to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well.... I kinda liked it.,"Okay, look, for me this film is a vast technical improvement over the one starring Harry Hamlyn toting a clockwork owl. Now, having said that, I've got to admit that like Variety's Brian Lowrey, I too felt like I was watching a rehash of Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"", only set in Ancient Greece with a few minor alterations here and there.Otherwise, I liked the film. Oh sure, the dialogue was canned, as was the dark feel of the film (a thing I didn't like), but it was entertaining. Truth be told the SFX did overshadow what could have been a better film, but the acting is what it is, solid, not really outstanding as this really isn't high drama (though it could have been).The action scenes and the brooding by the characters holds back a better film. But the story is solid. In fact, I'd say it's better executed than the original, which to me always felt like a Disney film gone bad.If I had another complaint, it would be that there's a lack of grittiness about this film. Everything seems to have a dark fantasy sheen painted over it. In fact, with all the twirling overhead shots, browns saturating the picture, and other Pete Jackson like trademarks, I wasn't sure if in fact I wasn't watching a film secretly directed by Peter Jackson himself!The original film was nothing to brag about. Okay, it took a classic myth and put it on screen, and did so with a kind of artistry that small boys (my friend included) enjoyed, but, beyond that, in spite of a solid cast (Olivier, Meredeith, et al) it didn't fly very well. This new iteration of the classic tale does a slightly better job.Things to improve upon; lighten up the colors and frame for Zeus' sake. Let us see the true color of the water. I mean this is supposed to be the Mediterranean, not the North Sea. Let us see how Greeks lived. Heck, you don't have to show us an olive press or winery, but show us more than just the Greek equivalent of Japanese citizens running from a mythological Kaiju.Art direction, other than what I just mentioned, is top notch, though one gets the sense that not all of the props were used to their fullest. That's more of a story fault, if anything, but, the story is what it is, and it's not that bad.I've got more to say, but I'll let it be for now. It's not the best film ever, but it's got some minor redeeming qualities.Take a chance, but don't pay extra to see it in 3D.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Release The Kraken,"During my trip to Talladega for the NASCAR races in 2010 with my dad and a family friend we didn't want to sit in the hotel room all day so we thought why not go to the movies and that's what we did.However there weren't much of option of the movies we could see in theaters so we agree on the 3D release for Clash Of The Titans.Now this was my first 3D movie I saw in theaters and it anger me because the 3D effect didn't even happen in the movie only in the previews looking back it should have been a red flag on the film how it would turn out.Now casting wise Sam Worthington played Perseus Gemma Arterton played lo, Mads Mikkelsen as Draco, Liam Cunningham as Solon, Hans Matheson as Ixas, Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios I liked Liam Neeson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, Danny Huston as Poseidon, Alexander Siddig as Hermes, Luke Evans as Apollo,Nina Young as HeraWith the 3D effects which really wasn't in the film all that often it really hurt the enjoyment of watching this movie. I recently pick it up for DVD just for the sake of collecting all the films I have seen in theatersClash Of The Titans I know is a remake and I have yet to seen the original movie.What I did like about the film was there was some good effects and action scenes that help make the movie interesting enough to watch. Plus the music in the film is good as well and a few scenes with actingBut the movie is pretty much a disappointment, some of the writing feels out of slight out of mind and the 3D effects are pretty much none-existed so it was watching a movie with both eyes closes as well as it was a drain on my eyes to have to rub my eyes through out the movie also there were some scenes that could have been left out of the film but I'll let you see for yourself.While there could be some interest for those who are fans of the original or someone looking for a movie to watch.

"terrible, I honestly feel angry after watching part of it","I jumped ahead when I had made it a quarter way through to find out who was responsible for this. The movie is painful, the attempts to connect with the feelings of disaffected youth butchered the myth, plot, and the original so brutally I couldn't take it. As a movie aside from the *complete* and unyielding failure to bring Greek myths to modern special effects, it was distant, and did not elicit a single emotion to bring me into the story. The makeup and costumes were garbage, it was like watching a 80's glam rock remake of 300. The soldiers were too clean, and the design of the armor was painful. I could go on, but it isn't worth my time.

An o.k remake of an o.k classic,"I am a 90's kid, and my parents grew up watching the original 1980's COTT, so when it was rereleased onto disc a few years ago, they bought it and showed it to me and my siblings. We thought it was the coolest thing ever, we absolutely LOVED it. When I saw the trailer for the 2010 remake of the film, I was very upset. I thought that the 1980's version was a timeless classic. I didn't need to be remade!! So I decided to dig up the original version and watch it again. At the time I hadn't watched it for 6 or 7 years, and when I had finished watching it I thought. ""OK maybe it does need a remake."" I won't go into extreme detail about the flaws in the story, and the over modernizing the movie with heavy metal soundtrack, and rapid editing shots. I will dive right into the things that really matter in a remake.ACTING/RECASTING 6/10 Sam Worthington is a good actor, but as Perseus? Maybe not such a good choice. Liam Neeson is pretty much good cast in nearly any role, and the role of Zeus suit him fine.SOUNDTRACK 5/10 The soundtrack for the movie did not fit with the movie. It didn't quite fit in with the ancient Greece theme. I guess that it worked OK because of the rapid editing and flashy colors.EDITING/CGI 7/10 The animation is average for a film like this.

Gods Schmods,"In a movie like this Theme is a strong issue.This is about Greek Mythology to a point, right? WRONG! It is very apparent in every scene of this movie, that someone either the writer, or the director, had a strong anti-god agenda. I am no god person of any kind, and believe me, if that is where they want take a story I am more than happy to journey with. HOWEVER, when talking about Greek Mythology, even with the poetic license exercised, this is simply out of the question.The role of Man and Greek Gods has been adversarial at times and down right ugly, but in the end the Gods loved it when the hero would pass the trials given him. In other words, this beating of that tired, ""I will do this without the Gods"" ""We are stronger than the Gods"" ""Man no longer needs the Gods"" ""Gods? What Gods?"", over and over and over and over again in each scene got really tired, really quick! Say it twice or three times, I get it, even though I feel it is misplaced in this type of movie. I sure wish that someone who had a real love for the Greek Mythological material had written and or directed this. Someone at least was mature and strong enough to not treat this movie as a pulpit to preach from.Although it was lacking in theme, it was unintentionally funny in a LOT of places. I give it two stars for that reason only. Rent it if you must, or wait for it to go super dollar store bargain bin.Liam Neeson rounds out the cast.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great monsters and creatures and definitely a good remake.I'll admit, not the greatest story and not the greatest movie ever. If you're going into this movie expecting to see something that's life altering, and pretty much the greatest movie you'll ever see, then you'll be disappointed.

This is mythology after all and there are tons of Gods you can mention, include in the story, then why sticking with only a couple of? Besides, the story doesn't go too deep. There could be much more developed scenario.On the other hand, the leading actor is OK and acted pretty well. Regarding Liam Neeson, his presence is always a +1 to any movie.

Clash of the Titans,"Clash of the Titans was for me the best action, adventure fantasy of 2010. Fantastic CGI, especially on Medusa and The Kraken and a well written storyline made this film one of my favourite reboots. The action scenes were epic and very enjoyable to watch. The acting was inconsistent however, Sam Worthington doesn't have a great range for an actor and as i had seen other films with him in in the same year i found him quite monotonous. However, Ralph Fiennes was a superb Hades and as a character who should be feared, he did not disappoint. Among the other actors, Liam Neeson and Jason Fleming were also impressive in their roles.

Crap of the Titans would have been a better and more suitable title!,"Clash of the Titans is a remake of the original movie from the eighties, when you're reading this review, take in mind that I haven't seen the original movie. Almost everything about this movie was boring. The story was quite bad as I found myself drifting in and out of the movie, unable to pay much attention to it. The acting wasn't very good as half of the cast looked like they didn't want to be there and just tried their best to hide that fact. The characters were quite boring and you didn't care for any of them at all. The direction wasn't bad but I can't say the same for the script, as that was terribly boring. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the battles, which were quite entertaining and were executed quite well. The CGI was okay as well, it wasn't terrible but it weren't all that great.Hollywood has done it yet again by making another pointless remake. Clash of the Titans will please some but not others. If you like CGI battles and don't care about anything else, then I think this will be the movie for you. However, if you like a good story and good acting, then you might not like this. I normally like both, I love a story to grip me and I also like great action or CGI scenes but unfortunately for this movie, one outweighs the other. The story bored me so much as did the characters, it felt like the actors was bored doing their roles sometimes. However, the CGI was pretty good and the action scenes were executed well but they weren't enough to cover the fact it had a tedious and terrible story. It's a movie with a bad story and terrible characters, which are covered up with CGI battle scenes. If the original is anything like this, I don't think I'd like to watch it.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Remake of Clash wasn't bad.,"This is a remake of 1981's Clash of the Titans, where Hades, God of the Underworld (Ralph Fiennes), demands that Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is offered as a sacrifice or he will unleash the Kraken against the Greek City of Argos. Perseus (Sam Worthington), mortal son of Zeus, it asked to defeat the Kraken, resulting in exciting adventures as Perseus and his fellow warriors battle the creatures of the underworld left and right while on a journey to retrieve the head of the stone-turning goron, Medusa (Natalia Vodianova), to use against the Kraken.Like the original film, Perseus sets off in an incredible quest to find Medusa, filmed in non-stop adventure and action showing the son of Zeus battling hordes of men and creatures that attempt to get in his way. I thought the CGI effects were pretty good and the overall acting wasn't bad.Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades were the most emphasized gods in the movie, leaving other noted gods such as Poseidon, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Athena, Aries and Apollo on the sidelines. They actually had more screen time filmed and it would have been nice if the director left them in the picture rather than cutting them from the final print, for I thought their roles contributed to the story and the overall mythology element of the movie.This film, though, does lack the magnificent countryside and renaissance-style scenery you see in the original film, and it does not have that overall classic feel to it. But overall, it is still a nice movie to watch for some decent action and adventure.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
TERRIBLE MOVIE whether seen in 3D or 2D,"First off, I love the original movie, so I was very excited to see this remake, especially since I enjoy a lot of action movies. I saw this new ""Clash of the Titans"" with a friend in 3D, and it was a horrible experience. The 3D is complete crap, and you can tell it was added just to make more money off people. Unlike the awesome and natural 3D of Avatar, this 3D was hurting my eyes and gave me a headache. But I thought it might be better in 2D, so I went with my dad and brother (who also love the original) and saw it again in 2D. I still thought it was a really bad movie. I love action movies, but this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Quite honestly, I don't think ANYONE above the age of 12 or 13 will enjoy this movie. The acting is atrocious. Really bad cinematography. Horrible writing. And the worst directing. As we were leaving the theater, some guy said to his buddies, ""Well, that was a waste of money. The trailer is the whole movie."" And he was absolutely right, because the best sequences were already shown in the trailer. Also, when you see the creatures, its so obvious that its all CGI, and that the actors are just looking at a green screen. Don't waste your hard earned money on this crap. Honestly, I would have rather paid to see Avatar again than watch this God-awful remake of ""Clash of the Titans.""",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Improving on a cheesy classic,"The original was a journey of fun with cheesy scenes and bad stop-motion animation. Hard to say why it worked, but that ""something"" is in this new version that adds beautiful visual effects. The storyline is simple, the relationships weak and the journey basic, but its's like the original staying loyal and all adds up to a better version than the original. What can also make or break films is the casting and the cast is solid with great performances by Ralph Fiennes and Sam Worthington. All the creatures along the journey keep the visuals constantly alive and the viewer engaged primarily for those reasons. This all probably explains bad reviews and others like me who think it's a fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Despite the new effects the 80's version is much better,The effects are great but the most glaring thing wrong with this new version is the great things about the first movie that are missing here. Where is the romance? What happened to the relationship between Perseus and Andromeda? What about all the charming dialog and incidents from the first movie? The riddle? Calibos? The goddess Thetes? The casting wasn't good. Sam Worthington is certainly not demi god like hero material - small sized and common looking. Are they looking for an anti-hero or an everyman that we all can identify with? At least Harry Hamlin looked the part. Gemma Atreton's large role here was a bit annoying making her the heroine instead. Alexa Davalos is a bit plump and common looking a far cry from the doll like Judy Bowker. After watching this movie you'll just appreciate the first one more.,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the worst movie ever.,"This movie was fun. It wasn't like, endgame, or John wick or anything, but it was decent for what it has. I wish they could have just made another Percy Jackson film instead, but instead they made this. It has good action, good acting performance, and good cgi. Not much in the way of plot, but a good movie. Sort of",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Amazing cinematography, strong story","My absolute favorite thing about this movie is the cinematography and costuming. The outfits and visuals are stunning, it really makes the story unfold. The acting is fairly good, I think the roles were well cast for the gladiators and God's. Sometimes the storyline can be a bit sluggish and there are a few scenes I could have done without. But overall it's a good movie, with strong characters and storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A soulless remake with little to offer beyond loads of special effects.,"""I can't become like them. If I do this, I do it as a man.""No one can say that this remake of Clash of the Titans is just a retread, that's for sure. Some of the people and events remain the same, but most of this new version is a completely different movie altogether. Different, but not very good.CG is used liberally. Everywhere you turn there's a CG monster or a special effect. But that doesn't change the fact that Clash of the Titans feels like nothing more than an empty action movie flavored with the story of Perseus and a conflict between men and the Greek gods. We're moved from one unimpressive action scene to another without any reason to care about what happens to the protagonists, and all the giant scorpions in the world didn't keep this from feeling boring and ultimately pointless.I thought that Sam Worthington was decent in Avatar, but here he's bland and dull as Perseus. Liam Neeson (who seems to be in every other movie these days) has very little to do, and is basically wasted. The same goes for Ralph Fiennes. Gemma Arterton just looks pretty and serves as the generic knowledgeable guide that these kinds of movies seem obligated to have. The surprisingly decent cast was basically thwarted at every turn by a poor script that put little effort into presenting interesting characters.Big action movies can be a lot of fun, but not when they're this uninspired. Clash of the Titans is an inferior effort. Not just in comparison to the original movie, but to the entire genre, in general. See it if you must, but I doubt you'll be eager to view it a second time.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Travesty of ancient mythology clothed in entertaining action,"Recent decades have seen growing interest in movies depicting ancient and medieval (fantasy) stories - apparently due to digital revolution enabling to depict fantasy world in non-ridiculous ways. Also, Clash of the Titans has seen great popularity (= box office), in spite of plain story with ""real"" characters from Greek myths; well, the visual side is great, chases-battles realistic, imaginary characters merge into real background, but the messages-ideas are too blunt and moralistic, and main characters most often on screen - younger ones - are performed by not-very-special actors. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, on the other hand, could have been more visible, they are pleasant to follow even in second-grade movies.Thus, the movie in question is just an above-average, perfunctory movie, but 1 hour 35 minutes is okay to watch it without a blah! feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Release the Crackhead ... that made this film,"That's what I would have yelled out except for the fact that you're not supposed to do so in a movie theatre. Went inside after plonking out extra moolah for 3D and special specs, and 20 minutes into the show, felt like puking and tearing my hair and eyes out simultaneously in protest for being made to sit through this travesty of a remake. 3D glasses did enhance my headache and eyestrain, but not the experience. Awful plot - if there was any, distorted depiction of mythological characters, inclusion of characters that weren't even supposed to be in it (djinns in a Greek myth?), bad acting, even worse dialogue and costumes - Zeus looked like an overaged glam-rock star and Hades the older brother of Voldermort. Kraken doesn't do anything except roar and stand there as if purposely waiting to be turned to stone. Medusa's head should have been turned on everyone involved in the making of this multimillion dollar joke.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well it could have been so much worse,"I'm one of those people who watched (and therefore loved!) the original 'Clash of the Titans' movies when I was a child back in the eighties. And, as any cynical adult, I was sceptical about a remake of one of my childhood favourites. The result – in my opinion – it could have been worse.In case you never sat through the charming Harry Hamlin version, Clash of the Titans is one of those 'sword and sorcery' epics that's a bit like Lord of the Rings, only with Gods added for good measure. Naturally an 'updated version' needs more than a few people in sandals and plastercine monsters and the remake does just that. There is a fair amount of computer-generated special effects, but they're not the problem. One of the main complaints against the new version is that it was filmed in NON-3D and then converted into 3D in post-production, therefore creating a slightly blurred and grainy effect overall.And there are some other problems with the finished product, but many of those are cosmetic. Take the lead actor's (Sam Worthington) hair. It's supposed to be ancient Greece and yet he's the only man without long flowing hair – choosing instead for a crewcut. Then of course you have a largely British cast (or at least actors putting on 'British' accents) while Worthington's natural Australian accent does tend to slip through occasionally. And maybe the most petty gripe I can think of is naming the Greek town Worthington's trying to save after a popular British 'catelogue store' – it always amused me when they're desperate to save 'Argos.'When it comes to the (all important) monsters, some of them are good and some do look a little too CGI-ish. The Kraken looked a bit much like the 'Rancor' from Return of the Jedi for my liking, but it's Medusa who steals the show. She was a tough act to follow after her portrayal in the original and, even though she is now fully CGI, she's actually pretty nasty! For some reason though the director felt the need to add too many lens flares (in my opinion) in all the scenes where the Gods were present in Olympus!But, despite all its flaws, it's actually not that bad. Yes, those of us who were brought up on the original will always prefer that version, but I imagine that there are plenty of kids (young boys I'm guessing) who will love watching Perseus slay one computer generated monster after the next. My main gripe was that I found Perseus' 'love interest' a little wooden. Yes, I see the reason the film-makers shoe-horned in a woman to go on the adventure, but she just kind of delivered her lines like she was reading them from an autocue. I don't know whether this is a fault with the director, not getting the best out of her, as I've seen Gemma Arterton in plenty of other films and she's always turned in a better performance.So, if you're not too hung up on the original and you're in a forgiving mood when it comes to remakes, you should enjoy this pretty harmless remake of a classic. The only thing I really couldn't forgive was the scorn displayed from the on-screen characters when 'Boo-boo' the clockwork owl from the original made a cameo appearance!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ripped off for paying for non existent  3-D,"OK i don't really want to say anything regarding the film, as it was directed by the man who bought us 'the transporter' series and ruined 'the incredible hulk' .so what did you expect? saying that the film isn't actually all bad, although you feel its been cut to get as many butts on seats as possible. but my main gripe is that talking about chasing money, there was no reason for this film to be in 3-D! there is not one 3-D effect in the whole entirety of the damn thing. they are chasing the avatar whirlwind but re-jigging this in 3-D, and charging more for the honour of wearing silly glasses while watching a flat film! the main thrill of the original were the final harryhausen effects, in the Medusa in particular. in this Medusa comes across like the 'scorpion king' in mummy 2. obviously rushed and completely ruined the scene chewing effects of the original. worth it only for Mads Mikkelson, who was also the best thing in 'casino royal' save your money and wait for the DVD",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Lower your expectations... and see it on 2-D instead.,"With the right expectations, CLASH OF THE TITANS is a pretty enjoyable update of the 1981 minor fantasy classic if you can forgive some of the absurdities of the script. I loved the original CLASH OF THE TITANS but I don't see anything wrong about remaking it, and when I saw the trailers I knew what to expect: A bone-headed, old school adventure movie with lots of action despite only having half a plot. I went in with little expectations and got out just fine, and provided that you don't expect anything else, you will too. And oh yeah, take everyone's advice and see it on 2-D. I took the advice to not see it on 3-D and seeing that the movie is not as bad as everyone has said it was, I think you should to.Turns out director Louis Leterrier and writers Travis Beacham, Phil May, and Matt Manfredi have done more than update Ray Harryhausen's vintage claymation monsters. Other than amping up the action, they have also added and changed several elements in the script. But despite a few decent additions, none of them really add much. The whole plot about mortals doing war with the gods might have been intriguing, but it's all played rather silly here. How do the brave warriors of Argos plan to fight the gods with only swords and spears? These, along with a few other inconsistencies just make the story a little confusing. And typical to any modern action/adventure movie, our hero Perseus (played by Sam Worthington) has to have a tragic background so he can hate the gods throughout the whole movie and get the job done the dirtiest way possibly. Does every action hero today have no other motive than a vendetta? Despite their best efforts, none of the performances really connected with me (Gemma Atherton's Io came close, but whatever she had with Perseus wasn't deeply ventured and therefore utterly forgettable). However, I enjoyed big-time actors like Liam Neeson (who performs his now-famous 3-word line immortally) and Ralph Fiennes (who does another sneering Lord Voldemort impression) who had a ball as some of the immortals.But other than these several alternations, the movie is fairly faithful to the original, only 10 times bigger. You thought a fight with giant scorpions was cool? How about one with giant scorpions 10 times bigger? You think the Kraken is huge? This one makes the one in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2 look camera-shy. But this gives and takes from the experience. The action sequences are quite exciting, even without the use of distracting 3-D. But on the other hand, it's as if Leterrier wants every moment of the movie to be loud and amped-up. Even the encounter with the Stygian Witches (who looked like they came out from PAN'S LABYRINTH) isn't devoid of a shaky action sequence. Nevertheless, the many special effects are pretty good and some of the action sequences they're in are some of the film's highlights. The aforementioned scorpion duel has to stand as my favorite, but there's also the battle in Medusa's lair (surprisingly enjoyable, but lacking the suspense from the one in the original) and the final stand-off with the Kraken.It won't be another fantasy film favorite like the original, but if you don't expect nothing more than a popcorn-movie that does what it's supposed to do, CLASH OF THE TITANS ain't have bad. Perhaps just for Neeson's delivery of his immortal ""Release the Kraken!"" in all its glory, this movie is worth seeing.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The trailer is all you need to see ...,"After I had seen the trailer for this movie I already assumed it would not be a good one and after reading some other reviews my expectations were really low. Still ""Clash of the titans"" was disappointing on every level. I was really surprised how bad this movie was.The story and how it builds up is truly a joke. Messy as hell. The ""Introduction"" is like 2 minutes long and the movie really doesn't want to take any time for story explanations or character development, no details, no depth. Many scenes seem unfinished and really raw. The dialog is lame as hell as there are lots of standard / cliché phrases thrown at your head. Sometimes it gets really cheesy as well.Now even the various action scenes that are poorly put together can't create a bit of entertainment and that is where the movie finally fails. (As I mentioned I did not expect too much of a story though it was executed even worse than i thought before)But also the fight scenes are terribly boring especially the ""final battle"". The gods do not seem to participate at all.Watch the trailer because as I was expecting it spoiled EVERY ""highlight"" from the movie. There is nothing more to it that you could miss and the trailer also got a cool soundtrack thats not in the actual film (at least from what i remember?).If you wanna see a trashy B-movie then you might enjoy it a little bit ... otherwise skip this!

Fairy tales.I only read about 20 reviews. All under 5 stars.

Are there really that many intensely keen Greek mythology scholars watching & reviewing this movie?Why take is so serious???The cast is above excellent. The production is awesome.

worth watching for fantasy fans,"I watched the movie in a theater and have to say that I enjoyed it. Especially the special effects and the well created fight scenes are favorable. Thought, the plot could have been more and better developed, but it is OK for a 106 minutes movie. Other critics remain mostly on the uncompleted story of Perseus. The movie contains just some scenes from the written myth and his journey to the Medusa. The actors provided an impressive acting, especially Ralph Fiennes who played Hades. The movie starts very promising with strong and symbolic action scenes and stays interesting and action packed until the end. I recommend to watch it on a big screen and digital surround.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
entertaining for the most part,"I was really anticipating this title when I first laid eyes on the first trailer and being a fan of Greek mythology I immediately geeked out with what I saw. It showed such promise especially when it showed the kraken at the end of the trailer. After seeing this on opening day, I left the theater mildly satisfied but really entertained. In terms of story, it's about a man named Perseus whose family has just been murdered by the gods themselves and wishes to seek revenge and in order to do so, he is given an opportunity when the gods have threatened to destroy the city of Argos if the princess is not sacrificed to them by the eclipse. What follows is basically a quest type of film that is action packed . That's basically what the story is with a few supporting characters that deserved better character development.The film's cast delivered a somewhat convincing performance but to be honest I thought the acting could've been a tad bit better like Sam Worthington for instance. His acting is alright for the past movies I've seen him in like Terminator Salvation and Avatar, but for a movie like this, he just didn't convince me. Liam Neeson was pitch perfect as Zeus. It was almost like a match made in heaven. No pun intended, as well as Ralph Fiennes as Hades was great as well and if you look at them you would actually believe that they were brothers in real life. They just have great chemistry. The rest of them were just there for show but Gemma Arterton is beautiful as always.The film's action sequences was the bright light of the film. In my opinion it had some of the best CG I've seen so far (if you watch it in 2D) clearly this movie was originally made for 2D and only slapped in the 3D effect in post production or so I heard and also heard that It didn't look great at all. All I could say about these action sequences was that it really kept me at the edge of my seat especially on the scorpioch fight scene. Not all of you might agree with me about the action scenes but this is just my opinion is all. But the biggest disappointment would be the kraken fight. I mean seriously watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking aboutOverall if you are ever in the mood for just sitting back, turning off you're mind and just enjoy mindless action with huge monsters then you can't go wrong with Clash Of The Titans. In my opinion I was expecting a lot more in terms of character development and storytelling. so my final verdict is a6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Effects driven action makes Clash a success,"I believe that I went into this film with the right expectations. Perhaps this is why I enjoyed it. I was looking for an entertaining popcorn flick with action sequences similar to those of The Incredible Hulk 2008 (same director) and that is what I got.The acting while not superb was sufficient enough and the story was acceptable. No Oscar quality script, characters, or just movie in general. Though it was a quality action film. The pacing was fine and the set designs were terrific -especially Madusa's lair.With CGI that is of biblical proportions, and multiple bad ass action scenes, Clash of the titans, though not nearly godlike, is a load of legitimate fun and deserves that recognition.8/10 -if your not a snob If every movie needs to be Oscar quality then 6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only a special effects movie.,"I would say this is definitely more of a special effects action film than anything else. If your looking for character development, and plot, then you probably won't like this movie. The film is based around Perseus (Sam Worthington) son of the mighty god Zeus (Liam Neeson) who must go on a journey to defend Earth against Haitis (Ralph Fiennes), and the underworld. I never cared at all for these characters, but it did certainly a good job at keeping me entertained throughout the film. I saw this film in 3D, which didn't really make any difference to the film, maybe because it was converted to 3D at the last second. Sam Worthington has been in quite a few blockbusters lately (Avatar you may have heard of, Terminator Salvation, and now Clash of the Titans). Liam Neeson gives a nice performance as Haitis, although he was barely in it, but that's the best you'll get in the acting category. Overall, this is a fun popcorn movie sure to please, well, any popcorn movie fan. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
CGI-heavy but exciting action.,"A big cast that wasn't really required, as the (sometimes overused) CGI Effects steal the show anyway. There are very few scenes without CGI, but admittedly some of these scenes are pretty awesome - especially the desert scorpion battle scene, and the Medusa fighting scene. This is non-stop action and entertainment from beginning to end.The film is not short on plot flaws and while I won't go into them, I'm just wondering why the powerful Hades needs to transform a mere mortal to pursue and kill Perseus, instead of killing him himself. He was able to 'consume' over a dozen guards in the beginning after all. Liam Neeson seems out of character as Zeus, and I must be honest Ralph Fiennes is way to good an actor for this kind of film. Sam Worthington, on the other hand, makes a worthy protagonist.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A good mythological remake that stands on its own.,"This fantasy adventure turned mythological mayhem was once the proud and final work of special effects master Ray Harryhausen. His work on the original film left such an impression on the world that it can be safe to say that it was one of the greatest old fantasy films ever made, mainly through the creatures Ray portrayed such as Medusa and the Kraken. To me, it was kinda a surprised that it has been remade, so naturally, being a fan of Ray, I checked this action out. Does it live up to the original classic? To me, it basically does.Many elements from the original film are still around such as most of the creatures and the basic story. With remakes, there's always new elements besides updated special effects, namely new characters and the direction the filmmakers went with this one. The new characters are sorta hit and miss, many of them are pretty interesting and sometimes humorous while a few others not so much. One new character whose performance I really enjoyed was Hades, God of the Underworld. He's so creepy, complex, and awesome that while humanity mocks the gods, he puts them in their place. Nice! Sam Worthington's portrayal of Persius is nicely done as he does as much as he can without much help to prove that he's more man than god, though this somewhat stubborn outlook does backfire on him a little, making things a little more interesting. Plus, Liam Neeson makes a great Zeus.Now for the creatures, which are a big part of the story. I like how they made Pegasus black instead of the traditional white, making the flying horse a bit more eye-catching. The scorpions are noticeably bigger and badder than back in the old movie and they have a more prominent role. Medusa is absolutely great as while she has the same basic look as before, her improved design combines both her once great beauty with her serpentine lethality. This makes her both sexy and deadly. The Kraken is by far the most awesome as not only does he look cool, but he is also a terrifying and destructive force of nature, which is enough for the gods to we themselves with fear. The rest of the creatures are good in my book.Other aspects of the movie, like the action scenes and music, are great to behold. There are some things to nitpick like certain characters that are either a little bland or annoying as well as are particular bits of dialog. Overall, a remake that's nicely done and may actually be better than the original. Worth a watch so check it out. RELEASE THE KRAKEN!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
fun ride but a rush film,"i saw this movie and my thought was: this movie was OK i did not expect a cool movie but it was still fun. clash of the titans is about Perseus who embarks on a quest to kill the kraken and have revenge on hades, its a very straightforward story but it will have been better if the director spend more time on the story than the special effects. the 3d is just terrible! the director forgot to film with 3d cameras and the result was awful because he rushed the 3d on the last minute. like some people i know if you think this movie is gonna be good like god of war you are gonna be disappointed. lots of people thought it was god of war and hated the movie for not going hight on their expectation. clash of the titans is still A good movie but is too short and some special effects look too much fake.if you like adventure movies by going with you're family to watch, than this is the movie for you. if you expect a god of war ripoff and lots of action than this is not for you and Greek mythology is not expected for too much action. i like it more than the original but still not a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Paying no respect to mythology and to the Hero's journey,"How very unfortunate that this title pays no respect to mythology and to the archetypes involved :( The original myth has been devastated by the pretentious writers who are responsible for hubris to say the least. It is understandable to make alterations to the original myth for making a more attractive storyline for the audience, but changing the myth in such a way as to be barely recognizable is really an atrocity.There is a reason why the hero has to go to the Underworld alone and there is a reason why the hero is moved by his love for a woman. An advice to the screenplay writers: If you have no idea about myths and myth-making, you can always ask a counselor from ethnographic or psychological studies. Putting all the mythological creatures that you have ever heard on the same story, won't work - except perhaps for CGIs.By going off alone, the screenplay writers have made a big flop (probably not by money standards but by arts standards for sure).",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

No Fun to Be Had with These Gods,"Congratulations Hollywood. You've payed homage to yet another older film by sucking out all of the charm and entertainment value that made the film worth remaking in the first place.The original ""Clash of the Titans"" from 1981 had a sense of whimsical adventure. Those involved knew just how seriously to take it all, which wasn't very seriously, and the effects served the story rather than seeming to exist for their own sake. The remake is a smörgåsbord of same-old same-old CGI that we've already seen a hundred times in other films, and the whole thing is too dogged and earnest to be much fun. The cast is lacklustre, even big deal actors like Liam Neesona and Ralph Fiennes, and can't inject the film with the campy sensibility that great actors like Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith brought to the original. This version also removes the love story that brews between Perseus and Andromeda, which gave the first film a sense romantic and heroic adventure.The first boring and unmemorable action film of 2010.Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Release the Kraken!,"Zeus descended down from Olympus and took the form of a mortal King (one who'd defied and cursed the Olympians name). Wanting to teach the mortal a lesson, Zeus went to the King's bed chamber and slept with the Queen, impregnating her. After catching them after the act, the King sentenced the Queen and son of Zeus to death. Enclosing the two in casket and throwing them into the sea, the King was certain they would both perish. The Queen died, but the baby survived long enough to be found by a fisherman. The baby's named Perseus.Fast forward a few decades, and the world of men have become boastful, and quite mocking of the gods. To the point where the Olympians decide (at the behest of Hades) to give Hades free reign in hopes the mortals will begin praying to them again.Since finding him at sea, Perseus had been raised by the fisherman and his wife. The fisherman, wife, and their daughter are killed while out in their fishing boat (collateral damage) by Hades. Perseus alone survives, and vows vengeance against the god.After turning Casseopia to stone for her mockery, Hades vows to release his pet, the Kraken, on the world of men unless the Princess Andromeda is sacrificed (to the Kraken) in ten days time.What are the mortals gonna do? Will the gods be prayed to for help? Will Perseus get his revenge?Remakes have about a 50/50 chance of outdoing the original or completely sucking. Thankfully, this remake was pretty good.

Sure was shiny,"There was a lot of really neat effects and graphics and the like... Too slow to start, fighting scenes were too fast to see anything of interest.. and absolutely no depth to it. It was pretty basic and in your face as it is. You can't read further into anything and the characters are so two dimensional (and I'm not talking about how it was shot). You can easily take a good legend and make it an epic movie- this was not it. Far from it. Had my dad not taken me for my birthday I might demand my money back for how horrible it was. Heck I'd like the 106 minutes of my life back. Basically it was a lot of flash and faces you could recognize. With all the good movies that have come out this year, this one feel incredibly short of anyone's expectations. I couldn't imagine paying more than 99 cents to own this film and you'd probably want to play it on mute to entertain a small child or as background noise while cleaning the house or something. And you'd really have to buy it more on impulse. But really, the effects and graphics is the only reason to see this, and I highly recommend not wasting your money. The original film may be old and not quite up to the standards of effects in today's world but you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why all the hate for.,"I don't understand why this movie is getting hated for. This is one of those movies where the score this movie holds is shocking because I found this one to be very good. No it doesn't have to be as good as the 1981 version but it also gets credit for keeping me hooked. This is one of those movies that is being treated unfairly just because they either do not like action fantasy or just plain out want to see these movies fail. This movie deserves to be on my great movies list because not every Movie has to be good it just has to be enjoyable. They can bring their own take on these. This could have been better but I was very satisfied with the finished product. Got a lot of action and fantastical creatures. I seen a lot of these movies where the finished product was either rushed or just cheaply made, this one is not one of those movies. So 10 for me because they went all out on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sometimes What We Saw in Movie-Trailer is What We Saw in Entire Movie,"Thiz movie is a remake from the original version in 1981 which was still using stop motion techniques. Now on CGI era, ""Clash of The Titans"" is resurrected back to live. Perseus used to play by Harry Hamlin, now is replaced by Sam Worthington. The Director is Louis Leterrier, the creator of ""The Transporter"" (2002) and ""Incredible Hulk"" (2008). I note that there are three mega actions which are giant scorpion battle, Medusa hunt and the unleashed kraken scene. The Special Effects work just fine. But for the close up fight scenes, the camera doesn't seem to focus and too fast, we even don't know what is really going on. The dialogue is a little bit lame and lack of interlude humor. The two opposite titans, the heaven king Zeus and the dark lord Hades are played very well by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. However, I like the Gods gathering at Mount Olympus as shown in thiz film. It is better and way beyond of what we have seen previously in ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" (2010) which is also based on Greek mythology. My school teacher used to say, ""Sometimes what we saw in movie-trailer is what we saw in entire movie"". It really happens to thiz film. It's not the best of Worthington, comparing to his latest performances in ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) and the ground-breaking ""Avatar"" (2009). There is emptiness during his appearance in thiz movie. Anyhow, I think we will see more of his movies in the coming years. Thiz man could be a new Schwarzenegger. It looks like we've got a new titan in Hollywood.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Special effects despite some 3D hiccups,"I was pretty familiar with the plot of the story, having seen the original in 1981, by special effects Master, Ray Harryhausen.The 2010 remake (in 3D) was pretty spectacular.Unlike Avatar which relied heavily on the 3D to carry the story, Clash of the Titans (2010) used 3D to enhance the story, not carry it.But unlike Avatar, Clash of the Titans (2010) has some 3D hiccups. Especially noticeable are scenes, where the object spreads to cover the left or right edge of the screen. (Thanks Wil!) The 3D image isn't quite so good. James Cameron, was obviously aware of this when he made Avatar. It had no 3D hiccups.Despite that, Clash is an excellent film for the emerging 3D industry. The special effects were expected, and they were well done.One wonders what Ray Harryhausen (retired) could do with these toys, which didn't exist 30 years ago?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad movie but a good story(5.4),"I think the effects are actually good compared to the year,there is a good story a scenario that everyone is interested in but too much confusion with such a beautiful story, I think a better film could be made.

Variety is the Spice of Life,"I will not bash this film based on being different from the ancient myths anymore than I will bash the 1981 version of the tale. These films draw inspiration from the ancient stories - not a carbon copy of the original Greek stories. This 2010 film is also not a carbon copy of the 1981 film, just like other ""remakes"" they have changes to create a variant instead of exact duplicates. Duplicate films are redundant and pointless while variants of the same story creates variety - and variety is the spice of life.With all the above being said, I like this version of the myth. Myths are simply stories and stories entertain us. Variants of stories are good, it's nice to see our beloved ancient gods and goddesses in a bit different way.No this film is NOT exactly like the original myth, but neither is the 1981 version. I prefer the 1981 over the 2010 but I do like this 2010 version.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Far from a classic however an occasionally enjoyable mythological romp nonetheless.,"Louis Leterrier's rebooted version of the 1981 cult film 'Clash of the Titans' is one dimensional, inconsistently acted and it's story plods along in comparison to an enormous boulder attached to the end of a truck via a rope, travelling across a rickety road.On the other hand, for the majority of average citizens, 'Clash of the Titans' is cemented full of stunning CGI imagery and cinematography. The action sequences are on a rapid convener belt which is continuous throughout the duration and there is little time to breath.As you may have guessed from the above, 'Clash of the Titans' has many positives which are balanced out with an equal amount of negatives. The budget of $125 million certainly polishes the films visual content which cannot be faulted. Nor can the well cast Sam Worthington, Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson who are each solid in their respected roles. However, there is too much of a video-game feel to the film with a paper thin plot, an action overload and a lack of characterisation.When Perseus (Worthington) realises he is a demi-god, son of Greek God Zeus (Liam Neeson), he is called upon to protect Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from Hades' (Fiennes) monstrous Kraken.Following on from the brief synopsis above is an onslaught of action scenarios involving huge, desert scorpions and more of Hades' devastating creatures.To conclude, 'Clash of the Titans' should fill the gap left on a Friday night/weekend night though I wouldn't expect much more than a dumb but reasonably fun 106 minutes.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Haters gonna hate,"One of my very earliest memories of being blown away and scared to death by a movie was when I was a kid and saw Jason and the Argonauts on TV. With a child's eyes there was no doubt to me that it was some sort of documentary, and the fight with the skeletons stayed with me for a long time. Ever since then I have been a fan of Greek mythology and the huge monsters that inherit the stories. So you can imagine I was really excited for this one, despite all the negative reviews. I went in to the movie expecting little more than simply an entertaining popcorn movie, and that was exactly what I got.The makers of this remake have changed the story around a lot, the original also deviated from the original myth about Perseus, but this goes even further away. The result is not perfect, part of the film's biggest problems is the bad lines and all the exposition that is needed because of the changes made to the original story. The story of the 2010 version seems to be made to be some sort of allegory to the war on terrorism, with Perseus in a marine haircut going out to the desert to find evil (Osama Bin Ladin), and then return to ward of the terrorist threat made by Hades and his horrific Kraken. The original Clash of the Titans is far from a perfect movie even though it's more true to the original myth, and one of the good things about the changes made is that it allows for more action scenes. Which should be the main reason why you go and see a film like this one.I've not done any academic research into the subject, but I have the firm conviction that movie ratings and whether you like or dislike a movie depends 95 percent on your expectations. If you go into a movie like this and expect another Godfather, of course you are going to be let down. If you go into this movie and expect a light hearted action film, you are likely to be satisfied because that's exactly what this is and it doesn't promise anything else. The special effects are really good and the action scenes rival those in Avatar. The 3D effects are only a gimmick in CotT and they look really bad (especially the actor's faces in closeups, they look like they are inflated balloons or something), but it's not enough to ruin the film. Any fans of action films should be able to enjoy this one as long as you go into it with an open mind and realistic expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Raise the Titans,"Pulverisingly loud and in-your-face blockbuster retelling the legend of Perseus, Hollywood style. As is Hollywood's wont, a lesser-known actor gets the main part, surrounded by bigger-name character actors in support to give the project some heft, but everything here is in thrall to the booming soundtrack and especially the special effects.These are plentiful and eye-popping at times, each sequence obviously setting out to top the preceding one, with the battle against a slithering, mesmerising Medusa only topped with the attack of the Krakken at the climax.Characterisation, again as is the norm, is slim, with the dialogue wooden and pretentious by turns. A little post-modern ironic humour wouldn't have gone amiss methinks instead of the odd mixture of contemporary modern and studiously archaic language on show here.As for the acting, no-one rises above the SFX, with Liam Neeson an unlikely Zeus and Ralph Fiennes almost indecipherable as Hades, while Worthington appears too squat for the heroic role of Perseus, although there's no doubting his athleticism.All that said, while the purists would probably hate it and liken it to a Disney park thrill-ride, as one who has ambitions to return to Florida next year, this whetted my appetite considerably.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The cover of this film says it all - a hench guy roaring at a monster's severed head.,"If you want an indication of what this movie's like, just look at the cover. Yes, that is Medusa's head he's roaring at.With a sand-scorpion scene like the one in Transformers, a Kraken like Pirates of the Caribbean's and lines like ""It is death who should be afraid of us."", it's easy to see that Clash of the Titans is gonna be fun for the action and little else. And it is. While trying to deal with his half-man, half-god heritage in a way that no-one really seems to care about, Perseus kicks mythical butt. Nevermind that the rest of the party of so-called elite warriors are either eye-liner wearing flute- players or grey-haired men who look like washed up 60s rockers. At least it's a refreshing change from the 300-esque beefed up gladiators. Another thing that just works for some reason is the movie's out-of- place, modern humour such as Perseus' pep talk's ending: ""Trust your senses and don't look this ***** in the eye."" Who cares if that expletive wasn't invented until about 1150 AD? Couple this with a very pretty, mythological-looking world and you've got at least some entertainment.The biggest problem with this movie is Perseus. Whatever possessed them to cast Sam Worthington as the lead should be exorcised immediately. The man is basically re-using his character for Terminator Salvation, and that does not work. His accent detracts and his manner speaks more of a 20th century criminal than a 4th century hero. Everyone else has long hair, Perseus sports a crew-cut. Everyone else speaks theatrically, if not poetically, Perseus never uses monosyllabic words and swears. Oh, and I'm not even going to go into the plot. It's the standard but-he- must-have-a-weakness! quest, with a bit of Jeremy Springer family drama thrown in. Not quite as epic a combination as I would have hoped.The action looks and sounds great, the backdrop is pretty and, on occasion, the humour makes you laugh with instead of at them, but with such poor characters and an unoriginal plot, it's only getting a 4. Oh, and it's a very misguiding title. The whole thing's set after the titans have been destroyed.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice one!,"A good mythological film, a handful of adventures and action, which is expected from this type of film. Lots of famous actors who mostly acted well. The special effects are great, if you ask me special effects are the best part of the film. The only drawback is that the action takes place too fast, there is material for literally two films in this film, and since everything is crammed into one, it spoils the experience a bit.

"Delivers the Goods, Nothing More","I went to see this film mainly because it was the unofficial opener of the blockbuster season (Iron Man 2 being the official May opener). For a popcorn film, I was successfully distracted for a couple hours. The film did not try to overstep it's comfort level, and thus delivered the goods as we expected. What surprised me was how the third act all of a sudden became more sublime than the first two acts. Methinks some reshoots were involved to elevate this material toward the end.The story, though simplistic, was somewhat a breath of fresh air from your more techno sci-fi adventures. Most of the creature effects work well, the green screen work adequate. Perhaps 1 CGI shot out of 10 looked iffy. Not bad for a fantasy film with almost no real locations. Sam Worthington seems to respond to quality directors. In this case, he can't seem to stretch beyond the scripted lines (except again near the end). What did appeal to me was the sense of humour, although not often enough. Liam Neeson, considered the go-to guy for making a film seem legitimate, has been disappointing me recently with his film selections. He seems to be going the Nicolas Cage route. Funny, Neeson once swore off acting in films altogether and was going to do theatre. Here, playing Zeus, he seems to be phoning it in. Nothing inspiring at all.For summer popcorn fare, this movie clicks along just fine. I choose to see the 2D version, because the film was nearly completed as a 2D until the studio stepped in to tinker with it. From what I hear, the 3D version suffers.I give it a 6 out of 10 for delivering the goods.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Does Not Deserve The Title,"Titling this movie Clash of The Titans is a complete joke. The story was so butchered that this movie has very little to do with the Greek myth or the original movie. This was nothing short of a hatchet job meant to spew some pretentious, pseudo-political garbage about man replacing gods. They eliminated most everything that was good about the original movie and downplayed the rest. What is left over is rushed and, in many respects, poorly produced. The characters were dull, the action tame and the plot was annoying. Frankly I have seen cartoons that I liked better than this. I'm hoping that this movie will be another Incredible Hulk. The first blows chunks, but in a few years someone will make a remake of the remake and do the job right. Then movie fans will have something worth watching.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a bad watch,"Despite a stellar cast and a major upgrade in special effects, I prefer the campy fun of the original.It is loosely based on the story of Perseus and Andromeda. The story more closely resembled the 80's movie story than the original. Filled with talented actors. Most notable to me were Ralph Fiennes as Hades and Gemma Arterton as Io. Somehow the total is less than the expected sum of the parts. There's nothing I can really point to as a failure it just isn't great. Worth a watch if you like this style of movie, just keep expectations limited to being entertained.Somehow the original works better for me but it might just be because I was 11 when it came out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There Are Worse Out There,"Wowthis was such a good movie when I rented the video and I could not sit through it once!!! Liam Neeson has turned out such great movies like, 'Taken', 'Michael Collins', 'Schindler's List', just to name a few and then he stumbles into garbage scripts of remakes of good classics like, 'The A-Team', 'The Haunting' – and now 'Clash of the Titans'. When he was offered this part, I wish he had turned it down. Hollywood directors – for the most part – suck these days. I really wish they would keep their personal and radical views to themselves. They have a tendency to be overly obvious in their tireless preaching. This movie was no different. The youth has the answer, and the gods should be tossed aside and forgotten about. By golly, the hero refuses the gifts from the gods, unlike the originalkind of thumbing his noses at his father. In many cases, Hollywood is no longer about entertainment – it is more about misleading the none-elites.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
hollow story line crashed by the amount of CGI,"The remake of a cult classic. Ray Harryhausen was responsible for the classic of the same title in 1981. What he used was stop/motion and it still works nowadays. I liked that flick a lot. Hollywood had to touch the classics because they are out of ideas. Most of them are failures and this version is a mediocre of the original.I never went into any of the characters because the makers were more busy with the CGI used then with the story itself. It do has a few good moments like with the scorpions but there wasn't anything new to see. Th world of the Gods and the humans didn't work for me. It worked in Thor (2011) or in Immortals (2011). But in both those flicks we had a bit of brutality a thing we are missing here. Sometimes it even reminded me a bit of another failure, Van Helsing (2004). The problem there was too the fact that they forgot to put an actual story to it. Just have a look here. The metal owl that was important in Ray's flick is only shown for a few moments. What I did like and worked was Medusa.They couldn't make it without CGI and I have nothing against it as it works but here it took the overhand and you never really get into the story. While writing my review I'm thinking who played who and that's not a good point.Still, it entertains and for those never seen Ray's version it will deliver. But I was more into Ray's version. Maybe they went for a low rating so children could attend it at theatres. There's no nudity and no blood to spot. Yeah yeah, I know, one person is thrown in two by the scorpion but it is shown quickly.

"""Leave it there""","In one of the scenes of Clash of the Titans, Perseus finds the mechanical owl (one of the landmarks of the original film) and someone says to him: leave it there. Well, to me that's the absolute summary of this motion picture. The CGA is ugly, exaggerated and, worst of all, false. Only Pegasus is a little more convincing, but the scorpions, the djin, the Medusa (with dark breasts in contrast to the pale scales) are very bad. The film as a whole is a mixture of the Lord of the Rings (the clothes, the architecture, the light), with Gladiator (the leather skirts spinning while the soldiers fight) and, in the end, the Kraken that looks like Godzilla. Honestly, I could not see any value in the movie itself. As for Antiquity, not the least attention was paid to myths and how they were constructed: humans could not declare war on the gods (ridiculous), Hades was not perverse (a common modern artifice that owes nothing to the Greek world, which feared the god, but considered him fair. Films may add new elements to th e myths, but the structure of the narratives need to be respected. There is no respect for anything or anyone in those two hours of bad performances, bad script and bad visual effects. In other words, leave it there, it's not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Am I suppose to be rooting for the humans?,All the humans seem to lack common sense. Most of them spend time angering the God despite witnessing their might countless times.

Release The Kracken....Again,"After defeating the Titans, the Gods created mortals, whose faith & prayers would assure their immortality. However, through time, the mortals lose their faith in the Gods so they stop praying and also destroy a statue of Zeus. To punish the mortals' defiance, Hades is given leave by Zeus to go to the city of Argos to tell King Cepheus & Queen Cassiopeia that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Gods, he will release the Kracken to destroy them & their city. Perseus, who lost his family when Hades arrived, learns here that he is a demigod, son to Zeus, and that he is the only one who can defeat the Gods and save Argos.Devout fans of the original 1981 Clash of the Titans will probably hate this film without even seeing it and will treat it as some sort of blasphemy but in all honesty this version is actually a very decent remake. Is it better? Well, yes and no. It's not any better (or worse for that matter) for telling a version of the story of Perseus defeating the Kracken, but it's obviously miles better in showing that story with the acting, action, and the visuals.Obviously the original version is extremely dated now, but it's still a classic in it's own right, and while the effects will probably be laughed at by a lot of people these days, for 1981 they were cutting edge and were well done, especially for the time. Will this be classed as a classic? I very much doubt it, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching and it doesn't mean that both cannot be enjoyed just as much equally.The visuals & the effects are fantastic all round, especially for the Kracken, and while the Medusa scenes were decent, I must admit the original film's showing was better, not because of the action or the effects, but because of the sheer mood & creepy atmosphere. Even to this day, I remember watching those scenes when I was about 7 or 8 and being genuinely creeped out.This isn't a jaw-dropper by any stretch, but it's still a very good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cool to look at, but that's about it","In the old days of Hollywood, the spectacle was a grand, rousing story filled with enormous battles, a dastardly villain and a hero that everyone could get behind. Nowadays, it's grand and enormous, but it fails to really be rousing and draw us into the story because there's no one to really care about.""Clash of the Titans"" takes place in a time of gods and man, of heroes and myths. Zeus (Liam Neeson) created man so their continued prayers could give the gods immortality. The problem is that the gods are screwing the humans over, and they're sick of it. When the citizens of Argos destroy a statue of Zeus, Zeus allows his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to get the humans respecting them again by any means he sees fit. Hades gives the King of Argos an ultimatum: either sacrifice his daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), or have his city destroyed by the Kraken. But while Hades has his own plans set it motion, the gods watch nervously as Perseus (Sam Worthington), the mortal son of Zeus, journeys to find a way to defeat the Kraken and save both Argos and Andromeda.The film, an update of the notoriously cheesy 1981 original, is loaded with special effects. For that part of the film, it works. Visually, the film is meticulously detailed and always cool to look at. Even better is the fact that we can actually see the action scenes. Louis Leterrier does not use the shaky cam to obscure what happens in the fight scenes, and apart from a few minor missteps in the beginning, the action scenes are clear and easy to follow.Unfortunately, the acting department is where it fails. It's not that the actors are bad, it's just they're all the same: gruff, growly and brooding. Had there been a little time for character development, this could have been a worthy successor to ""Lord of the Rings"" (in fact, there are scenes where it is trying to be). Alas, it's just all glitz and flashy visuals.Maybe it's just me, but I think if a human being is ripped in half or decapitated (regardless of the amount of blood shown), I think that deserves an automatic R rating. Had the roughly 10 seconds of footage been edited out or redone, this would be a bona-fide PG-13 movie. But as it is, it should have been rated R. Likewise, the images of some of the breasted creatures were covered up, despite being uncovered in the drawings from Ancient Greece.

It is certainly true that Sam Worthington could have made a far more convincing Perseus, and that this film did not really stay true to the strangely touching qualities of Greek Mythology, but as for actors, I have certainly seen worse.Although wooden, it certainly tried to be historically accurate, and, to a reasonable extent, succeeded. The supporting cast were also impressive, and the soundtrack, while not exceptional, was suitably 'epic'.

"Something stinks, and it's not the Kraken's breath...","As a great lover of most things 'long ago' and a fan of this sort of film, I had perhaps unreasonably high expectations of this one. Oh dear.The casting wasn't great. Instead of a lovable everyman to get the audience on his side, we instead receive a quite dislikable and somewhat thuggish-looking, shaven-headed Perseus played badly by Sam Worthington. Liam Neeson is an unimposing, henpecked-looking Zeus. Lord Voldemort voices Hades wonderfully early in the film, until Ralph Fiennes gets control of his alter-ego and finds a different accent to use (and that voice aside, his performance was quite good). In the half an hour since the film ended I've pretty much forgotten what Andromeda did, so unused was the character, so I can't say much about her; and Perseus's merry men were neither good nor bad.Saved until last, Gemma Arterton as Io was surprisingly good... well, once I'd come to terms with Io being ripped from one part of the mythology and inexplicably transplanted into this story, hilariously as a 'love interest' for the son of the guy who got her pregnant then turned her into a cow. Then Pegasus appeared (now a species, not a specific horse), and he was a badass black horse who scared all his white mates away.Just as I was dealing with that, a djinn appeared out of the wrong mythology entirely and struck a devastating blow for odd Hollywood storylining. On the bright side he looked like a baby ent, on the downside... what was he doing in Greek myth? Similarly, the Kraken - who sent him? Loki, Thor? And if we can push the name aside for a moment, why was Hades controlling the SEA monster? Why did Andromeda volunteer to be sacrificed to it? And why did it totally ignore her for ten minutes? As a saving grace the effects are pretty good, and Pegasus looked very nice in flight. One battle scene was decent if a little hard to follow, and some of the acting was good too.Maybe I ruined this film for myself, but if you know a little about the mythology you'll spend at least half the film picking at it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Successfully modernized,"The problem with the original Clash had to do with the plot. I believe it was a very wise move to add new elements to it.

The plot didn't need to be changed, they should have stuck to the old one and just updated it a bit - fans are always going to be put out when they change much loved stories like that.The 3D wasn't so great either, for those who haven't seen it yet, you might as well save your money and go and see the non-3D version because if you're expecting something as good, visually, as Avatar, you will be sadly disappointed.In fact, the only thing that improved it for me was the CGI - if the original could have had the special effects that this version had then there would have been no need to remake it at all!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"less personality, more action","The original version of ""Clash of the Titans"" was an infinitely entertaining - and still fondly remembered - piece of early '80s kitsch comprised of one part corn to two parts cheese. It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister. Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.It's all very Saturday-matinée juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.Good fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is Argus south of Texas?,"If Clash Of The Titans has to be summed up in just one word, that would be WEAK. WEAK acting and fake RP is something that one could probably forgive to a film coming out of the US where everybody makes movies, and it's only important that the film is ""popcornable"" and doesn't require a lot of thinking and understanding. WEAK storyline can be forgiven as well, provided that the Greek mythology has already been overused in film. But when those come combined, forgiveness is something not quite easy to give.This film has WEAKness that I just can't but forgive. It's obviously made by people that have no clue of Greek mythology whatsoever and all those little factual mistakes make it rather cheesy and too shallow for a serious film experience. It wouldn't have hurt if they actually made a brief research on Greece and the world of Antiquity before jumping into making a film about it. Antiquity seems so Americanized, that every person with intelligence over the average would feel insulted if expected to trust this joke of a storytelling. Everything is just as ridiculous as soldiers wearing Roman helmets in a time when they weren't even invented yet, or as fake-tanned actors that supposedly look more Mediterranean because of the fake tan... You can see those in the film.The film does not impress with a good story. The dialogue screams FAKE, the acting is amateur, so are the effects. The biggest disappointment is Ralph Fiennes, whose acting has never been so unimpressive, but it's probably due to the horrible script he had to work with.I wouldn't advice paying to see this, it's just not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"There are better mythology titles, really","As much as I like movies that are connected to the great Greek mythology, this is certainly not one of them. I can't compare it to the original version, because as of today I haven't seen it yet. But I definitely can say that Clash of the Titans (3D) is a barbaric carnage on the group of films that are set in the times of gods, heroic warriors, and ancient empires.The storyline is childish, but what more can you expect from a typical popcorn flick brought to life in order to please the masses, right? Right.The demigod Perseus, son of Zeus, has to stop Hades from releasing the Kraken, which will destroy the town of Argos. He gathers a team of brave, strong and handsome soldiers, who will accompany him on his nearly impossible mission. At first, there seem to be no chances of stopping the beast. However, as the time passes the team realizes that there is one way to defeat the monster, but it requires a trip into the deepest parts of the underworld, namely the palace of Medusa, and cutting her head off. As expected, at the end of the journey only a few men survive; just to make the tale look more dramatic. I think I don't have to mention how the whole story ends, as it clearly speaks for itself.Actually, from the whole movie the only scene that I was really able to call enjoyable, was the one, where Perseus's entourage had to fight with the nasty Medusa, and one by one got turned into stones. Simple, yet somehow very entertaining while one watches it in 3D.Oh yes, as for the special effects. The CGI crew did a pretty decent job of creating all the monsters and beasts for this feature. They aren't too simple and as of first sight, they don't look too computer-ish.The battle sequences would have been boring if it wasn't for the third dimension's visual experience. They look very spectacular sometimes. This is one of a few positive aspects of the movie, for sure.Sam Worthington as a demigod? Who knew? He actually has the ability to make his character credible, with all the fantastic combat skills and mighty words that he speaks. But Ralph Fiennes was seriously better off playing Voldemort.As of now, you aren't probably able to see the movie in the cinemas anymore. So the 3D opportunity is gone. If you have a TV compatible with 3D glasses, and are in the mood for some brainless action movie, than I say go watch it, just for fun. Otherwise, I say don't, it isn't worth your time.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, but thats about it","Clash of The Titans is by no means a bad movie, but it ain't great either. The biggest most entertaining part of the film was the art direction. The sets, the costumes, and the monsters were all absolutely beautiful. The universe has its own style of translating Greek mythology into gorgeous visuals. Everything feels like it all belongs together and is truly a site to behold.That being said, the plot is pretty weak. Most of the plot points are pretty contrived and it sort of feels less like a journey and more like random events strung together. Louis does a good job behind the camera and the action is exciting, there are just a few story problems. The main one being motivation. The characters simply do what they do and we are given little reason for why. Zeus is especially frustrating in this manner.In terms of performance, it is a mixed bag.Liam Neeson is wonderful as always and he is pretty much the ideal Zeus. Sam Worthington on the other hand sucks it up once again, that guy cannot keep an accent straight to save his life. He had the same problem in Terminator and he continues to go from British to Australian and some times to American.Despite its obvious flaws, Clash of The Titans is a fun ride and if you want to put a little mindless excitement to your day, the this is a good start.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shallow spectacle rewards low-to-medium expectations,"For an unknown reason, I was in the mood to rewatch this and it was surprisingly OK. What saves this movie is the actors -- even if we don't take the story seriously, THEY do. And the casting is really quite good. Liam Neeson never looked so good in his sparkling armor.Gemma Arterton's character has been criticized for being superfluous, but I find her to be easy on the eyes, so I'll overlook this particular plot contrivance.The visuals, music, and pacing are all quite good. But anyone looking for believability, depth, or meaning will likely be disappointed. If you haven't seen the film before, well, bear in mind the story borders on cartoonish.I give this 5.5 stars, with a half-star bonus for Mads Mikkelsen's performance (his secondary character had fine stage presence). That's six (6) stars total.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Clash of the Titans"" (2010)","""Clash of the Titans"" is an unusual film to remake for a modern audience. I mean, how familiar is Joe Moviegoer with the 1981 original or Greek mythology on the whole? The answer is 'Not very,' and the producers know it. They've taken broad steps to protect poor Joe from the alienating Grecian polytheism and comfort him with an immediately recognizable protagonist. To the layman, and in effect, for the layman, they've dumbed it down.Sam Worthington is Perseus, which I guess is a big deal now that he's the star of the highest-grossing film of all time. And when you hire Sam Worthington, you get Sam Worthington. The '81 Perseus is aloof, oddly lackadaisical, with shoulder-length hair and a caring, inquisitive disposition. Worthington's Perseus is a buzzcut graduate of the Christian Bale/Batman school of acting. His dialogue is gruff, brief, and introverted, because coolness now is apparently inversely proportional to vocabulary and elocution. It speaks to a certain extent about the types of characters we hold up as heroes in our current social climate, but more so, it's a simple example of commercial viability over storytelling practicality. Worthington as Perseus is a carefully calculated business move, and the streamlining of his character is indicative of director Louis Leterrier's greater neutering of the myth for 13-year- old boys. After all, if there's one thing less cool than masculine eloquence, it's ancient culture.Damn the gods indeed. 2010's ""Titans"" retells Perseus' story through a decidedly Christian lens. Mount Olympus has been downsized, and Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) essentially become surrogates for God and the devil. Most of the roles fulfilled by other gods in the original film have been reassigned to these two to keep things simple, which would be fine if they were interesting characters. Instead, a hunchbacked Fiennes rasps ominously at his brother, and Neeson sucks all ambiguity out of the king of the gods. It's worth noting that the original is far from a masterpiece, but the insecurities and petty vengeances of Zeus and his kin are among the more entertaining ideas it puts forth. The remake drops most of these characters and fits Zeus with a stoic (re: boring) gravitas, and a ridiculous set of digitally glistening armor.And I can complain until I'm blue in the face about the intellectual inadequacies of ""Clash of the Titans,"" but it's surface level mistakes like bad costumes and poor action choreography that really kills the film. The '81 version is defined by its special effects and set-pieces, and the best we can do in 2010 is CG monsters and post-production 3D? The remake is everything an effects-heavy film shouldn't be: sweeping and grandiose at the expense of intimacy. I don't care how many scorpions you render or how big you've made the Kraken when I don't even understand the decisions your protagonist is making.But it's not like the remake ruins a classic or anything. The original has its share of problems, and one of the things the 2010 film does right is to kick the pacing in the pants where it needs to, leaving fewer sedentary dry spells than its predecessor. Regardless, I still hold the '81 version in higher regard because of its faithfulness in depicting the pantheon of the Grecian gods, and the charm and personality of its effects. The mythology is all ""Clash of the Titans"" circa 2010 has to distinguish itself by, and it downplays that difference instead of embracing it. Splash bland action and unimpressive effects on that cinematic identity crisis, and even Joe Moviegoer will agree you've failed.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining but unexceptional.,"I remember my fifth grade English teacher making us read Padriac Colum's ""The Golden Fleece"", a long children's novel about Perseus, the sorceress Medea (the love of his life) and their adventures around the world, hunting for titans, monsters and defying the Gods. I remember this clearly, for she warned us that when we got to Mythology in our advanced English classes in college we were sure to flunk lest we learned our mythology right then and there, ""and what better way to do so than through this extraordinary introduction to the subject?"" I've always been a literature fan, and I love doing my research correctly. Back then, my research amounted to having my mom taking me to the Cineplex to watch Disney's ""Hercules"". She took me on a weekend, and I remember returning to school on Monday anxious to inform the teacher and my classmates that Colum was wrong, because Disney didn't depict the mythological gods and heroes like he said. My teacher, bless her, set me straight and explained to me how films will never resemble the book, and how the book, in turn, will differ in many points from what Mythology scholars would say.That was 1997. I've never taken a single course of Mythological Literature since, but it was a surprise to go to the Cineplex again to watch Louis Leterrier's ""Clash of the Titans"" and find that it didn't differ much from the portrait of Mythology our English teacher had painted for us back in 1997. The story is very much the same as I remembered it: Perseus, son of Zeus and a human woman, is seeking revenge from Hades for killing his Earthly parents, and is traveling with a bunch of soldiers from Argon to the ends of the world, seeking a way to stop Hades' Kraken from destroying Argon and trying to come to terms with his being a demi-god and his falling in love with the demi-goddess Io (not Medea, as my book would have it).There are three quite notable differences from film to Mythology, though: a) the characters' beards are wildly long and unkempt (I wanna say 'Neanderthal') unlike the clean-shaven heroes I saw in my book, b) their costumes don't fit into the preconception I had of Greek apparel; rather, the people are dressed in battle-wear and silk robes that scream ""The Passion of the Christ meets Frank Miller's 300"", and c) there was no Kraken in any part of the Mythology that was taught me; I remember a Leviathan in The Bible and a Kraken in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but no more.Then again, I had to constantly remind myself that this is Hollywood we're talking about, and no amount of unshaven Neanderthals in Greek armor can deter the main hero from being an Adonis, clean-shaven, perfectly-built and bearer of a modern port, handsomeness and demeanor which teenage girls would melt over. So, according to the Hollywood standards, casting Sam Worthington as Perseus is nothing short of infallible. Then there's the casting of Ralph Fiennes as Hades, God of the Underworld...and no, he's not dressed in a smoky dark tunic or has no blue flames as hair (like Disney would have you believe), but looks rather like Genghis Khan with ethereal fiery wings. Talk about imagination. Then there's Liam Neeson as Zeus, God of Lightning; his shining armor almost blinds the viewer and I was sure he'd join King Arthur any moment, brandishing his shiny sword around and having his braided and flea-infested beard flying behind him...but I digress.I guess I made my point about the costume design. Yes, they went too far and yes, it doesn't even look remotely Greek, but that can all be forgiven because of the imagination that went behind the design of the titans and demons Perseus and the Argonauts fight against. You'll find yourself in awe at the serpentine Gorgon, the stone scorpions, the Eyeless Fates, Pegasus, and even the non-mythological Kraken, who looks simply awesome.The plot is predictable, whether you know your mythology or not, but one doesn't see ""Clash of the Titans"" because of its plot, but because of the action scenes, and it DOES deliver at that. Action scene after action scene leave you awestruck, even if the so-called drama and seedily clichéd dialogue attempt to destroy them whenever the battles stop for a breather and we're left with the characters simply staring and talking at each other à la Transformers Two. But to be sure, ""Titans"" is your usual Hollywood action flick that bases its success on the special effects and a pair of steaming hot leading actors; the difference between ""Titans"" and any other commercial money-milker, though, is that this one actually entertains the audience and pumps you up.Yes, it's a heavily flawed film. Yes, it's not the best film of the year. But it IS a great time at the movies and it IS guaranteed to entertain. Rating: 2 stars and a half out of 4!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining.,"Australia's own Sam Worthington is Perseus, battling against the marshalled forces of Hades, including Medusa and the Kraken, in a pretty fun swords and sandals fantasy epic that is a remake of the 1981 classic that I remember seeing eons ago as a kid.Was it the greatest movie ever? No. But the special effects were incredible, the action sequences cool and the cast around Worthington, which included Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen was quite impressive.Sometimes all you need for an entertaining movie that doesn't require too much thought is a guy wielding a sword against the worst Hades has to offer.

Mildly amusing at best.,"This modern day remake of the 1981 fantasy favorite is at least somewhat faithful to its storyline. It spins a yarn based on Greek mythology, when mankind is sick and tired of the tyranny of gods such as all-powerful Zeus (who else but Liam Neeson). Perseus (stone faced Aussie hunk Sam Worthington) is the young hero of the piece, sired by Zeus with a mortal woman. Perseus actually has no desire to live the life of a god, but finds himself drawn into a quest. He and others will journey to the land of the Stygian witches to learn how the monstrous Kraken can possibly be destroyed. At stake is the land of Argos.From the beginning, it appeared to this viewer that the main reason this movie existed was to swap the charming stop motion animation of legendary special effects man Ray Harryhausen for cutting edge CGI. It's more of a grandiose technical achievement than a story well told, really. Director Louis Leterrier rarely gives us a chance to breathe. Granted, some of the action set pieces are intense, but they also tend to be incoherent at times. The digital effects are variable: the scorpions are pretty cool, but the Kraken, quite frankly, is a washout despite the attempts to convey its immense size. The venture into Medusas' lair should have been a better set piece, but she doesn't come off all that well either. And it's much too bad that Pegasus (referred to here as ""the"" Pegasus) has such a small role to play. The taming of this winged horse was a much more substantial sequence in the original movie. Impressive location shooting (in such places as Ethiopia and the Canary Islands) and thunderous music by Ramin Djawadi can't do a lot to make this version stand out in any way.Like the visual effects, acting is variable from the usually excellent international cast. ""Clash of the Titans"" 2010 can boast such players as Jason Flemyng, Alexa Davalos, Mads Mikkelsen, Izabella Miko, Liam Cunningham, Nicholas Hoult, Polly Walker, Pete Postlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Alexander Siddig, and Danny Huston. Most of the cast isn't given that much to work with, but the beautiful Gemma Arterton, and a heavily made up Ralph Fiennes, offer standout performances. She plays the wise guiding spirit in Perseus' life, while he plays the vengeful antagonist of the piece: Hades, dark lord of the underworld.Overall, this is passable entertainment, but it's also awfully forgettable.Look for a cameo from one of the Harryhausen creations of 1981.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cash in of the Hollywood moguls,"As I sat watching ""Clash of the Titans"" and felt my jaw dropping alarmingly, even after the first few minutes, these were some of the questions that crossed my mind: Was there a script when they started filming? Did it really take several people to write these stupid dialogs? Did the cutter suffer from ADHS,as you can barely recognize who is doing what to whom in the tiring action sequences? Was it really necessary to transform the film into a shoddy looking 3D version? Are the likes of Liam Neeson and Joseph Fiennes really so desperate for roles? Why is Sam Worthington hailed as the new action hero, when he spends this whole sorry mess of a film showing exactly one facial expression, something between grimly annoyed and seriously angry? I think, one of the critics got it perfectly right when he wrote in his review: ""Those whom the gods wish to punish, they force to watch this movie."" I couldn't agree more!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clash of 2D,Its an average movie that is not good or deserving to go beyond 6........The talents of great actors such as Liam Neelson and Ralph Fiennes were not utilized and 2D reigns more in this than 3D effects(or is ti a fault of theater that I watched I don't know that).This film doesn't deserve or need not even be released as 3D as it does not give much.......Although the myths and the animation works are good it sinks due to the vague 2D effect(because we expected 3D)........Only some scenes are shown in 3D..almost 3/4th of the film is in 2D........Watchable thats all but not a great or good film........its an OK type film.......The fight between Medusa and Perseus is smartly handled........,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nothing wrong with this film 6/10,"I'm a devout follower of the original movie and from reading these user reviews I almost didn't go to the theater, I'm glad I did though. I took my 5 year old son with me and we both loved it. All I can say is wow you reviewers are harsh. I thought this movie was fine. If your trying to compare it to a faithful re-telling of the original or are expecting Gladiator then think again. This is a Clash of the Titans for the next milennia. First you have to get one thing straight. The story has been completely re-written from the original. I mean totally re-written. But it works, at least for me. All the characters have different motivations and are brand new. For example, Perseus fights the Kraken but it is to seek revenge and save a city. Calibo's character is totally different too. Then some new characters are added, most notably a love interest for Perseus named Io.This movie is entertaining period action. It's fast paced and full of effects. I think it delivers what the message that the directors intends. I was entertained until the very end. The acting was good, sets and costumes were excellent, dialogue was action movie grade, monsters were good, the action flowed nicely.The Medusa was not as scary as I would have expected. The movie could have run a little longer too. This would have accommodated improved character development. But I tried not to be too harsh on this film. As I recall the some of my favorite sword and magic films were very cheesy. Movies like Beastmaster, Dragonslayer, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, The Sword and the Socerer, Conan the Barbarian to name a few. None of these movies were close to an Academy Award and neither was the original Clash of the Titans, it was entertaining and thats what this film was.

DO NOT SEE IN 3D.

"Could've been better, yet could've been WAY worse.","The Plot: Apparently, we humans have insulted and basically abandoned the Gods. In retaliation, the god Hades(Ralph Fiennes) will destroy the city of Argos(it destroyed the statue of Zeus) in 10 days, unless Princess Andromeda(Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed to his beast, the Kraken. To stop the Kraken, demigod Perseus(Sam Worthington) reluctantly joins a batch of soldiers led by Draco(Mads Mikkelsen) to kill Medusa, as her stare will turn any man or creature to stone. Along the way they run into Stygian Witches and giant scorpions, and Perseus starts developing a relationship with Io(Gemma Arterton), who knows more about Perseus than he does. Meanwhile, Hades is really planning to overthrow the king of the Gods, Zeus(Liam Neeson) for his own brand of ruling.Okay, let's get one thing straight: seeing this in 3D SUCKED!! It was a cheap last minute decision that to me was just a way to grab more cash.Glad I got that out of the way. In all, this movie isn't terrible, but then again, it isn't that fun cheesiness found in the 1981 original. First is the acting. Everyone sounds so bored. Even Neeson, a tough guy from the likes of Batman Begins and Taken, falls quite short. Worthington is hammed up to the max, and some of the others sound like they're reading from a mythology textbook. The only above average performance goes to Fiennes as the evil Hades. And what's with the gods wearing suits of armor? It's like a clash of Mythology and the Renaissance. I also thought the Kraken deserved more screen time. The way they were promoting this, you'd think the Kraken would have showed up for at least 15 minutes. It just felt too short.Now to the goodies. The action, though there's isn't too much, is pretty fun. I even think the Medusa battle is a little better and improved. The effects and setting are pretty good, though the great Ray Harryhausen's work will always remain king. I also kind of enjoyed the score by Ramin Djawadi(Iron Man, Prison Break), which I later bought on Itunes.Overall, this is a decently done film that, if casted and thought of better, would have been a nice Spring blockbuster. Instead we're left with only glimpses of that.The Verdict: 5 for the cruddy 3D and I actually give the traditional 2D a 6. The Good: Nice effects and battles. The Bad: A terribly cheap 3D conversion and wooden performances to almost every character.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unspeakably bad,"Usually in a mediocre sword and sandals outing, there are one or two elements that are bad enough to damn a film. Here, there's not one element that could salvage it. The sets are tacky and cheap. The dialogue is puerile, weak and stupid when not actually outright insulting to the viewer. The acting is wooden enough to give splinters. The script doesn't have enough for many of the main characters to do and completely wastes the rest of the cast. The writers deserve a firing squad: if you're going to deviate *this* much from actual mythology, it's forgivable only if you produce a better piece of art because of it. That didn't happen. Here, ***NOTHING*** works and the story is butchered to no purpose other than clueless impulse and ego. And the director deserves never to work again in film in this lifetime or any other, not even as a janitor.If Sam Worthington really wanted to make a worthy version of this film for his kids' generation, he should have read that script much more carefully before agreeing to be in the film.

Finally a good remake.,"CLASH OF THE TITANSThe original is a complete classic... so when I heard they were remaking it I had my doubts. I went to the cinema to see it because the trailer actually looked quite good... and I loved it. I finally got it on DVD and decided to watch it again today... did I like it as much the second time around?The movie is about mortal people turning on the immortal god Zeus, so when Zeus sends his brother down to the planet to teach the humans a lesson in respect and get them to prey to Zeus again. Zeus' brother, Hades, goes and releases the Kraken. A huge monster that only knows how to destroy everything in its path. The only man who can stop all this destruction is Perseus... the son of Zeus.This remake is a complete success in my mind. It has everything I wanted from the original. The thing I love about the original version was the really bad effects... for their time they are amazing. But I would not want to change them. The effects in this version are up to date, but there are moments where you can clearly see it is computer generated.I loved the giant scorpions and I loved the Kraken, but my favourite characters from this story is Medusa. They all looked amazing, but Medusa was awesome! I loved the snake hair and the face when she stares at people is really spooky.The movie stars Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Flemyng, Gemma Arterton & Mads Mikkelsen. Everyone dies a great job. Especially Liam Neeson. I am not really a Liam Neeson fan, but since he has started making action film I am starting to like him a lot more.The film is full of action from beginning to end. And the action is full on. I really like the fantasy world that this film is set in.Finally, I was super impressed to the little nod to the original version when Perseus pulls out the original mechanical owl and asks what it is. Perfect!Is is exciting and a lot of fun to watch... and even though it is missing the feel of the original film, it really is a remake that I like.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""There is a God in you.

Popcorn amusement at its worst,"Two things first: one, I'm none too big on myths so I didn't know the backing story. And two, I've never seen the original Clash of the Titans (or cannot remember seeing it) so I'm not going into comparisons.The film starts when a kid is found at sea gets rescued from drifting. A small bit of film later and he's all grown up and a skilled fisherman who sails the sea together with his family to get some food and fish to sell. During one of these fishing trips they witness an event that can best be expressed as an act of war against the Gods and so this war starts.What follows is an endless string of battles, explosions of pent up anger and overly predictable near misses, rescues and what else. Added to this is an awfully thin layer of 3D effects which makes the film look and feel like these old school 3D toys where you insert a disc with pictures into a device that looks like a binocular to give them some depth.Added up you get a thin and broken up story line, somewhat more than OK 2D effects and very very bad 3D effects.

Makes you MISS stop motion filming,"When it comes to classic stories it is dangerous to stray from the storyline, after all they became classics because of the way they were written the first time. If you do stray from the storyyou better do it damn well (such as 300)or fail miserably (such as The Scarlet Letter – Demi Moore version).There have been a handful of versions for the trials of Perseus, but nothing this off target. The only parts of the story that retained are the Graeae and Perseus killing Medusa. The movie came in below 2 hours with big chunks being the freshly made up stuff. So it is quite lean on storyline.The action scenes are OK, but not really impressive. On top of thatthe CGI did not impress me. I found myself missing the Ray Harryhousen stop motion work in 80s version of Clash of the Titans.The acting was OK, but nothing memorable or worth remembering. Ohh one rant, I am getting really tired of the whole ""ancient world spoke English with a British accent"", ohh we can't find enough actors that speak with a Mediterranean accentso Queen's English shall suffice.Movie is worth a discount ticketor rent the 1981 Clash of the Titans and watch it at home.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Titanic,"I haven't watched the original(and I know this copies stuff invented/imported for that one), but I understand that it, like this, doesn't follow the Greek myth entirely. Oh, I have no doubt that, on the whole, it is superior(this doesn't appear to have that much in common with it). I don't mind dated FX, if they get the job done, and in a lot of cases, they clearly put serious effort into it. If I find a copy of it, I'll give it a chance. This is the third Leterrier(who, I understand, is a fan of the 1981 version) creation I catch(The Transporter and The Incredible Hulk), and other than Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, I've largely liked his choices. He always delivers plenty of awesome, exciting and effective action, and this is no exception. The same goes for it being engaging and fun. Production values are high, and the designs(other than the silly-looking beard they hid Huston behind) are usually very good. The plot moves along nicely, and I was never bored. Characters are fine, if more development, personality and a greater amount of ones that get to be fleshed out and play a genuine role in the story would be quite welcome. There is essentially no poor comic relief. The Gods are in it relatively little. This is largely well-cast, if the acting talent is basically wasted. With that said, they do add to the experience. A few performances are over the top, most noticeably Flemyng(is it me, or is that his thing?). Dialog is marvelous, with the occasional hiccup. The editing and cinematography are well-done, apart from brief instances here and there. Visually, it's attractive enough, though you can tell that it wasn't meant to be 3D from the start(in fact, one can barely see that it is, at all... in the bad way). The CGI is excellent(and smoothly and nearly seamlessly integrated; also, the locations and stunts help immensely at selling the illusion), with strong exceptions, such as the soulless Medusa and the obvious horses(honestly, just stay away from animating anything that is alive and exists in the real world). Score is fitting and cool, by the man who also did the music for Iron Man. This communicates its themes pretty well. There is a lot of mild-ish(if bordering on brutal) violence and brief moderate language in this. I recommend this to fans of the genre and of epic popcorn flicks. Nothing too challenging, and certainly not the best of its kind, if entertaining. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Greek tragedy, Epic fail, the only myth here is why it was green lit.","I loved the 1981 original. I remember watching it as a kid; we had that and Jason and the Argonauts taped from the TV. I've seen it since as an adult, and know that it isn't a masterpiece, but I'd still recommend it over this new thoughtless, boring action by numbers remake.The plot's dealt with and put aside in the first 20 minutes or so, with minimal time spent on characters or motives etc. We're offered some flimsy sudo-existential man v religion rubbish embodied by Perseus and his almost homophobic fear of not being a MAN! (GRRRR!) Which practically becomes his catchphrase. Almost every time he opens his mouth the words ""I'm just a man"" or ""I'll do this as a man"". OK; we get, you've got some father issues. Stop scowling, and show us some personality...Even a ridiculously impromptu romance with the monotone Io (A heavily sedated Gemma Arteton) fails to bring another dimension out of Worthington.This goes for all the characters in the movie. None of them are at all fleshed out or developed. With Mads Mikkelsen's Draco particularly underwritten. The result is a cast of stock-fodder that you know's going to die, and you don't really care how, who, or when it happens. And then there's the damn tree man and his people?! Or Chew-bark-a as I like to call him >dies<, Leterrier's Tesco value Wookies. They were rubbish, totally pointless; looked awful, and unintentionally hilarious every time they ""spoke"".Much has been said about Liam Neeson as Zeus too, but he looked uncomfortable and a bit embarrassed in a lot of scenes to me. Ralph Fiennes hams things up as the Lord of the Underworld Hades but doesn't resemble a true antagonist until the final act.Once established the film moves at break neck pace from set piece to set piece, aided by the incessant music that comes to life any time anything happens on screen. And I do mean anything! A horribly forced ""teach you how to sword fight"" scene is made to feel like the final showdown. Sounding like some kind of orchestral-metal; it's that typical Hans Zimmer-esquire ""chugging"" sound that accompanies 90% of all Hollywood action scenes, and is quintessentially douche! What happened to action scenes without music? They're always so much more gripping and atmospheric.The Medusa scene sums up the whole film for me. In the original it was a dark tense sequence; tension slowly built up with subtle use of sound and shadow. It genuinely freaked me out as a child. Leterrier's vision wastes no time getting into things. Her lair is bigger, louder and more perilous and looses any sense of atmosphere as a result.The special effects are indeed impressive (although the 3D is an underwhelming after thought), but covering a piece of rancid steak in a gourmet sauce isn't going to make any more palatable. But given that you don't care about any of the characters, the action scenes end up being impressive but ultimately devoid of any real tension.To it's credit it doesn't get bogged down in cheesy quips, or comic relief like many summer blockbusters feel the need to, but on the whole it's pretty dismal.If you enjoy mindless (if uninspiring) action or burley men with big swords; this is for you.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining flick about Greek mythology,"Hearing about the movie, as relates to 'wrath of the titans', I decided to see this, and I'm glad I did. I went into it , expecting what I got; pure adrenaline and entertainment. If you go into it looking for precise mythological representation, you may be disappointed, but then aren't most people disappointed when they see a movie after reading the book, - and given the small time period for a movie, why are you ? ;) I knew this going in, I sat there looking for entertainment, as most of us do when we goto the movies, and was most certainly not disappointed. The acting seemed a tad stiff in places as if a given actor was trying to find a reason to be excited about their role, but that's a very small nit, as overall the acting is wonderful, by a stellar cast.The plot is as you would expect from such a movie, as it does not delve too far into the mythos, yet gives you enough information, along with stunning visuals , to be clearly entertained for the entire 1.5 hours. The Greek mythos adage about gods not feeling loved enough is clear, is simple in its comprehension yet is great content for a action experience. I never felt like I wanted to leave the room, nor did anyone else. I remembered the original quite well, and while in some ways it was better than this remake, what's clear is the attempt to yet again, entertain and in that it achieved that quite well.I do think the snarky comment about the poor metal owl, though honestly semi humorous, was I thought a bit misplaced and in a way slightly ruined the energy the movie had going up to that point. It's not even close to a deal breaker, but having seen the 1981 original at least twice, felt like the owl omission was unfortunate, but I do understand that they were concentrating on other plot points and do not fault them for that per se. The owl, for me at least, gave the movie a distinct feeling of empathy, as I, like I imagine many others, were rooting for the owl, as the stalwart companion. We all love our animal companions after all, which brings us further into a position of empathy as movie goers, yet no matter, as they more than make up for it in other respects.I recommend seeing this if you liked the original, are okay with something unique regarding plot twists, and love special effects as they lend a hand to magical mythological portrayals.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Pride of Man,"As a whole people have a difficult time accepting help whether it be from friend or foe. Generally speaking, a person carries emotional baggage with them that affects their decisions for good and for bad. A large part of this baggage is passed down to us by our parents and those who influenced our lives early on. Sometimes this results in the acceptance of help and other times it compels us to refuse help out of pride, shame or any number of secondary emotions.These thoughts coalesced during a secondary viewing of remake of the film, ""Clash of the Titans"". While the movie did fail on many levels, what it did get right was the above message. Perseus throughout the entire story, refused his father, Zeus' assistance. In his mind he needed to prove and to know and that he wasn't like the other gods and that a human could accomplish great deeds. Only once, he was able to cut off Medusa's head without godly assistance was he able to accept that he could allow Zeus' offerings; a Pegasus and a sword.This is not something that is exclusive to a narrative. Everyday we make decisions that have the potential to be based on qualities passed onto us that he feel shame or pride in. Often, these decisions limit our potential and what we are able to accomplish in our lifetime. On the extreme end of that, those who cannot cope with their baggage may even descend into a lesser life lived. There is no one path for a person to take in order to work through this baggage and achieve happiness. It is accomplished through trial and error. One person may have to reconcile their feeling about a perceived inadequate parent while another person has to cut a monster's head off. It's all a matter of interpretation.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Mythical Monster Show,"Sitting through this movie, I get the feeling that the main reason for Louis Leterrier and company to do this remake of the 1981 ""Clash Of The Titans"" is just to flex its special effects muscle for 3D fans. It's a sort of Mythical Monsters Show. There is no attempt to improve the stories of the Olympian gods, or its characters.And yes, they paid tribute to stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen by inserting his mechanical owl in a scene when Perseus and his warriors are preparing to set out to do battle with the monsters. The 1981effort was Harryhausen's last movie.The film is basically the story of demi-god Perseus (played by Avatar's Sam Worthington), the bastard son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). It is Perseus' destiny to rescue the city of Argos from the vengeful wrath of Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld, and his monster Kraken.Teaming up with a small squad lead by Draco (Mads Mikkelsen), Perseus must giant scorpions, a hideous king turned slayer (Jason Flemyng as Acrisius), the snake-haired Medusa and finally the dreadful Kraken. Also on his side are his guardian angel Io (Gemma Aterthon) and the flying horse Pegasus.As far as remakes go, this one seems content to just lay out the plot which is familiar to those who know the legend. The action on the screen may be in 3D (in selected cinemas) but the characters are mostly two-dimensional.This is especially so of the council of Olympian gods which turned out looking like folks dressed in Halloween costumes mouthing lame lines. Even Neeson looks and sounds fake as the king of the gods.The human warriors fare a little better - with the main theme being Perseus' insistence on being a man rather than the son of Zeus. The Mythical Monster Show, however, has its moments of grandeur and photorealism - and it recalls actions from films like ""Avatar"" ""Star Wars"" and ""One Million Years BC"". I remember feeling more involved in battle scenes from Harryhausen's ""Jason And The Argonauts"" than in this one.

It's Boring and the 3D is useless,"I tried to like this mess but with memories of the cult classic original I was super keen to see this remake. Aussie Sam Worthington is made for this movie, he is not the problem, it's the darkness, the noise and the stupid situations. How did the scorpions accept a rider to steer it around. No spoilers from me just one more thing, WHY WAS IT IN 3D. There was simply no need to see this in 3D as in my eyes it was not effective until the final credits. Then there was the camp factor, sure, the sparkling jacket worn by Zeus is like something Wayne Newton might wear, but the fake Greek pillars in Mount Olympus look like a set from Showgirls. Overall its nothing more than a big lightweight expensive kids film. The music was good, the battle between hero Perseus and evil Medusa was watchable and a highlight, but nothing memorable. Even the magnificent mechanical owl from the original gets dissed and flying horse Pegasus is Black! huh....This won't hurt Sam's growing career but not good.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stunningly enthralling,"I always loved ancient Greek mythology. Even when I was a lil' kid I used to read the legendary myths and be amazed by all these incredible ideas and stories the people from the very Cradle of Civilization would hold true and passionately believe in. Yes, I used to watch the campy ""Hercules"" with Kevin Sorbo. Later, I loved the ""Age of Mythology"" RTS. And now, after long years of deep slumber, my love for Ancient Greek gods, and heroes, and fearless mortals who opposed them was magically nourished and reborn by this new ""Clash of the Titans"" film.Throughout the movie, adrenalin was being pumped non-stop, my face of jaw-dropping amazement could only temporarily be replaced by a glittering smile. The 3D visuals were simply TOP-NOTCH, that is, like something I have never seen before. The acting was great: Sam gave a genuine and charismatic performance; Liam Neeson redeemed himself of his ""Taken"" nonsense; it was pleasant to see the amazing actress Polly Walker from ""Rome"" have a part in the spectacle, but, to me, Mads Mikkelsen and his staunch acting was the one worth the title of the demigod.I saw this film a nice, still spring evening.

Not Worth my money,"I was quite excited about the film, mainly because its a 3D film.

"Well done visually, but hollow","Despite its flaws(the uneven acting and the episodic storybook-like structure) I really like the original Clash of the Titans, especially for the set design and the Harryhousen effects. In short, it is flawed but good nostalgic fun. This 2010 remake is very well done in the costume and set design and some of the effects are truly incredible, but emotionally it is ultimately hollow.While I do agree the effects were incredible, especially the Kraken, some of the scenes could have been better done. In particular with the gorgon Medussa. A scene that terrified me when I was little in the original and still does to some extent, but as has been pointed out once or twice before there was more emphasis on too much action not enough suspense which diminished that scene's appeal in this.The music comes across as rather generic. It strived to be rousing, energetic and bombastic, something you would find with Erich Korngold and Bernard Hermann, but sadly it came across as generic and boring. Pacing was an issue as well, it was very uneven here. It felt as though the not-so-important scenes dragged and the important bits felt rushed and skimmed over. The direction was disappointingly lethargic too.My main complaints though are with the acting, story and script. As I have said, the story and acting weren't the strongest points of the original, but both elements had their moments. However, the story has a very uneven structure, it is quite episodic, but it is also rather unexciting. On the whole the dialogue is awful and very banal, and there were some scenes where it came across as cheesy or forced. The acting wasn't much to go on either. Sam Worthington was merely alright, he has the heroism and charm, but then there is the accent that comes and goes and I got the sense that the delivery of some of the lines and the action sequences didn't come naturally to him. I was more disappointed in the bigger names. Ralph Fiennes doesn't seem to have a clue what he is doing here, and Liam Neeson looks lost and embarrassed. Gemma Arterton can be good(BBC's Tess of the D'Urbevilles) but while she is very pretty, her character is rather vapid.Overall, it had its moments, but it was unengaging and disappointing. 4/10 for the production values.

Entertaining enough for a throwaway laugh or gasp,"I watched the original Clash of the Titans merely days before the new remake to try and understand why it has become such a cult classic since its original release back in 1981. While people will tell you it is one of those films that are so bad it slowly becomes good, I actually found the film to be quite entertaining. It was by no means a great film, but it had heart and an epic scope limited only by its need to employ the effects of Ray Harryhausen.Enter the remake, or reimagining as it so conveniently seems. As the people of Argos lash back against the Gods, including Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the Gods start to lash back. Caught in the crossfire is Zeus' bastard son Perseus (Sam Worthington), who seeks revenge against the Gods, but quickly finds out it is his destiny to save the townspeople and to help Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from being sacrificed to the mythic Kraken.What was charming about the original film was its lack of dimensionality and complications. Perseus is raised and trained to fight against the Gods, and find his calling in saving Andromeda out of love. The plot was focused entirely around him, and the Gods took a back seat to his storyline. Hell, there really is no specific bad guy in the film at all. In the remake, it seems like they attempted to pile on as much story as they comprehensively could, cutting out certain Gods almost entirely (or having them stand almost as a placeholder and do next to nothing, such as Danny Huston's Poseidon or Alexander Siddig's Hermes), cutting out or changing characters around entirely, or curbing the screen time of some of the first film's integral characters (Jason Flemyng's Calibos immediately comes to mind).But even with the changes and the added dimensionality for some, the film lacks the heart that drove the original almost entirely. There is nothing charming here, nothing fun. Sure the film is exciting, but it lacks the pulse that made the original so enjoyable. Of course, this is not helped by the script, which plays itself out much too seriously for its own good. There are a few amusingly ridiculous one-liners sprinkled throughout (the blatant sexual euphemism ""Ease your storm"" is a gem that sticks out), but the majority of the dialogue jumps quickly in scale of bad to worse. There was a reason huge chunks of the original film did not have any dialogue. Apparently the filmmakers here did not get the memo, and decided to jump amp up the silly dialogue as much as they could at any moment they could. And was there really a reason to replace Bubo the mechanical owl with a not so subtly camouflaged ripoff of Chewbacca?Acting wise, the film is entirely hit and miss. The majority of performers are lifeless, and emotionally banal. While Neeson and Fiennes do their best to overcome the contrivances of the script, you can tell almost immediately that they really have no place in a film like this. They are much stronger thespians than that (although Fiennes appears to be channelling his inner Voldemort in far too many scenes). While it is nice to see them in a goofy picture like this, I find it very disheartening to note the last film they appeared in was Schindler's List. Bond veterans Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen seem to get the juiciest material in the whole picture, but both lack the real charisma and drive for the audience to really care about their characters, or their relationships to anyone else. Davalos fares even worse, seemingly making even a damsel in distress look difficult to pull off.Worthington is the glue that holds the film together, and for the most part he does well. Even when he is clearly being held back or delivering the silliest pieces of dialogue, he still has the emotional presence to carry the film and make you care about his plight for revenge. I was not overly excited about the overly cliché revenge plot, or that he was playing an off-shoot of Jake Sully from Avatar here, but he still manages to make the character unique enough to stand alone. He may have been a breakthrough in Terminator Salvation, and simply great in Avatar, but here he merely maintains his status as an excellent newcomer. I look forward to his next film with great trepidation.While there are a few bad green screening moments (and a few throwaway shots clearly thrown in to appeal to 3D viewers), the special effects are quite excellent. Gone is the stop motion and claymation of the original film, and in its place are CG effects that make everything look more realized that I imagined (and even include a few great makeup effects too). I was impressed by just about everything thrown at the screen (outside of the absurd scorpions), as they looked a lot better than I imagined they would. While not every scene is as polished as the next, they all come away looking very well done.I did not expect a whole lot from Clash of the Titans going on what the trailers offer us, but having the shell of the original story still in place works in its favour. The film, even at its worst, still manages to be entertaining enough for a throwaway laugh or gasp. Although it is done in a more epic way in the God of War video game series and with more heart in the original film, there are still some things to like about the film. It is not a great film by any means, and it likely will never find the cult classic status its brethren did. But it is enjoyable enough, and could have been so much worse.4.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Cadre of Fine Actors on a Silly Spree,"CLASH OF THE TITANS was perhaps more entertaining as a 3D movie in theaters than it is on the small screen of the home television where the CGI effects are less impressive and at times downright silly. Louis Leterrier directed this remake of the 1981 Olivier/Hamlin epic based on Beverley Cross's take on the struggle for power between the Greek Gods and mankind: this time around the myth is manipulated by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi who have managed to create dialogue that must have been embarrassing for the actors to speak. The gods are either surrounded by blinding light or smog-on-a-bad-day smoke and the presence of the creatures of the very mixed up version of the myth range form beautiful Pegasus (flying horses) to a voluptuous Medusa to the bigger than life scorpions and devilish gods to the Kraken who probably wins the contest for most disgusting beastie - though the competition is tough!The story is basically an attempt of Zeus and the gods on Olympus to restore their tainted reputation as being adored and worshiped through the wiles of Perseus who is thwarted by a long standing sibling rivalry victim Hades in Perseus' travels to kill the Medusa and the supposedly indestructible Kraken. It is a tale of men versus kings versus gods versus good and evil. The very odd aspect of this dark film is the fact that of many of the cast are among the finest actors on the screen. Some are minor actors (Sam Worthington plays Sam Worthington who is placed complete with burr cut in the role of Perseus), but others include Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Hans Matheson, Danny Huston, Nicholas Hoult, the departed Pete Postlethwaite, Mads Mikkelsen (the strongest in the cast), a very chubby Polly Walker, Elizabeth McGovern, Gemma Arterton - the list goes on and on.Having never seen the original 1981 Clash of the Titans makes comparison impossible, but if the purpose for making this over the edge movie was to test contemporary 3D techniques it probably succeeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle.Grady Harp",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Um...were there any actual writers in this project?,"**Contains Spoilers*Being a fan of the original Clash of the Titans, I was very optimistic to see what a CGI Kraken and Medusa could look like. The 2010 Medusa was pretty well rendered, but the Kraken was nothing more than a Cloverfield rip-off, and a bad one at that.But these additions are not the worst part of it...first off, did any of the script writers actually read the myth of Perseus? A Cliff-Notes edition would have sufficed. Instead, they took most of Disney's Hercules script,brought in a few names they barely recalled from high school English, which they undoubtedly failed, and placed a Jason Stathom version of Perseus into the mix.Here is a little 101 of the myth: 1. Perseus never knew of Andromeda until AFTER he had slayed Medusa. 2. Hades played NO PART in this story and Zeus played barely anything as well. 3. Athena and Hermes were the two major Gods in this myth, as there was no f**king way Perseus could get to the land of the 3 gorgons (yes, there are three of them) without some aid of airborne transportation...he received winged sandals from Hermes. 4. Perseus was getting the head of Medusa as a bargaining chip for the king of Argos who wished to send Perseus away so he could have his mother. 5. Pegasus emerged from the severed neck of Medusa...please see number three above. 6. No, there were no god d@mn scorpions in the myth. Harryhueson came up with that for visual effect, which incidentally made it fun for 1981...2010's version just made it silly. 7. Who the f**k is this Calibus guy? Yes, he was an integral character in the 1981 version, and was well played. No, he was never in the original myth. Perseus had enough of a challenge taking on three reptilian creatures and a big freaking sea lizard. Yes, the 2010 Calibus was, without a doubt, the most unused potential.There is more, but I will hold there. Now, I will forgive the 1981 version for its misinterpretation of the original myth, based on the fact that it tried to make a myth exciting, which it did. It allowed people to read more about ancient myth to see what was really written. All the 2010 version is do a misinterpretation of a misinterpretation, and did it with a story-line that had more holes than Swiss Cheese. Unfortunately, all this version is going to do is enable the laziness of most people into thinking that Perseus was a stubborn sailor who suddenly acquired the skills of Bruce Lee with a sword overnight and that mountain-sized Scorpions spring to life from the blood of a drugged up satyr.In addition, doesn't it seem odd that a giant leviathon with the lung power of a solar flare couldn't knock any human down by bellowing at its highest note?Way to go Hollywood...another brain buster.I give it three stars, as there was some obvious hard work done by the CGI animators and renderers, who more than likely knew the original myth and were scoffing at the stupidity of the so-called writers behind this pile of crap.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Some genuine old-fashioned entertainment.,"This 'remake' of the 1981 classic ""Clash Of The Titans"" is not --I repeat: not-- the miscreant a lot of people want to see in it. On the contrary, I found it to be very well done. Apart from some at times rather cheesy dialogue, that is.As with most adaptations --in this case, an adaptation of an adaptation-- one should first watch this movie before reading up on history/mythology; or indeed watch the 1981 'original'. Of course, what the 2010 release has in favour over the 1981 movie, are the state of the art special effects. In a lot of modern day movies, those effects are sadly the only thing which make the movie interesting, but not here. Here, they are fitting the story nicely, adding some much needed pomp to the circumstances. After all, we're dealing with the Gods here.Speaking of Gods, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are both up to the part they play; Zeus and Hades respectively. Although I must add that Neeson's natural grandeur is a tad lost under the wig of unruly hair they fitted on his head and a rather thinnish beard they smeared on his face.Worthington is more than okay as the demi-God Perseus, while Mads Mikkelsen is very good as the rather stoic Draco. Add the charms of Gemma Arterton as Io and we've got a more than adequate cast who all perform their duties with grace and adroitness.""Clash Of The Titans"", while in the same vein, may not be of the solidity of the epic movies of the fifties and sixties (Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, etc...) but it sure makes for some excellent entertainment and as a consequence it gets a well deserved eight out of ten from yours truly.JJ",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh My Zeus,"At first i thought this movie is going to be epic, but unfortunately it's not. ""Percy Jackson"" is better than this one. The action scenes were awesome but the trailer spoiled almost everything as usual. The screen writing and editing is bad, The costume design is silly, too many questionable moments and goofs, and ordinary CGI. Clash of the Titans is one of the most disappointing movie of the year.The action scenes were awesome, exciting, and entertaining but the rest of the movie is (blowing raspberries). The only good CGI here are the giant scorpions but the Harpies, Medusa and the Kraken are just like the CGI in G.I. Joe. The music score makes the action scenes exciting but it is still not the best. The editing was bad, there are some scenes aren't complete.Zeus' costume is silly. is he suppose to be a god wearing a knight armor? because in that costume he looks like a cheesy super hero.Sam Worthington is a miscast, he needs to stick to roles like Marcus Wright. Liam Neeson was good but his costume makes him look silly. Steve Coogan is better Hades.... just kidding Ralph Fiennes was awesome to play the role.Clash of the Titans isn't the worst remake ever. The movie is still watchable because the action scenes are exciting and awesome. But it's still disappointing. You will like this film if you love movies with sword fights and fast action, but Greek myth or Clash if the Titans of 1981 fans won't like this. I always think this movie is not enough.5/10.If you want to watch a better 3D movie this week then watch How To Train Your Dragon, not this",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A shallow action film with an uninspired storyline,"This film was really an uninspired one, considering its potential, since Greek mythology may always provide the basis for great stories. When I saw the first film (but that was several years ago), I thought mythology was indeed used in an interesting way. In fact, it was only the original film that made this movie sound so promising to me. But it ended up being a betrayal of the source material and full of terrible mistakes regarding mythology. They tried to compensate for this shallow aspect of the script by adding as many aimless action scenes as they could, and this is not how I define a good movie. But if you don't know the original, nor mythology, and if you are not too demanding, you may be less underwhelmed than I have been. And there is one redeeming quality to this silly movie: the Kraken scene, which was at least beautifully shot and showed a very convincing Kraken. I didn't see it in 3D because it had never been intended for 3D in the first place, and the 3D seemed badly rendered anyway.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic disaster,"This movie is disaster of epic proportions, right from beginning all the way to the end. Acting is awful, screenplay is horrid, editing and directing is as director wanted to make 5 minute movie but was forced to extend them to 1hr and plus. Maybe if it lasted only 5min it would be better. So many scenes seem out of place. Soundtrack is dull and uninspired. CGI effects even those seem cheap in comparison to 1981 version. Such a great story with such a potential for great blockbuster and wasted for no good reason. If Zeus was for real he would fry entire movie crew with lightning.How movie got even 6 stars is beyond me.Compared to original from 1981, well the old one is far better movie.I just saw they are planing another failure for 2012 Clash of Titans 2. Please do not film yet another disaster.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Note: This film contains no Titans,"If you're going to do Greek mythology there's no need to simplify. After all it's just storytelling. Such is the problem with the mundane ""Clash of the Titans."" I never saw its' 1981 original but I wonder if it's more inspired than this. Director Louis Leterrier (""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Transporter 2"") knows how to make a kick-ass, fast paced action flick. This is neither. Nor does it have the mythology it should. Greece should serve as a backbone for an epic tale. Instead it's used something to get from one action scene to the next.The tale at hand tells of Perseus (Sam Worthington of ""Avatar"") who was discovered by his fishermen family (Pete Postalwaithe among them) adrift at sea in a tomb with his mother. The fact that the infant survived and the mother did not should tell them something. Perseus doesn't know of his origin and there's the token ""embrace your destiny!"" ""But I'm just a man!"" scenes that follow. His father is Zeus (Liam Neeson) and his mother a mortal tricked into boinking him. Thus he's a demi-God which is kind of like being Penny Hardaway as opposed to Michael Jordan. Soon Perseus is discovered by the kingdom of Argos who demand he help them. Greece, Argos in particular, have angered Zeus and Co. so much that Zeus unleashes his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) upon them. Hades' ultimate weapon is the most underwhelming aspect of the film. The Kraken is large, impressive and fierce but its' use is so anti-climatic that you may end up thinking it was nothing more than a marketing ploy used in the trailer to make us say ""ooh fun!"" Trust me, not really.The cast at hand is rather good and at times they keep the film afloat. Worthington isn't the most complex actor in the world but he makes for a likable and believable hero. He's accompanied by a battalion of Argos soldiers who must bring back the head of Medusa or their princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) will be sacrificed to the Kraken. Among them is the hardy Draco (Mads Mikkelsen; Le Chiffre of ""Casino Royale""). He's sort of a mentor on the fly to Perseus, teaching him how to properly use a sword in one of the films' best scenes. He and his outmatched but savvy and witty group of soldiers give this the fun feel it sorely needs. There's also the matter of Perseus guide Io (Gemma Arterton). She can handle herself in a fight and fits in nicely with Perseus and the others on their quest. The screenplay unfortunately changes her from a character to a plot device as the film goes on. Neeson and Fiennes are fine as they always are but we've seen far better from them. Neeson isn't on screen much as Zeus and when he is, he plays his role rather straight. Fiennes always makes for a good villain but I couldn't help but thinking ""man, he was a lot cooler as VoldeI mean 'he who must not be named'.The acting isn't the reason anyone comes to a film like this. We're here for epic action scenes laden with awesome monsters, larger-than-life heroes, and some cool mythology mixed in. That's the films ultimate failure. It dispenses its mythology matter of factly instead of with intrigue and excitement. While I don't think the film muffed any of the storytelling to suit its needs, it certainly neglects most it. Where's Poseidon, Athena, Ares or any of the other Greek Gods so crucial in these stories? There's sort of a round-table of the Gods but none of it matters. They are all utterly ignored so that Zeus and Hades can bicker and plot. It's not as if ancient Greece was only about the two brothers. The mediocre and predictable plot line would be more forgivable if the action sequences still delivered. Those too are predictable. We know every battle will end and never are the fight scenes intense and stunning as they were in ""300"" and ""Troy"". The CGI effects are nice but they're nice in the way that every film looks nice nowadays. The Kraken isn't on screen long enough to make an impression. Medusa isn't nearly as terrifying as she should be. The scorpions are a nice touch. So are the things that ride them.When a film is mediocre it isn't bad. ""Clash of the Titans"" isn't bad but it's disappointing in the sense that's it's never very thrilling. It certainly promised to be. This was even pushed back a week to be released in 3D. Don't waste the cash. While the 3D doesn't take away anything from a movie like this it isn't breathtaking like ""Avatar"" or even peculiar and vibrant in ""Alice in Wonderland"". The actors are good but they are good because they're good actors. Not because this lazy screenplay allows them to be. It's something of a shame. What could have been a grand semi-epic is just a paint by numbers action flick. There's never a sense that what you're watching is some mythological masterpiece. You can't say much about an average movie. You can say a lot though about a disappointing one. Unfortunately that's what this is.Visit me at Celluloidlove.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Big, brash and boring","Kick-Ass. The Dark Knight. Avatar. Sherlock Holmes. These multi-million Hollywood behemoths have recently proved that blockbusters are perhaps no longer the mindless orgy of explosions and crap acting that we had previously expected. Clash of the Titans is directed by Louis Leterrier and having recently worked on the Hulk reboot in 2008 I had decently high hopes for his latest effort. Unfortunately, Clash of the Titans is, whilst great to look at, pretty darn rubbish.Good old swashbuckling Greek myth adventure films of the past always had likable and entertaining stories to make up for their laughable special effects. This remake on the other hand has a ridiculous and stupid storyline that is easily summed up by the film's set-up. Basically, Perseus (Sam Worthington) is annoyed with Zeus (Liam Neeson) because the God punished a mortal king (Jason Flemyng) by posing as him and getting busy with his wife. The humans of Argos are fed up with the Gods and their treatment of mortals and decide to start rebelling. For some unknown reason, the God are a bit weedy and so need to call upon Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and his pet Kraken to help defeat the human uprising. From here on it's the basic and boring hero's tale in which the god awful (pun not intended) Sam Worthington fights some monsters, gets with a sexy lady (Gemma Arterton) and saves the day. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.OK, maybe the lacklustre plot is sparked into life by some good acting? It isn't.As already mentioned, Sam Worthington is as bad as he was in Avatar and in Terminator Salvation. Gemma Arterton looks nice but does little else and Liam Neeson looks as bored as he did in The Phantom Menace. Ralph Fiennes gives the best performance of the lot but don't expect any Oscar nominations for this bunch (perhaps a few Razzies though).As I said at the start, Clash of the Titans does look quite spectacular. The special effects are top of the tier and the battle scenes are quite impressive. However, put te 3D glasses on and it's a different story. It was clearly tacked on rather than carefully constructed like in Avatar and it clearly shows. The 3D scenes have a blurry, bleeding look, like a busy watercolor. If you want to know what's happening, flat may be a better bet. In other scenes, actors seem to pop out against flat backgrounds like figures in a children's pop-up book.I came out of the cinema disappointed. The film had a decent cast, a proved blockbuster director, a good opportunity to expand on a much loved story and it just does not work. The acting is generally poor, the story is a joke and the 3D is terrible. In 2D this is a standard and uninteresting CGI-filled blockbuster which is leagues behind the top tier examples of the other Hollywood blockbusters of the past few years. It's big, brash and boring.1/5",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Zeus would not be impressed,"This year's allotted position of 'Easter blockbuster' is covered by the simplistic visual grandeur that is Clash of the Titans, a modern-day remake of the 1981 film of the same name. Perseus, the demi-god and bastard son of Zeus embarks on a journey to thwart the Gods of Olympus and save the population of Ancient Greece from utter destruction at the hands (and tentacles) of Hades and his pet Kraken. Unlike the original, which was founded on Perseus' love for Andromeda, this version is far heavier on action and effects, inarguably sacrificing any sense of a decent script and character development in the process.Let it be known that I will drastically limit, from this point onwards, any comparisons between the original and the remake. Rather, I would prefer to look at this as a stand-alone film. Just as irrelevant is the fact that this film isn't exactly a history lesson when it comes to the ins- and-outs of Greek mythology. For starters, I wasn't expecting utter adherence to the stories of my childhood anyway, but this has to be critiqued as if it were the first story of its kind so as to focus wholly upon the viewing experience only.Prior expectations always form a significant part of any review, and I expected nothing more or less than exactly that which was presented to me. Excluding a decent opening scene that gives a neat synopsis of Perseus, the Gods, and their respective roles in the context of the plot, further insight into the motives and nature of any character is non-existent.A cheesy script containing all the elements of an appeal-to-the-masses-cash-cow undertaking compounds this negative effect. Lines such as 'This is just the beginning', 'Someone's got to make a stand' and 'Only you can save them' form just a small part of the generic script, which seems to have been taken from most other blockbusters of the last five years and loosely tailored to suit Titans, failing to fool, convince or impress the rest of us.These throwaway phrases are used to fill the gaps between one action scene and another, and the film feels needlessly rushed in this respect. Furthermore, it is proof that Titans makes no effort to inspire any feelings of audience sympathy, interest or hatred of any character, simply because they all play stock roles at a most basic level. Of course, the trade-off is that the on- screen monsters look genuinely threatening instead of the now-laughable plastic toys that 'terrorised' Argos some thirty years earlier. Having said that, there is no reason why Leterrier couldn't have implemented both a satisfactory script and boggling visuals to appease those of us in the critical community.Pacing becomes an even greater issue during the final battle between Perseus and the Kraken. It ends in both a predictable and abrupt manner, and the closing scene wraps everything up in what can only be described as a cliché ending that can unfortunately be found in most films of this nature today.Aside from the aforementioned problems that can be located using some sort of academic process, Titans suffers from continuity issues and anachronisms that are evident to even to most infrequent viewer. Perseus' mother transitions from having brown to blonde hair in two different instances, and I'm pretty sure lipstick didn't exist in Ancient Greece either. Most disappointing is the issue that Perseus, simply, does not sound Greek. Worthington makes no effort to lose his recognisably Australian accent, while Zeus and Apollo sound more like Braveheart extras than Gods. Master director and walking film guide Quentin Tarantino once said: 'the best directors don't adapt. They steal.' QT's statement does not ring true for Titans, which blatantly exploits plot and basic character models found in Avatar, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings.In closing, one shouldn't expect much more from this film than a brain-dead, popcorn- actioner. Despite this, I refuse to apply the term 'switch-off-your-brain-entertainment.' I feel the statement, by its very nature, is a cop-out used by critics to justify senseless action and overall lack of detail or effort taken in the production process. The CGI is, as always, to be praised and marvelled at, but this tale of mythology is no masterpiece.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The screwed this one up big time!,"This movie it terrible! Yes, the effects are better then those in the original film, but that is the ONLY thing that is better. And I thought some of the effects were still pretty bad (particularly some of the stuff with the scorpions). The original story, the one in the original movie I mean, was very good it was dated but rather then just updating it, they changed almost everything. Sam Worthington really didn't seem right as Perseus he seemed more like a Marine who somehow wound up in ancient times. And I hated that Perseus knew he was the son of Zeus all along like he was the freakin' chosen one or something. And enough with the reluctant whinny hero. I liked it better when he was just a common guy (as far as he knew) who had to become extraordinary to save the woman he loved. The Gods are boring, and their shinny armor looks cheesy. I thought the Medusa part was actually pretty cool, but that was about all I liked. I didn't like that they took Calibos who, in the original film was the son of a lesser god who felt wronged by Perseus because he was once Andromeda's suitor, and they made him a two dimensional creature that just wants vengeance. And what is the deal with Hades giving him powers? Lame. Perhaps the lamest addition were the glowing blue-eyed desert dwellers. Io was a stupid character. I did like the cameo by Bubo, the owl. Don't be fooled by the preview, which makes it look pretty good... don't wast your money on this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sorry but this 2010 version lacks character,"I do not know what is worse about this new Clash of Titans, the laziness in them not studying Greek mythology, or the laziness in keeping things relevant to the time period or mythos. Actually I know exactly what it is, it's the absolute waste of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, whose talents and characters was the only shining light in a dark movie of shallow characters, shoddy CGI and light speed pacing.It seems that people have forgotten the Greek mythology whose influence has made many a movie and tale as lovable as the original Clash of The Titans. Call me a nerd for being a tad too much into this but my annoyance started when the movie begins with a conveniently hacked up and incorrect story version of the Gods' win over the Titans to rule earth. I do understand the abstract nature of this movie and the reality that this particular Perseus (Sam Worthington) was not the one of the ancient poems. But something about the matter-of-fact nature of the narration rubbed me the wrong way.The armor and clothing is dark or black, there are no colors. The people or relevant armor that rang true of ancient Greece is not here. What we get instead is the X-Men treatment, black on everything and a mixture of armor and architecture of cultures that come about hundreds of years after the time of the Gods. Maybe Zeus wished in some steel from medieval Europe and haircuts from the modern day Armed Forces? He is all-powerful after-all, let's say he did, just so I can shut up about it.Aww screw it, I can't ignore these things! Seeing Zeus (Liam Neeson) walk away from his throne in a type of mock plate mail armor, reminded me of his role as Gawain in Excalibur. Why was he dressed like a medieval knight in a movie about ancient Greece I wondered? This is not to say that the other Gods were much better off either, Apollo in golden standard was also in a form of scale mail and so was Poseidon (Danny Huston) who is replaced in relevance with the new owner of the Kraken, Hades (Ralph Fiennes). How does this make sense that an obvious water creature is owned by the king of the Underworld? Who cares right!?Perseus, again in ancient Greece sporting a buzz cut reminiscent of a Marine or a Roman Legionnaire was only second in lack of relevance to him actually being played by Sam Worthington. Sorry folks, Jake Sully did not show up to play this time. Gone is the likable kid from the original who grows in front of our eyes from a boy gifted by the gods to champion them, into a man who is bold and clever enough to take on the gorgon Medusa and topple the champion of Poseidon. No we get a Perseus who is simply not in the right time period, mindset or character to either be believable or formidable. When Io (Gemma Arterton) basically takes his hand and teaches him how to kill Medusa (Natalia Vodionova) it summed his character up very well. This is not the brave Perseus of the original, not by a long shot.Ralph Fiennes as the bent and ultra dark Hades was a great character, his low, gritty voice and dramatic entrances made him extremely scary. The satyr-like Calibos (Jason Fleming) who chased Perseus and made his life hell in the original is reinvented in this as a jilted lover, whose body has been turned into some sort of demon, albeit not a satyr. Io is the replacement for the lovely goddess Athena, whose wit and metallic owl of the original were mainstays in our memory of its charm. Io is beautiful but she is no Athena, and thanks to the pacing which made this 2 hour movie seem like 30 minutes, you get no true feeling of familiarity with her or the other beauty in the movie, the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos).I really wanted Clash of The Titans to be great, and based on the high votes I see on the web, it's apparent that super fast pacing and lack of character development is positive right now. Maybe I am too old school and like to learn the personalities, histories etc. of my heroes but what can I say? For me the inaccuracies, pacing and shallow nature of this 2010 Clash of The Titans makes for a bad movie – which by the way is another to take full advantage of the 3D fad going on since Avatar. This makes me wonder about Sam Worthington and his range, or lack thereof, and why Liam Neeson thought that it was a good movie to be a part of. The trailers had me salivating, especially at the Kraken, yet upon seeing it at the end, I was already done with the movie.Of all the characters and wasted talent, I must say that chief soldier Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) was my favorite. His portrayal of a grizzled, old wartime soldier was well done. Despite the pacing issues, we got enough of his character and history to go from hating him to respecting, then finally liking him.If you own the original Clash of The Titans and you bemoan the campy, cheesy humor or the extremely dated special effects. You will find yourself forgetting its faults in lieu of its character; because for all the 3D effects, expensive CGI and acting talent, this 2010 version lacks character and I am sorry but no amount of 3D debris flying in my face can make that a good movie for me.SpicyMovieDogs.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Instantly Forgotten,"This film is not good or bad. It does not have any of the spark of a b- movie nor does it have any of the action drama of an A movie. It is honk stuck in the middle. Fine, blandly edited/shot performances of fine actors saying fine expectable lines. A cute girl who should have been used more I think. A hunky hero with not much to say passed the occasional grunt and screaming ""NEVERRRRR"" every so often and that should do. Some passable but below par and overall unbelievable CGI. The kind of CGI that makes you wonder if you are ever going to see old school special effects again. The kind of CGI that makes you think that nothing moves like that in reality and really these people are just standing around on a set pretending to look astounded. It just makes it seem a little foolish. Not epic regaurdless of the theme, not enough GOOD action for action, no humour at all, no romance, no friendships although they tried to fake one up it just didn't stick or was lost on the editing floor.

What a mess of a film.,"Lets all be honest, the original ""Clash of the Titans"" was far from a perfect or classic movie but it at least still offered some good entertainment, of a more old fashioned sort. This modern 'update' and remake of the 1981 movie is one huge mess to watch and only entertaining to watch, in some parts.This is truly one bad constructed movie. The way scenes follow each other...it's all just so incredibly messy and feels totally disjointed. The movie truly never gets to flow well. There seems to be no interest for the story or any development at all and the 'story' is just being used as an excuse to throw in as many different action scenes as possible. Even the most shallow movie goers won't be fooled by this and will be annoyed by it instead, just like basically everybody else will.I at least expected to be entertained by the movie its action and visuals but because nothing else about this movie really worked out, mostly because they simply didn't even bothered with it, all of its action also fell kind of flat. It occasionally gets a spectacular movie to watch but because you never feel involved with any of its characters and aren't taken by its story at all, since you'll basically have no idea what it is all about, you also don't ever feel any involvement or excitement for any of its action moments. Things just simply and very randomly happen, without making you care for any of it.Now I admit that this all gets slightly better, as the movie heads toward its end but only just slightly! Still enough for me to give it an extra point but not enough to rate this movie as a good or entertaining enough one.The moment when the movie started to get better for me, was when they entered Medusa's temple. I thought that scene was great and probably the highlight of the movie. The movie never peaked again after that but it was enough to keep me interested and it kept me watching, till the end.There is no denying that this is also a good movie to look at, visually. It's obvious a whole lot of money got put into this movie, which makes still still look like a somewhat decent blockbuster. If only there was a better flow to the movie and its story, this might had been a good enough movie still but I now just can't recommend it at all to you.The special effects are all pretty good but still, it also gives the movie a fake and unreal look, which also makes it hard to ever feel involved with any of the events happening in this movie.I think that Sam Worthington is not half as bad as some people are trying to make you believe he is. He simply is a good and charismatic enough leading man, for any type of any type of action movie, this one included. But it's not like any of the actors get to do anything good in this movie. Even Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, who are also in this movie, get very little to do.Too big of a mess to recommend this movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It could have been better.,"The technology nowadays have brought a lot of things into almost real. Story lines have been very predictable that the excitement to the story is gone. The challenge is balancing technology and storytelling making the audiences nowadays feel that they are seeing a classic literary work. Acting should have blended to the story having the real human element on humans and understanding hows gods (good/evil) think. Sam Worthington was like Marcus Wright or Jake Sully in the movie even his hair was still the same. There was much less dialog, more of one liners that people are waiting to hear. I felt that there was less meticulous preparation in order to make the film better than before. It is one thing to keep in mind that there some audiences who saw the first film and cannot avoid to compare.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Special effects alone don't make a good movie,"There is one scene in this movie that says it all: Perseus finds the annoying tin owl from the 1981 picture in a box of junk. He takes it in his hand, looks at it, and throws it back in the box while saying something like ""We don't need this."" Here, this production shows nothing but disdain towards the brilliant original production. This pretty much sums up what you have to expect from this ""Clash of the Titans"".State of the art CGI stuff, but otherwise annoying and shallow characters that fulfill all the clichés you could possible think of. Good vs. evil at its simplest. The plot drags on without much suspension. This movie is once again proof, that fancy special effects alone don't make a good movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What an Awful Movie and a huge waste of talent!,"OK, let me put it like this, on a scale of 1-10.Atmosphere 6 Acting 5 Story 2 Direction 3 Characters 2 Music 2I did actually sleep in the middle of the movie. The crowd actually booed at the end. It is not a Greek thing, I mean Troy was loosely based on Homer's actual text, but it was a strong movie. This one, is a joke!The acting? Non existent, fake, the dialogs cheesy, great actors had nothing to say and no screen time.The music? Do not expect to listen anything from the trailer, the music is boooring, no theme or anything like that. An orchestra playing something like ""va va vooom, voom vava voom"". The story? Hahaha the story was, how can I say it... Well let me say, it had great potential... But... It was a joke!Omg, I got no good things to say about this movie simply put IT WAS Awful!This is one movie that could actually be submitted as Mystery Science Theater episode!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perseus and the Olympians (Screen),"This one didn't steal the lightning but didn't invent fire as well.Actually there's a renewal of Hellenic thematic but except ""300"", the movies failed.I saw this one on 3D but it enhances nothing because it just darkens the colors. The production design was disappointing because Olympus and the Gods look like they arrived from the set of ""Excalibur"" and the Greek civilization was depicted rather tidy and not luminous.The adventure was boring, uninspired, a faraway reminiscence of Conan adventures.The only good things here are the character of Io (the babe from ""Quantum of Solace"") and for a french audience the appearance of (a slim thus unrecognizable) Mouloud!

the best Clash of the titans,I thought this was the best one. The newest one is so much better than the old one.. I totally recommend people seeing this one. I loved the angel the one that keeps an eye on his life. I thought it would be very scary but it wasn't as scary as i thought it would be. I though the princess and queen were so pretty.. I am totally recommending this movie to my friends and family to go see.. I am really interested in seeing it on video to see how the costumes where maid and to see how they did the special effects. I loved Sam Worthington in this movie as i did in Avatar.. Avatar was the best movie and so was this one.. i Think this is the best movie since Avatar and the Matrix.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great effects but wait for to rent.,"Being a fan of the original movie I was thrilled to see the trailer on TV and went to see it with my father the next day it was in theaters.The effects were wonderfully done, especially Pegasus. I didn't like the horse being black though. I know now a days black is the new heroic white but growing up I always remember seeing the white horse swoop down to take his drink and that ruined it for me.Also the downside was, that they really changed too much from the original. Things were taken out that I often cherished in the original like how Calubus put a curse on Agost and the Princess. The two headed dog, and the Vulture chase.When Bubo the owl had a cameo in the 2010 movie. I was also sadden he was not used in the movie. The movie ended as they are thinking of making a sequel but I don't think I will rush to the movies to see it.I recommend this movie for people that have not seen the 1981 original. It has great effects and a fun movie on those terms but for die hard fans it might be better to rent this later..",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
First modern movie foray into Greek mythology offers little,"A good special-effects era mythology movie is bound to happen at some point, but we're definitely still waiting. ""Clash of the Titans"" is merely a modern incarnation of the original that in the age of CGI monsters and impressive fight sequences plops lazily in the category of status quo, something its 1981 cult predecessor was anything but thanks to the groundbreaking stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen.That's where my comparison of these films nearly 30 years apart starts and ends. 2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" has enough faults of its own. It serves up the meat and potatoes we come to expect of any action film, especially in a post-""300"" world of modern swords-and- sandals epics, but there's a definite lack of gravy. No surprises, no unique features -- even star Sam Worthington as the hero Perseus comes off dusty after the true ""titan"" that ""Avatar"" was.The myth of the Greek hero/demi-god Perseus, though butchered completely in this movie, is still essentially the quest to retrieve the head of Medusa. In ""Titans,"" Perseus finds himself in the troubled city of Argos after his adoptive family is killed by Hades, who has uncharacteristically left his domain in the Underworld because humans have begun acting out in defiance of the gods. Hades gets the gods of Mt. Olympus to agree to unleash his Kracken, the beast who defeated the titans long ago, on Argos if they don't sacrifice their princess, Andromeda, in reverence of the gods.Angry at the gods himself, (and already embittered by the opinions of his father who not- so-subtly suggests ""someone, someday will take a stand""), Perseus is slightly unhappy to learn he almost is one. He agrees to consult the Fates and learn what he can do to defeat this fearsome beast, but he wants to do it on his terms -- as man, not as a god.Twisting mythology is small stuff, however, on the list of the script's flaws. It's a typical hero's journey story told almost entirely by dialogue. Not narration, but using dialogue to move the scenes rather than let images and events speak for themselves. It's horribly amateur and as a result the lines are all throwaway. The script speaks of grand themes such as humanity vs. godliness which don't work when you don't care for the humans because the beginning is scraped together and told in this talk-heavy way.Impressed by the action work on ""The Incredible Hulk,"" I had reasonably high expectations for director Louis Leterrier, but the action scenes are aimless and ill-conceived. I once again fault the trio of inexperienced and low-quality writers, however, because they gave these scenes no shape and which prodded Leterrier toward milking them for whatever they did have, using too many slow-mo shots and the like. He does some great flying camera takes and the Medusa scene turned out fairly exciting -- even though the gorgon was kinda awkwardly sexy, which you can interpret however you like.The art direction renders mixed results. Medusa's lair was well-conceived and I did like the vision of Charon the Styx ferryman, but the weird shiny armor of the gods was corny and the horrific makeup used to disfigure venerable actors Neeson as Zeus and Fiennes as the oddly asthmatic Hades was below true blockbuster quality. The cgi effects were pretty good, particularly Hades turning into puffs of smoke and such.Finally -- and no spoilers here -- yes, the Kracken is released, just in case you didn't catch Neeson saying that in every TV spot. Why Warner Bros. wanted to release the Kracken in ads and completely spoil the biggest reveal/tool to shock the audience the movie has is a question is beyond me and says a lot about their confidence in this generic adventure film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

How to train your Kraken,"Toothless is lucky that he did not decide to attack Argos, or he might have been turned into stone in addition to being misunderstood.As for the mythology, just forget anything you may have earlier read--you are probably better off if you have never read anything about the ancient myths. And probably better off if you have not seen the eighties film.The ancient ""politics"" behind this film were muddled. It first seemed like man vs. gods. And then it seemed like Zeus vs. Hades. And then there was Perseus, who was a demigod and seemed rather confused. But probably no more confused than his father Zeus, who eventually ordered Hades to ""Release the Kraken."" And why did they have to wait until the eclipse? Why not instant revenge on the mortals? Why was Zeus still speaking to Hades? Didn't Zeus know what Hades was doing? And if the Kraken was kept under the sea, what became of Poseidon? Maybe the god of the sea was lost in a budget-cut. Or maybe his part was given to Ralph Fiennes. And the Kraken gets released, and then gets marble-ized within a minute of emerging from the deep. Not much suspense there.The hunting of Medusa is an example of bigger not really being better. In the eighties film, you had a sense of space--the arrangement of the pillars in Medusa's residence. Here, Medusa had moved to a place in the country--on the other side of the River Styx, and why? Who would need to be turned into stone after they were already dead? Would Medusa find much fun in killing boatloads of already dead tourists? Her lair was just a confusing craggy locale with a pit of fire somewhere inside. You had no idea where anyone was.The gods seemed to be British (Liam and Ralph), and the bastard demigod son was Australian. Hmmm . . . And the not-very-comic relief sounded vaguely Russian. Was a statement being made? And Pegasus was black. But apparently had a lot of white girlfriends. And Perseus could just hop right on Pegasus at will whenever necessary, like hailing a taxi. And if there were all those other winged horses, why didn't Perseus and his buds just saddle up, rather than having to travel by scorpion?There was no real way to care much for any of these characters. I didn't hate the film (I didn't see it in 3-D) because it's not that awful. It's just not very good.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Trailer is beyond exciting.,"Several parents at my son's school have decided to sponsor an after-prom trip for our sons and daughters to see this movie as a group. I'm really looking forward to comparing this version to the original version. The original is still a classic and one of the most recognized lines ""release the kraken has now resurfaced as a playful reminder that something big and strong lays deep within to be released should you not listen to the rules within the family. All of the scenes of lore are ready for a new generation of creative minds. It makes me happy to be able to share certain phrases and moments from the original and not have my kids looking at me saying what is a ""kracken""?This movie is the ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. The theme involves saving the family, understanding, facing and combating superhuman fears. The journey and sub journeys are captivating and brilliantly put together. I am constantly teaching, training and coaching my family and peers about the dangers of peer pressure and I reference old text, wise men, Aesop's fables and clash of the titans as the final word.

And where are the titans?,"Not a very positive attitude to Louis Leterrier. In all his paintings, Awesome desire to cut the money simply striking. Although he began well. His ""Transporter 2"" was a good fighter. Then Louis switched to comics and took ""Incredible Hulk"", which, unfortunately, I dislike. Why dislike? Because the film does not pull on comics, he was dull, gloomy, and one-time, but for the cast to improve cost estimation and forget about the plot and stuff. And now the ""Clash of the Titans, a film about the war gods and men, well, of course, in 3D. The cast of the first magnitude. Here and Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Danny Huston. The very idea is good and the actors too, but why should not I like? Let me explain.The first forty minutes, I liked it, plenty of action, special effects, etc. But then it is so annoying, one action, it's just get bored. Actors themselves sometimes overplayed. Everything is their beautiful camera angles, nice scenery and, of course, 3D. Louis Leterrier planned to make a blockbuster, but not even thought about the plot. The film only lasts for actors and annoying special effects, well unless we have not seen enough? And why such a pathetic name? By title, I thought that the gods would fight with each other, but I got endless trip to the crabs for a horizontal mountains and deserts. And in general, popular actors themselves say something just a couple of phrases in the movie and all, well, then disappear and finally say something pathetic. If even shoot a blockbuster about the gods, we must just think about the story, so everything was like in history, not to push any crabs in 3D. Even for the sake of the actors do not want to overstate the estimate. The film boring, insipid. But what can I say, a movie with absolutely no soul. The fact that he filmed for the money, it is evident, Jonathan Libesmen lift a decent sequel, his films with a soul, he knows how to make blockbusters and at the same time he thinks about the plot, and not dully shoves 3D and the cast of the first magnitude.

I don't want to offend anyone who took part in the making but I'd like to know that what audience is this made for? It's too violent for kids and has nothing to say to adults. Next time watch the original before making a remake and build on it's values. Modern filmmakers really have to learn that CGI orgy has nothing to do with quality. It's like writing a book based on the words length and how they sound. I have the feeling that the script was written in two hours during a hangover by a twelve year old. Am I getting old?

Sam Worthington is a complete zero face, there's just nothing interesting to be detected in his facial features... And then: What's with the Kraken? It's not supposed to look like the alien beast from ""Cloverfield""... But to top it all off, this movie really boasted the dullest writing in 2010.

Linear and nothing special,"Okay so this is a movie about Greek mythology and a very shallow and narrow one at that. To put it simply this movie pretty much sucks, there is almost nothing special about this movie and almost nothing stands out. The plot is very narrow and simple, sort of like going from point A to point B but there is nothing really imaginative or creative or even entertaining about it. The actor Sam Worthington came out of nowhere and was in ""Terminator Salvation"", ""Avatar"" and now this. And I guess Hollywood is trying to sell him off as the next big thing but he just plays a boring and generic character in everything I saw in him so far, which is few but still. If this was a video game cut-scene it might be somewhat forgivable but it's not. In fact watching the video game ""God of War"" is more entertaining than this. The CGI is alright but nothing all that special and same elements has been done before and can get kinda crappy sometimes for a movie that was released in 2010. The movie is about a half human half god guy named Perseus(Same Worthington) rising up against the gods. Liam Neeson looks the part and fits Zeus very well but his character is easily manipulated. The gods in this movie just seem pretty weak mentally and there powers seem far from being omnipotent. But some parts in the Greek mythology is like this but it gets sort of awkward in a negative way because the gods in this seem too human sometimes. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades who is sort of the opposite of Zeus in some ways. Which is interesting because the last time these two actors played opposites in the same movie was in ""Schindler's List"". One aspect I liked about this movie though personally is how it shows how arrogance can lead to downfall including when it comes to the mortals. I also find it interesting how Luke Evans who plays Apollo in this will play Zeus in ""Immortals"". For marketing reason this film goes 3D as well at last minute and the outcome isn't very good. I haven't seen the original but I have a feeling that it must be better than this. The man build up is for the Kraken and even that was disappointing, it's very short and it's nowhere close to a epic fight. Hollywood does a good job of making the trailers way more epic than the movie itself and that applies this.3.6/10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sadly, there is little else for this film to fall back on. Some gorgeous thespians, perhaps. That's it.

A Missed Opportunity.,"Found in a coffin with his dead mother as a child, Perseus is raised by a fisherman. Persues lives a quiet and normal life despite wanting to know where he came from. As mortals begin to rebel against the Gods, the Gods lash back by having Hades do his thing, which includes releasing the Kraken, unless the people sacrifice the princess Andromeda. Persues joins a small crew of men to go and stop this madness.I love Greek mythology, I find it so interesting and when I watched the original Clash of the Titans when I was a child, the most memorable scene was Medusa's lair. Hearing about the remake made me excited, but it seems the filmmakers went the old generic Hollywood route and went for senseless action and and the cash grab that is 3-D. I don't remember everything about the original, but I do know that it is more entertaining then this forgettable swords and sandals 'epic'. I use the word epic loosely because the film does not feel as big as it's story. I don't know if Lord of the Rings has spoiled my ""people on a quest adventure"" but this film doesn't hold up to what it should be and it feels like a miss opportunity.The biggest problem is the film lacks any kind of heart. I felt nothing for the forgettable characters, I can't even remember their names. The conflict didn't feel like it was raised to the right stake for me to care about what happens. There is no time spent with the Princess, why do I care if she gets sacrificed. I felt nothing for Perseus and his family, or his so called love interest. Which feels fake and tacked on to appeal to the females in the audience.Worthington has literally exploded onto the big screen from nowhere. His acting chops haven't been tested yet and this film does nothing to try and provoke some kind of emotion from it's lead character. He screams and jumps from place to place and cries about wanting to defeat people as a man and nothing more. What should I have expected though right? Well, for one thing I was hoping to like all the Gods. Yet they managed to screw that up to. The Gods are hardly in it. My favourite God Poseidon stands in the background and has one line. I should be thankful he got that much because every other god just stand around in the background and serve no purpose.The two main Gods that get the spotlight are Zeus and Hades. Played by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Neeson does nothing, he just stands around and yells the famous trailer line ""Release the Kraken"". Fiennes does a good job and stands out, but at the same time he is simply playing Lord Voldemort and the connection is obvious.What the film does offer is what most people going to see it want. Action. The special effects work and the action sequences are entertaining. The Medusa scene is nowhere near as memorable as the original and doesn't feel as important and the Kraken sequence, while spectacular is over far too soon. It's all about him getting out of the water, that's it. I was expecting Jack Sparrow to be stuck in his teeth.In the end this film is sloppy and had problem from the script to the last edit. It's clunky and has no heart, the special effects and action sequences are entertaining, but not enough for one to invest their time into. Looking back on this film, there is not one moment that jumps out at me as impressive or note-worthy. More mythology, more character development and more story driven aspects would have helped the film immensely. Instead we get this Hollywood Blockbuster that fuels the fire of what a lot of people dislike.Oh and I saw it in 2-D.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"With $493m in box office takings, Cash of the Titans might be a more appropriate title.","Based on the 1981 film of the same name, Clash of the Titans is a big budget CGI-fest that aims to dazzle the senses with it's busy action sequences and sprawling scopes. With a heavyweight cast and a dizzying $125m budget, director Louis Letterier has created what is essentially a rushed looking collection of overblown set pieces assembled around chunks of dull exposition. This is the story of demigod Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, and his quest to fight as a man, for man against the vengeful Gods of Olympus who are royally 'cheesed off' because some soldiers took it upon themselves to knock down a big statue of Zeus – Liam Neeson no less. So, fresh from the 'underworld', up pops big bad God Hades (Ralph Fiennes), embracing his inner Voldermort, to teach mankind a lesson. Frankly, why Zeus would ever set a God with blatant mental health issues loose on a species he claims to love is never fleshed out, but then again, this isn't a film that invests much time fleshing much of anything out. Instead, it's far more concerned with getting some of that $125m budget and shoving it in your face. And so it does. Along the ahem, 'epic' quest (presented via a series of sweeping CG exteriors), we encounter all manner of CG behemoths, none of which are animated with any convincing real world heft. The Medusa part of the story, the chapter i always found to be the most riveting and frightening as a child, sacrifices any genuine creepiness by being a noisy and action heavy overload of computer generated disappointment, which all but sums up the film. Sam Worthington fails to inject any personality into Perseus, Gemma Arterton looks pale faced and pretty while Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes most likely pick up a decent payday in exchange for a bit of hammy overdoing it. When the inevitable conclusion finally comes, it's a welcome relief. With it's swordplay and excitable action, the film may function satisfactorily for an early teen audience, but for most it's sorely lacking in many areas, most crucially character and script. Despite much derision aimed at it's eleventh hour retro-fitted 3D release, the film turned over an almighty $493.2m in global box office although if you've seen the spoiler heavy trailer first, you've pretty much seen the whole thing.

It also over explained everything with elongated scenes that were in dire need of a trim.COTT went the other way, jumping from plot point to plot point, occasionally filling in certain gaps with Gemma Arteton giving them all a bedtime story for a few minutes. A film that seemingly could have run for over 2 hours with the plot points it needed to hit ran for less than an hour 50... and in fact I'm glad it was so short because there seemed nothing in this film that blew me away.

They didn't do a good job making it 3d and it does no credit at all to the movie. Before I went to the movie I checked IMDb and saw that it had an overall rating of 6 out of 10. So I didn't have high hopes, but I really enjoyed the movie. Maybe it was because during intermission I sat on my 3D glasses costing me 25 euro's + not seeing the last half in 3D.Okay, the movie has it's weak points and it is by no means a classic. But it was a really enjoyable mythological movie. Definitely worth seeing again in HD.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining bad film,"Clash of the titans is a free adaptation of the myth of Perseus, which in the better case won't get you bored but not much more. The story is a mixture of Greek myths connected by a very weak plot and not much better acting and special effects. It is a remake of the homonym film made in 1981.It tells the journey of Perseus in order to find a way to stop the kraken that gods have summoned to destroy the city of Argos and save the princess Andromeda who has been offered as a sacrifice.The best of the film is the presence of Ralph Fiennes in the role of Hades, the worst, everything else.

A Big Disappointment,"Clash of the Titans 3D Date Rated: Apr 5, 2010 | Rel. Date: Apr 2, 2010 I have always been a fan of this genre and in particularly of Clash of the Titans. As a Child I remember watching this movie over and over and each time enjoying it as if it was the first time I had seen it. That is why I was very excited when I heard it was going to be re-made, and although did expect that it would change to make it more relevant to modern times and to appeal to more sophisticated viewers I was not expecting it to change so drastically. This move should not even have this title because it misleads viewers to think it has anything to do with the original, it was so different that it was unrecognizable. Other than keeping the names of the Charraters which they had to for reference nothing is as it should have been. this film does not even maintain the historical references from the original mythical legends. I was completely let down if you are fan of the original skip this trash and go watch the original I guarantee you will enjoy it better.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another fun greek adventure.,"It's over a decade since I watched this movie. I have never watched the original and am not really a master of greek mythology so I can't say how faithful it is to the original movie or the greek mythology. Though I do know that Perseus used Medusas head to kill Cetus and not the Kraken who doesn't exists in greek mythology. The Kraken looks pretty damn cool though. Too bad it had this huge ""built up"" in the movie only to appear for like 2 minutes. A full third act with the Kraken would have been much better.Also mentioning Medusa, she once again is damn hot. Lol 2nd time I mentioned that in a review of a movie with Medusa in it. I do find it weird that Medusa gets called a Titan in the movie though despite Io telling her story in a time she was just a human. Also I do find it questionable that the Kraken was responisble for the downfall of the titans in the great war since it basically is just an large kaiju sized animal.The movie is still a fun adventure with a good cast and well done action scenes. Unlike Jason and the Argonaunts it also feels like a complete story.8/10 Kraken roars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uhmm... no.,"Let me start off by saying this movie SUCKS. It has to be the worst one of the year.First of all, It's story is terrible, I don't want to spoil anything for you but this movie is so bad that it doesn't even matter. So here it is: Humanity is revolting against the Greek gods, so the god of the underworld threatens to release the ""Kraken"" unless the humans kill a princess (I'm confused as well. This plot sucks.)So instead of killing the princess, they decide to go on a journey to prevent the kraken from coming. Sounds epic, but too bad it's horribly executed. The action starts off with the God of the underworld sending his personal fighter (How cliché) out to kill the group of adventurers. He fails, and it results into a fight against giant CG scorpions. Then the adventurers fight some Labyrinth of Pan creatures, and then they fight more stuff.... and then they fight some more, and then some more, and then finally, the best part of the movie... the credits roll.This movie is just a mindless fight to the next. That's it.This is basically God of War smashed carelessly into a movie. The only difference is that God of War is better in every way (did I mention it's a video game?)So do yourself a favor, save your money to see Robin Hood instead. You will thank me.I give this a 2/10 (and I'm pushing it).",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Release the CGI, because that's all there is!","Years ago, I took a mythology class. We went over in-depth the different gods, goddesses, and heroes. I have probably heard of all the Greek mythical tales, but not of Perseus. I was thinking this would be a treat, as I am a lover of mythology, but the negative reviews pushed me away from seeing it on the big screen. I found it online. I'll be honest, I'm glad I did not spend seven dollars or more to see it.This movie has run into the same issue as many Hollywood films do, effects over story. I should take it for a grain salt, since I had no idea what the myth is about, but even in the story itself, there were little plot holes that just made me chuckle. I won't bother even mentioning them, for I could write a several-paged essay on them.The other let down was the acting. Thoroughly impressed by Sam Worthington's role in Avatar, I thought he would be a good lead. But in this he was dry, uneventful, and even at a point of where he was supposed to express great emotion, I found myself laughing instead of being moved.The only actors who seemed to have fun with this movie were Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. Yet still, Neeson was dry and Fiennes, who pulls off an eerie, raspy voice is almost unintelligent in his dialog. On top of that, the 96 minute film also felt slow. But the one thing the filmmakers put their moneys worth, was in the effects. The ten-minute sequence involving the Kraken is shear brilliance, and so are the other creatures in the film. I will note that the encounter with Medusa was not as creepy as I later saw in the 1981 version of ""Clash of the Titans."" Yes to effects, no to substance. I was at least entertained for the time I devoted to this film, but memorable, not really.**/****",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrific special effects; rushed story and action; waste of money watching it in 3D.,"Don't watch it in 3D. Why? Well because there's nothing special about it. A few moments of pop-ups here and there but that's it. Not even the magnificent Kraken or the giant scorpions can save this. As a reminder, this film was shot in traditional 2D and was about to be released when all of a sudden a little movie called ""Avatar"" broke box-office records with its groundbreaking 3D effects. So in any studio head's mind, 3D = big bucks at the box office. So they decided to up-convert this movie into 3D for the masses. Big mistake.Why? Because it underwhelms the movie. Anyone expecting something remotely similar to ""Avatar"" or the recent ""Alice In Wonderland"" or ""How To Train Your Dragon"" will simply be disappointed. These three films were made with 3D technology, ""Clash"" simply wasn't. Therefore all you get is just depth of perspective, or dimensions behind certain objects and characters. That's it. The 3D version is a great disappointment.This review is mostly to warn people not to watch it in 3D. Now having said that I have to admit the movie itself was good, solid popcorn entertainment. Oscar guarantee may not be found here, save for the special effects, which are simply dazzling and terrific, and may just be the best thing about the movie that makes it worth seeing. The CGI is extremely well-rendered and well-amounted, delivering just the right amount without feeling extremely overused. Some notable scenes are the giant scorpion battle scenes and the final scene involving the Kraken. It (effects) is simply mesmerizing.The acting, while not reaching the heights of say, Pacino or Day-Lewis, is still adequate in my books. The larger-than-life San Worthington portrays the larger-than-life Perseus, a role that seems to suit Worthington well. Our boy Sam will definitely be in the Hollywood spotlight, and while this one is not that great compared to his efforts in ""Avatar"" and ""Terminator Salvation"", it is still Worthington that makes the movie as he has the most screen time than any other actor in the movie. The other actors are OK, with the exception of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, who chew the scenery when they're in it and they look like they're having a blast playing the two Gods.In technical aspects, Louis Leterrier's kinetic direction ups the film above it's choppy editing and action scenes, rushed story and unimaginative story outline. Yes I am aware it is a remake of a film, and like most remakes, this one is not that good as the original; it just have special effects. The characterization in the original is gone here, leaving only mostly two-dimensional characters trying to save the day in a limited two-hour time constraint. The editing does not help either, rushing from one character's fight to another's in about half a second. The action, while solid, concludes all too soon. And the music score by Ramin Djawadi is a little bit too modern for this sword and sandal fantasy. On a positive note the cinematography is sweeping and the costume and production design and value are top- notch, pulling you into the past and getting immersed in the setting.Despite some flaws, this new ""Clash of the Titans"" is not the great blockbuster many hope to be, mostly due to the great underwhelming 3D effects, but it is still grand, fine Hollywood entertainment at its finest. Watch it on the big screen in 2D, and enjoy this fine offering of CGI dessert after a year of Oscar nutrition.Overall rating: 6.5/10 (Above average)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It Does Have Some Cool Scorpions!,"All the joy I had in the hokey first film, disappeared as I watched this plodding, endless remake. There is no suspense, no justification, and the myth itself is pretty much ignored and changed around. There are characters that never existed. It seems that for twenty minutes they battle giant scorpions that later become their camels. The acting is dull. There is no human story. The Kraken is boring. We also have a brother fight between Zeus and Hades where Hades tricks his brother and the big Z has to go along with his wishes. All in all, by the time it was over there was no surprise, no tension, and no satisfaction. And what about Andromeda? Anyway, another time where Hollywood couldn't come up with anything new, so they decided to make this snorer.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The gods need us. They need our worship. What do we need of them?,"Clash of the Titans is directed by Louis Leterrier and collectively written by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi and Beverley Cross (1981 film version). It stars Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Flemyng, Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham and Gemma Arterton. Music is by Ramin Djawadi and cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr.Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the mortal son of Zeus (Neeson), who has to battle the hellish minions of the underworld to stop them from conquering the Earth and the heavens.There's a lot of fondness for the original 1981 version, which while understandable, and it features the considerable talents of effects maestro Ray Harryhausen, it is hardly a great picture anyway. So with that in mind it didn't seem such a bad idea to remake it with all the current advancements in special effects to hand. Then there is a pretty great roll call of actors filing in to star in it, while for fans of 3D that was also an option to potentially savour. How come, then? It ended up such a big dull dud?The blame for that falls at the door of the writers, who come up with an unadventurous story. Film's trajectory basically sees Worthington and his band of grumpy men set off to kill The Kraken, where they of course stop off a couple of times to slay some hellish nasties. It's all very muscular with slice and dice and shouting, but the trouble is is that this band of not very merry man just don't look or act the part, especially Worthington, who still looks like the grunt from Avatar. While dangling hair extensions on and applying make-up to the others doesn't make them underworld warriors, it's still Cunningham with a weird accent - Neeson in spangly costume - Flemyng being Flemyng - and Nicholas Hoult being in the wrong movie.The effects work is very hit and miss. Giant scorpions score well and provide one of the high action points, even if you will struggle to see who is actually being killed in the ensuing mêlée and the winged horse segments are beautifully done. But on the flip-side is the awful Medussa footage (Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova donning the snake wig) and the 3D moments just feel like tagged on gimmicks (oh wait, they are). Dialogue is often served with a helping of Brie, and come the finale you will wonder what exactly was the mission about in the first place? In fact was it ever made clear? I'm not sure, such was the waft of tepidness that cloaked my brain.It plays like a video game and is badly written, while costuming never once convinces. Were it not for some fun to be had with Fiennes as Hades and the slice and dice machismo, this would be a total write off and no sequel would follow... 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing but a adventure of CGI in abundance,"Another point is proved with this film. Hollywood has no more ideas for a decent film! So, let's remake some. And we pick good old ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981), the classic adventure film, with greatly adapted characters and story from Greek mythology. I mean, so many things about this old movie was good, I watched it as a kid, and I was blown away, especially by Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, his Medusa... scary... his Kraken... amazing... the music score was astonishing. But this remake... well here goes...Story is entirely different, well let's be blunt and short. The story, characters and special effects were modified for a today's audience, I mean, you can't argue with that fact. But, it also doesn't mean that is good. Now, This is extremely expensive film, and what is it exactly? An abundance of CGI, nothing more. The movie's runtime is an hour and 20 minutes... I expected something like... two and a half hours, but we just got a fast film that is filled with special effects, that's just it. No emotions, here's bunch of computer effects and they were good... but sucked. The CGI was sooo... artificial, and when I remember the stop-motion from old version... that was freaking real! It was there, simply it was there. But these... damn! Now, a star Sam Worthington, well he was not all that bad, but he constantly speaks in some low tones and, honestly he can do more than that, come on man, you're not Steven Seagal, free that voice of yours! Liam Neeson as Zeus? Well, pretty cool, if you ask me. But still, again in some father like role... Ralph Fiennes as Hades? Good, he was OK. But, when I heard that James Woods showed interest to play Hades in live action film... I thought... that would be a joke. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda... good, she was OK, haven't seen her in long time. Gemma Arterton as Io? Who's she? She was not needed. Waste of time character. Jason Flemyng as Calibos? He is a good actor, but I expected someone bigger and more menacing. This Calibos is nothing but a berserk monster, the original one was more scary and commanding... Mads Mikkelsen, Danny Houston and Luke Evans perhaps... well they were OK in their own terrain...Now, other things as costumes and music score, those were OK, perhaps two things that worth in this film. And Pete Postlehwaite, one of his last films, RIP Pete, he was one of the best.So, if you want, watch it. Don't listen to me. And one more thing, I won't deny that I enjoyed in adventure.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What were they thinking?,"This is so bad I'm angry about it, how they've managed to take a good story and ruin it is incredible. It's cheap rubbish going for a high profit margin based on popularity of the previous one. Special effects are reasonably good but without that the sheer lack of effort is appalling. The expectation is that this is a big budget movie but try counting the extras. They seem to only have been able to afford about 60 of them to run from one end of the shot to the other then change clothes and run back again. It also seems over edited where most plot was taken out to make way for monster battles (monster meaning large scary looking stuff, not huge) and yet the movie is 1&1/2 hours long. Imagine Legend of the seeker or xena warrior princess with better special effects. This is an awesome failure of a movie and could have been done so much better.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was Great!,"I loved the movie! I don't care what anyone else says, it was good. I've seen the original and loved it, too (even though it was pretty cheesy, but hey, it was made in the 80s). It wasn't quite like the original, or anything like the myth, really, but who cares? It's kind of like books-turned-movies. You can't compare them, or you won't enjoy the movie. The movie is separate from the myth and it's separate from the original. It was great. I didn't see it in 3D, because it hurts my eyes to watch movies like that, but I'm sure it was just as good. The only part that bothered me was Io's character. Perseus and Andromeda are supposed to fall in love! Haha :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There's more to filmmaking than a huge budget,"The remake has none of the heart of the original, the acting is passable at best and weak in many places. The director seems more intent on making a good looking film than a well designed film.The plot is fine in theory as it follows the original, but many scenes are horrendous compared to the original. For example the Medusa scene has no tension and she's made completely out of CGI which is very weird, the model in the 1981 film is a lot more frightening and builds tension better with the disconjointed movements, the CGI in this seems more out of The Mummy than a serious action film. Not to mention there was an infamous 3D gimmick surrounding this when it hit cinemas but that's a touch off point.3/10: Despite some half-decent action scenes it has no heart and is not a good remake.

Clash Of The Titans- 2010,"First of I would like to state that I have not seen the original in the 80's im a sixteen your old so I did not grow up with it, I found this movie one of the most entertaining films I have scene in 2010 so far and I watch a lot of movies, I've seen every big release so far this year of all genre's, (alice in wonderland, cop out, shutter island) and this is probably movie of the year for me right now, the CGI was amazing, the acting was decent (no Oscar winners), I don't understand why everyone is complaining about this remake. I will watch the original in the next few days and compare.I found this movie to move very quickly, and that's very rare for me, although with all that said I will be the first to admit they do focus a lot more on the CGI than the actual storyline for this film.Sam Worthington once again delivers the ""tough guy"" role in this film and it's very believable. This kids starting to look like another arnold or sly. For those of you who don't know who sam is he was the main character in Terminator Salvation and Avatar.All of the supporting roles were very well done, Casting was great. the directing was very good. overall the film was not in the least confusing.So if your looking to take the family out, or the girl/boyfriend to see this movie I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good time.I hope my review helped .",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mature and Classical Era Percy Jackson?,"Well, given the last few ""epic"" movies that have disappointed us more and more, I can't say I was expecting much from ""Clash of the Titans"". But I really did not expect yet another gross insult to Greek mythology.10 minutes into the movie, after the narrative and a few corny, over- the-top CGI shots of Olympus, I knew this movie was going to be bad, but against my better judgment I watched it until the end.First of, saying that the movie ""deviates"" from the original myth is a huge understatement. It is basically a collage of the most popular items in Greek mythology. Take one son of Zeus, add a huge powerful Kraken that has nothing to do with said son of Zeus, mix it up with a bit of Medusa (oh how fans love Medusa) and finally add some ""touching"" scenes of beautiful flying Pegasi and the classic Hollywood ""hero gets the girl"" and you have a mainstream high-budget crap-fest because ""Hey! Who cares? People are so ignorant they don't even have a clue who Perseus is. They just want epic battles"".The sad truth is that people actually fall for this crap. I'm not even going to bother to enumerate all the things wrong with the story, most literate people will know for themselves, the others... well they probably rated it 10 because they liked the shiny sword.The story would not have been SO bad if at least the acting and directing was worth ""the ferryman's bribe"". The only decent actor in the movie is Liam Neeson, but even he manages to make a mess of things. It might not be his fault, the dialogue is so sketchy that you'd actually think it's all improvised.To sum it all up, ""Clash of the Titans"" is the ""original bad copy"" of ""Percy Jackson"", more bloody, more action, more and more CGI.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Liam Neeson's and Ralph Fiennes' performances were great, as usual, while Perseus' character was a disappointment, leaving Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) as the coolest character.

Knowing what to expect...,"... and I've never been so bored. Already seeing the Harryhausen original I had low expectation for this remake (I didn't favour the original as much as Jason and the Argonauts) as you can't really replace the effects maestro himself with just bland CGI. Yes I understand we live in a digital age but they can at least make the monsters seem like characters (like Harryhausen did) and not just a computerised shiny thing to wow idiots with. And the 3D. Thankfully I saw this film in 2D and not 3D as many people have said how god-awful the 3D is. 3D is just a pointless fad in general and seeing Clash of the Titans in 2D saves you a lot of money...... but, in the end it's not the effects and 3D that makes a film, it's the story.As far as the story goes it's not really different to the original and so brings nothing new to the table. The characters are one-dimensional, and anyone with any knowledge of films such as King Kong or the Sinbad films, knows that whoever follows our hero around in the film is but a lamb to the slaughter. But the supporting cast was pointless! They had no depth, Mads Mikkelsen's character just seemed more like an arse, than a gruff, tough teacher with nothing remotely wise or helpful to say (except for slapping Sam Worthington around). The two guys -- I think they were warrior merchants -- who follow Perseus added nothing, except their presence. And there was zero chemistry between Worthington and Arterton's character Io (and I won't even mention the crap her character keeps talking about).Either way a lot of you will be saying I'm reading too much into a film such as this, well, maybe... but even for an action film, there's nothing there and it comes off as boring! When watching the action I felt bored, when watching the characters interact I felt bored, when magic and monsters were flying about the place I felt... well, you know where I'm going with this.In the end, at least with the original, it wasn't the best sure, but it was entertaining none-the-less.

good story is paramount,"Clash of the Titans goes to show the importance of a good story for a movie, even if it is a couple of thousands of years old. Of course, if you're awaiting an ancient Greek myth brought to screen you'd be disappointed.As far as i understood there has been a whole genre called sword-and-sandal or similar which were basically historical epics. I even remember seeing several of those as a child, at a time when The Lord of the Rings has been merely fantasy aficionado's literature. Although old, they have definitely offered stories different from my ordinary movies at a time, despite the outdated special effects.Given the strong story you might expect that contemporary CGI might help improve the viewers' experience, but you'd be just partially right. CGI is superb in Clash of the Titans, yet we've seen a whole bunch of it when the aforementioned The Lord of the Rings turned mainstream, thanks to Peter Jackson's adaptation. And all the mythical creatures are but a fraction of the fauna populating the worlds we've seen afterwards.Eventually, we've been left with a Hollywood blockbuster full of half-witted dialog and superior CGI.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Titans Did Not Clash,Saw this film last night in 3D. Well can you say 3D when the previous trailers actually had 3D unlike this film. You could in fact remove your glasses through the film and clearly see that some of the film was still in 2D. Often when effects were in 3D you could see jagged edges. Overall the film somewhat falls to impress having seen the trailers. The film takes roughly an hour or so to get going and then after two quite impressive fight/action scenes the movie ends.
