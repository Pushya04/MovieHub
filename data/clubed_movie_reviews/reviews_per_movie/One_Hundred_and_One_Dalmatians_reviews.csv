A new look,"A large part of Disney's triumph cannot be detected by the naked eye.  His last animated film had been `Sleeping Beauty', which was the most extravagant and spectacular animated film of all time (excluding `Fantasia').  It wasn't a financial success.  `101 Dalmatians', much less extravagant, was.  In the two years between `Sleeping Beauty' and its successor there had been a revolution.  The entire army of inkers who had carefully translated animators' pencil drawings into smooth, flowing lines were replaced by a machine that simply photocopied.  This changed the character of animation so much that `Dalmatians' is almost the precise opposite of `Beauty'.  Outlines are rough and black; the entire film looks decidedly drawn rather than painted, even the bits that are in fact painted; and the rich variety of colour of Disney's earlier films has been replaced with the stark white-with-black-spots coat of a dalmatian, with the occasional splash of startling red.  The art directors were as determined to get the most out of the new technology as they had been to get the most out of the old technology.And it has its own quiet extravagance.  A title promising over one hundred spotted dogs was (probably still is) the kind of thing liable to make animators feel faint.  It couldn't have been done without the photocopier; and even so, getting spots to stay in the right place on a featureless white background is a huge headache.  None of this leaps out an audience.  We simply see a hundred adorable dogs.The story is simple, clean, civilised, and warm.  It moves slowly but this doesn't matter.  Preventing the film from becoming lethargic is Cruella de Vil.  She can drive like a maniac through the snow, smoke a cigarette through a holder the length of a sword, wave her arms like a windmill ... yet she handles quiet determination and gritted teeth equally well. Character animation doesn't get any better than this.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely enjoyable,"One Hundred and One Dalmatians is a classic Disney film from the company's brilliant late 50's and early 60's period. The film has a number of Disney high points including fantastic supporting characters, great suspense and a heavy atmosphere. The film can be considered another excellent feature for the legendary company.The story sees Dalmatian Pongo and his 'pet' Roger find love with two of their kind in Perdita and Anita. When Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies the cruel Cruella De Vil wishes to buy them but is turned away. With the help of her bumbling henchmen she kidnaps the puppies in order to make fur coats of them. Its then up to Pongo and Perdita, with the help of a collection of animals, to find the puppies and return to London. The story is simplistic but wonderfully executed. It has so many great elements that make it such an engaging movie, from the way dogs view their owners to the many escape attempts.The characters are superb. Rod Taylor is perfect as the very likable Pongo who we see as brave and caring as the film goes on. The relationship between him and Perdita is better than most as they do care for each other. Cruella is one of Disney's stronger villains, it's the way she is so crazed and manic but always trying to be stylish that makes her so entertaining. Jasper and Horace are brilliant henchmen, supplying lots of fun comic relief. Their so inept and clumsy that there's never a dull moment with them. The team of the Colonel, Tibbs and the Captain are brilliant. The Colonel is lovingly silly and Tibbs is so likable due to his never say die attitude. Roger and Anita are good as they are presented as a normal pleasant couple. The other dogs that help out like Danny the Great Dane and Towser are nice, solid supporting characters.Though the rougher animation isn't to everyone's taste it does fit in really well here. The way it looks fits in with the gritty darkness of London and the wilds of the countryside, it's a nice change from the angular style of the films preceding it. When you consider the amount of puppies they had to animate it's an impressive feat. It is certainly one of the Disney's most suspense filled and exciting films. It's not very often that a Disney climax has a car chase and it's an outstanding sequence. The whole search for the puppies has a brilliantly tense feel and watching Cruella search for them has some really well made strong moments. This leads on to another highlight which is the atmosphere the film has. The whole 'twilight bark' is a great piece and the scenes where Tibbs and the Colonel investigate the matter have a really effective dark feel. These are underlined by the superb visuals of a gloomy London and the demonic looking 'hell hall'. The music is also very memorable as it contains the usual solid score Disney does, as well as the fantastic songs ''Cruella De Vil'' and ''Dalmatian Plantation''. The other effective scenes include a humorous look at how dog owners are similar to their pets and the what's my crime TV show that's funny.This is one of Disney's most entertaining movies filled with many great elements.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favorites,"Lion King has always been my favorite Disney movie. But One Hundred and One Dalmations is on my top 5. The movie is filled with so many laughs, you have to love it.Pongo is a lonely pup with his lonely musical master, Roger. When he spots two lovely women(one being a dog of course), he sets Roger up to meet the woman. They hit it off immediatly as well does Pongo with his new mate, Perdita. When Perdita has puppies, Perdita's(her master) old friend, Cruella DeVille wants to buy them from her. But only to make the puppies into a new fur coat. When Roger refuses, Cruella kidnaps the puppies. Pongo and Perdita go out to save the puppies. And the rest is left for you to see for yourself.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
101% entertainment,"""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" is among my Mouse House's favorites.And Cruella is second only to Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent ,as far as the villains are concerned.Cruella's character is so vile that my wife gave that nickname to her wicked headmistress (who really looks the part)! Pongo,Perdita,their offspring and all the rest have a long way to go before tasting the quiet joys of home.Very good scene in the park when the two dogs fall in love and make their masters do the same.And during the long walk across the snow ,aren't they nice all these puppies?

A Dalmation Tale,"Walt Disney once again produces an animated film centered around dogs, this time Dalmations to be specific, as bachelor Roger and his dog Pongo one day meet single girl Anita and her dog Perdita, and of course they are the perfect match, and fall in love. Pongo and Perdita have a big litter of pups that somehow grows to 101, much to their exasperation! But when evil woman Cruella De Vil finds out, she decides to turn them all into a coat(!). Of course, they are appalled, but when Cruella has her two henchmen kidnap the pups, it's Pongo and Perdita to the rescue.

Beautiful animation Disney!,"This film is beautiful, and superior to the 1996 live action version. The animation is just beautiful, and I delighted in seeing those puppies's tails wagging. Those puppies were very cute, and a lack of any voice overs in the 1996 version was sorely missed. The scenes like the Twilight Bark added a sense of poignancy to the well-written story.I also want to say, I absolutely love the book by Dodie Smith, and I am 16. Another high point was the villain Cruella DeVil(voiced to perfection by Betty Lou Gerson), who was truly diabolical in every sense. The dogs, Pongo and Perdy were very lovable, and their scenes with the puppies were often very touching. Supporting characters like Tibbs, Captain, Colonel, and of course Jasper and Horace were very well done. The songs, were not as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but at least they were tuneful. In conclusion, a beautiful and entertaining animated film, that is underrated in my opinion. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Short and sweet,"Pongo was a carefree bachelor in London and then he decided that his pet Roger Radcliffe needed a mate. Pongo is a dalmatian. Then he spots Perdita walking with her human Anita. Anita's fur-loving friend Cruella takes a fancy to the 15 dalmatian pups. When Roger refuses to sell the puppies, Cruella hires thugs Jasper and Horace to kidnap the pups. They overpower Nanny and then hold up in a crumbling mansion with other dalmatian puppies. There are 99 puppies in total.Let's face it. Cruella De Vil is one of the more outlandish Disney villains. She isn't scary as much as silly. The movie opens with a fun rom-com story. I like the narration by Pongo. The movie stalls a little in the middle after the puppies have been stolen while the dogs haven't started on their search. It's a pretty short movie which is a good thing because it doesn't overstay its welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Vintage Disney,"If there's any classic Disney movie that's less likely to be forgotten because of the modern Disney movies, this would be one of them. Part of the reason may be the live action version and its upcoming sequel. Skip those remakes and watch the real deal. The other part of the reason is because this movie is just so charming. Cruella De Vil is one of the more memorable Disney villains ever made. Romance abounds in this movie, and don't forget those adorable puppies. This may not have the animation or the big fancy songs of the moderns, but all that fanciness usually distracts from the story. Classic Disney always rocks, and this is no exception.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sweet Disney movie,"A sweet Disney movie. Mostly meant for children but has something for adults too. Adorable characters, nice story, happy ending.Not perfect though. The opening background and set up are wonderful. After that, however, the movie does feel like it loses some of its charm and substance as it then becomes a bit of a caper. Becomes more of a kid's movie the longer it goes on.Doesn't overstay its welcome though. Is just the right length.Animation is okay, for the time. Some of it feels a bit basic, but that might just be compared to the animation of today.Good voice work. Only recognisable name among the voice providers is Rod Taylor, making it even more impressive - it was a cast of mostly unknowns.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never have I loved any story like this one!,"101 Dalmatians is, no doubt, my all-time favourite story and also one of the greatest films I have ever seen. When I was small, I never got tired to listen to or to read the story, and because of thinking especially much about Cruella de Vil I very early noticed that in fact I like wicked characters. But, of course, the unforgettable dogs are best in the film. Because of this story I have loved real Dalmatians all my life and also thought that only the names of the film's dog figures are really suitable for Dalmatians. I have also read Dodie Smith's original story, and I was really glad that it's so much like the Disney film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"After 15 Viewings, Still Disturbing","My two-year old is obsessed by this movie.  He can't get enough of the unsanitized, unpasteurized fare that Disney used to put out before political correctness drained all the fun out of their movies in an effort to make them suitable for McDonald's action figure tie-ins.Watching ""101 Dalmatians"" is like entering a time machine to the days when all the men drank Miller High Life and all the women fetched the men their beers. The animation is so rough it's good; more than a few times you see shots where not everything was colored in.  And that's freaking cool.  Fast, cheap and out of control.I mean, what other Disney flick has criminals drinking beers, everyone smoking, gunplay, violence and the lead human character living a quote-unquote ""bachelor lifestyle"" when everyone knew that ""bachelor lifestyle"" in 1961 was code for ""alternative lifestyle""?  Yet Pongo-Boy finds his ""pet"" a woman, and the ensuing childless marriage is blessed not by the pitter-patter of little infant's feet, but the stench of wet dog smell.This has to be the funniest Disney movie I've seen: Kanine Krunchies and the little dog watching the Western TV show and trying to peer around the corner's of the screen to see where the bad guy is hiding is worth the price alone.Even with all its merits, the movie must go back ""into the vault"" for 28 years.

"Heroic animals, funny villain, boring story.","This is Walt Disney's 17th full-length animated feature film, a story where a litter of puppies, belonging to Dalmatians Pongo and Perdita, are abducted by the minions of Cruella De Vil, who plans on making fur coats out of the pups. As a result, Pongo and Perdita go on a mission to rescue their children.The actors did a nice job in voicing the characters and the animation, although not very vibrant and appeared washed-up, had a somewhat nice, jazzy feel to it. The characters were given their own personality and charm and I thought the banding together of the various animals and dogs to help Pongo and Perdita rescue their pups was a great act of heroism. However, the plot and story take a very long time to gain any steam and, aside from the rescue mission scenes, a large part of the movie was actually pretty boring. I thought the main human character, Roger, had the personality of wallpaper and the romance subplot was a little too sappy.The villains, though, were the highlight of the film. Cruella was crafty, sly and hilariously captivating, and is one of the few most interesting elements of the movie. The two minions, Horace and Jasper, were also funny.Overall, kids would probably like this movie more than adults, but I thought this animated version is a tad better than the live action version with Jeff Daniels.Grade C-",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
101,"When two Dalmatians named Pongo (Rod Taylor) and Perdita (Cate Bauer) are blessed with fifteen puppies, they couldn't have been happier. But when their new family gets stolen, along with eighty-four other puppies by the evil fashion designer Cruella De Vil (Betty Lou Gerson) for the intention of making fur coats out of them, Pongo and Perdita must call on numerous other animals to help them rescue the puppies from their fate. Important in animation history as the first Disney animated film to heavily use newer xerography methods for the purpose of cheaper animation methods, One Hundred and One Dalmatians may lack the visual beauty of Disney's earlier fantasy films, but the modern UPA style of the film helps it stand out as one of the most visually unique films of the 1960's. The infamous Cruella, thanks to Marc Davis's incredible character animation and Betty Lou Gerson's piercing voice makes her one of the most memorable villians of all time and despite a lot of it would end up being reused for numourous films produced during this cost-cutting era, George Bruns's score is fabulous with the best example of his work being the jazz-inspired opening credits that would set the mood for the more laid-back films of this time period. Overall, One Hundred and One Dalmatians deserves it's reputation as not only one of the most important films in the companies history, but also as a fun thrill ride for all ages.",,Anonymous,Animation

101 dogs' lives,"Just last year, our family took on a pet dog for the first time so my perception of this Disney classic is obviously now biased. Seriously though, I'd have enjoyed it anyway. It's old fashioned family entertainment, easy to watch, but highly sentimental, of course. The animation was to my inexpert eyes, very good, particularly the tricky job of imparting personality to so any Dalmatian pups. Pongo and Hattie, the pups' parents could be Lady and the Tramp a bit further down the road while Cruella De Ville follows the models of preceding Disney female baddies, only with even more flounce and extravagance. Apart from the ""Cruella De Ville"" song, there's a distinct lack of musical interludes, which serves the purposes of the one-long-chase plot-line reasonably well. There's gentle humour as you'd expect and a tolerable running gag with the little pup that's forever hungry. I thought the best sequence though was right at the start when Pongo persuaded his owner to cosy up to Mattie's in the park, but the narrative manages to engage all the way through with the ""human"" characters also achieving sufficient degrees of personality to embellish the tale before the obligatory happy ending. You'd have to be pretty hard-hearted not to enjoy this delightful animation which I took pleasure in doing today for the very first time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved The Artwork!,"I liked this film mainly for its drawings. It was a departure from previous Disney animated films in that it had harder-edged drawings instead of the soft pastels. I found the detailed sketches of the building to be fascinating. I could actually watch this film with the sound off and just enjoy the artwork.I actually saw this movie AFTER the 1996 live-action version with Glenn Close so I was familiar with the story. The only deviation was that there were more animals involved in the rescue of the puppies in the latter version.The narration was very good in the beginning and film is okay, nothing super.

She kidnaps them,and now Perdita and Pongo needs to save their puppies,before being too late.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming and Artistically Brilliant Dognapping Classic,"About 60 years ago, a small little animated feature came out from Walt Disney's studio called 101 Dalmatians, based on the book of the same name by Dodie Smith. Released two years after the ambitious albeit financial flump that was Sleeping Beauty, the film was the smash hit that saved the Disney company from falling into bankruptcy, mostly given its smaller budget and cost effective xerography process at the time, in addition to many critics hailing it as one of the last great films produced by Walt himself prior to his death. So given its long lasting legacy, sequels and spinoffs, how exactly does it hold up nowadays?Set in then modern London, England, the film tells the story of two Dalmatians named Pongo and Perdita, whose puppies get kidnapped by the villainous coat maker Cruella deVille. Along the two's journey to save their children, Pongo and Perdita end up rescuing 84 additional puppies, bringing their total up to 101. Now given that premise, admittedly the film's weakest element is the plot, as it's pretty routine and predictable with not too many surprises for what will come next. However, what does save the story from being dull is the humor and charming characters. As the first several minutes start off with how Pongo and Perdita met, it ends up creating some funny shenanigans between their individual owners, Roger and Anita, one being a suave albeit assertive songwriter and the other being a kind albeit overly concerned person, having been a former schoolmate of Cruella De Vil. Speaking of Cruella, Betty Lou Gerson and animator Marc Davis steal the show with her hammy albeit overly threatening presence, and one can tell you do not want to mess with this spoiled witch.As for the other characters, Cruella's henchmen Horace and Jasper Baddun might have been the kickstarter of every mediocre henchmen trope in movies, but here their personalities contrast off one another so well with one being smart and the other being dumb, and they end up in some of the finer visual gags. Admittedly, the puppies themselves are more so reduced to Macguffins in the story, but they are cute enough as far as individual kids go. In addition to all that, people remember the movie most for its popular song named after Cruella herself, which is so corny that you cannot help but to sing along to it. The other songs being Kanine Krunchies, which showcased some subtle satire on the gimmicky commercialism in TV back then, and Dalmatian Plantation, which wraps the film up in such a lively harmonious fashion that you feel satisfied after the experience is over. While the Twilight Bark sequence does go on for a bit too long, it still has some fun dog barking antics and hysterical banter between the military like farm animals trying to rescue the pups, so it's still all in good fun.Now as for the animation, the film itself is famous for being the first Disney film to use Ub Iwerks' innovative process of xerography, which allowed for the animator's pencil drawings to be directly to animation cels, therefore controversially eliminating the use of ink and paint. While Walt himself hated the process out of wanting his films to look realistic, this might be one of the best uses of the process given the film's modernesque artstyle based off of Ronald Searle artwork and Mont Blanc India ink. In addition to Ken Anderson's experimental art direction and Walt Peregoy's stylish colors, the animators clearly had a lot of fun working on the film in bringing the characters to life. Animators like the aforementioned Marc Davis, Frank Thomas and Milt Kahl especially had the time of their lives on this film after being restricted to venture into exaggerated realism for too long, especially after the nightmarish production of Sleeping Beauty. While the xerox process would go on in other Disney features onward, none even came close to matching the artistic brilliance of this feature.So in the end, what could have easily been another standard rescue mission story ends up being highly entertaining and even boldly artistic. 101 Dalmatians might not be one of the Disney Company's greatest achievements in storytelling, but it remains a humorous thrill with fun characters, hysterical songs and luscious art experimentation nonetheless. Considering the decades worth of people who grew up with this film, there's bound to be even more generations who will too. So if you're yet to give this flick a watch, by all means give it a go at least once, and maybe you'll be hungry for some kanine krunchies afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cruella is what makes this film so good.,"I have always thought that the animation and story of ""101 Dalmatians"" were actually a bit weak. After all, a crazy lady who wants to steal puppies to make them into a coat ISN'T especially deep. And, the xerox process they used in this film did make the movie look a lot cheaper than the exquisitely animated films of the 1950s. But what makes it very good and well worth watching is the character Cruella De Vil. Her voice work by Betty Lou Gerson was just fabulous--and very obviously inspired by Tallulah Bankhead. Her mannerisms, style and voice were Ms. Bankhead all the way--but with a wonderful insane quality that made a horrific act (slaughtering puppies) so ridiculously comical that it was watchable and fun. Otherwise, this film would have been seen as cruel and just awful. Plus the ""Cruella"" song was a hoot--with great lyrics and a perfect accompaniment to this horrid character.The bottom line is that I nearly scored this one a 9--it's awfully good. But having the sub-standard animation brought it down a point. Enjoyably sick and funny--even for adult audiences.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"In the wide array of Disney classics, this is one of the weakest.","This famous Disney film tells the story of a litter of fifteen Dalmatian puppies that are stolen by Cruella De Vil, a wealthy lover of fur coats, to be turned into a coat. Despite the fame, I don't think it's particularly appealing. The story is basic and has nothing special, besides a lively attack on the use of animal skins. About three-quarters of film's lenght are occupied by the puppies' escape, the remainder being divided between a brief prelude and a predictable outcome. The film also has problems of cinematography, because the drawings are a little coarse and ungainly, very unpleasant to the eyes. Contrary to the usual Disney movies, music isn't a strong point here. With the notable exception of ""Cruela De Vil"", the film has no notable music. The best of this film is the work of voice actors and Cruella, one of the best villains ever created by the studio. She makes the film really funny and is the most remarkable character, even more than the puppies themselves.I've never been interested in this movie in my childhood. I knew it existed, but it never caught my eye, I'm not sure why. Only now, as an adult, did I have the curiosity to watch it.

This Movie is GREAT!!!,"""101 Dalmatians"" is a great movie from Disney. I read the original book by Dodie Smith and its sequel, ""The Starlight Barking"", I watched the animated series, watched the animated sequel ""101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure"", and watched the live-action films with Glenn Close as Cruella. The story of ""101 Dalmatians"" is Pongo and Perdita meet up in a park along with their owners, Roger and Anita, the two couples fall in love and eventually they get married. Later, Perdita is expecting puppies. The only person to hear of this is Anita's old schoolmate, Cruella De Vil. On a dark and stormy night, the puppies get born, totalling up to 15 Dalmatian puppies. Cruella shows up in time and wants to buy the puppies from them, but Roger turns her down. Cruella then vows to get even on them. When the puppies are older, Cruella hires two incompetent crooks, Horace and Jasper Baddun, to steal the puppies. They succeed in doing that. All the humans fail to find the puppies, but luck comes when Pongo gives out the ""Twilight Bark"" to every dog in London for information on their missing puppies. It finally reaches the Colonel, a sheepdog, and his companion, Sergeant Tibbs, a cat. Pongo and Perdita then set off to find their children. Then, we learn that Cruella stole the 15 puppies, along with 84 others, with the motivation to turn them into fur coats. Now, Pongo and Perdita have to get the puppies to safety before it is too late. I love this film 100-percent. I'm waiting for the Platinum Edition DVD to come out. It comes out on March 3rd next year. My favourite characters are Pongo, Perdita and Cruella. I like Pongo and Perdita because this story is about them saving their children from death. And I like Cruella because, thanks to this film, she has become one of the most popular and also one of the most iconic villains of all time. And I am very interested in this story because it's all about good vs. evil as the pups try to outsmart Cruella. It's a real lovely film from Disney, and I'm giving it 10/10. And this is enough talk for me. I enjoyed it and I can't wait for the DVD to come out. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I personally prefer the book by Dodie Smith!!,"Genre: Cartoon, dogs, adventure, based on Dodie Smith's book.What happens: So the film is about two Dalmatians meeting with each other.

They could have just left the idea alone and based their next film on their imagination. However, no, they decided to make a film based on Dodie Smith's lovely book.I prefer the book to the film, as I have told you before. The film is good, but it would be much better if it had the following things added or changed: One: In the book, the mother of the pups was called Missis and Perdita was a liver Dalmatian Anita found on the road. I would like the film to have this. Two: The film has less of Pongo and Perdita and more of the pups. In the book, more than half of the story concentrates on the grown-ups. This change in the film annoys me a little. Three: In the book, Lucky is not a sickly puppy. Instead of Lucky being the sickly one, there's a sickly puppy called Cadpig and he isn't in the film!!

"maybe not the 'best', but certainly a lot of fun","Disney's 101 Dalmations is fine for kids. Whether it really holds up for adults I'm not sure - I actually haven't seen the whole film in quite a while. But it holds up, for what it's worth, in my mind as a fun spectacle for kids. There are so many Dalmatians, naturally, not all of them can get personalities. Most of them don't, really. The real focal point though is the villain - Cruella DeVille - and of course with villains like her, who needs strong heroes? She, and the actress voicing her, Betty Lou Gerson, are eating up scenery with the large fur coats and wild,crazy eyes. Even her design is creative and just a bit warped in that villainous way to hold up well; I still remember her driving in the climax and that being as memorable a set piece as any in the classic Walt Disney animation era (that is, before his death).And it's enough that the Dalmatians can get around with some direction - and some help of furry friends (the shaggy dog Colonel and the cat Segreant Tibbs, are very entertaining and funny supporting characters) - to get through the narrative. So that even if they aren't always as great as the villain, they have enough to keep things moving. The animation itself is not as 'polished' as the widescreen epic that came before it, Sleeping Beauty, but that's fine.More than fine; this is a cartoon, and it has some of the rough contours of the animation studio trying to find their way, and, usually, getting there. Apparently Xerox was also used to make copies of all the dogs, and there's kind of a hypnotic quality to the shots of them all running in unison, one after another after another. It's scratchy, and this would continue for a number of movies (Aristocats for one), but I liked the look - it's taking a chance on a different style, and it connects in the way to the high-velocity adventure style of the story.So, for the kids? Sure. For adults? Well, there's always Cruella.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Chloroform? not a drop. and no ether, either...ey-ther","After securing his human a mate, immediately following a creepy scene of watching women without them knowing it(the misogyny and fatphobia are some of the only things that have aged poorly), Pongo has 15 puppies(well, Perdita has them. He just kind of waits outside until afterwards) attracting the attention of a villain so iconic that she is in a total of five feature length stories.And it's no wonder Cruella DeVille has made such an impression on the world. Before we even see her face, we realize she's a menace behind the wheel. Roger sings a very catchy tune about how awful she is. When she does make an entrance, the horrible tobacco smoke fills the air, and she pretty quickly declares that fur coats are her one true love, setting up the conflict, and earning the ire of everyone in the audience who is against animal cruelty - so, all of us. Later, she laughs at the pain of others. Her phone has a Satan theme; she even lives in Hell Hall!Centering another story on adorable dogs and the world they have that we aren't privy to was definitely a very calculated move. A low blow, even. But it absolutely works. This is the rare animated Disney classic that has no less than three live action movies, and that's not a surprise. The ""twilight bark"" fashioned into coded messages to military members is truly inspired. Same goes for the alliance between canines, a cat, a horse and cattle. The animation is fluid, every living thing moves the way the species does in real life, except for when that's the joke. It's funny, dramatic, tense and the atmosphere is strong. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is full of fun characters - the dogs themselves are actually an adorable bunch who you actually care about rather than a faceless mass that you just watch blankly without any real cares. The adventure is fun to follow along with, and even though the town of London seems a little unreal in this film, it's only the dogs we care about after all. But the best thing about this film is the villains. Cruella DeVil is one of animation's greatest villains - as testified to by her evil looking house and her nasty looking car. The two thick henchmen (I've forgotten their names) are amusing to watch when they're clumsily pursuing the dogs - there is nothing about this film that could have been done better. It manages to touch, amuse, captivate and make the audience care about it - it should be at least an 8.0 rating on IMDb. Although I guess some films just don't receive the credit they deserve, this film being one. And though I did have trouble trying to figure out if the film was set in the Victorian era or the 60s, it's still an amusing watch, and the dogs have such a good story to tell that you won't care anyway. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
charming Disney although lacking songs,"101 Dalmatians is classic Disney in every sense of the word, giving each little puppy a characterisation and making us involved in the plight of Pongo and Perdita and their search for their stolen family.Cruella de Vil is evil personified, a smoke-breathing, wild-eyed monster looking for new ways to make fur coats. No animal is safe around her! Dodie Smith's book comes to life after a long journey in production and is well worth the effort. Despite most of the songs written for the film being junked before release, this film manages to enthral both children and adults alike, and is still better than the two live-action versions which were released in the 1990s.Funny, charming, beautifully animated ... and timeless.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not good,"The 60s and 70s were the nadir of Disney animation, which is perhaps why, as someone born in 1959, I was never a big fan.The movie is bland and indifferently animated. It's fairly unwatchable. It's so much weaker than 60s TV cartoons like of Charlie Brown and Dr. Seuss.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never my favorite Disney animation,"I'm a huge fan of the series of Disney's animated films. I remember I saw 101 Dalmatians when I was very little and I watched it with my father again and again and he loved it a lot. I was just never really that much into it. I love the original story by Dodie Smith, but the film just lacks something essential. It contains a lot of happy childhood memories for me but I haven't yet figured out the missing piece.The story is familiar to most of us. When Anita and Roger get married, they both have a dalmatian. Anita has Perdita and Roger has Pongo. Soon Perdita starts expecting puppies. Anita's old friend Cruella De Vil pops in and wants to buy the pups to make a fur coat for herself, but fails. She then hires two dumb criminals to do the job for her, but the dogs are smarter than she thought.101 Dalmatians is a real classic but the missing feel's just always there. The best thing in the film are probably the dumb criminals, who are mostly responsible for the funny scenes in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Anita darling""","Un-vaulted for Disney+, my sister and I watched this movie on loop when we were kids. She absolutely Loved Dalmatians. Watching this again the songs instantly came back to me. It's a quintessential classic Disney animation. Funny that what I thought was cutting edge special effects was actually cheap animation cost cutting techniques. If only it was that easy to clean soot off 101 dogs.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is the movie that introduced me to dalmatians,"The 17th animated Disney classic is a less ambitious film comparing to earlier top Disney classics, but it is enjoyable enough anyway.""Sleeping Beauty"" nearly bankrupted the Disney studio. Perhaps because of this and also because other extremely expensive Disney classics were initially a failure, the Disney studio needed to make cheaper animated films in a try to recover financial costs. This one is cheaper and more simple in everything: story, designs, sceneries/backgrounds, colors, picture quality, characters, etc...It certainly doesn't have ""that"" magic and attention to detail which makes Disney so legendary, but it doesn't deserve to be judged too hardly. It isn't Disney at its worst, very far from that! The animation is great as usual on Disney and this one also has lots of fun, entertainment, danger, adventure, darkness, classic humor and even some touching and depressing moments. The happy ending is another sign that it follows the Disney tradition.Although the artwork is way cheaper-looking than in the most artistic Disney tales, is still in a good and acceptable level in many ways. It is basically the same artstyle we see in ""The Sword in the Stone"" and ""The Jungle Book"", for example. Simple and not extraordinary, but not as poor-looking as in ""Oliver & Company"". Just for the record, I consider ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" a better movie than ""Oliver & Company"", ""The Jungle Book"" and ""The Sword in the Stone"".However, there is one thing which the artwork of this movie is brilliant: a brief scene which we can see the sparkling stars at night, with an impressing resemblance to the fabulous artwork of the best Disney classic ever, ""Pinocchio"".The characters are very enjoyable in general. The most enjoyable are Roger, the Colonel, Sargent Tibs, Pongo, Perdita and those adorable 99 dalmatian puppies. All of the puppies are adorable.By the way, the first time I saw dalmatians was in this movie. I didn't know that dog breed before, but ever since then they became one of my favorite dog breeds. They're such cute spotty dogs! I love dalmatians since I was a kid.Returning to the conversation about the characters, Cruella DeVil isn't one of my favorite Disney villains and I personally don't consider her one of Disney's best villains, but she's one of the most eccentric and original. I like her red car, nevertheless. She's got a beautiful and fine automobile! Jasper and Horace are Cruella's sidekicks and they are funny in many moments. They are just as cruel and heartless as Cruella, but more comical. There are several hilarious moments with these two guys. It's so funny how the dalmatians (with the help of other animals) make their lives miserable, considering that they definitely deserve it. This only accents the comical effect.Pongo, Roger, the Colonel and Sargent Tibs are equally humorous characters. In fact, Sargent Tibs (the cat) has always been one of my favorite characters from this movie. He's funny, smart, clever, well-mannered and cool.This movie takes place in England. It takes us not only to London, but also to other places that must be not very far from London... or maybe they are. But wherever they are, those are all nice places, at least judging by the movie's perspective.About the soundtrack, it is generally great too. ""Cruella DeVil"" is a delightful song (a perfect song for Cruella DeVil, describing her in perfection). ""Dalmatian Plantation"" is a catchy one. ""Kanine Kruchies Jingle"" is a lovely and cute song.""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" had a ""remake"" in 1996, but as a live-action version. The live-action version/remake has amazing similarities to the animated version, being very faithful to it. Although the live-action version is okay, I rather the animated version with its simple and old-fashioned charm.Overall, a charming Disney classic which might not be their best, but deserves its attention too. It also features the voice talents of many well-known Disney artists.This should definitely be on Top 250.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I forgot how good this movie is!,"I watched this one relatively often as a kid and remembered enjoying it, but as an adult, it's much easier to appreciate how great a movie this is. It's very funny, yes, but also quite suspenseful. The ""scratchy"" animation style and the backgrounds are well-paired. The dogs and their owners are sympathetic characters, but it's Cruella who dominates the movie. She is pretty freaking scary and designed to perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Will the fans ever learn to spell ""Dalmatian"" ?","It's more than 30 years later, and ""dalmations"" are still the order of the day. The turn of the century brought us several sequels, both animated and live action, but none are as good as the original or even have the right ""feel.""Now, this film is not perfect, as the first half is pure gold, but it gets tedious beyond that. The animation is classic and fluid with nicely stylized dogs, even if it's a sketchy in places, and at times you can see the same puppy with the same spots running across the screen over and over. It's also a clashy film in that it has childlike themes (cute puppies, lots of slapstick with the barnyard animals) alongside mature themes (animal slaughter, marital relations, a truly evil villain), so it lacks a certain consistency.The first half is all wonderfully written and sure to please any adult or child: Pongo trying to find a mate for Roger, the cruelty of Cruella, the birth of the puppies, and especially the charming family scenes like when the dalmatians are watching TV. (""Why Patch, where did you ever hear such talk? Certainly not from your mother..."") As long as Pongo and Perdita are around, the story stays nicely grounded, and it is lovely entertainment of a type we seldom see anymore. This isn't the modern ""Joke Every 2 Minutes"" animated film; it's pure storytelling with all sorts of clever detail that never gets old.But then we get to the antics of the animals in the barn, the madcap car chases and the constant scenes of puppies running away, and it loses most of its appeal. Scattered in there are a few good moments (like when the puppies are slipping on the ice), but it's mostly downhill because that adult feel from the beginning is gone.I give this a 6/10 because it's great fun up until the puppies are kidnapped. The design of the dogs is so cute, as is the way they interact and fall in love without being ""too human."" It's also good to see a villain with some grit; this is from a time when family entertainment was much broader and could appeal to anyone, unlike the dumbed-down fare of today.Overall, a must see just for the experience, but subsequent viewings need only the first half.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Family classic,"in my mind there are only 2 versions of this movie, the good one (1961) and the bad one (1996 ? ) this is a great classic when I was a younger i would watch it and then rewind it, all day! it is great. the main characters are Pogo Perdita and their 15 pups which grows to 100 pups!and of course there is their humans, ""pets"" according to Pogo, Anita and roger. there is a newer version that isn't animated, but it ruins the movie, b/c Pogo is supposed to be able to talk and the animals all work together to save the pups but when they use real dogs and humans it takes away part of the fiction, glamor, and fun of the movie. i grew up in the 90s and didn't realize until today that it was made in the 60s. its not made w/ ""todays"" kind of animation meaning it is all done w/ a computer and tries to look like real life, in my opinion it is better than any new animated movie. also boys and girls alike enjoy this classic. there are some movie that you watched in your childhood and go back and watch them and think they are not that good, but no matter how old or young you are its a guarantee you will like this movie. its wholesome, speaks of family, loving, and taking care of each other and it has a few good songs, that are lots of fun to sing along to, and even when you haven't seen the movie in a while you will remember the words and hum the tune, a song you just cant forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why does Disney hate consumers so much?,"OK, now we have a new ""platinum"" (yeah...) 2-DVD edition of ""101 Dalmatians"". This is a classic Disney film and one of their better efforts. Complaints about the animation style arise from failure to appreciate that it IS a style. It's wonderful for its clarity and lack of clutter and arises from a cartooning style popular during the late '50s and early '60s.It must be admitted that the ""good side"" characters are a little bland, especially the parent dogs' owners. The Disney people should probably have employed some better voice talent for these people and given them a few interesting crochets  assuming this wouldn't be too great distortion of the original book.However, Cruella De Vil and her nincompoop sidekicks more than make up for this deficiency. In the 1996 live-action version, the brilliant Glenn Close is even nastier and funnier. However, Betty Lou Gerson, the voice actress here, gives her Cruella plenty of bite and venom. Also making up for so many pallid characters are the ""Cruella De Vil"" song and Cruella's own number about pelts.On the whole, the film is a good romp. Young children may be apt to take Cruella's threat to the puppies seriously  although Cruella is painted in such broad strokes that a moderately intelligent 5-year-old will probably realize that she's all smoke and mirrors. Teen-agers and adults will relax and enjoy the fun without worrying.The extras included in this set are on occasion interesting, even meaty. They are some inducement to buy the new edition even if you have one of the old ones. Also an inducement is the restoration work on the film itself, which makes it look as fresh as it did in the theaters. Well, almost (see below).You may at this point wonder at my rating for this offering, since my verbiage seems to be working toward a tepid mid-range score. No such luck. This edition of 101 lies at the bottom of the barrel. I don't know why anyone would want to buy it, much less rent the thing. The reason is its disastrously mutilated visual aspect.The Disney people have had a vile and pernicious prejudice against widescreen aspects from the get-go. The only reason they even make widescreen films for theaters is that's what audiences expect. But they know there are a lot of Luddite fools out there who want films to ""fit"" their oh-so-1960s little-screen TV sets. And this plays right into their hatred of the widescreen medium. Getting them to put out a DVD with a film showing its original dimensions sometimes amounts to pulling their teeth with rusty pliers. This latest travesty really takes the cake.""101 Dalmatians"" was filmed at an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. Every single VHS and DVD edition of it that I know of has mutilated the original down to a disgusting 1.33:1  with a coy little note that it's been mutilated to ""fit your television screen"". WELL, IT DOESN'T FIT MINE. Welcome to the 21st Century, stupid stupid Disney people. Yes, people still buy antiquated little screens  save those pennies, guys! But half the programs on many channels are already in widescreen, and it doesn't fit YOUR screen, ha-ha-ha. It fits mine. Most widescreen films are produced on DVD only in widescreen, and it's about time.If Disney wants to wallow in the last Century, that's their business. However, I don't see why we should enable them by buying their old-fashioned, creakily antiquated products. Once they produce a widescreen DVD of 101, I'll buy it. Used  that way they don't get my money. Until then, I'll just keep my VHS tape. Yes, Disney, I can still be even more-antiquated-than-thou. As to this issue of the film: what a rip-off!",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

A really underrated film that should be held up to the standards of Beauty and The Beast or Pinocchio,"I haven't read the book so I can't compare it to that though, frankly, that makes it easier to review and possibly more entertaining. But enough of this introduction, let's get on with the review!I want to start off by expressing the great ideas this film comes up with. I love that they have the dogs consider the humans as their pets. And the way they go about explaining it is really good. If it were to be made now they'd probably just have a dog saying ""Hi I'm a dog! You may think that this human I'm with is my owner but no! He's actually my pet!"". I actually cringed typing that. My point is that they treat you with respect and don't ever talk about it as if we were supposed to think they were pets. That's good writing. However the two main characters, Roger and Anita are only brought together because Roger's dog sees them and thinks that they should get together. Despite this they don't lack any good chemistry and are one of Disney's best couples.Now the animation! I've already said that I really like this modern sketchy style, it gives the movie it's own feel and almost even some grit to it. Doug Walker said something along the lines of that he personally doesn't like it and that it doesn't look like the final product, I disagree though understand where he's coming from. Though I also feel it helps with some of the character designs, the dog called colonel looks really cool, due to the sketchy style but I think you can tell that I'm just building up to talking about Cruella De Vil.This bony little old woman under a massive fur coat is really unique idea is one of, if not the best Disney villain designs. She's one of the best Disney villains and has such an iconic presence and voice. Her entrance is amazing. She bursts in the door, with her own theme tune playing from up stairs. The opera length cigarette holder, that puffs out green smoke is also a really noticeable element about the character.As I mentioned before Cruella has her own theme tune and unlike other Disney movies where people just break into song for no apparent reason, here it makes sense. Roger is a songwriter and is working on a melody, once Cruella shows up at the house he applies lyrics to do with her to the song. They even add to this idea more when we hear is song being played on the radio and his wife refers to it as ""his first big hit"". This, sadly, is the only song in the movie.Now onto the pups. The puppies are the most important part of the movie, if they didn't exist this movie really wouldn't have it's plot. So how do they turn out? The puppies are probably the worst part about the movie because since there's so many of them, the writers couldn't have gave them all distinct personalities. Thankfully they never come across as annoying or stereotypical and that's good enough. It would probably take too much time to flesh all of them out anyway.Something surprising about this movie is it's vast amount of suspense. Through a lot of it I was very worried for these characters and as critics would say ""on the edge of my seat"". The characters go through so much that when you do get to the final happy ending, you've worked for it and in this movie that's done better than in any other film I've seen, in my opinion. However once you do get to that happy ending you kind of feel underwhelmed, or at least I did. I feel they could have went that bit more happy but what I got I'm happy with.This film is definitely worth giving a watch and, despite what some critics lead you to believe, has a lot of harsh elements. If I had to pick something that disappointed me, that I haven't already mentioned, is that it was too short and I didn't get enough. Though I suppose that's more of a compliment.Thank you for reading and goodbye.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watched it 101 times as a child - interesting as an adult,"One hundred and one Dalmatians is a blast from the past. Spending so many hours watching this show as a child it was nice to rewatch it again in adulthood.Whilst it has a solid story, the most impactful part of the film was the first act. It was charming, witty, sad, and filled with great music. However the heightened emotional impact faded for the rest of the film, but kept the same tone.What I found interesting was that it is essentially a human vs animal film, with all animals being in cahoots with each other. It maintained and set humans up as the ones who cannot work together, and who have evil in their hearts, whereas the animals (all domestic animals I might add) have a togetherness unable to be achieved by humans.As expected by Disney films, the soundtrack was great, the voice acting very expressive and convincing, and everything cumulates with a happy ending.The stand out of the film was Betty Lou Gerson who done a fantastic job at voicing the truly diabolical Cruella De Vil. She really brought life to the insidious and cruel antagonist.Disney has always been a frontrunner in animation, and this film was no different in parts. The animation was expressive, however it lacked in the backgrounds which were dull and often poorly drawn, and the animators reused the same template over and over for the 84 Dalmatians that weren't the puppies of Pongo and Perdita.Definitely worth a watch as it is a unique film casting very a unique dog breed as the protagonists and heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
great fun and absolute blast to watch,"If there's any classic Disney movie that's less likely to be forgotten because of the modern Disney movies, this would be one of them. Part of the reason may be the live action version and its upcoming sequel. Skip those remakes and watch the real deal. The other part of the reason is because this movie is just so charming. Cruella De Vil is one of the more memorable Disney villains ever made. Romance abounds in this movie, and don't forget those adorable puppies. This may not have the animation or the big fancy songs of the moderns, but all that fanciness usually distracts from the story. Classic Disney always rocks, and this is no exception. I liked this film mainly for its drawings. It was a departure from previous Disney animated films in that it had harder-edged drawings instead of the soft pastels. I found the detailed sketches of the building to be fascinating. I could actually watch this film with the sound off and just enjoy the artwork.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A classic tale of adventure and courage,"""One Hundred and One Dalmatians,"" released in 1961 by Walt Disney, is a charming and adventurous animated film that continues to captivate audiences of all ages. The story follows Pongo and Perdita, two dalmatians who embark on a daring mission to rescue their stolen puppies from the clutches of the nefarious Cruella de Vil.The film's animation, though dated by today's standards, possesses a unique and nostalgic charm.

Her portrayal as a villain is both menacing and darkly humorous, adding depth to the narrative.The plot is straightforward but engaging, blending moments of tension, humor, and heartwarming family bonds. The journey across the English countryside is beautifully depicted, showcasing the resourcefulness and bravery of the animal characters.The musical score by George Bruns complements the film perfectly, with memorable songs like ""Cruella de Vil"" adding to its enduring appeal. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing each character to life with distinctive personalities.Overall, ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" is a delightful and timeless film that combines adventure, humor, and heart.

Spotted Friends,"The cartoon ""101 Dalmatians"" is another, already the seventeenth animation project from the Walt Disney company. The picture was published in 1961, but even after so many decades, it is definitely worth enjoying the bright atmosphere and fascinating history.The atmosphere of the cartoon is simply permeated with a unique charm. Every frame, every scene is built with exceptional taste, convey the unique charm and flavor of the era. The animation of the past is well recognized, certain habits of the characters are also present, the presence of bright colors is on the spot. Looking through the picture, it's like plunging into the world of the old school of animation. Colorful characters, picturesque locations - all this simply fascinates and takes the viewer into a magical world.However, it's not just the atmosphere that makes this cartoon so memorable. The story that the creators tell the audience in the cartoon, I think, will forever remain in the hearts and souls of many generations. This is a story about true love, friendship and courage that overcome any difficulties. Yes, it's a fairy tale. Yes, it's magic. But it is precisely such projects that teach us to believe in miracles.The painting aims to highlight the most important topics of everyday life of society. The authors tell how important it is to remember to protect and take care of weak and defenseless creatures. The cartoon shows that every animal has the right to a happy and safe life, that shelter can be found if you are brave and fight for your friends.The cartoon has long been a true classic, which has not lost its charm over the years. It is deservedly recognized as one of the best animated films of all time and gave people a lot of joyful moments that will be remembered for a lifetime.

Walt himself lamented that it too expensive to justify continued operation, but having an attachment for the medium with its initial success having been instrumental to Walt's early success. Ub Iwerks was able to get One Hundred and One Dalmations produced more economically through the usage of Xerox photography which had been experimented with in animation for the thorn vines in Sleeping Beauty and was utilized more extensively in the Disney animated short film Goliath II. Thanks to utilization of the process the film was able to be produced for half the budget of the traditional ink and paint process, and while less graceful and smooth in comparison it served well with the more contemporaneous setting inspired by the works of illustrator Ronald Searle (though this would be a sticking point between the film's Art Director Ken Anderson and Walt Disney). The film became a massive hit upon release making more than quadruple its budget and helped to keep Disney animation afloat. The movie itself is enjoyable, but admittedly it feels more conventional and safe than previous Disney animated features.The movie is certainly unique in the Disney lineup in that it's definitely the most contemporary piece portrayed by Disney animation which up to this point (save for maybe some of the shorts) had always tried to convey more fantastical or historical environments with the most recent set film produced being Lady and the Tramp set in 1909. Looking at One Hundred and One Dalmations, it's unmistakable that the London portrayed is very much in the vain of the ""mod"" era with a number of iconographical and stylistic references to that era, coupled with the artistic style that's more inspired by magazine and newspaper illustrations, the style works rather well.The characters are all fairly decent. Rod taylor does well as the voice of Pongo with his voice conveying the same level of charm, humor and charisma seen in his live-action performances and the rest of the cast do well to suit themselves to the material. I wouldn't say there are too many standouts, but there are some memorable characters and performances littered throughout. David Frankham's performance as a tabby cat named Sergeant Tibbs is one of the standout characters in the film who plays a large role in the second act and is both likable and funny, he does well playing a good natured but put-upon character you want to see succeed. Frederick Worlock and J. Pat O'Malley also have fun playing the two goons Horace and Jasper who's dynamic and well timed slapstick lead to some humorous moments, but by far the best performance is Betty Lou Gerson as lead villain Cruella de Vil who's voice fits the fantastic design of this frail withered woman underneath a grotesquely oversized fur coat remarkably well conveying the characters phony attempts at charm as well as her hair trigger temper.One Hundred and One Dalmatians is an okay comic caper. It lacks a lot of the ""magic"" and ambition of its predecessors going instead for a more conventional approach, but its contribution to keeping the struggling animation department of Disney studios afloat cannot be overlooked even it's success came from an admittedly just ""okay"" movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Fun Film For Children,"ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS (ANIMATED) **** Disney studios intended to give this movie a more softer, toned-down look that may be visually refreshing to you.

An absolutely fabulous movie,"For the past 20 years, whenever someone asks my favorite Disney movie, I have always said Peter Pan. And I still do. But every time I watch this movie I love it even more. The animation is different than any of Disney's other movies, making it very intriguing. I love the story, the characters and the humor. The TV that the dogs watch is hysterical and there are so many other fantastic lines and jokes. I have always loved this movie. I even have a stuffed dog named after Pongo. And though I will always have a special place in my heart for Peter Pan, I wonder if, as I get older, this movie will replace it as my favorite. While other Disney movies (such as, at times, Peter Pan) are entertaining for nostalgia's sake or when you're in the mood to feel like a kid, this movie is entertainment for all ages. Smartly written, cleverly animated and all around entertaining, 101 Dalmatians is a movie you will love in every stage of your life. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pure Disney classic,"ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS, in my opinion, is a pure Disney classic. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Pongo (voice of Rod Taylor) and Perdita (voice of Cate Bauer) set out on their mission. If you ask me, Cruella (voice of Betty Lou Gerson), Horace (voice of Frederick Worlock), and Jasper (voice of J. Pat O'Malley) were truly devious. If I were Pongo or Perdita, I'd probably do the same thing they did. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has done it again. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney classic to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Inferior spiritual successor to Lady and the Tramp,"What really bothers me about this film is the fact we had just gotten a much better film about animated dogs from Disney. It was called Lady and the Tramp, and it was amazing. As such, a tale about even more dogs, this time without the warmth and the charm of the previous ones, just didn't feel as successful.Problem number one, Pongo and Perdita. I just don't get these two. They're supposed to be the main couple, the heroic parents who save their children, but I don't get anything from them. Their owners, Roger and Anita, are a great couple, one of the best of the so called beta couples Disney has ever done. But the main couple. Nope, don't work.The second problem, the copying. A lot of this movie's plot lines and scenes have been copied from previous Disney movies. Mainly from Lady and the Tramp. It's not really all that noticeable if you don't watch them back to back, but if you do, it's kind of blatant. Plus the animation style utilizes a lot of copying because of the new Xerox method of animation that allowed them to animate all those individual dalmatian puppies without going stark raving mad. Which I give them props for. This movie looks noticeably rougher when compared to the ones before it, but it is a very impressive technical achievement anyway.The first good side, the villain. Cruella De Vil has since achieved almost legendary status as a Disney villain, and for a reason. She's petty, nauseatingly glamorous without any of the grace that usually goes with it, just one push away from cuckoo land and absolutely mad about fur even when not pushed. In a word she's memorable, even though her actual plan is really not that ambitious when compared to her brethren. She just wants a coat.The second good side, the music. This film has some great tunes, from the classic Cruella De Vil to the opening scene with its early 20th century London suburbia.As a whole this movie is something of an uneven package. It has definite upsides, but also equally as definite downsides. It is a very good film, don't get me wrong, great even, but only when not compared to other Disney films too vigorously. Still, definitely a classic children's film by any meaning of the term.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the More Impressive Looking Films of its Era,"It's amazing that this film came out n 1961 considering the quality of its presentation. I don't necessarily have a seasoned eye for quality of animation, but I found myself impressed witnessing the animation from the opening credits sequence alone. I could be wrong, and maybe this isn't an impressive film visually, but for me, I really enjoyed the quality of the animation in this film.One of the more difficult things to do with a film like this is, when you have 99 characters, giving each, or even some, of them distinct personalities can be difficult, yet this film manages to pull that off. It isn't perfect, but if given to any other animation studio, I'm not sure if they would have managed to pull something like what this film was able to off.This film is well-written and while it is a fairly straightforward story, there is something to be enjoyed about this film for all ages.The soundtrack for this film is remarkably good, featuring different styles of music ranging from the classic Disney sound from the 1950s up to the more kinetic sound of jazz and bebop. It's certainly one of Disney's more overlooked soundtracks in my opinion.One Hundred and One Dalmatians is a film that is possibly among the more overlooked part of the collection of animated films released by Disney. While previous Disney films that are considered classics by many didn't really do anything for me, this film still retains its value that I remember it having from my childhood. Yes, perhaps I might be a bit biased as when I was a kid I watched this film on VHS just short of wearing the tape out. It's still an enjoyable film today and takes the viewer on a still-quite enjoyable adventure. I recommend it to anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mixed feelings,At first I was awestruck at how it was all hand drawn and thought it gave it a nice traditional touch but as it went on it was more like watching a moving painting than s movie I'm so used to the much higher levels of animation today. I have a feeling those who remember watching the original will still love the nostalgic feel but other viewers will likely find the change to much to rate to highly although it was still somewhat enjoyable. For me the remake I grew up on as a kid starring Glenn Close was better but I know many will disagree and I can understand why.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful Classic from Disney,"One Hundred and One Dalmations (1961)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Delightful Disney classic has the evil Cruella De Vil trying to steal ninety-nine Dalmatian pups so that she can turn them into a lavish fur coat.It's funny but ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS is a film that I never really cared too much for as a kid but seeing it for the first time in probably fifteen years certainly made a world of difference because I never realized how fun and how extremely dark the film was. As far as characters there's no question that the film offers some of the most memorable in any Disney movie. This includes the two Dalmatian dogs and their fifteen pups as well as the two humans and of course there's the wonderful villain. All of these characters are given their own delightful personalities and it's rather amazing to see how much character they actually have.Another major plus is of course the animation, which is excellent as you'd expect. Add in a good tune and there are all sorts of wonderful elements here. Heck, I mentioned how great the main characters were but even the supporting characters are extremely entertaining. Another thing that the film has going for it is how dark it actually is. I mean, the plot involves cute little puppies being killed and skinned. You can't get much darker than that.ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS has wonderful characters and plenty of nice laughs making it a classic.",,Anonymous,Animation

Go ahead and watch this movie if you want, but I like the 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure sequel better. At least in that film, Patch got to be the star and he wasn't as annoying.

The dog characters were all great and we loved the couple who owned the dogs and the maid. Cruella de Ville is the best Disney villain of all time in my opinion too she is so evil and insane and gets a great come upping in the end.

"A Classic Disney Premise, Perhaps Hampered by Budget Constraints","A mad mistress gathers spotted puppies, including a freshly-stolen litter of fifteen from a small metropolitan family, to harvest their pelts and produce a line of fur coats. When the lost pups' parents send out a distress call, half the hounds of London take the case and the great chase begins. The theme and tone are fitting for a Disney picture, retaining some of the fantasy elements that first brought the studio to fame, while continuing the lean in a slightly darker direction that would continue throughout the next thirty years. Disney Animation had to cut some corners to make this one, after Sleeping Beauty underperformed at the box office, and many of those cost-saving measures show up in the finished product. Xeroxed and reused character animations are abundant, artwork often seems rushed and over-simplified, and the extensive use of rotoscoping is often distracting. It's also a very short film, running just an hour and nineteen minutes with credits, and the story suffers for that brevity: villainess Cruella De Vil's great comeuppance seems short-lived and inconsequential, while the focal family's happy reunion comes off as narrow and happenstance. There's also very little music in the picture, surprisingly so considering the human father's occupation as an always-working composer, which makes for a less jolly, wholesome vibe than one might expect. It isn't bad - the core characters are charming and they're aided by a full, well-rounded supporting cast - but it does seem terribly shallow and borderline incomplete. The beginning of a difficult transition away from the days when the studio was churning out classics every other year.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
incorrect grammar,"A vile creep-ette kidnaps a bunch of little dogs and the parents go out to look for them. Yeah, we know. I liked it when ""The Simpsons"" did a semi-spoof of ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", with Mr. Burns trying to turn Santa's Little Helper's children into clothing.Speaking of the title, I should identify that the title is incorrect grammar. It should be ""One Hundred One"", as ""One Hundred and One"" means 100.1.Speaking of dalmatians, here's something that I learned from the movie ""State and Main"": they were named after the island of Dalmatia, near Croatia, almost 2,000 years ago. The ancient Romans were also considering naming them after Sardinia. Had they gone with the latter, this movie would be called ""101 Sardines""!Anyway, I just like poking fun at big, pompous Disney movies (my reviews of ""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" were even loonier).

They're not for sale.,"Though Cruella De Vil is as iconic as her reputation would imply (certainly sitting among the long-running studio's best villains), 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)' is much more than just the vehicle for her success. It's a charming, down-to-earth adventure that sees two dogs go on the hunt for their missing children who have been kidnapped for their spotted fur. The film has a scratchy aesthetic (a by-product of its time-saving animation techniques) but it's still very appealing, smoothly conveying its canine shenanigans and bumbling burglary.

Probably the worst' film I've seen from Disney's animated department,"One hundred and one Dalmatians may be a classic' animated film, according to the package it comes in, but I personally felt that there were too many things missing to even call this memorable. First of all the animation was not good (especially if you compare it to Snow White which dates back from 1937) and second of all the story was not that compelling. It was not very thrilling and it was neither as charming nor as funny as I am used of most Walt Disney's animated features. It could certainly be me, but I wasn't moved or charmed by all that puppies at all. I mean they had no real depth and I did not get any chance to grow to like them, before or during their captivity. Despite that this is not total rubbish though. The pacing is adequate and it does not get boring. The thing is, that this is just not up to Walt Disney's standards. I liked Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs much better and therefore recommend you watch that film instead if you want to see a Disney classic. But hey I am a grown up and if you want to start your kids on Disney animation, I guess this is one you can start with. If you just want to see the story of those cute little dogs I suggest you watch 101 Dalmatians or 102 Dalmatians (both live action).

"TV, car chases, kidnappings... 1961 marks Walt Disney's entrance in Modernity...","It wasn't called Disney Renaissance for nothing: in 1989, ""The Little Mermaid"" was the first animated Disney to feature a princess in thirty years, the last one being ""Sleeping Beauty"". With that in mind, the first Disney animated feature to be released after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a starter in its own right, opening an era of uneven productions that can be assimilated to dark ages. Although perceived as classics they never inspire the same glee in the eye than the likes of ""Snow White"" and ""Pinocchio"" or ""Mermaid"" and ""Lion King"". But ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" has aged better than most of its contemporary, maybe enough to compete with the legitimate masterpieces.Now, do kids really care about these technicalities? Speaking for myself, this film is one of my earliest memories, and by that I mean very early. I had vague and foggy visions of the encounter between Pongo and Perdita (and their masters Roger and Anita) in the park, I never forgot the face of Cruella De Vil who was the first villain I could put a name on, and as a kid who was a bit cowardly, I used to hide uncer a table during the TV scene. I simply hated that startling moment where the villainous cowboy's face occupied the whole screen and scared the hell out of Patch, and me in the process (quite a ""mise en abime""). I avoided watching, and later renting, the film maybe because of that moment, but the film didn't avoid me for all that.Indeed, one of the first books I started to read at the age of 5 was based on the film and at the same time, I used to watch the Disney Channel program and to those who remember, the intro started with the iconic picture of the polka-dotted canine family staring at the TV. This is just the stuff your nostalgia is made on, you can't control it. And for all these reasons, I simply can't formulate a critic against the film without feeling like I'm betraying my inner child. But I'll let the adult speak a little: after Christmas, I bought my daughter four Disney classics and I couldn't resist the temptation. I had to see the Dalmatians, three decades after the first complete viewing. Enough with the princesses, ""Frozen"" and 'let-it-go!' message, how about a family- friendly film about a dog family.After all these dragon fights and dazzling magic tricks from ""Sleeping Beauty"", there's a sort of cozy and relaxing little charm ""Dalmatians"", conveyed through that opening scene where Pongo tries to find the perfect girl for his master and culminating in the park. The next scene is a revolution; TV in a Disney film. This is an acknowledgment of the role the little screen played on Disney's expansion, and what a wonderfully crafted moment with these puppies staring at their dog hero while we stare at them. TV would even play a part to the story as the two thugs Horace and Jasper will delay their mission because they want to watch ""What's My Crime?"" on TV. As a big fan of the ""What's My Line"" channel on Youtube, I was surprised to find a parody of the program on a Disney film.But then I remembered that even the great Walt Disney came to the show and promoted the opening of Disney World (or was it Land?). Disney was a pioneer in the sense that he could anticipate the tastes of people but he could also disconcert the expectations and make something like ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", a family oriented film in the purest sense of the world, perhaps the only Disney with a united family not affected by death, and a great message about it. Even that powerful doggy SOS where, one howl to another, dogs communicate in order to find the puppies find some strong echoes in our era affected by sad kidnapping stories. ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" marks an unexpected entrance from Walt Disney in modernity.Of course, it had a few undesirable effects such as the constant recycling of images (I spotted that the image of Roger lighting his pipe was reused three or four times) but this is not as blatant as the case of ""Sword in the Stone"" or ""The Aristocats"" and there's obviously an element in the drawing of these little dogs (and the big ones, too) that is admirable. The sketchy drawing and seemingly static background never bothered me anyway because they fit the very kind of stories Disney would start to tell. And the way Cruella De Vil looks is integral to her appeal, she indeed looks like a devil, a monster, but she might be the most 'human' of all Disney villains, maybe the character modern audience can most relate too, she's crazy, obsessive, narcissistic, but she's a woman who backs up her words with actions, she embodies the darkest side of the 'woman-power' and contributes to one of the most thrilling climactic sequences from Disney. Can you believe that after a dragon fight, the next Disney featured a car chase, and one that holds up pretty well by today's standards.So, it doesn't come as a surprise that she was listed among the Top 50 Greatest Villains from the Top 50 villains of the American Film Insitute's List among the Evil Queen and the Man from ""Bambi"", not a bad company. So for the villain, the positive message about family (maybe the only Disney where it's a central theme) and the whole 'great escape' plot, ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", if not the best, is perhaps one of the most endearing Disney features.(And I just noticed this is the 100th review this film got, next reviewer will be happy)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Review for One Hunderd and One Dalmatians,"This was an animated feature that I'll be honest, I didn't realize was as old as it was when my sister and I watched it growing up. I believe that we had it on VHS so my guess is that it came out of the vault or they did a re-issue of it so my dad bought it. He was a collector of movies and he knew that we liked it, he wanted to make sure we had it on hand. We were fans of the animal based films from Disney during this era, so that helped as well.Now something I didn't realize until putting this on for my daughter, Mackenzie, was that this was based on a story of the same name. I'm not shocked as that was Disney's move. They would take properties that were already proven and then do a movie based on it. I do commend them due to the success of what they've done over the years.To give a recap here, this tells the story of a dog named Pongo (voiced by Rod Taylor) as he tries to a find a mate for his owner, Roger Radcliffe (voiced by Ben Wright). What I love here is that he's basing his determination on the dogs that other owners have. It works in his favor though when he finds Perdita (voiced by Cate Bauer) and her owner, Anita Dearly (voiced by Lisa Davis).The two get married and then the dogs have puppies. The litter is made up of 15. This though draws the attention of Anita's school friend of Cruella De Vil (voiced by Betty Lou Gerson). Roger isn't a fan. He even makes up a song about her. Perdita is terrified of this woman and it shocks Pongo.Things take a turn when two men, Jasper (voiced by J. Pat O'Malley) and Horace (voiced by Frederick Worlock), strong arm their way into the house to steal the dogs. It becomes big news and the animals around London rallied to help Pongo and Perdita find the missing puppies. Their litter aren't the only ones that have been taken either.What I'll say here is that I love the animation that Disney did during this era. They're able to match up dogs with their owners so well and it adds charm. It is also a good touch to have Taylor doing the voice of Pongo, as that just gives him a sense of not only arrogance, but also a suaveness. How they're able to make the puppies look cute, giving them each their own personality as well. This is just well done across the board there.Something else that I find interesting is how villainous they make Cruella. She is willing to kidnap a hundred puppies to make fur coats from. She is deplorable for the idea. There's something else here is that her, Jasper and Horace are missing the dogs getting away because they don't believe them to be as intelligent as they are. This is something that I find to be ahead of its time because in the real world, they're right. There's no way that all these animals could coordinate like they do, but for whatever reason, it works here. It adds charm for sure that only a cartoon can do.This one is still one of the better animated features from this run of Disney that I appreciate. It held up for me and that includes the little song that Roger made up that I still quote.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Everything about her is so over the top and volcanic. She of course wears her signature black dress with a white fur coat all throughout the movie. Then always smoking a cigarette with a red holder, green smoke bellowing from it constantly. Her design and look to her is so detailed and correct for her kind of character. And then Of course, we have her car, her red classic Cadillac that she drives crazily everywhere. Her driving is so much of who Cruella is lol, I remember loving that as a kid, that's really where most of the action in the film stems from. On to the other characters. Anita and Rodger are great innocent characters that have good romantic chemistry, pongo and perdita are really Rodger and Anita just in animal version. The plot is darker than most current animated films, but kids can handle it, they'll certainly have loads of fun watching these animals try desperately to escape Cruella's clutches.

"Crazy Cruella, Disney just Excels","It is perhaps ironic-or hardly-that 'One Hundred and One Dalamtians' was made during the year I was born. It certainly had a profound influence on my childhood. Almost 'living' in the cinema with other films, I don't think I saw repeated showings as much as this. I once went to a matinée of it with a friend and his family. I sneaked behind under a seat while it was still dark in the cinema to see it through again. Needless to say, when leaving, the family wondered where I'd got to. Such antics can only be attributed to one character, Cruella De Ville. Disney's talents, and those who were the voices, just oozed with the villains, (and esses). Eleanor Audley's voice is fantastic as the wicked Maleficent in the 'Sleeping Beauty,' but nothing quite matches the combined animated effects with the voice of Betty Lou Gerson. I guess it was this that held a peculiar obsession and fascination, and I suppose, addiction. I love the scenes which portray Cruella's crazed outbursts and demented frustrations. Her reaction when Roger refuses to sell the puppies: 'you wait, you'll be sorry. You fools! You idiots!' And her crazed frustration when finding Jasper and Horace haven't done the dirty work; grabbing the liquor from Jasper and flinging the bottle and its contents in the fire, and blasting the door shut after clenching her hands with, 'I'll...l'll call the police. DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!'causing the plaster to crack, are some of the most memorable. 'You know, I think she means it Jasper.' Not to mention the crazy car chase at the end. The colonel's muddling, 'Puddles' and 'Pingo,' is always quite hilarious. Apart from the English diction in these voices which isn't emulated any more, the film will always be a timeless classic and first rate for any student learning British English. I couldn't agree more with the commentator who said that Cruella's character animation 'doesn't come better than this.'Disney was getting better and better.",,Anonymous,Animation
another forgotten classic,101 Dalmatians is a very good movie indeed which is said more for its sequel which had to be one of the worst sequels. The live action 1996 version was good but no where near as good as this. The animation is wonderful and the characters are great I love Jasper and Horace they were wonderful and funny to watch I love their Truck I think this has to be one of the most forgotten classics and getting ruined by a sequel which Sucked. I was watching this movie again one youtube and I gotta say its still good to watch. The puppies are cute and this movie has to get another chance so please give it another chance I give this a 9.1 out of 10 still wrath watching,9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of my favorites from Disney,I love dogs and I love London so it only makes sense that I love this movie so much. I thought the twilight bark was interesting for some reason.

Alright Disney Animation Film,This is a fine enough Disney animation film for all viewers to watch. There was plenty of room of improvement for the crew to create this Disney animation better and stronger but it was still alright to watch. The storyline of this Disney animation was simple and straightforward and weak. It could have been a whole lot better if the crew had added some extra effort and strength. The cast selection could have been a whole lot better and stronger. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry displayed throughout this entire Disney animation film between the cast members.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good humanity on display!!,"Pongo and Hattie, the pups' parents could be Lady and the Tramp a bit further down the road while Cruella De Ville follows the models of preceding Disney female baddies, only with even more flounce and extravagance. Apart from the ""Cruella De Ville"" song, there's a distinct lack of musical interludes, which serves the purposes of the one-long-chase plot-line reasonably well. There's gentle humour as you'd expect and a tolerable running gag with the little pup that's forever hungry. I thought the best sequence though was right at the start when Pongo persuaded his owner to cosy up to Mattie's in the park, but the narrative manages to engage all the way through with the ""human"" characters also achieving sufficient degrees of personality to embellish the tale before the obligatory happy ending. You'd have to be pretty hard-hearted not to enjoy this delightful animation which I took pleasure in doing today for the very first time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Best Disney Movies Ever!,"101 Dalmations is perhaps the Best Disney film ever made. The story, characters, animation, detail, colour and music was spot on. I mean who doesn't love this movie? Cruella De Vil is definitely one of the best Disney Villains of all time. She's wonderfully evil and cruel. Skinning puppies is quite a ruthless plan which can scare audiences. We can easily see that the animators have out a lot of work into this film. The voice talents were cast perfectly. Betty Lou Gerson nailed it as Cruella.101 Dalmations is a film which should be remembered and treasured forever.Thanks for reading.",,Anonymous,Animation
Cute film for sure,"I'll just say it. One Hundred And One Dalmations is just seriously cute. It's dark plot is covered by it's sweetness, but that isn't a bad thing.All those little puppies are cute, especially Patch and Lucky. I like how the accents matched the location, which is London, England. A lot of films don't cut that these days.Anyway, even though it was sort of predictable, it's a really good movie that Disney fans should see. It's sweet, funny, and a woman(Cruella De Vil) who wants to make coat out of puppy skins, wow, one of the darkest plots I've seen. But don't worry, like I said the sweetness and cuteness cover that up. So yeah, Great cute film!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spot-on brilliant.,"My Take: An irresistible Disney classic.It's probably a bit strange to say this 1961 Disney animated movie as one of their best animate films in the Golden Age of the studio. Still, I ask no apologies. 101 DALMATIANS is a sweet, clever and splendidly entertaining animated adventure and, in my opinion, one of the very best films in their classic era. But lets face it! Although I took a fonding of Disney's classic animated films, some of them (PETER PAN comes to mind) are extremely overrated. So far as I've seen, only FANTASIA lives up to the term ""classic"", but then again, I haven't seen them all. But even if I did, I'll always have a space in my list of favorites for 101 DALMATIANS. Not only do I find it one of the very best Disney films, it's also on of the very best talking animal fables ever to hit your theaters.One of the aspects of the film is its villain. With the exception the Evil Stepmother and Maleficent, DALMATIANS' Cruella DeVille (voiced by Betty Lou Gerson) is an outrageous and colorfully written villain, and yes, the mention of her name brings in wonderful memories. But, although Cruella is one of the finest aspects of the film, there are other pleasures to behold. Mainly, the clever portrayal of its talking animals. With clever voice acting but mostly due to much more clever writing, the animal characters here don't just talk for our fondness, they talk with precise and clever speeches. The animal characters are far more intelligent and colorful than its human counterparts, but I guess that's what they meant to do. In fact, sometimes throughout the film, I can almost see a sort of human personality among all of the animals, be it cats, dogs or the dalmatians, one and all.The animation has its flaws, and the energy level drops at a rather low point midway, but the film never failed to cheer me up. Colorful characters, beloved animation and no lack of energy help make this little Disney film a big delight. Now, if your still looking for an apology when I say 101 DALMATIANS is one of the best Disney movies ever, your probably better of not reading this review in the first place. I make no apologies about it, 101 DALMATIANS is terrific, if not flawless, entertainment. Bundle up the kids!Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Straitforward Classic,"101 Dalmatians is a straightforward animated classic whose brilliance is in its details. The plot is an uncomplicated kids story--a young couple own two dogs that have dalmatian puppies, but an evil friend of the couple wants the puppies for an unclear purpose. It turns out that she wants to kill them and use their coats for a fashion experiment, and after the couple decides not to sell her the puppies, she sends a couple of hired goons to kidnap them. The goons do their job, but the puppies escape and the chase is on.101 Dalmatians sounds like a kids' movie, and it is a kids' movie, but like all good Disney movies, this film resonates with adults as well. The key aspect is the villain, Cruella de Vil, who is one of those people that you occasionally run across and wish you hadn't. Cruella is quite simply an evil person, someone so self-involved that she really does not care about others at all. What makes her effective is that we know people like this, but sometimes we want to believe that they do not really exist. The film makes us confront them, makes us deal directly with a person evil enough to kill 99 helpless puppies for a simple fashion conceit. The effect is creepy enough to really make me feel for this family of dogs whose objective is only to live happily, and whose handicap is simple human greed and conceit. It is really very powerful.And what about child viewers? Oddly enough, they will not be traumatized by this movie as much as they might be. The reason is that the battle between good and evil is treated with real gentleness, and the good characters have great moments in the film. A scene where it appears that one of Pongo's puppies is born dead is treated with tremendous sensitivity. Another scene where Pongo and Perdita agree to take along another 84 orphan dalmatians rather than leave them behind for Cruella also is one that makes us cheer. Also, much of the conflict is treated with a comic flair that puts us at ease with some actually quite disturbing situations, and seems to deflate Cruella's menace.The result is that this is a great movie for kids. Evil Cruella is not sugar-coated but is put in proper perspective, a really impressive feat for a movie like this. At the same time, the movie is a thriller, a love story, a critique of the social class system, and an adventure film. It is a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Animation Classic,"One of Walt Disney's popular animated movie 101 Dalmatians!!!!! It has a wonderful story of pongo and Perdita with their ""Pets"" Roger and Anita. they have 15 puppies together and they all get captured by one of Disney's most memorable villains Cruella DeVil!!!!! The animal fashion lover.This has absolutely great animation with no help of computer graphics. This movie is a treasure of Disney's films.This was the first Disney movie with the use of the Xerox process. Even though Disney did not like the style of the animation and background. He was happy that it made such a success.I love the movie and that it's awesome that it will not be forgotten anytime soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
My favorite movie as a kid,"This was Disney's last animated film made when ""Uncle Walt"" was still alive and in good health. First off, I love the way the story actually tried to stay true to the source material, unlike, unfortunately, many later Disney films.Just a side note here and a pet peeve. If you have a child that loves this movie, get them the original book by Dodie Smith, NOT the books Disney makes. If it's one thing Disney does that I cannot stand, it's taking real works of literature and making not only an animated version, but their own ""book version"". Ick.As for the artistic style... some people on this board are way too young to remember, but the cartoon style of the late 1950's early 1960's took a sharp turn toward the abstract, and realism was frowned upon for years. It's no wonder 101 Dalmations looks different from most other ""old school"" Disney films. Honestly, they got away with as much realism as was accepted at the time in the graphic design and art community.This film is very well paced, with lots of wit and style and well written characters. Cruella is one of the great villains, and the puppies are adorable. I loved this as a kid, but even as an adult I can see that it works on many different levels.",,Anonymous,Animation
Worth it for the villains,"The one good thing about One Hundred and One Dalmatians is undoubtedly the villains. Cruella De Vil has no difficulties stealing the show as the personification of evil. Credit goes to her two partners in crime as well, they make for a nice comedic counterpart.On the other hand, the dogs themselves are nothing to write home about. They try too hard to be cute and as a result they come off as annoying and spoiled, not to mention there's no way of telling them apart. The fact that the plot is highly predictable and the rule that the good guys, in this case the dogs, have to prevail, no matter how impossible the odds are, doesn't help either.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A cute and heartwarming puppy masterpiece,"Based on the novel of the same name by Dodie Smith, 101 Dalmatians takes place in London where Pongo, a male dalmatian, is living in London with his master, Roger, a bachelor songwriter who has yet to sell his first tune. Bored with their single existence, Pongo arranges for Roger to meet Anita, a pretty young woman who just happens to have a female Dalmatian named Perdita. It is not long before love blossoms all around and a double wedding takes place. A few months later, Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies, much to the delight of Cruella De Vil, a wealthy, wicked former schoolmate of Anita's whose burning passion is to own a coat made of Dalmatian pelts. When she is unable to purchase the puppies, she has them ""dognapped"" and brought to her crumbling estate in the country, where 84 other Dalmatians are also being held captive. All attempts by the police to find the missing pups fail, and the desperate Pongo and Perdita appeal to the dogs of London, via the ""twilight bark."" Led by The Colonel, an indomitable shaggy dog and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs, all other dogs comes to the rescue and, aided by geese, cows, and horses, tracks down the missing puppies.Is 101 Dalmatians on par with earlier Disney classics a few decades later? You bet it is! The animation is extremely beautiful with cute character animation. The songs are catchy and well-executed I could hum ""Cruella De Vil"" for nearly five minutes. The voice acting is pretty good and the story is unbelievably touching that could bring tears to their eyes and mixes courage, humor, suspense, and bravery extremely well with very amazing chase scenes. 101 Dalmatians is Disney's masterpiece of the classic 60s and would recommended as one of the greatest works ever made.

One of the Best,"One of the best films I watched as a child; 101 Dalmatians is great family entertainment. A story of two lonely people and their dogs that brought them together. It's a really endearing story about family and loyalty; Roger and Anita and their pets against Cruella. If you haven't seen this film, you're missing a great story and experience.Fans of Disney will especially love 101 Dalmatians as its pure magic, from the story to the voice cast; including Rod Taylor (from The Time Machine). One of the funniest characters is Rolie, an overweight male pup who's always hungry. And there's Sgt. Tibbs the cat, his interactions with Horace and Jasper are pretty darn hilarious too.This was one of the forst animated films from Disney to receive the live action treatment, which occurred in 1996. The live action version wasn't bad, but the original is always best. In 2004, the animated 101 Dalmatians was followed by a sequel, Patch's London Adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Onne of Disney's underrated films,"One-Hundred and One Dalmatians is about two Dalmatians who along with their owners find love. They have some puppies which are kidnapped by the vile Cruella DeVille, a woman who wishes to use 101 Dalmatians to make into a fur coat.It's one Disney's funnier films, there're a lot of fun characters. Cruella is a different villain in the way that she doesn't have a lot of screen time and the scenes in which she is on screen are fleeting and just focused on showing her as a scary character.The animation is a little different in a couple parts. Scenes of snowfall looks quite different then other scenes. The Walt Disney Studios were looking for quicker ways to animate scenes and thus varying techniques were used.
But overall it adds to the films uniqueness.

Another good piece of Walt Disney-produced animation,"This 1961 animated feature is one of the films that Walt Disney produced during the last decade of his life, and one of the Disney films I remember seeing in my childhood. I was born nearly twenty years after Walt's death, but saw many Disney movies as a kid, some of which were produced by him and others made by the company after he died. ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" was one of them, even though I didn't see this one as many times as I saw certain other Disney features during the 90's, and couldn't remember it as clearly. I watched it for the first time in probably over a decade in 2007, and again nearly three years later. I can usually expect these films to still impress me after all these years, including this one.A Dalmatian dog named Pongo lives in a London flat with his single owner (or ""pet,"" as he is referred to), Roger, who plays the piano and writes songs. Bored with single life, the dog sees a female Dalmatian named Perdita with her female owner, Anita, walking by the window, and thinks this is a perfect opportunity to get himself a mate and Roger a wife. He gets his owner to take him for a walk in the park so they can meet the pair, and as Pongo planned, they both find romance. Roger and Anita soon get married, as do Pongo and Perdita, and with the four of them now living together, it isn't too long before Perdita gives birth to a litter of puppies, fifteen in total. Cruella De Vil, an evil former schoolmate of Anita's, wants to buy all the puppies and make a coat out of them! After she is denied permission to buy any of them, she hires two men, Jasper and Horace, to kidnap the litter! After the police fail to find the kidnapped puppies, Pongo and Perdita must call upon other animals to help them try and find their missing young before it's too late!The animation in this film is a little different from that of the previous Disney efforts. It was the first Disney flick to use the photocopying technique. This worked out well, as the animation here is very good, especially with the backgrounds, showing an animated version of London and memorable images of winter countryside. ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" also has basically everything that usually makes Disney animations entertaining for all ages. It's often funny, with scenes such as Pongo and Colonel (an old sheepdog) struggling to communicate via barks, and many gags involving Jasper and Horace and sometimes the way Cruella treats these two. Also, the characters are well crafted and the adventure gets very exciting at times. There are some weaker spots in the film, such as the overlong piano playing near the beginning and the rushed scene showing Nanny the housekeeper's reaction when she finds the puppies are gone, but there's no need to dwell on these petty flaws when the film as a whole is so entertaining. Overall, it's another good piece of animation for the whole family to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great characters and Disney name save this film,"It cant be the animation, in my opinion the worstly done of all Disney movies to date. Dialog doesnt match lips at all, at some points people are talking without moving their lips at all. Things look hastily drawn, and the colors are drab and dark.What really makes this movie special is the characters, Cruella is a great villain. Of course all the cute puppies. Horris and Jasper make great lackies, and all the other rich characters I left out.When you add in the great score, and of course the all important Disney name, you get a decent well grossing family film. Nothing spectacular, but standard Disney fare. A ""7"".",,Anonymous,Animation
Dog and Pony Show,"With Disney Plus having rejigged their alphabetical list slightly ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" now sits with its ""101"" remakes and sequels near the top of the lists. This boosted it into becoming the next film I had to watch - which was unfortunate, as I do feel it's one of Disney's lesser titles.Roger (Ben Wright) and Anita (Lisa Davis) meet because of the interference of their respective Dalmatian dogs, Pongo (Rod Taylor) and Perdita (Cate Bauer). With both couples now together, Pongo and Perdita produce a litter of 15 puppies. They are abducted by henchmen for Anita's school friend, Cruella De Vil (Betty Lou Gerson) who intends to turn the puppies, along with 84 others into a fur coat. With humans useless, the dogs look to themselves to rescue the puppies.I have a lot of love for various Disney films from all era's, but ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" isn't one I really connected with as a child. Maybe it's because of that, that I found seeing it as an adult a rather dull and tedious affair. Visually it's interesting, as it marks a transition away from the hand drawn animation and the beginning of an automation era, but it's hardly beautiful - and lots of the animation, particularly the background work leaves something to be desired. There's only really one song of note, the Cruella De Vil song - but it's the story that really lets the film down. It's a bland procession of events, which doesn't build over the movies course and ends without anyone really learning anything, also the whole chain of barking aspect of the film takes' way too long.Cruella is an iconic villain, but that's really all that the film has going for it. Better films came before, and better films came after but for me, the silver age started with a whimper, rather than a bark.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Doggone Cute Film,"This is a very cute Disney film crime-mystery classic animated film. The story is not bad - it's pretty interesting. And Cruella De Vil really is a vile character because she wants the puppies to make a Dalmatian fur coat - I will admit she is a cool looking toon and sometimes funny with her anger but she is definitely one of Disney's most villainous characters - she tops the most evil list.Some reviewers are not fond of the animation (the actual artwork) in 101 Dalmatians. I personally like the art in this film - it has a dark or mysterious look and feel to it - so it's perfect for the story.The only thing I felt was missing from this movie was some catchy songs like most of Disney's film animations. This movie needed some jazz to spice it up just a bit (IMO).Want to make it a double feature?

101 Dalmatians barks onscreen with a barrage of spotted puppies.,"One thing that never ceases to amaze me is how timeless Disney animations are. 1961 and still better than the average modern animation, what more could one want? Dalmatian Pongo decides to find a wife for his master and a mate for himself, which eventually results in fifteen puppies being born. Old school friend Cruella De Vil wants the spotted fur of these puppies so she can make a new coat, to do this she hires henchmen to kidnap them and eighty four other puppies. What sets this film apart from the other classics in Disney's canon is just how small the story is. It's not a grandiose fairytale with fantastical magic, it's a crime chase set in both urban and rural London. Removing princesses, fairies and living puppets from the equation resulted in a more relatable plot that still conveyed the excitement and charm that Disney is famed for. The bachelor life in the first act, the portrayal of the ""Twilight Bark"" in the second act and the climatic car chase of the final act. Each segment exhumes delightfulness for both the human and canine characters that come together to create an enthralling story about family. The animation style was delicately crafted, from the cute bumbling puppies to the metropolitan streets of London, that unsurprisingly has stood the test of time. The human characters ooze essential British quirks that represent a flourishing love for their canine companions. Some of the puppies have the opportunity to push their own personality forward, such as Lucky, preventing them from being just a plot device. However, the main star is the maniacal fur speed demon herself, Cruella. An antagonist so deluded and crazed that she ranks in the top echelon of Disney villains, not an easy feat to accomplish. The outbursts, perfectly voiced by Gerson, were enough to put kids on edge! I just wished there was more closure for the character, especially after a nail biting chase sequence. Some of the supporting animal characters were not memorable enough, however everything else was spot on...*cough*!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Class Disney,"This is a film that is unabashedly aimed at the young at heart. You might think that that statement should be obvious with all Disney films, but alas, it is not. The plot seems to be taken straight out of a fairy tale, an evil witch wants to hurt children and must be stopped at all costs, causing a great quest. The puppies are cute, Cruella is one of the evilest witches put on screen by Disney animators, which is surprising as she appears to have no magical powers at all. Although the way her smoke stays in the air with a green kind of evil hue is wonderfully animated. Disney also does a wonderful job of animating the way that Roger smokes his pipe with disdain. The background of the film is also animated in a delightful way. There's so much baroque detail in the scenes of London that it harkens back to the detail of Pinocchio. That's surprising because the previous animated Disney film, Sleeping Beauty while gorgeously animated, had been a box office disappointment, so the company was trying to cut corners with its animation. But they hadn't descended into boring animation quite yet, and this is a real treat for the eye.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece,"A beautiful story about family and love, with lots of sugar from Disney. Still, we have some rather scary scenes for children, especially today, when the censors see that many things permeate their subconscious, but in 1961 things were different, and we could speak openly about death, or turn dogs into coats. The remake with Glenn Close does not detract from the original and follows the script almost to the letter, which is commendable. The traces of the drawings are very typical, like scribbles on paper, giving a water-colored beauty to the environments. It is worth showing this classic to the kids and then the remade version and let them decide which they liked the most.Film reviewed on January 5, 2020.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best cartoon movie ever,"This movie is amazing because the animation is so realistic and different; some of of the color is outside this lines and you can still see some pencil lines. In the art department... totally would give it a six star if I could. As far as character development and character personality, you can totally feel what they feel and see the sadness or happiness in their faces. The animation is so impeccable and moving that you can relate to the characters and see their points of view. So as far as the characters this movie, again, six stars. And of course we have the villain. Cruella DeVil is such an easy person to hate and loathe, and that is what makes her such a great villain.

Wow,"Review By Kamal KThe animation with hand drawn pictures is absolutely beautiful, and the voice acting is marvellous. You'll be terrified out of your seat by Cruella De Vil's vicious personality. Although it includes smoking scenes. 101 Dalmatians is a film you can put on for your kids if they're making a racket, and also a great choice for a family movie night. It has catchy songs, realistic dialogue and story, wonderful music ... I could go on forever!! These were the reasons why I gave it a straight-forward 9/10 star rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Almost a 10. A family favorite.,"Cruella is one of the best Disney villains and wonderfully drawn. If I could just ""cut-out"" the short scene where she slaps the two bumbling robbers and once again tells them to ""Kill"" those puppies. Otherwise, a joy to behold. No actual violence in the movie and several memorable scenes: The twilight bark. The black Labradors piling into the truck. Pongo considers his owner to be his ""pet"" human. Far superior to the (much) later live-action versions. Wonderful talking animals with outstanding voice casting. Stylized animation with simpler backgrounds and no shadows, but still very well animated. A family favorite to this very day. We always watch it with our dog beside us.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming and adorable,"My favorite thing about 101 Dalmatians has always been the animation style. It's super simple but it just works and it's just great to look at. Cruella is one of Disney's best villains, she's just so much fun. I have a few problems with some of the scenes, I feel like some of them drag on a bit, but I still love this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Timeless,"Timelessly beautiful animated feature about domestic bliss and middle-class solidarity, with just a whiff of sexism. The sheer amount of well-developed sidekick characters is amazing (and I don't mean the puppies)!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Superb,"Of all Disney's post-Golden Age work, One Hundred and One Dalmations is my favorite, though it oddly features many of the things which bug me about Disney's other post-sixties work. The production methods are cheaper, the structure more focused on various side characters than its protagonists, and clean-up methods are noticeably sloppier. These problems were due in tandem to the financial failure of Sleeping Beauty and to Walt Disney's waning interest in the animated feature department as he delved more into his theme park (anyone who thinks Disney's input into the animated features is oversold because he didn't draw anything for it need only compare Disney's early work with that toward and after the end of his life to see how vital he was to the process).What makes it work regardless is its style. Disney brought in the input and influence of the great cartoonist Ronald Searle, and combined this with Ken Anderson's UPA esquire art direction (which had previously been explored in shorts like Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom). I'll also defend the xeroxing methods as having been an initially positive development, which allowed the animation to appear much more organic and handdrawn. Granted, it hinders believability at first, but it brings out a pleasing gutsiness and exciting individuality that I wish hadn't been wasted after The Jungle Book. For once, the human characters work as much as the animals, as the animators just the right balance between caricature and realism.Everyone is on their A-Game here, from John Lounsbery's comic animation on Horace and Jasper (an obvious influence on Sylvain Chomet) to Milt Kahl's consummate professionalism on Pongo and Roger (which isn't his most theatrical stuff, but does its job perfectly). As always, though, it's the villain who gets to have the most fun, and Marc Davis delivers his masterpiece with Cruella de Vil. Years later, Milt Kahl would respond to this marvelously bombastic work, which makes a brilliantly imposing use of her fur coat, with Medusa in The Rescuers. For a master like that, who considered himself (with good reason) to be the finest of Disney's animators, to attempt to one up a colleague is saying something. Not that this makes the animation better or worse, but I'll also point out that there was a single animator who worked for two years and the accuracy of the dots on the damn dags. The climax also remains one of the finest action scenes in American animation, a school of animation that I usually find far too conservative in terms of action.Rather than splinter the narrative with its many characters, I think they work with the design to make this film's world one of the most fun to watch in any Disney film. To me, it seems heavily influenced by Hitchcock, making this the only Disney movie of this period to feel a bit like a thriller (only instead of being framed, Pongo and Perdita simply lack the speech functions to go to the useless men who are only good for burning down Bambi's forest anyway). The ensemble nature prevents it from being truly Hitchcockian, but the cast of characters met along the way do recall films like The 39 Steps or Saboteur. Nearly every one of the characters are enjoyable and add to the narrative without intruding too much upon it (aside from the collie, who doesn't leave much of an impression other than his poorly animated fur). Captain and Sgt. Tibbs are especially ludicrous and delightful, in how they represent the most ragtag military unit imaginable. Even the entirely irrelevant television sections are great satiric fun.My one big complaint is that Roger and Anita wind up disappearing through the entire second and most of the third act, but it's not too big an issue in the long run, this being an animal story after all. Other problems are minor matters of animation. While I'll continue to insist that the Xerox methods had serious virtues, the reused animation is jarring (though in the case of this film, it's much more skillfully used than in later works that abused it).For these reasons, I love One Hundred and One Dalmations. It's witty, fun to look at, and highly entertaining. Alas, it also marks a final triumph before a steep decline, which didn't hurt the sixties work too much but crippled Disney in the seventies, and even the next few Disney films had their problems.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Puppy's Favorite Movie,I was watching this Movie for a little nostalgia That i love from this movie and its beautiful animation and my puppy started barking with the dalmatians if even a dog can love it its amazing. I love watching how smooth the animation and the beautiful backgrounds. It brings back memories of old Disney movies. Who doesn't love remembering Disney movies when they were younger and loving everything about it from the fuzzy friend to the princesses. The voice acting and storytelling is nothing to push to the side either everything about this movie is fun and memorable for everyone no matter your age.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I love this movie!,"The movie that I want to review is the animation '101 Dalmatians' from Disney. I've never seen this movie before until I saw a teaser of 'Cruella' that will be released in June, so I was interested in the movie that Cruella is the villain, the movie '101 Dalmatians'. Personally, I think it is a bit cruel because in the movie Cruella needs a fur coat from 99 Dalmatian puppies. Is it too cruel from children? But this movie grossed $ 320.7 million worldwide. I decided to watch the movie because I liked the puppies but has been impressed forever. I love that the movie features the main character as a dog and it has a dialogue that expresses the feelings inside. I read an article saying that Disney deliberately gave the voice actors the voice of dogs very sharp and It sounds more dependable than a human being. And when going to the movies, it really felt like that. Pongo, the main character, is very cool. I like him the most. He is a dog with determination, courage and protection that he loves. I am amazed that there was not a lot of technology that enabled animation at the time but can be made to make the pictures look good and fun. Another character that I like is Ella. Even now, I don't know why she is so mad about fur coats but I also like some of her personality. I can't wait to see her part of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Is this a great movie that is a must see? Absolutely. Is it a top 5-10 Disney movie? Probably not.,"One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on Disney+. The storyline for this focuses on a young couple with a couple Dalmatians that have puppies. When the puppies are stolen by an eccentric rich lady who wants to use their fur for coats, both the humans and parents get nervous. When the humans take too long to find the puppies the parents and their dog friends take matters into their own hands. This movie is directed by Clyde Geronimi (Cinderella), Hamilton Luske (Pinocchio) and Wolfgang Reitherman (The Sword and the Stone) and contains the voices of Rod Taylor (The Birds), Betty Lou Gerson (Cinderella), J. Pat O'Malley (Alice in Wonderland) and Frederick Worlock (Spartacus). The humans in this from top to bottom, both good guy and bad guy, are so well set-up, depicted and executed from beginning to end. How can you not love Cruella and her thieves in this? They were excellent. The parent dogs and animal friends along the way are very good; but to be honest, I never connected to the Dalmatians themselves, which always kept this a step down from the absolute Disney classics for me. Is this a great movie that is a must see? Absolutely. Is it a top 5-10 Disney movie? Probably not. I would score this an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

He really wants it from the man but he is super busy. He is a writer and a artist and he is very engaged in his work. The dog is a Dalmatian, where the town villain wants possession of the dog and sends inept thugs out to get the dog. That is overall the main topic of the story.

The animals spoke so nothing was left up to interpretation. I knew full well what was going on.B.)

A Stylish and Thrilling Canine Adventure,"With a cast of mischievous puppies and an unforgettable villain, ""101 Dalmatians"" strikes the perfect balance between humor, adventure, and tension, keeping the audience hooked from start to finish. The movie stands out not just because of its charming four-legged protagonists but also for how it builds its story in such an engaging way, seamlessly mixing lighthearted, funny moments with scenes of real suspense. Unlike many of the animated fairy tales of its time, this story isn't about magic or enchanted kingdoms-it's about a dog-napping and a desperate escape, which gives the film a slightly more urban and modern feel compared to Disney's usual standards back then.The script is incredibly effective, kicking off with a fun and breezy introduction to Roger and Pongo's daily life before shifting gears when Cruella arrives and the puppies are kidnapped-that's when the tension really kicks in. The use of the ""Twilight Bark"" as a communication system between dogs across the city and countryside is a brilliant narrative touch, creating a network of information that keeps the story moving in a clever way. The second half of the film turns into a full-fledged survival journey, with Pongo and Perdita braving the cold, snow, and Cruella's bumbling henchmen to rescue the puppies and make it home safely. The balance between comedy and suspense is spot-on, making sure the audience stays invested in the adventure without losing the film's overall lightheartedness.The real magic of the film, though, lies in its characters. Pongo and Perdita are solid leads, driven by their protective instincts and unconditional love for their pups. They're not just worried parents; they're active, intelligent, and brave characters who take charge of the situation and push the story forward with real determination. Roger and Anita, though they get less screen time, are just as likable-especially Roger, whose sarcastic wit and playful jabs at Cruella make for some of the film's funniest moments. As a human couple, they provide a strong emotional core, showing genuine warmth not just toward each other but also toward their dogs.And then there's Cruella de Vil-one of Disney's most iconic villains, standing out precisely because of her sheer extravagance and relentless obsession. Unlike villains driven by ambition, power, or revenge, Cruella is just an eccentric, filthy-rich woman who wants a dalmatian fur coat and will do anything to get it. Her presence on screen is magnetic, whether it's because of her striking character design-with that wild two-toned hair and oversized fur coat-or the way she erupts into fits of rage when things don't go her way. She's over-the-top in a way that's almost cartoonish, but her complete lack of empathy and her unwavering insistence on murdering puppies make her a truly despicable antagonist. Betty Lou Gerson's voice performance is the cherry on top, dripping with disdain, impatience, and a growing madness as the story unfolds.Horace and Jasper, Cruella's clumsy henchmen, work well as comic relief while still posing a real threat to the puppies. They're bumbling and not exactly the brightest, but at the same time, they're a genuine danger-especially in the scene at Cruella's house when they try to capture the puppies while distracted by the TV. That moment is pure tension, where it feels like any wrong move could be disastrous for the dalmatians. And speaking of the puppies, even with so many of them, a few manage to stand out-like Patch, with his bolder personality, and Lucky, always struggling to keep up with his siblings.Visually, ""101 Dalmatians"" has a unique style within Disney, with a rougher, sketch-like look thanks to the Xerox animation process. This gives the film a distinct, more modern and stylized aesthetic that fits perfectly with the London setting and the film's fast-paced energy. The backgrounds are well-crafted, with a gray, melancholic London contrasting against Cruella's chaotic and vibrant home. The animation of the dogs is top-notch, capturing their movements and expressions with impressive detail, making them incredibly expressive characters.The soundtrack also deserves praise, even though the film has only a few songs. ""Cruella de Vil"" is an instant classic, with a catchy melody that perfectly embodies the villain's over-the-top, wicked nature. The instrumental score during the final chase scene, with Cruella losing her mind behind the wheel, takes the tension to a near-frenzied level, making the moment even more intense.If there's a downside to the film, it's the sheer number of characters, which can make some of them feel a bit underdeveloped or forgettable. With so many puppies and allies joining the journey, it's hard to give everyone their moment to shine, and some end up blending into the background. Also, there's noticeable recycling of animation throughout the movie-something that would become common in Disney films later on, but here, it's already pretty noticeable.Overall, ""101 Dalmatians"" is a fun, stylish, and charming adventure that gets almost everything right and remains one of Disney's most unique films. With an unforgettable villain, a striking visual style, and a gripping story from beginning to end, it's a classic that's always worth revisiting. And, of course, it's a must-watch for any dog lover.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Best Animated Disney Movie of Walt's Time,"When I was a kid, Disney's animated 101 Dalmatians was my favorite movie of all time.

A couple of months ago I decided to re-watch the film, and I wasn't disappointed.Sure it no longer is my favorite movie, nor my favorite animated movie, or even my favorite movie in the Disney Animated Canon. But man this movie brought back a great nostalgic feel. There are many reasons why this film works. One is the villain, she is so horrible that you just want the dogs to rip her face off. The two hero's, Pongo and Perdita are also really good, as shown by the lengths they will go to save their children. The puppies are cute. And even the humans have enough charm for me to like them. And all the side characters are great too.The animation is really cool, for a movie made in 1961 it really looks like it was made no earlier than 1988. There are some really good jokes, the action scenes are fun, but the main reason this movie works is it's characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strong animated feature and perfect for children,"Two Dalmatians and their pups are coveted by fur-loving heiress Cruella de Vil.This is a pretty enjoyable adventure with some great animated sequences and a very memorable villain.The plot is okay, with some very cute, lovable protagonists on a capture and escape adventure with some standard Disney formula thrown in, such as romance and an evil queen/stepmom substitute in Cruella.Although the animation isn't amongst the most celebrated of Disney, I enjoyed it. The animals looked and moved as realistically as any in the Disney catalogue. The backgrounds have been criticised as not to the standard of other animated features but I found it all contrasted well with the black and white colours of the Dalmatians.Some sequences I thought were very memorable, such as the television watching scenes, the dog telegram, the journey through the snow and pretty much every image involving Cruella, which was a brilliant character design.All voice talent works well and the editing as always in these animated features is superb.Importantly it held my five year old daughter from start to finish, who seemed enthralled and entertained by it all.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Jasper and Horace who is one of my favorite characters and they're the ones who stole the puppies and they need to get the job done before the police gets them. Roger who sings Cruella De Vil thinks she's evil and chase scene at the end really is cool. And speaking of which there are no songs apart from one. That's all I can say about it.

Late Disney Movie That Works,"The movie is about a 1920's British songwriter and his wife, female servant, and a male and female dalmatian who have just had a litter of puppies.

It turns out the woman has already bought a bunch of other puppies with the idea of making them all into a coat. So she has two thugs in her employ steal the puppies. But the dalmatians don't like what Cruella wants to do...It works because the dogs are regular dogs, even if they can talk and do some humanlike things (like Sylvester the cat), and the villainess is bad enough to be scary but not overly frightening, and the kids in the theater all cheered at her comeuppance. Definitely a good movie for the kids.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Childhood Favourite,"I won't set the plot of ""101 Dalmatians"" out in any detail, as it is already well-known from this film, the nineties remake and Dodie Smith's original book (a great childhood favourite of mine). Briefly, however, it deals with the theft of a litter of Dalmatian puppies by a woman named Cruella De Vil (an obvious pun on ""cruel devil"") who wants to turn them into fur coats. The human authorities are baffled, so it falls to the kidnapped puppies' parents, Pongo and Perdita, to track them down and rescue them- along with a lot more Dalmatian puppies acquired by Cruella for the same nefarious purpose.The film is rather different in look from a lot of earlier Disney cartoons, which were characterised by bright, even garish, colours. Here, by contrast, the colour scheme is surprisingly restrained for a film aimed at children. Much of the action takes place either at night or in the depths of a snowy English winter, and the palette reflects this. Black and white are much in evidence (as one might expect in a film about black-and-white dogs), and the other predominant colours are blues, greys and purples. Unusually for a Disney cartoon, the action takes place in a modern-day Britain, and this restrained look may also reflect American ideas of the British as a nation of quiet, restrained, phlegmatic people, qualities exemplified by the human protagonists, Roger and Anita Radcliffe. (In Smith's novel their surname was Dearly, and Roger was an economist or financier by profession, not a musician as he is here). Actually, these qualities are also exemplified by the animal protagonists as well; Pongo and Perdita are essentially Roger and Anita transmuted into canine form, and the various animals they meet in the course of their adventures generally represent recognisable British ""types"", such as The Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog with a distinctly military bearing. (His friends, or should I say subordinates, are a horse named Captain and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs).One person, however, who is neither quiet nor restrained is the villainess Cruella de Vil. She is perhaps Disney's most memorable villain, a monstrously hyperactive woman with an obsession with fur; she is always seen wearing a fur coat. (In the novel her husband was a furrier, but he does not appear in the film). Her main distinguishing feature is her hair, half-black and half-white. The subsidiary villains are the comically incompetent Badun brothers, Jasper and Horace, whom she employs to steal the puppies.This was one of my favourite films as a child. I was a great animal- lover and generally found that Disney cartoons involving animals, like this one and ""The Jungle Book"", were a lot funnier and less sentimental than all those boring girly fairy-tales like ""Snow White"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty"". I also liked the fact that the action took place not in some fantastic never-never land but in the real England in which I was growing up. My one complaint was that the music (in comparison with something like ""The Jungle Book"") was a bit forgettable; even though Roger is a songwriter there are only three songs. I recently saw it again for the first time in many years, and I can say that the animals- especially the spotty dogs themselves- are just as endearing, and their adventures just as amusing- as they were in my childhood.Some goofs. Although the Disney organisation seem to have gone to some lengths to make the film as British as possible, one or two errors have crept in. British television programmes were not directly sponsored in the early sixties. A ""creek"" in British English means a saltwater inlet, not a freshwater stream. The Suffolk landscape is not as hilly as it is depicted here. I will, however, let them off over that girder bridge- they are not common in Britain, but not completely unknown. I will also let them off over the name ""Perdita""- strictly speaking, Latin grammar demands that it be stressed on the first syllable, but the actual pronunciation in Britain tends to vary.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A definitive Disney classic....,"From beginning to end this film is just such a triumph on so many levels in my opinion it's hard to think where to begin.The animation obviously is top notch but somehow it feels different and special and very specific to this film.

I especially enjoyed the animation in the house with the minute details in books and musical scores, heck even the brickwork looked amazing. Everything felt lìved in and was brimming with character. Nothing more so than the Dalmatians themselves and wow if you sit and think about how much work that would have taken it's just mind blowing.Disney also did a great job in creating a truly memorable villain and she was brought to life magnificently by both the animation team involved and the voice actress who was superb.The story also was just lovely and had warmth and heart to it something Disney excelled at back in the day.

Spotless,"Charming, funny and touching! This tale is one everyone can relate to and enjoy. Who can't rally behind two parents fighting to get their children back from a kidnapper and reclaim their perfect life, or emphasis in the tense escape and journey home (with its has shades of escape from prison camps)? All these element gives this fluffy tale some great layers.It's super witty too the opening scene starts with the great observation of dogs and their owners or should we say dogs and their pets, and continues this throughout the film with the sort of whimsy you expect for classic Disney. The film itself is pumped full of character with the great characters themselves, the subtle, but energising, jazz and swing score or the art style. This all culminates in making it one of the best and stand out Disney movies.Much like all great art, as time goes on you can't help but marvel at how the artists accomplished such a luxurious finish in a time without cgi and the many shortcuts that are now available to them.

101 Times The Fun. (My 101st review!),"I saw 101 Dalmatians 8 months ago, a few days after my 23rd birthday. Even though I love Disney movies, I hadn't seen this particular one in about 12 years, and it was a delight to return to.The plot is pretty well known. 2 dogs, Pongo and Perdita, have 15 puppies, to the delight of them and their human owners- Roger and Anita. However, another person is thrilled about the puppies for a completely different reason.Anita's childhood friend Cruella De Vil sees that Anita has 15 puppies and steals them for one simple purpose- she wants to kill them to turn them into a fur coat! When Pongo and Perdita discover this plan, they get all the help they can to get their puppies back in time.101 Dalmatians is impressive animation wise for one main reason. Consider this: It's a hand drawn movie, therefore a triple digit number of dogs were drawn, step by step. Luckily, a ""Xerox"" method was used to make the animation easier, but I'd imagine that even then it was still a challenge.Could you imagine working for Walt Disney as an animator, and after completing Sleeping Beauty, he comes up to you and says: ""Okay, now I need you to work on 101 Dalmatians?"" I'd probably either quit my job or ask to work on the live action projects instead!101 Dalmatians also has one of the very best villains in a Disney movie. Cruella De Vil wants to kill 15 puppies that belong to her best friend- what could be more evil than that?In fact, she is so evil that Roger introduces us with a song about how wicked she is! Granted, he's a songwriter who's just being silly at the moment, but he warns us right from the start of how wicked she is.Speaking of this, IF you do have kids who are sensitive to super evil villains, it's better if you hold off on this Disney movie. For a tamer Disney dog movie, show them Lady and the Tramp instead. I have a church friend who won't show her granddaughter this movie yet just because of Cruella De Vil, and I don't blame her.For anyone else though, 101 Dalmatians is a delight for adults and children alike. If you, like me, hadn't seen it in a very long time, it's a movie worth re-visiting. When it comes to Disney movies, this is 101 times the fun!PS: I also highly recommend the live action remake from 1996, where Glenn Close plays Cruella De Vil. That performance is one of my top 10 favorite performances in film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An oldie but a goodie - excellent family fun movie,"We watched this as part of our family movie night and the kiddo was enthralled. While I find this one doesn't have a lot of stuff to keep the adults entertained, personally the nostalgia of it helps stay my focus.I find this old school type of movie to be a slow burn leading up to the action which is perfect for my kiddo as she is easily frightened. The only thing I would warn parents about is they throw the word idiot around a lot in the movie and for those trying to teach their young ones not to say mean things etc this one came up a lot. Other than that would totally recommend this, the music is fun, the villians are great and there is lots of action once it gets going.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favorite animated Disney movies,"""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" is one most my favorite animated Disney movies (along with ""The Incredibles""), because the plot of the movie was fantastic and fun, Walt's new style of traditional animation, Cruella De Vil was a great villain, and the song that Roger Radcliffe wrote about her was good. I first watched this movie back in 2020 or 2021, and after seeing, this movie became another of one my favorite Disney movies and the franchise also became on of my favorite Disney franchises.This movie will forever be one of Disney's best animated movies for families, and others to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.","Have you ever wondered what your pet was thinking? I am sure we all did. I love that the movie is told from Pongo's point of view. He felt compelled to find Roger a partner to brighten up his life, which also resulted in a match for him. As they settled into their new home, they were visited by an unexpected guest who filed a claim for the new born puppies. When her request was denied, Cruella vowed vengeance. The nanny did her utmost to fight the kidnappers, but she wasn't a match. Cruella has so much money she could have paid someone to find some other Dalmatian puppies, but once she made up her mind, there was no stopping her. She was really gutsy to phone Anita and express her feelings of grief. I love how the dog chain was used to send out the alert; without it, the puppies would not have been rescued.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty great,"'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' is pretty great, certainly my favourite animated film from Disney up until the point of this release.The animation is stunning, even with the minor details in and around the Radcliffe residence. The dalmatians themselves look excellent, while the premise keeps you locked in. It also features one of the studio's greatest villains in Cruella de Vil, who is incredibly wicked.I like the voice cast here, also. Rod Taylor is very good as Pongo, with Ben Wright doing positive things as Roger. Horace and Jasper, voiced by Frederick Worlock and J. Pat O'Malley, are there to amuse too. Betty Lou Gerson is, of course, the star as Cruella.I prefer the 1996 live-action production as it brings things to life better, but this is a fantastic effort from 1961 - one that is certainly worth your time viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Really Good One From Disney's Past,"In the usual Disney, animated style we are introduced to two Dalmatians (Pongo & Perdita), who eventually expand to 101 Dalmatians through the magic of Disney story-telling. The birth of the Dalmatians incurs the wrath of the evil Cruella De Vil, probably one of the most classically famous, tough, evil-female characters in film history.Fantastic animations, especially the background paintings, are seen throughout the film. The writers give us interesting, cutting-edge ideals (at least for the 60s), such as Pongo, checking out the legs on the women who walk by the street, in an attempt to find a mate for his owner. I rather enjoyed the interesting communication angle that Disney used, to help explain how talking dogs communicate with each other and with fine precision they show to us how smart animals in the real world really are.A fun adventure with the animators of Disney, that is hindered by a slow pace, that is counter-productive to the film and burns into the story in the middle of the film, but there is enough in the first and last thirds of the film to garner a very good film to see, although, I felt the chase scene at the end was a little forced. I was also shocked that Disney was still in 4:3 at this time.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Close To Perfect,What a wonderful movie. And so thought my 6 year old boy.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sweet but on a budget,"Pleasant little Disney, a notable entry in the Silver Age. But what first strikes me in this movie is the huge step back in terms of quality, even more so when compared to the previous, extremely expensive Sleeping Beauty: half of the screen size, ordinary setting and xeroxed. Disney was trying to cut corners and indeed it paid off, but the final result is clearly less impactful. One might advocate for the xeroxed style, which actually reminds me of newspaper vignettes, but the animation is hardly defendable, for example without much interaction between characters and environment.Still, the story is sweet, the characters are easy to like (or despise when necessary, as Cruella is one of the most renown Disney villains), the story entertaining, the music modern and legendary. Honorable mention for the twilight bark sequence, still gives me chills of wholesomeness.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute classic,I was so thrilled that 101 Dalmatians was part of my childhood. A truly wholesome film and impressive production. Despite being 1961 the animation is not too bad and has a remarkable story that keeps you interested till the end. Top marks for Disney for this film. It is films like this that cemented Disney's legacy and continued to pave the way for its future success.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A charming classic,"101 Dalmatians is one of my favorite stories of all-time, one of the few to genuinely impact my life. Heck, when I read the book as a kid I loved Cruella so much I started using pepper a lot. I never put pepper on anything before. So, yeah, I love the character Cruella and love the story. So, what do I think of the animated adaption? It's pretty darn good. Really good animation for it's time, solid songs and film score, with highlights being the song about Cruella and the music playing while the dogs are escaping on ice. The movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but once Cruella shows up things start moving..
for the most part. That scene where the two dogs kept talking to each other right after the kidnapping went on a bit too long. That said, this is a quite entertaining film for the whole family and does a decent job, at least as good of a job as a Disney film would ever do, at adapting the book onto screen.",,Anonymous,Animation
